Cat's liked it and it helped with hairballs as described, but now... The had to go and put corn syrup in it! Horrible! Corn syrup is a nasty by-product that is being put into all kinds of foods these days. Why? Big Ag profits big given all the corn subsides from the government which has led to an overproduction of, you guessed it, corn! So what do they do with all this extra corn? Find new and exciting ways to use it, hence the addition of corn syrup and all its insulin spiking nastiness into just about everything \\"edible.\\" Now they're sneaking it into our pet products. Underhanded. Diabolical. Unacceptable! I will not buy this product again unless they switch back to the old formula and that's all there is to it. Sorry kitties...

Called my Vet and they recommended \\"Laxatone\\"....so I bought it at PetCo. It's drips and it's \\"gooey\\" but my cat will eat it.

The cats won't eat it on their own, and I can't keep it on my finger... it just runs off. It's a waste of money and a huge mess.

My cats both refuse to even consider licking it, and I cannot in good faith force-feed them corn syrup, which we all know is bad for blood pressure, blood sugar, and other reasons.

Sentry, if you're reading, I beg you: PLEASE GO BACK TO THE OLD FORMULA!For years, my cat eagerly licked this gel off my fingers, even when pills were hidden inside. Now he won't have anything to do with it. It was truly my last option for hiding pills, since he rejects Pill Pockets, other hairball gels and even human food.Beyond the fact that the cat hates it, the new slimy consistency just makes a gooey mess of everything if you try to force into a cat's mouth.

Although I was promised a refund for my tube, I still have never received details to complete the transaction. Recently I did receive a voice mail from Sentry CR offering me the original formulated fish flavor Petromalt....for my rabbit. That would certainly be a first if she liked it.

I have been searching for tubes everywhere I go and horde the few I have.I read the ingredients and it differs from the original packaging of ingredients. After mineral oil, the next ingredient is petroleum. Petroleum isn't mentioned on the tubes I have. As I see it this is not the original formula.

Two of my three cats loved it and looked forward to the 'treat' everyday. Like others, I also noticed right away the different packaging and consistency of the product. The new recipe sort of poured itself out of the tube as soon as I opened it and made a goopy mess. I keep a couple of tubes around to make sure I don't run out as it is not easy to find in stock. I happen to have one of the tubes with the old recipe still on hand so I opened it and saw they still love it. I googled 'Petromalt changed reciepe' and just had to chime in about this product when I saw my suspicions were right. I share the sentiments of other users who experienced the same. Very poor consumer relations to not even advise customers of the change on the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIFFERENT than the original formula","review":"I, too, purchased Petromalt online when I could no longer find it in my regular pet stores. I use it daily as a treat for an elderly cat when she gets pilled and she actually begs for it.The old formula was thick and could be squeezed out of the tube in a ribbon. The new formula, in a new plastic tube, is much a thinner consistency and almost runny. It is impossible to squeeze out a ribbon cleanly without leaving a long drippy strand and the tube requires constant cleaning.After using the old formula daily for multiple years, my cat just sniffs this and walks away.I would not have purchased it had I known the formula had changed and have switched to a different brand (Laxatone) that is not messy and that my cat now prefers.I think Melinda covered the rest of the issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"They changed the formula","review":"I just bought the family size tube and it is now in a plastic tube, not metal. The ingredients are now different. My cats just sniffed and walked away when I gave it to them.

The original tube has a small cap, not the big plastic cap on their newer version. I too called Sentry and originally he said the ingrediants did not change, but a lot of consumers have been complaining about their pets suddenly \\"turning their nose up\\" to this newer type product. It's even runny and won't stay on my finger well like the original. He stated that Sentry is revising the product and should have it back on the market by the beginning of the year.

Purchased 6, 4.4 oz. tubes on Oct 1, 2011, assuming (incorrectly) that I was getting the \\"Real McCoy\\". I would have given this new formulation zero stars if possible. Have been using Petromalt for decades, and my cats would beg for it as soon as they saw the tube. They won't touch the new formulation which is a drastically different chemical cocktail. My neighbors cats won't touch it either, and they have also used the previous formulation with great success. Sentry gave no indication on the packaging that it was a new formulation. The packaging states \\"The Original Hairball Relief for Cats\\". This is not the original by any means, but I doubt that they can be legally taken to task.

My cats love to lick a one-inch strip of the Petromalt right off my finger as an evening treat several hours away from feeding time.

I said yes and received a call in a couple of days. The company representative was very friendly and informative. She stated that her company had bought the company the owned Petromalt but they would not sell the recipe so they had to do the best they could. Over time they were finally able to get them to sell the recipe. She told me it could take some time to get this formula ready and distributed. At that time she did not know how long that would be, maybe a year. I have contacted them once again for an update. I will let you know when I hear something from them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat used to LOVE it, now she HATES it","review":"We just got a new tube of Petromalt (the one with corn syrup listed as the first ingredient).As many others have noted, they seem to have changed the formula, no doubt in an effort to cut costs.Our cat used to really eat this stuff up, and would come running when the Petromalt tube came out.Now she absolutely hates it. My wife smeared some on her paw to try to get her to eat it and it just made her MAD.In their quest to maximize profits, many companies are trying to get away with using more corn-based materials in their foodproducts, for both pets and humans.But this cat is not having it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why change an excellent product?","review":"I've been using Petromalt for a couple of years to hide one of my cat's medications in...nothing else worked. I just started a new tube, to find a completely different product in it. The formerly firm gel that could be easily formed around a pill is now something that becomes a runny gooey liquid in the time it takes to form it around the pill, which it then flows off of. It's like trying to wrap a pill in warm honey.It looks like the major change is the addition of corn syrup.

I have 'paired' this and a second stand purchased a few months ago with Samsung flat screen TVs that have the 'eye' somewhat low; placing a sound bar or any other component in front, on the same surface where the TV is, makes it difficult (perhaps impossible for some models) for the remote to control the 'on-off' function.

After trying two pieces, the poncho and the folk shawl, neither one turned out as was suggested in the patterns.The poncho required much fiddling with the wool/gauge to get the look in the picture, which attracted me in the first place.The folk shawl, which I relutantly finished, complete with fringe in the suggested yarn types (wool, cotton, mohair etc), was so disappointing, I am taking it apart and knitting a wrap of my own design. Though the yarns are beautiful together, the length-wise weight narrows the drape across the back too much for me. It's too skinny for shawl, considerably too skinny for a throw (a 54\\" version would be stunning), and too fat for a scarf.After spending a respectable amount of time with this book, I believe there MANY better 'beginner' knitting books than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great beginner's guide to knitting","review":"Most knitting books are full of out-of-date, ugly projects that I wouldn't want to make for my worst enemy. This book is the perfect antidote for that. It has wonderful patterns which are simple and fun. Most of all, they make for great gifts. I really love the hat patterns. They can be completed during one long TV movie or in a pinch during someone's birthday party. The result is a professional-looking, yet homemade creation. I highly recommend the book also for friends who are just learning.

The technical information was well written, and I felt the illustrations of different stitches were the best I've seen. In fact, I think this book would be helpful to anyone trying to become a book-taught knitter. I certainly refer back to the technical pages quite often. Some reviewers have not had positive comments for the projects in this book. I think it's just a matter of perspective! I think a beer cozy is a great gag gift, particularily for my friends who tease me about learning to knit. Those types of projects (and there are several in this book) are meant to be offbeat and campy. These little projects are also a good way to use up leftover yarn. I gave the book 4 stars only because it does not have a picture of every project. All in all, It's a lighthearted book with lighthearted projects, while still very informative and instructive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better ways to learn to knit","review":"Don't judge this book by its cover. Being \\"pretty\\" doesn't make it worth the price. If you're just learning to knit, you can buy a pamphlet for $2.00 that will give you everything this book gives you. Better yet, corral an experienced knitter and ask her/him to teach you. Knitters love to share what they know. But, back to the book ... it's absolutely worthless for anybody who has any knitting skills at all. I'm surprised that these folks thought there was a need for this type of book; there isn't, not when there are lots of simple little knitting pamphlets out there doing the same thing. Spend your money on \\"real\\" knitting books ... like the books by Rowan or Starmore or dozens of others that really teach you something. This one doesn't qualify and I don't recommend it. The fact that you're starting to knit says you want something more than this book could ever teach you."},{"rating":"1","title":"things too simple to knit","review":"Not too interesting book on knitting, alot of mundane things to make - not too challenging. Pretty photography though, but if you are looking for a twist on simple knitting-this book doesn't quite make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knitty Pretty","review":"This is a very bad book. The cover art is attractive and I can see why you might be draw to it but do not buy this book I have several friends who have been duped and have not knit a stitch because they were so discouraged by this book. I told them they should have asked someone first before plunging head first into a book that will not teach you a thing.The directions are not written for anyone who needs to actually learn anything. There are hardly any pictures, and that is just the tip of the iceberg.I recommend the Yarn Girls Guide to Knitting for anyone new to knitting and even for someone who is looking for inspirations for simple projects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Lacking","review":"The book *looks* pretty, but how can you have a pattern for a sweater and not mention the gauge or the finished dimensions of the piece? What are we supposed to do? Knit it up and then hope that it fits? It's an attractive book, and it does make you want to pick up your needles, but the lack of photographs for every project and the lack of diagrams make it very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indeed, a pretty book","review":"full of inspiration and not at all intimidating. I'm a beginner and a perfectionist, and won't try a new pattern if it looks to difficult. Percival is great at telling you what you need to know before you start, and the patterns are rated for difficulty-which I love. I'm disappointed, however, that not all the patterns have accompanying photos. It can be difficult to visualize what a project is supposed to look like, especially for those of us with limited knitting experience. The photos are beautifully simple, uncluttered and calm--just the thing to make you want to pick up your needles."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be a better book than this!","review":"I really feel like this book would be helpful to someone who already knows how to knit. As a beginner, it is not very easy to use. The diagrams are in tiny cicles and are not really readable. There is not much positive I can say about the book other than the cover looks inspiring.Purchase something else... there has to be a better book than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot see the pictures","review":"You wouldn't be able to view the finished product since the pictures do not show the knitted project clearly. This book is more for beginners however the pictures should be clearly shown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't judge a book by it's cover","review":"At first glance, it looks like a nice looking book for beginners, but has a lot of problems. Unfortunately, if you're a beginner knitting, you're not going to know it until you're right in trying the patterns. I wanted to try the retro shawl, but was hesitant as there was no photo of the finished product anywhere to be found in the book! I tried making the rib scarf, but couldn't find the proper gauge for the scarf. I finally had to get someone to help me...definitely pass on this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"it taught me...","review":"how to knit in 10 minutes. I used to know how to knit when I was a little girl, then I forgot. My husband taught me to crochet in grad school, and I picked that up quite quickly. I tried teaching myself how to knit again - through using many books (I'm a librarian), and failed.This book worked for me.Some of the reviews by experienced knitters here sound rather elitist.As for the lack of the gauge - is this really important for knitting a scarf? She does mention gauge, just not for every pattern.And the paperweight cover? it's good practice. The beer cozy is a humorous touch to what some consider an old woman's hobby. Take it from one who deals with sterotypes on a daily basis - I know it isn't and you know it isn't, so appreciate the creative nature of this book.If you consider knitting a science and follow recipes with no alteration, skip this book. If you consider knitting an art and are not afraid to be creative once in a while, check this book out."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOCKINGLY POOR KNITTING BOOK!!","review":"Ok, so I should have looked at the other reviews before I bought this book, but I like to get new knitting titles and the cover looked so appealing!!Its an insult to even the newest knitter, with a pattern for a 'bookmark' and how to knit a square!!! Many of the patterns dont even have a picture of the finished item, whats with that?Knitting books are supposed to inspire new knitters, but this one just bores you senseless.This woman is not a designer, shes a knitter making a quick buck out of ultra-basic rubbish and calling it 'art'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-around boots (especially in winter)","review":"These are great everyday boots. They are comfortable, and low but not flat. They look perfect with pants. Additionally, they are not leather uppers, which normally would be a drawback.

Great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent boot at an affordable price","review":"I was looking for a nicer looking boot with a low heel that I could wear with jeans. Even though others said that it runs a little large, I still ordered a 1/2 size larger than my normal size and I'm glad I did. I have bunions, so I prefer square toe and a slightly loose fit to accommodate. I was actually disappointed when I first put them on. They were somewhat tight, especially in the ankle area once I zipped them all the way up. I don't have large ankles/calves, so I was quite surprised that they were so tight. However, I wore them all day at work and to my delight they stretched out. They were not difficult to break in, in my opinion, and they are now very comfortable. I have worn them twice on icy Chicago sidewalks this winter and haven't slipped. They don't retain heat very well so they're not ideal in Chicago's brutal winter wind. Other than that, I think they're decent for the price. Had I paid full retail price I would have been disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice rail, but........","review":"This conversion kit included the Roxanne model as one of the models it could fit. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The Roxanne model has a drop down side and therefore has hardware in place of the holes the rail is supposed to screw into.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that there is some material it does not cover. It does not cover particples & gerunds and you need this knowledge to read Russian. The book's coverage of verbs of motion is also inadequate. They should also have some audio material to cover the book. Other than that for general speaking capability it is a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't expect to get a gender-specific slipcover","review":"The \\"bonus slipcover\\" pictured is a green, gender-neutral pattern, but the slipcover that was shipped is a blue sports theme.

It will only work now for about 1-2 inches of paper, even thin newspaper thickness items, then has to stop for several hours to ?reset?. The thing is not overheating (takes 2 seconds to stop) and it does go in reverse. Occasionally now it will shred one whole sheet of paper, then it quits.We have to purchase another shredder and we still have a pile of stuff to shred.Thought it would work better than this, and the warranty is expired.I recommend giving this shredder a heavy duty workout as soon as you purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brennan Family Does It Again","review":"Clannad consists of numerous Brennan family members; they've been playing together for in excess of 20 years, and the closeness really shows. \\"Banba\\" demonstrates not only the individual, but also the collective talents of the band.

This works only about 75% of the time (i.e., I doesn't receive about 25% of the faxes which are sent). (2) The software hook-up to the computer is not seemless. I have it conected to a very good computer (Dell pentium, 128 mb ram) and I still get an error message that the printer is not hooked-up when I turn on the computer; I need to repeatedly hit retry to get the printer hooked-up everytime I turn on the computer. (3) Everytime it prints a page, multiple pieces of paper run through the machine (i.e., it does not feed 1 sheet at a time.) (4) There is no toll free number for customer support. I have spent a lot of money calling customer support and they have not been able to solve any of the aforementioned problems.In summary, I do not recommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out for paper jams--you may need a technician!","review":"I've had a tough time with my unit, which was delivered just days ago.

Since printjobs must be done over so often, so much ink gets wasted on half-printed pages that are torn up by this machine.The scanner and photocopier are a nice addition. I use those often. However, I am not sure I can use the fax machine... the directions aren't very clear, and it appears that you can SEND faxes with the device, but not receive them.

It was definitely one of the best Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys Super Mysteries. It was probably one of the more difficult books in figuring out who the bad guy was. I liked how this time there was two separate mysteries instead of one intertwined one. Sometimes they try too hard to make the mysteries intertwined and it does not work out as well and in this case having two separate mysteries worked out perfectly. They both had to deal with the Rock Star's tour but they had two different culprits. I think that the bad guy was also pretty hard to figure out and I had no idea who it was until the very end.

Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys are both in Paris (of course, by chance). Nancy is there to help a rock star solve a mystery, while Frank and Joe are there to go to an art convention. The parties meet at the airport. The plot was great, though one thing has always really annoyed me about the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys books. The author portrays the characters Nancy, Frank, Joe, and their parents as perfect, which is ridiculous and immpossible. Luckily, this book proved me a bit wrong, because Frank and Joe trust someone, an old foe, when they shouldn't..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely first movie for Bogdonovich","review":"Bogdonovich got big start with this film. Corman let him pick the movie he wanted to make, but because of short term contract Corman had with Karloff, (A weeks work Karloff owed him) Bogdonavich had to agree to use Karloff in whatever film he made. With all the crazy gun stuff going on in US, this movie is stands up today. Very timely"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Karloff! Great Movie!","review":"Boris Karloff is stupendous in this low-budget Peter Bogdanovich thriller. (Spoiler)Incorporating footage from THE TERROR and THE CRIMINAL CODE, Karloff is established to be aging horror actor Byron Orlok(a chracter similar to himself in real life). Bogdanovich runs two plot lines into eachother-one with Karloff and another with a psychotic man with a rifle(Tim O'Kelly). He brings them together in a great climactic scene at a drive in theater. Cult film was shot by the great Laszlo Kovacks. It was Bogdanovich's first feature-and a very good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do it.

Sexy groove, it works if you can work it. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good listen provided you like the genre.","review":"This is no intro to electronica. Nor is it a hardcore beeping frenzy without any human touches. The opening track has nice vocal touches, and the the slack-jawed commentary on \\"Pretty Deyenol\\" make for that rare track that will make you laugh while you dance. Yes, there is ample dance material here; trouble will arise in finding anyone who has heard it and would therefore be able to dance, however. In the end 'tis not a classic but rather an enjoyably small step down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best by far.","review":"I love the Stones and have always been willing to check out the solo releases, but in the years since this arrived I have yet to be able to listen to it all in one sitting. The single \\"Let's Work\\" is a cheesey working class singalong, and \\"War Baby\\" has one of his most ridiculous lyrics, \\"I was born in a war, so they call me a war baby.\\" Aside from \\"Throwaway and \\"Shoot off Your Mouth,\\" this record lacks what every good Stones record or great rock and roll record has -- a good groove. Two many of these songs feel stiff, without the ability to swing. Get started with Wandering Spirit, where Mick successfully mixed rockers, blues stomps, ballads, and his own take on country to much better effect. Not to mention, this has to be one of the ten worst album covers of all time in ANY genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Jagger solo album","review":"Not 5 but at least 6 stars album. I don't care what others say about this album and Wandering Spirit, but I know that this album is better, and even better then the funky-rocker She's the boss. The two deepest songs R the 2 last ones (Party Doll and War Baby), there R 2 funky ones (Radio Control,Piece 4 the Wicked), the one and only outstanding Let's Work, that is much more different than the other songs (not so good), 2 of my favs R the Jagger-Stewart's Say U will and Cow Tow, and there R the real Jagger-rocker Throwaway and Shoot off your mouth. The Title track is something different again, like Let's work, it's been nicely put between Say U will and Cow Tow. I have a few friends who don't even know or like Stones, but they like this album very much! I like both of them, but believe me, if U don't own any Jagger album, GET THIS ONE FIRST, then Wandering Spirit and then She's the Boss, cause this is the ranking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I bought this album when it first came out.

Geez, I miss those days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please!","review":"Touted as the best-selling independant CD of all-time. Nostalgia-wise, this CD is a must for all Yngwie fans. It is interesting to hear him play in a band where he is not the centerpoint. But only in it's nostalgia and oddity is this CD enjoyable. Ron Keel does most of the songwriting and the CD suffers for it. It also suffers from the fact that he sings. \\"Serenade\\" has to be simply the most awfully sung ballad I have ever heard. I find it hard to believe that all the reviewers giving this 5-stars would ever be caught dead blasting this CD in their car stereo where there is any threat of anyone else hearing it. Ron Keel's voice is awful and Yngwie sounds so out of place that it makes one cringe. I only own it so that it fills the nice empty slot I had before Yngwie's Rising Force CD on my shelf. It hasn't left that slot in a long, long time. I might just have to dust it off tonight and enjoy the nostalgia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Refund please.....","review":"To suggest that this is an awesome album begs the question: Have you heard any other albums before?

Considering Keel's first album came out the following year, and had some less-than-stellar production value to it, I expected this album to be just as sketchy for my discriminating ears. It turned out to sound excellent, and that's just production quality I'm talking about - let alone the fact Yngwie Malmsteen is included in the Steeler lineup, working his guitar wizardry (before going solo himself).Some good compositions, overall not a bad metal album.

The album showcases the musical maturity of the band along with the power,passion and versatility of Michael Hutchence.

It is an album that should be in any INXS collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated.","review":"For some reason, this album often gets overlooked in the INXS back catalog. This is quite a strong album, full of good guitar grooves. 'Days of rust' is a killer opening track. 'The Gift' is full on with a great video. 'Time' has some great guitar. The four songs from 'Please' to 'Kill the Pain' are as good a sequence as you will find on any INXS album.The album does suffer from inconsistency, a flaw that marked all of INXS's post Kick albums. By comparison to their previous albums, to me this album most resembles 'Shabooh Shabah,' perhaps due to the fact Mark Opitz is again producing (I think). An album worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Album","review":"This is one of INXS' best albums behind welcome to wherever you are and kick.

Warren Farrell is a true hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting yet fightening","review":"I was astonished to read this book to find out how men feel on the subject of the different sexes. I found the book interesting but it can hardly be based on fact. Any author that compares an unemployed man to a raped woman needs to have had the violent experience. I was disturbed but also inclined to read on if only to see what other outlandish statements he would make. I read the book together with my husband and he had a little different reaction than me. While he open my eyes as to what the author was trying to say he also shared some of my opinions on the unresearched claims made by Mr. Farrell. Although I would say it was interesting reading I would hope no one took it as a factual account of the society we live in today."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is full of unsubstantiated assertions.","review":"Warren Farrell is not fair to his feminist opponents. In fact, he asserts that feminists have not considered the male sex role, and that he is the first to do so. This is far from true. Furthermore, he most often does not quote feminists directly; he prefers to allude to what he perceives to be feminist thinking. He also makes the mistake of assuming that society is governed by feminist ideals.I found a few disturbing errors in this book. One is so glaring that I wonder if it is in fact an error. He states that Laurie Dann injured or murdered only men and boys, and either exaggerates or fabricates her other violent activities, and offers the Chicago Tribune as a citation for this. If one checks the actual articles (05/21/88), however, one will see that two girls, Kathryn Miller and Lindsay Fisher were shot. I wonder why he felt compelled to make this distortion. In my opinion, it makes his arguments look very weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulated information and bizarre comparisons.","review":"Aside from deliberate distortions of well documented facts such as the case of Laurie Dann, I find it impossible to take seriously or have any respect for the opinion of a man who claims to see the genders as equal, yet feels no shame in comparing an unemployed man to a woman who has been raped. It obviously does not occur to him to compare an unemployed man to an unemployed woman, nor does he recognize the significance of rape or that this lack of recognition disproves his point."},{"rating":"1","title":"misguided","review":"Conservatives love to think that feminists sit around talking about how much they hate men and how they will take over the world.

While the right to critique any theory must be protected, Farrell deliberately misinforms those who read his book. The only purpose of such an endeavor is to perpetuate the gender division that forced women into the positions that feminism provides one way of explaining. Farrell is merely telling his readers what he wants them to hear -men are the victims and are powerless - but refuses to acknowledge the evidence against him like disproportionate representation of women in governments around the world. Farrell needs to learn that critique does not involve slanderous misinformation. There are critiques of feminism that are legitimate, informed, and less hostile to women than Farrel's. Try Enlightenment theorists as a start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not my first reading choice.","review":"It's just not my cup of tea.

His citing facts-and-figures from trusted sources clearly makes his case. His having been on the board of NOW lends more balance and credence to his work, as well. It's an eye opener, to be sure, and will cause one to see male-female relationships in a new light. I especially applaude his optimistic and well-thought-out plan for action to remediate this gap in responsibilities in future generations. In closing let me say that, as a simple-minded farmboy (of age 59), it's always been clear to me that Mother Nature has written a beautiful symphony between the genders. As men and women we only need to care very deeply for one another in order to make the music...it's really not as complicated (nor adversarial) as some folks have made it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy one book this year,make it The Myth of Male Power","review":"Warren Farrell engages and researches the breadth of men's issues in Myth of Male Power, and writes with empathy for all. Farrell doesn't seek to lay blame on either sex; Myth of Male Power was intended as his contribution toward better understanding between the sexes, and more equitable laws and politics.As an example of where our laws could become more equal: I was shocked to read that sexual harrassment is the only criminal charge where the defendant's intent is not considered--\\"hostile environment\\" considers only the woman's interpretation. That's one of many issues that I've contemplated daily since I read Farrell's book.If you've never thought about men's issues before, this book covers the full gamut, but also has a well-researched depth. You may be pretty shaken by the time you've finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent critique of feminism by an insider","review":"Dr. Farrell was on the board of directors of the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women (NOW). He broke ranks because of the increasing man-bashing by many feminists. This book was ten years in the making, and makes a compelling argument against many tenets of the feminist faith. Gloria Steinem and Patricia Ireland don't want you to read this book, because they can't answer his arguments.

The album is much more raw than their later efforts and delivers a very clean sound that will be unique to most listeners.The highlight of this album, like ALL Fruvous albums, is the bands wonderful vocal arrangements.

Barginville is the best of Moxy Fruvous(with the exception of \\"Horseshoes\\" from the Wood album). It carries three signature Fru songs, \\"King of Spain\\", the \\"Drinking Song\\" and \\"Video Barginville\\". Each an experience at a Moxy Fruvous concert. The \\"Drinking Song\\", sometimes sad, sometimes satirical, song that every Fruhead knows by heart.

Not without its charms but difficult to take seriously.I sort of like Just Another Night and Lucky in Love but the production is so Miami Vice / Pastel / Cheery / Reaganesque that it is virtually unlistenable now. I can just see Keith and Ronnie giggling over this one. And Jeff Beck playing guitar? Why? I wonder if he was snickering as he picked up his paycheck.This record has its moments and in no way is it as bad as the follow up, Primitive Cool. That stinker killed any momentum and goodwill Mick had built for a solo career."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's the Boss","review":"I have been looking for this CD long time. I had it once and lost it. I am very very happy that I could find it. It was actually only Amazon who had this."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"This album is okay, but it shows why Mick needs Keith: to keep Mick from getting lost in slick-land. The guitars are all shiny, slick, fast-picking and soulless. Give me a sloppy Keith Richards rhythm any day. \\"Just Another Night\\" is a good song, a good composition, and played and sung well. It's the best on the album. \\"Hard Woman\\" is good, with good acoustic work by Pete Townshend. But Mick's vocal is so quavering, it mars an otherwise good song. \\"She's the Boss\\" is okay, but it's basically ONE CHORD. Was Mick trying to do a rap song, without it actually being rap?...who knows... The other songs are so so at best. No attitude, no grit, no personality. Keith's solo albums are TOO gritty and sloppy, so Keith needs Mick as much as Mick needs Keith. Thank God they kissed and made up, and made the great Stones albums they've made since."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Solo Disc Mick Has Done Yet","review":"Right from the first track, Lonely At The Top, you know this is going to be a great album. The other two songs that received a lot of airplay, Just Another Night and Lucky in Love are also somes of Mick's best songs. Hard Woman sounds like a Stones song with great vocal work. One of the biggest factors that makes this album so good is the guitar work of Jeff Beck and Pete Townsend. If he's gonna do an album without the help of Ron Wood and Keith Richard on guitars, he certainly made a good choice. If you're a Rolling Sones fan, this album is worthy of being in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vai is God.","review":"If you're a dedicated guitarist seeking a challenge, look no further. The tab book for Passion and Warfare attempts to show you every note that Stevie played on this wacky album. Sometimes this is not possible, because tunes like Alien Water Kiss are \\"entirely processed sounds,\\" so there is actually an artistic rendering in place of a transcription.The notes included at the beginning of the book show Vai at his literary best: creative, insightful, and interesting. The tab itself has a few problems, though. The notation for string bending is a little different then most guitarists are probably used to. Also, there are a few blatant errors (especially in the Animal and For the Love of God), but they are rare and fairly obvious when you come across them. For the most part, the transcriptions are very accurate.One final warning: some of the music here is almost physically impossible to play. If you decide to attempt it, good luck. You will become a better guitarist for it. Buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The LanRoverPro sucked, Customer service rocked!","review":"Bought this for a huge backbone install at a new Motel.

The first few chapters are great -- there is a lot of detail about what situations cause what weeds. However, most of the rest of the book deals with the evils of 2-4, D, chemical company conspiracies, and other rhetoric. I feel that the title is a bit misleading . . . very little reference to actually getting rid of the weeds. There is a nice compedium of weeds in the back--which might be useful if you don't already have one (I do.)Overall, I think this book focuses too much on the author's ideals and too little actual what we can do to improve our situation. Not to mention it contradicts other ACRES publications (ex. Hands On Agronomy is a proponet of deep tillage but WCWP is against.) I am still looking for a practical organic weed control manual if anyone has any suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to use","review":"Like all of the Rosle products I've bought, this is a quality tool.

It's hard to explain due to the fact that sections of the book were so out of sequence. This will be my last Patricia Springer book -- I should have learned my lesson after her book re Darlene something who killed 2 of her children.

Traditional skewers don't have a big handle wasting precious real estate on the grill, these handles are very long, and quite useless when heated to grilling temperatures. You can't grab them to turn the kabob, you have to let them cool off, and by then you might as well have removed the kabob contents for serving.

So I spooned some of the cooking water over them to sink them a bit and that sped things up. However, I'm not sure if that's the intended process or not. At any rate, the pan was much easier to clean. The second time I used the poachers I sank them a bit in the water right off the bat and ending up overcooking them.

Some of the themes on this underrated album mirror the rebellion of punk, like Rat Trap or Don't Believe What You Read, but the clever lyrics and catchy tunes have more in common with the work of Elvis Costello or early Nick Lowe. Songs like Me And Howard Hughes, I Never Loved Eva Braun and Like Clockwork have melodic hooks and almost Stones-like vocals. Other tuneful and energetic rockers include Blind Date, Mary Of The 4th Form (a gorgeous teen romance) and the catchy She's So Modern, my favorite on the album. Joey's On The Street Again is an impressive rock epic with an almost Springsteenesque feel in its blasting sax, tempo changes and an impressive dramatic structure.

Someone suggested I start using these for a minor, but nagging ache I had in my knees. For the first 30 days or so there was no difference then, by the second month of use all of the pain disappeared. Keep in mind I was also on a very hardcore diet and exercise regime at the time. I lost about 30 lbs while taking osteo bi-flex (I didn't lose because of the supplement) so I figured the weight loss was taking the strain off my knees and that's why they didn't hurt anymore. So once I reached my goal weight and level of fitness I stopped taking them. Well, within about 3 days my nagging pain came back. This was the proof I needed that it was osteo bi-flex and not the weight loss that was helping the pain. I'm using them again but I fear I'll be taking them for life.

Wish I'd read the reviews more closely. The product at the time I added it to our registry was advertised as solid wood. It is full of MDF/Pressed wood with very little actual solid wood. The product description still does not state this.The table had several flaws in the production (missing holes for screws, etc). Upon following instructions exactly, it ended up having four cracks in it by the time we put it together. Totally flimsy. My husband and I debated returning it, but we'd spent so long putting it together that we decided against it. My advice would be to think twice, though. Its hard to come by a good changing table that is solid wood in this price range, so I'd suggest looking at something made of another product. With this table, you'll get an Ikea-quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"The shelves are barely better than cardboard.

It is a pretty color and the drawers/shelves are functional. If your child is potty trained before 12 months or 20#, I think this would be a good purchase.However, as other reviews have mentioned, the MDF is very flimsy. My baby is now 15 months and 24 pounds, and the table is unusable because the MDF is so bowed the drawer containing the diapers does not even open. My husband had to reverse-engineer some metal brackets and slats to put on the frame to make it functional. Be warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!!","review":"After shopping around for a changing table and finding that most stores wanted almost $300 for a decent one, I decided to look online.... and I am so glad I did! This table is a beautiful edition to the nursery. It is sturdy, and has sufficient storage space for all your baby items. I love the pull-out drawer, it glides beautifully. The actual table top is made of particle board (or something simulair) but will definitely support an infant/toddler up to the 30lbs it's limited to. I do want to mention that the 1 in foam pad that it comes with is a bit cheapo in my opinion, but I just replaced it with the larger contoured ones you can find at your local baby store. Fits like a glove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I have the set of DaVinci Emily furniture (crib, dresser and changing table). The crib is the highest quality piece of the set-very sturdy and well made. The dresser is not bad-we had some trouble putting it together because of confusing directions, and a couple of the drawers don't fit as snugly as they could, but overall not a bad piece for a child's room. The changing table itself it decent and seems to be sturdy enough-although my child is only 7mos. and under 20lbs. at this point. The drawer is a joke-cheap materials and craftsmanship-it was a nightmare to assembly because the screws didn't line up with the drill holes. It never really worked, and eventually after coming apart so many times we just removed it. I do miss the drawer, but it can function well enough with just the two shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vey Cheap material.","review":"Not Sturdy at all.

Easy to put together all predrilled holes fit together and I did it in about 45 minutes, 8 months pregnant by myself. Directions were a little hard to understand but workable. Seems very sturdy.

From start to finish this album drags on in one monotone whiney torture session where the songs are lacking dynamics and are completely indistinguishable from one another. This album screams Skate & Surf Festival material and would be an appropriate fit with the other horrible bands that play that fest.

It has a dark, melodic emotional vibe to it. Armor for Sleep has matured greatly in their music. The lyrics are catchy and witty and very compassionate. I whole heartedly recommend this album to everyone who likes this type of music.

Their second CD What To Do When You Are Dead increases the dark emotions of lead singer/guitarist Ben. Like the bonus DVD says, the harder songs are harder and more aggressive and the softer songs are softer. The CD is great and will surprise fans from the first CD. If you like bands like Brand New, this CD is for you, but AFS is setting the scale in their own genere. A must get for people who like dark punk rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album, but whats with the infatuation on death?","review":"I think the band was very successful with putting the lyrics together as a story about dying and what it is like. The story goes from drowning in a submerged car to realizing that heaven isn't as great as it is supposed to be. Then that goes to being miserable and wishing about being alive again. They seem to be very fixated on dying.As for the actual vocals, the singing is rather outstanding. This album is very catchy. his voice is perfect for this story that he is attempting to convey to the listener. The guitar workings on this album are entertaining. The drums are good and even though they are mixed low in the sound, they still have a good presence.If you like rock with a dark vibe to it then you would probably oblige to this.

After buying this Cd, I didn't really listen to it very much after the first time. I thought it was good, but not very good. Well I was wrong. I gave it a few more listens and it really is very good, a very strong sophmore effort.The concept album about a man after he dies really works in this case. Each song moves through a progression of the story, and I love that. It's definitely a cd you should listen to from start to end. By the way the last song is just amazing. But if you have liked what Armor for Sleep has done in the past you will really like this.If you have never heard of them before and you like emo/alternative/occasional screaming, then get this cd.

The scenery is beautiful at times, at other times it seems out of place (i.e. not quite the scenery that Kateri would have known).

Something to read on a long flight, perhaps. This book really did disappoint me. The characters were shallow and two dimensional, and the plot was hackneyed and quite frankly, boring. In fact, I almost gave up half way through. The most annoying thing about this book is that it was trying so hard to be \\"fun\\" and \\"deep\\" at the same time. Frankly, it doesn't succeed too well at either. A pretty pink cover and a gimmicky title do not a good book make. Baggott seems to know how to market herself, but that's about all."},{"rating":"1","title":"baggott's poetry is better","review":"I'm afraid this novel didn't work for me. The characters were flat and it felt cliche. The biggest annoyance, however, was the way Baggott recycled her images from her poetry.

Anyway, advice such as that is near the end of the book. I really liked this author's fresh, different perspective on life and her way of showing us how Lissy blossomed into her own being.Told in a candid, matter-of-fact style, this author hands you fiction that is in so many ways non- but, the real deal for all of us. I feel the book definitely gets much better at the last few pages and am relieved to watch everything finally merge. Life is soooo not perfect, and Lissy shows us this from the get-go. Oddly enough, she paves an eloquence for what she's learned and been told.I never like giving details about a book via a review, so forgive me if this sounds like I'm jumping around. I was satisfied with the book on many levels, and, having never read her before, will most likely pick her work up again.Unique style here of the typical coming-of-age saga.

They were definitively chick lit. This book was, frankly, boring. I try to finish every book I start and the only good thing about this book was that it only took a few hours to read. The characters were dysfunctional, and not in the kind of way that makes you want them to succeed. I didn't care what happened to them, I just wanted it all to end.

Follow along as one listens to \\"La vie en rose\\", \\"Jezebel\\", and my favorite \\"Non, je ne regrette rien.\\" When I listen to this cd I sit back to get everything out of the songs.

His excuse for not having the customary tattoo under the armpit is that he was sick the day they gave those. His uniform is suspect. His claims of not hearing one single anti-semetic remark are rather interesting considering the other books on the Waffen SS I've read.His ridiculous holocaust denial nonsense is irritating. His claims that dead Jews (tens of thousands, historical fact) found sprawled around the grounds of concentration camps were, in fact, victims of allied bombing raids and starved by the allies!The author is persona non grata in Germany, and ranks up there with Ernst Zundel and other loonie Hitler admirerers.This book is peppered with his anti-Jewish sentiment. Sure, whatever.I want my money back!!!!By the way- the author saw only about 3 months of combat duty in total. Doubt he fired a single shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Day's Journey Into Night","review":"Dull and biased. For those interested in the harsh realities of soldiers in combat, this book is not for you. As a teenage recruit towards the end of the war, Hans' combat experience is limited to minutes, as he is wounded on two occasions just as the fighting commences. What is left then to fill a good part of the book is a long, unconvincing apologia for Nazism and rants against World Jewry and, if you can believe it, General Eisenhower. It is rather sad that he dismisses Nazi barbarity as exaggeration or misinformation while conveniently assigning malevolent intent to all those who opposed his beloved Reich."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Having read hundreds of books on WWII and spent my adult life studying this war, I found this book very interesting and unique. It tells what the war was like from the German perspective and also brings into question many of the things we have been taught. War history is written by the victors and always slanted in their favor. This book trys to explain that in this war, crimes and atrocities were committed by both sides. The author ties many of these ideas and themes into current events and tells how WWII continues to hold sway over things, even today. The author questions have caused him trouble in his homeland, Germany, where it is a crime to question many of the events that took place during the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tryin' to be objective","review":"I like to read memoirs and personal narratives from WW2 soldiers of all nations involved. I really enjoyed reading \\"The Good Soldier\\", 'Black Edelweiss\\" and \\"Five Years, four fronts\\".This book, \\"SS Panzergrenadier\\" is simply a piece of crap. Because it cost me so much money I will keep it on the shelf but will only use it as a reference when someone askes me \\"just how arrogant, self-serving and distorted were some SS soldiers during WW2\\"? Hans Schmidt, you are a zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter war memoir","review":"This is a frank, no-holds-barred account of serving in the Waffen-SS in WW2. The author was greatly affected by his experiences in Russia and the Western Front and has some scathing opinions of American authorities inability to handle the large number of German POWs following the war, which led to many deaths from starvation. He goes to considerable lengths to compare actions of American troops being similar (with regards to atrocities) as German troops, like the continual shooting of a young, wounded comrade during the Battle of the Bulge by American troops.While Schmidt is bitter about his experiences, he writes reasonably well and his recollections are vivid. I enjoyed this book and would highly recommend it for the WW2 buff."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most compelling books I own","review":"\\"SS Panzergrenadier\\" ranks as one of the most outstanding volumes in my sizeable collection of books about WWII. As an autobiography, not only does it give a German viewpoint of the war (which we find all too seldom), it also takes us beyond tactics and strategy into the heart and mind of one who was a direct participant. Hey, those German soldiers were people like you and me - they DIDN'T have horns and a tail!!! In fact, the author's experiences in one of Eisenhower's death camps leaves a thoughtful reader reflecting on which side true inhumanity was to be found.Hans Schmidt's engaging writing style carries the reader along on the odyssey of a young life that repeatedly came close to being over almost before it began. It's a great pity that there are not more voices like his left today. Our search for historical perspective would be easier if there were."},{"rating":"1","title":"A German viewpoint","review":"This is an autobiography of a young SS soldier during the last two years of the war. He tells his experience that is contrary to our perception of the Third Reich, and in particular how strict the German military was regarding either rape or looting. Both were capital crimes.It corresponds to what my cousins and acquaintences, veterans of the wehrmacht, told me on the same subject. They did not dare loot or rape as one cousin put it.You also get an idea on the ideals of that society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant !!","review":"Heer Schmidt has touched the true nature of WWII from the point of view of the foot soldier. At last someone with courage and determination has decribed the atrocities done by the Allies that none would speak about. His pasion and natural story telling is hair raising and his patriotism is without question. The description of the code of honor and the actions taken by SS personnel are a credit to these men documented by one of their own. Well done and a very important book for anyone intrested in the correct version of history. My signed copy holds a special place in my collection and so will yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember That College Textbook You Just Hated?","review":"I started out as a lit major, then switched to linguistics. I worked three years as a medical transcriptionist. I've never had trouble reading anything.

But if you just want to understand the physiology of trauma, read the first section of Levine's \\"Waking The Tiger\\" instead (the rest of the book is rhetoric); it's a quick and easy read and presents the same basic information.And if you're a PTSD sufferer, this is definitely not the book for you! It's written by an M.D. for those interested in the physical aspects of trauma, but offers absolutely no help (or even resources) for trauma patients. Try one of the breathing books or tapes by Gay Hendricks.

The author states that there is no soft tissue pain in ME!! And says ME and Fibro patients are \\"hypervigilant' to sensory stimuli (because they were traumatized).

One sip of Celsius and one thing you will notice is they did not become a copy of Red Bull.Celsius is the best tasting energy drink that I have tasted. The first swig was pleasing and the drink ended clean. No bad after taste. I have enjoyed all of Celsius flavors.Celsius also gives me a boost of energy when I feel like I am dragging or during workouts.

This works very well and is very easy.I would have given 5 stars had the preview area been sharper. But I still recommend this camera as the features and picture quality met my expectations. I should add this is my second APS camera and this camera seems to take superior pictures to my other camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I have found this camera more trouble than it is worth.

And I love the woman-in-distress episodes of series (hey, it worked for City Hunter). But the artwork and action in this tape don't do Eat Man any justice is at all. Its like they took a great manga and sliced it up into crappy animation. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is for the terrific dub, though I dont think its worth buying it for. Either way, Eat Man flows the wrong way at every turn. I beg you to read the manga comic instead of waisting your money on a poorly done show like this.

The remaining 50 or 60 pages are photos you've seen everywhere, but without the contextual explanation that makes it all fall into place. One example of this lack of contextual explanation is a picture of a platform over someone laying on the grass. There is no mention that this photo set up was for a shot from \\"The Power of 10\\".

The first time I laid it down on the screen there were a couple bubbles, but they were easy to get rid of. And it was a perfect fit - no trimming necessary. Also, the image quality/ brightness was not at all reduced by the protector - a big concern for me. Buy this!

The content, instructions, etc. just are not there. If you want to look at some pretty pictures to get ideas for decorating, or to take to a seasoned florist, it may be useful, but this is not a how-to book.

So I had expectations of some sort of documentary style DVD with techno music. Not so. No interviews. No narration. No good images. Just somebody waving a camera around, and I do mean waving, with a techno background. This is home movie quality and that may not be fair to some of the better home movie enthusiasts. Much of the only 40 minutes of DVD is shot from the top of one of the floats moving though the parade. Camera movement is headache inducing - think of a 12 year old with his first camera. The camera never moves off the top of the bus during the Love Parade sequence. All other sequences suffer the same plight, being shot from the same vantage point. This DVD is overpriced and under produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"A little disappointed with this one. I suppose the description did a good job explaining what the DVD contains but I was expecting a more refined picture and sound for a DVD.

Try the Tiesto in concert DVD if you want to focus on the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I was not satisfied with it. Amateur camcoders spread all-around the love parade... very shaky... novice editing work...stone-age effects... and the music is not great at all. It made me dissy.

It deserves max 2 and 1/2 stars. \\"Everyday\\" is great song, \\"Both sides of story\\" is ok, but after third song, album goes to nowhere. It is like you open big book and inside there isn't any word. Every song is too long (more than 6 minutes) and I really can't listen this album 'cause it become really painful after some time. The songs has some mood, that is true, but there isn't any catchy melody, only easy going to nowhere.

He wrote, produced and performed this entire album single-handed. Apart from the drum machine, everything was played live. The songs are for the most part, intelligent, the lyrics are thought provoking and deep. \\"We wait and we wonder\\" is about the threat of terrorism, The title song touches on social issues of homelessness, domestic violence and racism.

The rest of the album is a bunch of bland ballads, badly performed songs that don't rock and just uninteresting songs to me. Just drags for much of its 68 minutes!!!!! Phil can defend this album, but I just don't like this one. His later albums were far better than this dull effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Phil Collins may play every instrument on this album but do not be fooled, he will never play as many instruments or play them as well as his serious competators in the music world (notably Peter Gabriel) and hes still a weak vocalist and songwriter.

Her Jasmine Reese is conflicted and capable and Mitchell's look at a future Net in which an AI uses people's minds as, well, human resources is chilling.The book's heroes (if you can even use that word) have a touch of larceny and the villains (ditto) turn out to have good reasons for their apparent villainy.This is Mitchell's second book (her first, \\"Murphy's Gambit,\\" is a reworking of classic space opera) and she has a flair for fast-paced action and fluid prose.An author to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature and poorly written","review":"This is without doubt the worst book I have read this year.

There is no apparent energy or enthusiasm transmitted to the listener by the musik or the playing. No chances are ever taken and everything sounds contrived and stillted.P.S.

I am currently using this book for a statistics course in an MBA program. We are twelve chapters into the book now and in most every chapter I have found a mistake; more often than not there are multiple mistakes. What is worse is that the majority of the mistakes are in the practice problems which are where the student learns to apply the skills. This serves to create confusion and frustration on the student's part. Some of the mistakes are sloppy editing while others more significant are providing wrong information. The editors need to take another look at this book and the authors should also take note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by statisticians for statisticians, not under grads","review":"Positive aspects: Many examples for practice.Negative aspects: Definition of terms are too complex and require further explanation. Most definition of terms refer to terms defined in previous chapters. This causes far too much searching and flipping through pages looking for previously defined terms. Guaranteed headache in 2.5 minutes.Recommendation: Only read if you are a hard core statistician. I had to suffer through this book only because it was required reading for an undergraduate statistics class at the university I attend. My classmates and I have asked our instuctor to never use this book again for an undergraduate level class. Ten editions and they still can't get it right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I used this text in my MBA stats class and have found it to be very informative and useful.

So I guess the book actually does more of a review of statistics with examples of how it applies in the real business world.If you are in an undergraduate program, your school may accept credit by examination. You may possibly be able to test out of your statistics requirement.

This book was suggested to me on a list of plus sized heroines. This is wonderful book. The hero and heroine are real people-with real jobs and real problems. I liked how the author showed that even though the hero was \\"perfect\\" physically, he was also filled with self doubt about himself-and Lucy was just as bad about judging him by his looks as others were to her. Lucy is a heroine to love-a delightful blend of self doubt and optimism.Yes-there are parts that are a bit cliche'-but those are present in most romances and do NOT take away from the story one bit.If you like to root for the underdog then you'll enjoy this fun, emotional, and sensuous romance:)4 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And the underdog wins again!","review":"I love feel good romances like this that take real life bring you down situations and turn them into a badge of honer.

Since I'm a huge bibliophile I decided what better way than to read novels that tell about other women doing the same. So far this book and one called \\"Fat Cat\\" fit the bill. And as for \\"He loves Lucy\\", its such a funny sweet story. I also like that its not full of family dysfunction drama.. the heroin did suffer something traumatic years back but her family isn't the kind that has me cursing them out. At the end of the day they can be annoying but are not life suckers. If I want to read about that I'll look for a drama.I found myself wishing it was on audio so I could listen to it while I walk on the treadmill.

Lucy was likeable enough, but I never got sparks from her and Theo.The story was well-written but it wasn't a quick read for me. It took me longer than I thought it would to read.

You'll be disappointed in the sappy, predictability of this book. Of course the hero had a perfect body and found the heroine attractive even though she was 100 pounds over weight.

Theo, the beautiful trainer, ends up helping her and of course Lucy falls in love with him. He in return over time starts to have feelings for her, but fears and life seem to keep them apart.The story overall was cute and heartwarming. Both Lucy and Theo are good people and try to help others around them. Buddy was a fun character, but the other characters in the book weren't given great dept which is fine since the book mostly surrounds Lucy and Theo.Although I predicted the ending before I even started reading it, it was fun to read about what happens between the two of them and read about the transformation Lucy makes. It read at a pretty quick pace and keeps you wondering if Lucy is going to make her goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Susan Donovan","review":"I can decide if He Loves Lucy or Take a Chance on me is my Favorite Susan Donovan book!

The reviews all raved about this book.Lucy is 5'7 and 100lbs over weight? What does that mean? The weight range for a female who is that tall (that is tall because the avg height for a female in the US is 5' 3\\") is 127 to 158lbs. Which means Lucy can be anywhere from 227 to 258lbs. Now if she is 227 she really might be only 60lbs overweight not 100.The second problem I had was when they were doing Lucy's fitness eval. It feels like the author didn't even bother with even asking a physical trainer what they do when they do an eval. They don't put people in a tank of water to see how much of a person's weight is fat. All the need to do is step on a special scale that computes that.I couldn't even finish the story. I was 9% in and gave up. I returned it on Amazon.

It has one removable tray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price poor gauge of quality","review":"For those of you who equate price with quality, based on my experience with this gauge, you're going to be disappointed. Taking it out of the box, it looked intact. I immediately noticed the rigidity of the rubber tube, but I thought, with use, it would likely become more flexible. I promptly took it out to the car and proceeded to attach the clip to the tire valve. That's as far as I got. The pin holding the spring in place on the clip fell out, and along with it came the spring. So much for my high-priced so-called \\"racing tire gauge\\". It was a complete disappointment. I just sent it back yesrerday. It's my guess, even if the pin and spring hadn't popped out right away, that eventually (sooner rather than later), this cheaply-made gauge would have malfunctioned or broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent gauge for the price, not racing quality.","review":"The gauge works ok. It reads very accurately while you are holding it tight on the valve stem. It drops a tenth or two when you take it off.It is perfectly fine as a very accurate pressure gauge for normal or professional use. This is not what I would consider a high quality RACING gauge.Also the chuck would be easier to use if it where a 90 degree end. Guess you need to spend the money for a racing gauge."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised","review":"Simple and easy to use. Having tenths is helpful to get just the pressure your looking for. If a track junky you'll be happy with it. Especially love backlighting for dark situations.

I called the mfr. and they asked me to look at the back of the guage and read them the codes. They said the guage was two years old. Three batteries cost me ten dollars. I think Amazon should tell you they bought old inventory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use it and not accurate!","review":"I returned mine to Amazon. Didn't like it for the price I paid for. It was not giving me accurate readings. The readings on the tire 32.5 psi first reading. 20 seconds later, the same tire gives me 31.6 psi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this","review":"I have used lots of gauges, and this really works well. I wouldn't say it's racing-team quality, but it was not too much money and way better than the cheapest gauges. Easy to read, even for my eyes. Would be nice if the pouch held the nipple better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This gauge has some nice features that caused me to buy it. But it has design and quality control issues that make it unacceptable.First, contrary to the user guide, it does NOT use a lithium battery. It uses 3 rather ordinary A76 (or equivalent) button cells. The cells last no more than three months and then need to be replaced at a $5-$6 cost. I suspect the short life is due to failure of the automatic on-off feature; I've discovered the gauge turned \\"on\\" for no reason.Second, readings are not consistent. This may be due to improper fastening on the tire stem (which is a design flaw) or to electronic circuitry problems.Amazon replaced my first gauge. The replacement gauge is worse. I'm discarding it.I recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in cold weather","review":"It appears that the problem of slow readings described in the earlier reviews has been solved, as my gauge reads continuously. The reading drops several psi while bleeding just as with a mechanical dial gauge. The reading takes about two seconds to re-stabilize, so a mechanical gauge is actually faster to use.The quick-connector on the end of the hose is excellent, but be careful to not scratch the wheel with it. The hose is fairly stiff, but isn't a problem most of the time.I used this gauge at the track this past weekend, and was pleased with it until the second morning when it was cold (by cold I mean 45F, this is Houston...) and the display read 'Lo', indicating a low battery. So essentially the gauge was useless. The hose also becomes annoyingly stiff when cold.Overall, a good mechanical gauge is easier to use and more reliable, as long as you don't drop it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to bleed, powers off automatically, not a good racing gauge","review":"First, the positives.1) Excellent visiblity from the display.2) Seems ruggedly constructedNow the negatives1) The air bleed button bleeds air way too slowly. If you're actually using this gauge for racing and only have a couple minutes to bleed air from your tires, you will be hard pressed to do it with this gauge.2) The unit powers off after about a minute. There is no way to disable it. That means if you're in the process of bleeding air it may power off, requiring you to unclip the hose from the valve, bleed the unit, hit \\"on\\" and start over. Very frustrating.Overall, it works fine as an air gauge, but for competition... no way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Gauge, but CHEAP, LEAKY FiTTINGS","review":"If this gauge cost $20 I would give it a high rating, but even at the discounted $35 price I see for these gauges I think it is bad value, let alone the nearly $50 it cost me!AS mentioned hose is VERY INFLEXIBLE at cool, not just cold temps, general quality of the fittings is very poor for something advertised like this, mine is now leaking badly and I am trying to repair with quality materials, as I still hope to use the gauge part anyway.I would NOT BUY AGAIN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the high price","review":"Much has been written about this product, and I have nothing to add other than the reason for my one star review. The gauge wouldn't seal on any of the tires on either of my cars. Readings were erratic, inconsistent, in short, useless. Also beware if you have short valve stems, as the gauge seems to require longer ones. In my case that made little difference, so I've returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, reliable gauge","review":"I've tried every possible type of tire gauge, and nearly always had a slight problem with air leakage at the start of the check. This gauge not only is super-accurate, but it all but eliminates the air-leak problem. I'd buy another one without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Unfortunately the unit received was defective. It leaked from inside the dial to the point I could not get a pressure reading. It was returned for a credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Problems With This Product","review":"Problems that I have encountered with this gauge:1 - Hose is too stiff. Storing it in its case doesn't help straightening it out either.2 - The Gauge doesn't work in cold weather when taking readings during the winter months.3 - The lever on the chuck that locks the hose to the valve stem literally fell apart.3 - Good luck finding the recommended replacement batteries.The only positive thing I have to say about this product is that the chuck is deeper than on most othe tire gauges which is a plus. But the extremely stiff hose negates this advantage.Don't waste your money on this product. I replaced it with a similar gauge made by Slime and that gauge has more functions built into it than this one and it has a much more flexible hose and replacement batteries are readily available for it. And its less than half the cost of this one. BTW this is another \\"Made in China\\" piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"I just received the gauge and I'm returning it after trying it for 2 minutes:- The hose didn't seal well on the tire valve- WHen bleeding air, the display didn't update. You have to remove the hose, wait 10 seconds for the display to turn off, then plug it back to the valve stem and get a reading. This is ridiculous.- The display is on for 10 seconds and then it turns off itself"},{"rating":"1","title":"BATTERY LIFE IS THE WORST","review":"As stated in previous reviews. This item would get 4-5 stars except thebattery life is unexceptably low. I only checked by tires a dozen timesbefore low battery signal comes on.

Others love it, I hate it. I went back to my old tire gauge, and will give this on to Goodwill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Accutire MS-5510B Racing tire guage","review":"The only drawback too this product is the size, if you want to stick it in the glove compartment. It's easy to use and very accurate. It locks on to the valve stem and you can bleed the pressure down very easily. The battery life is an unknown at this time,having only used it for 1 month. It is much better then any guage I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little expensive but you get what you paid for.","review":"Have been looking around for a good tire gauge but was always disappointed by most of them. The mechanical ones are usually the safest bet in terms of reliability, yet they were always giving me an incorrect reading, and I know this because tire pressure monitor warning sign in my car would light up which means that my tire pressure dropped below 28psi, and when I would check with a regular mechanical tire gauge it would show around 32psi. What I like about this tire gauge is that it shows correct reading according to many tire shops who checked the reading with their equipment; the quick disconnect (if attached properly) never losses pressure and the Bleed valve is a nice feature so you do not have to disconnect the clip. And the hose is flexible enough to get the job done. The only negative so far is that the back-lit display goes dark in less than a minute so you have to turn it on again to see what was the last reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Upon receipt of the tire gauge I was pleased with the large display and size of the item. When I applied the gauge to a valve stem it wouldn't seal and air continued to leak out. I applied it to three of my other vehicle valve stems and the same leakage occurred. I returned the gauge for a refund. Note: By the way, the Amazon return process is no hassel. The Amazon representative provided me excellent service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good,but not impressed!","review":"I just got it today. Opened the package and saw a small screw laying in the the plastic wrapper. Looked at gauge...screw was missing from back of main body and appeared to be one of the 2 retainer screws that hold the bleeder tube(round tube with air bleed off button) to main body. I then used it one first tire and noticed it would loose air pressure quickly when when removed(not from using bleed off botton. I found that the rubber hose was loose where it screws into the bleeder tube. The guage works reasonally well,but not great. LOOK if the manufacturer is too lazy to put all the screws in and tighten everything...then that makes me a bit nervous about the quality/accuracy of the guage(I will check it against a mechanical guage later). Look its $35 and MADE IN CHINA...don't expect the world(\\"worlds most accurate guage\\" is B.S.). I won a $25 gift card so it only cost me $10. Satisfied,but would shop around more before buying another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Precise but not Accurate","review":"Although this air gauge provides very precise measurements to 0.1 psi, it is not accurate. It reads 12 percent high when compared to the tire pressure monitors on my three cars (two GM vehicles and one Honda).

I purchased it because of the need for a highly accurate gauge and this boasted a 0.1 PSI accuracy - the best I could find. It has lived with all of my automotive equipment for almost four years, being jostled around in a difficult tool environment. Today, it finally sprung a small leak and I noticed the tire connection point was just slightly bent. I've always wished that piece was a little sturdier and, in generally, that the gauge was a little less finicky as far as its position, but it has been an absolutely wonderful gauge. I'm now looking to purchase a new gauge and the only reason I'm going to shop around instead of simply buying a new one of these is that I want to make sure something new hasn't come out. I wouldn't be at all surprised if I end up owning another one of these for the next four years and won't be at all disappointed with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"After returning 2 of these Accurtire gauges I give up. The first came apart at the gauge end and the second blew off the nozzle end. Both times parts were lost so I couldn't fix them.

So the choice is risk losing parts by not tightening or having inaccurate readings. Best choice is not buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Tyre Gauge","review":"This is an amazing quality product for such a small price. it is extremely fast at reading the pressure, easy to let the pressure down then it via the bleed button and then shows pressure level again.the display is large and very easy to read - perfect for when your dealing with tyre pressures in the dark or dim light.this is by far the best gauge on the market - the batteries are very easy to change when they go flat.I wouldnt go past this gauge for any other.I had the gauge shipped to Australia and it arrived in 7 days :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Accutire MS-5510B Racing Tire Guage","review":"I am not all that happy with this guage. when it gets cold it does not work. at 1st I thought it had some how got stuck in on position or just a lousy battery life. after it had warmed up again, I pressed the on button and what do you know it was working again.

When I first received it, the gauge wouldn't turn on. I took out the batteries and reinstalled, then the unit came on. I then checked my tire pressure and the gauge read over 70 pounds all around. The tires felt very hard, so I trusted the gauge. After I did this, my pressure monitor warning light came on. I went to the dealership who checked the pressures only to find that I had between 15 and 17 pounds all of the way around. Thankfully, I only drove less than one day like this.

But Amazon and Accutire don't have customer service phone numbers so it appears I am out the $9. Yes, I could have gone through the trouble of returning the gauge for another -- but what assurance is there that the next gauge won't also have dead batteries. A last note: My neighbor has the same gauge and there is a one lb. difference at the 30 to 34 lb. range between our gauges -- who do you believe? So much for accuracy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gauge but misunderstood","review":"This gauge works well and is easy to read. It seats well and does mostly what it should.There seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what I have read in other reviews. Let's clear a few things up.First of all, you do NOT have to wait ten seconds between readings. You DO have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings.Secondly, you DO NOT have to send the unit back to replace the batteries. The instructions VERY clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries (if you were to read the instructions).The hose was flexible for me in 30 degree weather contrary to what I have read elsewhere. Maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then I use mine in the garage.Very Nice Gauge"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks fancy, but has no value on the track.","review":"This gauge makes one (probably very precise) measuring. The problem is that the display does not follow the current pressure after the initial reading.When bleeding excess air from the tires to reach a certain pressure you make a reading, let some air out, remove the gauge, empty the trapped air from the gauge, attach the gauge again, make a new reading, let some more air out, remove the gauge again, release the trapped air, attach it again, make another reading .... the device looks cool, but has no real value.I'd recommend getting a good quality mechanical gauge instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"same problems here","review":"As other reviewers mentioned, the display does not update when using the bleed valve and you have to wait at least 10 seconds between readings. It may be accurate, but dropping overpressure tires to a desired level ends up being a several-minute guessing and waiting game. Calling it a \\"racing\\" gauge is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile Read","review":"Internationally known writer, counselor, & speaker Gary Smalley came to a crisis in his life: even though he made his living by telling people how to change their lives for the better, he realized that he was over-eating and despite his best efforts, he couldn't change his eating habits. This book is his personal journey on changing both what and how he ate. Written in a warm, non-technical style, this book changed how I looked at food and spurred me personally to make some changes in my diet and take nutrition more seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Non-Traditional Diet Book","review":"If you are looking for a step by step guide to losing weight, this book is not for you. However, if you are interested in uncovering the reasons you overeat and how you can improve your health and personal relationships by changing your eating habits-this is the book for you.Diets come and go, and many of us remain trapped in the cycle of overeating and harboring negative thoughts about ourselves. Smalley explains how there is a clear cycle we all follow when we make poor food choices, and these food choices carry over into our personal lives.For me, this book has made a big difference in the way I view food and its role in my life. Smalley offers tips on foods to avoid as well as foods to eat heartily. But more importantly, he teaches you how God can heal your food addiction and improve you relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Food for the Mind","review":"When I walked past this book in the store, it caught my eye. Like so many people, I have problems with my weight - and with my relationships. A couple of years ago I read Gary Smalley's \\"The Five Love Languages\\" and found it to be very sensible and helpful. So, based on my respect for Gary Smalley's name, I bought the book. Well... I was very dissappointed. After wading through the first 30 pages of fluff, I began to get the the \\"meat\\" of the matter and found it to be just a jumble of unscientific, unsubstantiated diet cliches.Now, I have no evidence of this, but I suspect that this book was concieved by the publisher, written by somebody else (which Dr. Smalley admits), and published under Smalley's well-respected name to boost it's sales. Just the title alone puts it into two genera which generally sell well. Many may buy it, but I suspect that few will find it useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film","review":"A very entertaining film, with exciting film footage interspersed with player interviews. It may seem at first like a time capsule, of more interest to former college students or football players from the 1969 era, but the tension builds and the game footage gets more and more compelling. It's also an excellent story about team spirit, character, and the emotional reality of the Vietnam era. By the end, and its incredibly dramatic finish, it's a movie that should be required viewing for everyone who thinks they know something about football, or really just for everyone, period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvard Beats Yale 29-29","review":"Always double check your purchases. I didn't know I was buying a Blu Ray version. This movie is worthless to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're curious enough to read these reviews, you won't be disappointed!","review":"This film is simply incredible. It's captivating and will keep you on the edge of your seat. If you have the slightest interest in reading these product reviews, then you should simply stop and get the DVD. You'll love it. The story has it all - the superstar, the introvert, the enforcer, Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury, Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones, Al Gore, George Bush, student life in the late 60s (Vietnam, student protests, life on campus as an athlete), the camaraderie of athletes working together, and the bravado-free honesty of the former players discussing the anxiety of on-field pressure. Very well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, great film","review":"I was at the game that day, and just saw the film at our 40th reunion, with Kevin Rafferty and nine of the 1968 team in attendance.

As several of us could not get tickets to THE GAME, we went to the Yale Club in New York City to watch the game. But the yale Club was sold out so we had to watch the game at the Harvard Club.

Of course, there are already overlapping components. The phone and computer come to mind immediately. Media shape messages and the number of participants influences the process as well. Moving on to a second set of circumstances, there's a look at emotional education and mass media. Even entertainment media education. In fact, this subtle approach is sometimes more influential than a hard sell, because it reaches an audience whose barriers are down. It teaches people what is supposedly acceptable behavior.The book is well documented throughout and its contributors are well known in the field of communication. It adds to our understanding of the process and the complexities of sending and receiving messages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits changing tables TERRIBLY!","review":"I bought this change pad cover to match the rest of the island pieces I had purchased.

The Yucatan and Quintana Roo produce some delicious dishes and I was curious to try to make some of them, myself. This achiote paste produced just the right color but I found it a bit difficult to get it to dissolve in oil, even with heat and constant stirring. Next time I think I'll try using the actual seeds instead (also available from a supplier to Amazon). I may be wrong but I think achiote is more of a colorante than a saborizante anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I plugged the inverter in to my cigaretter lighter and it did not provide any power to my laptop.

Larry Hagman is still mesmerizing as J.R. Ewing, with Patrick Duffy also solid as his brother Bobby. The younger cast includes Josh Henderson as J.R.'s son John Ross and Jesse Metcalfe as Bobby's adopted son Christopher.

It's great to see that JR has not lost anything with age.

I was devistated when the series ended 20 years ago. I was so excited when they announced Dallas was coming back! And the original cast like linda gray, patrick duffy and larry hagman were returning as well. Little did i know the modern rewritten CRAP they ended up producing! The sets are hideously ugly, the new actors are terrible and feel like they are reading a script. The entire show lacks the suspense, drama and glamour of the original. Lets face it if not for the original actors coming back, the network would have pulled the plug before the pilot finished airing. I still hold that Dallas ended in 1991 because this modern piece of crap doesnt deserve to share the spot in tv history with the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Just terrible.

The ending of this book is so sad, but it shows how life was back then, and the changing of the west. Still, good always triumphs in a great book, and Death of an Eagle has to be among the top books from the who I consider the best Western writer who has ever lived.

THIS IS NOT REALLY AIMED FOR GAY MEN, but rather for females that like Asian guys. The guys were just okay in my book. If your looking for totally nude guys, including full frontal - look elsewhere.

The detailed descriptions for making stocks and glaces come first, as they form the basis of many of the sauces in their recipes to follow. Time-consuming but easy, these stocks provide a richness and depth to their cuisine found mostly in elegant restaurants, without relying on excessive butter, cream or cheeses. Most important, the recipes are painstakingly edited. I have never had a recipe fail for me, as long as I followed the directions.

I don't agree that Bernadette steals the show: wonderful though she is, the part is overwritten. A little less of the Witch would go a lot further. Ultimately the show belongs to Joanna Gleason and Chip Zien, who are both wonderful. When the Baker's Wife comes back and sings, \\"Sometimes people leave you halfway through the woods,\\" it's definitely kleenex time.

I must say that Joanna Gleason, as the Baker's Wife, probably takes the prize for me as one of the greatest marriages of singer/actor and role I have ever seen.

It brings you back to your childhood and fairytales. My husband who doesn't like musicals even enjoyed this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Play, But Look At The Editing","review":"Into The Woods is one of my Sondheim favorites. Having seen the PBS presentation of this, I am thoroughly dismayed at how poorly this DVD is edited. Rather than allowing one to be engaged by the staging and character interaction, this DVD uses pan and scan to isolate characters and provide sometimes inappropriate close-ups. This especially detracts from what one wishes to see in a play; the staging. By forcing the viewer's perspective, this version does a disservice to a very fine play that investigates our relationships with each other through fairy tales and their aftermath.I am hoping that somebody releases a version that does not presume to edit out the director's vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Disappointed","review":"I love \\"Into The Woods,\\" but this review is because of the lack of information for Amazon Instant Video.To save time and a few dollars, I purchased the Instant Video version under the impression that I would be able to burn the film onto a disk, view it on my phone, and watch it on my television through the use of the cloud or my PS3. I was unable to view it through any, and feel as though I wasted the money just to be capable of watching it on my computer - which I could have done for free through YouTube.I would recommend just buying the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Into The Woods","review":"I viewed this original production once before. Seeing it for the second time made it become even more entertaining. I am afan of Bernadette Peters and she is always wonderful.

Joanna Gleason would have to be my favorite, having brought wonderful expression and vocals into this.The casting for this movie was incredible. they definitely chose their characters wisely...and every single actor/actress was PERFECT for their part. i was highly put out by the revival cast, but that is, of course, my personal opinion.this is definitely a heart warming musical, and DEFINITELY the most thought provoking one.i definitely recommend this...you will NOT be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you!","review":"I have been looking for this movie for YEARS!

Ofcourse, the musical is great, no doubt about that. But I already had it on video, because BBC send it out some years ago. What I really was hoping for, on a dvd... Extra's! But there aren't any on it. Only the show itself. But still... it is great to have it now on digital dvd. The quality is much better then on my old videotape, wich I erased now, btw..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST!","review":"I've never seen a better musical!

I very highly recommend it to...well, anyone at all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Into the Woods: Simply Amazing","review":"My English class watched this DVD as part of a unit of myths, legends, and folklore. We begged our teacher to watch more when we had to end early. It was simply amazing! Days later, some of the other kids and I were skipping down the hall singing lines from the play. \\"I wish... I wish to go to the festival!\\" \\"Into the woods to Grandmother's house!\\" The tale of learning lessons is simply amazing. The Witch, Little Red Riding Hood, the baker and his wife, Prince Charming (who learned to be charming, not sincere), Cinderella, and Jack (from Jack and the Beanstalk) are simply wonderful. Bravi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Beautiful music, lots of clever lyrics, absolutely superb cast--trust me, Into the Woods (at least this performance of it) is everything you could wish for in a musical. Although the darker, more melancholy second act provides a sharp contrast to the first act's supposed 'happily ever after', I found it less jarring than interesting, and my favorite song (Last Midnight) is in it, so...yes. At the risk of sounding cliche, this is not to be missed. Even if (for some odd, inexplicable reason) the plot bores you, in my opinion it's all worth it for Bernadette Peters singing 'Lament' and 'Last Midnight'. Stunning, incredible, awe-inspiring, whatever positive adjective you want it will apply. ^^A warning, however: the songs from it seem to get stuck in your head for days. I've had 'Last Midnight' running through my head for the past two weeks or so and I keep getting this urge to swirl around a swishy cloak that I don't have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful video of a great musical","review":"This is a very enjoyable video. I watch it with my kids - we all enjoy the music and the story is great. It combines the the stories and fates of a lot of familiar fairy tale characters, but it adds a twist. They all have to go \\"Into the Woods\\" to find something that they think will make them happy. The video taping of the live Broadway show is excellent.

I highly recommend it for all grillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick...","review":"We use this for all kinds of veggies, tossing them with olive oil and a little seasoning. The basket has a pretty large capacity, which has its pros and cons. If you have a very small grill, be aware that this will take up space assuming you are also cooking meat or fish at the same time. My husband and I typically just grill for the two of us, but it gets pretty tight when cooking for four. Overall, great product and does what it says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right size","review":"Solid contruction using quality steel. I use it to make my favorite hated veggies on the grill...squash, YUCK!!! Easy to clean and store. The handles are integrated tabs on the sides and not some rivited nonsense that can easily come loose in the future and also making it hard to clean. The handles also are such that you can easily grip them with oven mitts...A huge plus. I prefer this over the handle that are long, that way I can close the lid on my grill and that handle doesn't impose on the competing and limited real estate in your grill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the price","review":"I returned a Sunpak Pro 724 carbon fiber monopod just because I could find better deals like this one.

I take it with me to the softball fields. It packs nicely into a backpack. The only improvement I would make is the wrist strap. It comes loose rather easily so you can lose it.

I also recommend getting the Bogen-Manfrotto 3229 Swivel Tilt Head with Quick Release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liteweight, but useful","review":"This monopod does help steady the camera, but I honestly don't use it that much.

I added a tilt-head and improved a lot more. Manfrotto is quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for light use. Excellent for youth soccer photos","review":"My wife and I use this monopod to take action photos of our sons' soccer team. We use a Nikon D70 with a Nikon ED 70 - 300 mm 1:4-5.6. This monopod eliminates handheld vibration (even at high shutter speeds) especially when the lens is maxed out at 300mm. Don't let your kids play with it. They can destroy anything. On the foot of the monopod is a plastic cover which our kids managed to pull off. It appears to be friction fitted so it can come off. The monopod screws into the D70. When compressed, the monopod is only about 19 inches long and weights about 12 ounces. Perfect for light use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locking ring broke after light use","review":"I received this monopod as a gift. It is fairly lightweight, I found it easy to carry, and fairly easy to use. Unfortunately, I only got to use it a few times before the middle locking ring cracked. Even though it was broken, I was able to just leave that section collapsed, so I continued to use it a few more times, but now the bottom locking ring has a crack, too. The locking rings are some form of plastic, and there doesn't appear to be any way I can fix them. As a gift, I doubt I can find adequate proof of purchase to get warranty coverage, and I'd probably be obliged to pay postage anyway - On a monopod that costs $30, round-trip postage is probably a significant fraction of the cost of a new one; and unless the replacement rings are made of a different material, it'll just happen again anyway. With this experience, I can't say I'll buy a Manfrotto / Bogen monopod to replace it. I was surprised that it had a 4.5 rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for what it is","review":"As the title says, this is good for what it is: an inexpensive, lightweight monopod.It can flex a little bit if you put too much weight on it and have it leaning against something (like a rail at the zoo), even at less weight than the listed 9 pounds of max weight (I had a large sigma lens attached to a camera body). I didn't have that problem when using smaller lenses.I'd imagine you could also use with a camcorder without much problem.Flip locks work great, legs expended smoothly.As with any monopod, I'd suggest adding a head for more flexibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"What beautiful melodies!","review":"I first heard this song when I was a very young child.

It is, in fact, a pleasure to indulge in an audio CD where the talent is not all in the mixing board.But her delivery is straight ahead, and the arrangements are the conventional ones. I don't get a sense of a personal interpretation of these songs -- one much different than would be delivered center stage, fitting in with the rest of the original cast production."},{"rating":"2","title":"great blues / rock cd","review":"I bought MICHAEL LEE FIRKINS first solo CD and was very impressed. I ordered this CD when I found out he played in this band. As FIRKINS is a metal guitar player ( SATRIANI / HOEY etc. ), this foray into BLUES might well have been a failure, but alas the opposite is true. While being a somewhat progressive BLUES CD, their are many tradional elements as well. The harmonica of LITTLE JOHN CHRISLEY is traditional for the most part and his vocals are more than adequate for the BLUES. FIRKINS shines on guitar and keeps the energy level high while playing some inspiring guitar. The songs grow on you after a period of familiarisation. GREAT BLUES / GREAT GUITAR / GREAT HARMONICA. If that sounds like you, don't hesitate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't walk away from this set....RUN!","review":"Having purchased over the years Time Life's 70's & 80's CD's, I was looking for some hits from the 90's and THOUGHT this would be a great set.

If you like hard driving fast rock/blues music search out, find & purchase as much of his stuff as possible. If you don't have any of Kevin's work in your collection, you don't have a collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A REAL CD!","review":"This is only a cd of cuts from each of the songs, NOT the full songs. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in Intimate Theater","review":"David Hare's play is a wonderful look at relationships against the back drop of the 1980s and 1990s London art scene. The tensions of Mother-Daughter relationships forms the core of this play. Other family relationships crackle with the same intensity leaping off the page. The role of Esme is one of the few excellent female lead roles available today - strong, vibrant, sharp tongued and opinionated Esme showcases the broad spectrum of emotions women have between themselves, their children, in-laws, lovers and coworkers.This book is a terrific reminder of an excellent theater production, reading it won't spoil the play a bit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great parenting book!","review":"This is one of the best parenting books I've read. It gives you solid tools for parenting from the heart. This author is a management expert, not a psychologist, and many of the tools are appropriate for working with people, no matter what their age. I especially like the \\"gift of forward focus\\" which helps kids to see that all of life is about learning lessons, and that the only reason to look backward is to understand the lesson in order to be able to avoid the same mistake again. Otherwise it just wastes your energy. I also like the \\"gift of feeling fully\\" which helps kids to be in touch with their emotions.

There is no clip or additional piece to secure the screen so that it does not curl. The screen comes with a wall mount kit, however you would have the same problem as the lattice-type suspension behind the screen keeps the screen a good 2 inches away from the wall.If you have a professional keynote or powerpoint presentation in 16:9 format, the top of the screen has a big shadow area from the bending of the screen.

The widescreen option is fantastic and really makes for an impressive presentation. The fact that the whole thing is self-contained (no need for a bag or case) and that is is quite light and easy to stash in trunk or store in the corner of my office when not in use is also a bonus.

Blowing Zen is made considerably more interesting by the fact that Brooks didn't set out to explore either Zen or the shakuhachi.

In his search for authenticity, the author leaves the party circuit of London and travels to the Orient. While living in Japan,Brooks discovers temples, Buddhist monks, the Japanese mafia, and, perhaps most importantly, the shakahachi - a bamboo flute..What makes \\"Blowing Zen\\" so thouroughly enjoyable is, not only is the book entertaining (I couldn't put it down) but it is also inherently satisfying and hopeful. Part travel account, part autobiography and part spiritual journey,\\"Blowing Zen\\"'s biggest strength lives in its timely message: one does not have to travel the world and play the shakuhachi to find an authentic life, it is simply necessary to look within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Zen tastic!!","review":"Roy writes wonderfully and keeps you entertained as well as informed of the shakuhachi world during his travels."},{"rating":"2","title":"plush friend","review":"He is so much nicer looking than the picture shows!

None of the people in this book have any redeeming qualities except the Indians and the posse chasing the main character, Tom. This is little more than Bonnie and Clyde on horse back. The writing was okay and the plot did have me engaged, but I kept hoping the \\"hero\\" would get caught by the posse and strung up from a high limb of the nearest tree. The point of the story is that we should feel sympathy for him. I didn't. It would have been an interesting story if the marshall chasing this guy would have been the main character. Some of the characterizations are well drawn, but most were people I wouldn't want to hang around-even in a book. I must add that I like westerns and edgy characters, but this was not worth my time or yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"No heroes in this book","review":"I purchased three books by Jonas after reading some of the reviews.

I decided to pick up one of her books after I finished her Literature sequence. It's an excellent book, though definitely not for the vocabularily-challenged. It describes what young women's lives were like in the 19th century - everything from what women were supposed to be like physically, to what skills they should have, to dating and the \\"winnowing\\" process. Cogan draws upon various popular fictional works of the era, thoughts of prominent doctors of the time, and several different areas. Her rather acerbic wit came through nicely in this book, I was pleased to see. Don't mistake this for a light read, however. While not technical, this book is quite verbose.

Socha hid and cared for a group of hunted Jews who had escaped the massacres and deportations during the liquidation of the Lwów Ghetto, at first helping them in exchange for daily payment, but then continuing to do so long after the Jews' money had run out and aiding them had become ever more dangerous.

The foam was packed EXTREMELY tight so we had to work to break up the foam so that it was looser. We finally finished and found that there wasn't enough foam to fit the material so the bean bag laid pretty flat! We kept trying to bunch it together so that it would form a seat the way it is pictured in the photo but to no avail! Every time my son sat down on the seat it would expand and flatten out and he'd wind up on the floor. He was so disappointed that we decided to send it back and boy oh boy was that a task trying to get that back in the box!!! Why do they advertise this one way and send it to you another way?

The replacement ink cartridges will cost you more than the printer itself, with each running over $30. Unlike other brands, all three colors are in one tank, so if one color runs out you have to spend $30. The cartridges themselves work well for the first couple of printings, then begin to look poorer and poorer, until they finally die an early death.The software that comes with the printer is useless as well.

The printer's troubleshooter is the worst I've ever seen for any hardware. The company's website stinks too.Perhaps coincidentally, my first Compaq (now Lexmark)printer found its way into the garbage, but lasted 2 1/2 years. This one made it about 6 months.

He has done an awsome job on keeping up to date in today's music world. In addition to making a new album, he has also spread his work out to a new dimension by adding musicians like Lenny Kravitz, and changing up his style on every other song. One of my favorite songs on the C.D. was \\"How Much We Grew\\". It was a dedication to his folks in the hood, and all the people who supported him even when they had no reason to. It shows that Busta Rhymes had also went through tough times to get to where he is today.

With typical guest spots from Flipmode, he has Jigga, DMX, Raekwon, Ghostface, M.O.P., and Lenny Kravitz (? ? ?) on hand to show support, we wonder how can Busta be down with everyone?But maybe his apparent friendships with everyone in the rap world (who else has Jay Dee and Swizz on the same disc?) just further prove that Busta is a true personality--Something that has been missing is rap recently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"Bustas attempt at a more meaningful cd turned out to be pretty good!

When I bought this cd I gave it about a 50% chance of equaling his previous album, ELE. Plain and simple - it's better. With \\"Anarchy,\\" Busta Rhymes maintains his reputation of being the most original rapper in the business. Both his lyrics and beats are unique to his own style. If you don't believe me, just listen to about five seconds of \\"Bladow! \\" and tell me you can picture any other mc rapping to a beat like that. Besides that, just about every song is worth listening to. \\"Anarchy\\" is the kind of CD you pop in and play through. If you like Busta Rhymes or anything Flipmode, you'll like \\"Anarchy.\\" The only drawback I can think of is that Lord Have Mercy isn't in any of the Flipmode Squad songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Busta's Best","review":"i love busta's style. charismatic, fun, and great to get the part going. and when he gets more serious or vengeful, such as on \\"Hail Mary\\" with Busta Rhymes and 50 Cent which is tearing up mixtapes and radio, he is still great. this album just wasnt as good as he can be. its still good though, although not busta's best. fiery beats and apocalyptic/party lyrics, and enough energy to last through an Apocalypse, this album is good, but some lackluster production brings it a step down. busta fans, and hip hop fans buy it.Fav. Songs: \\"Salute Da Gods\\", \\"Bladow\\", \\"Fire\\", \\"Live It Up\\", \\"Show Me What You Got\\", \\"Cmon All My N*****, Cmon All My B*****\\", \\"Make Noise\\", \\"Ready For War\\", \\"Why We Die\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"BUSTA AND FLIPMODE NEVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME","review":"It's hard to believe that a rapper in today's world of rap can produce three albums in a row on a theme other than \\"gangsta.\\" Busta's raps about nothing but ... well nothing. Even though his lyrics barely make sense, his flow and style is remarkable in it's own right. His lyrics can also make you laugh and always have a positive feel to them. His songs are just very up-tempo songs that make you feel good. Swizz Beats always accompanies Busta with some of their best stuff. Although the \\"end of the world\\" syndrome is sort of old now, Busta manages to follow the same successful formula. The only thing missing from this cd is the slow duo he had on the previous two album's (hence the 4 star rating). But he replaced it with a heart-felt ode to him and his \\"homies\\" growing up which is good too. Overall, definitely a good rap album. Thanks for the music Busta ... Flipmode lives on 4-eva!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Busta Bust","review":"\\"The Coming\\" is a classic hip hop record, one that any fan of his should have. Since then, he has gone too commercial to remain as hardcore as he pronounces to be. Busta is one of my favorite MC's, but when I listened to Anarchy, all I heard were recycled lyrics. The beats and music kicked as usual, but this was a lackluster effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta took us through total anarchy on this one.......Tight!","review":"This new one from Busta suprised me. I didn't expect him to drop a another one so fast. After hearing \\"get out\\" I was kinda thinking whether or not I should buy this. Then I heard another track called \\"Bladow! \\" and decided to get it. Was it worth it? yes! Even though I still think his best album is somewhere between When Disaster strikes and ELE, this one is a good follow up. The intro goes through news reports like the Columbine shoting, Ellian, etc... to show you what he means by the world being in total anarchy. Compared to ELE , this one is more concious and the beats hit with a more street vibe than ElE. Overall, If your a fan of busta don't miss this. If your not a fan you should check it out. You might be suprised.get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"Busta came back, and came back feriously!

Geeez give me a break!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta Ryhmes is BACK!","review":"I got a sneak peak of this album at my local records shop, and let me tell you this album ROCKS! Busta has great lyrical ability, and the beats he sings with will keep your head bouncing for weeks.The guest spots are really great, especially the one with Lenny Kravitz. If you liked E.L.E i reccomend you pick this album up right now, if you didnt care for E.L.E give this album a try anyway because he tries a lot of new styles out! P E A C E !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Didn't Do It For Me","review":"I'm not sure why, but old school Busta Rhymes just doesn't interest me. His songs are too chaotic and his lyricism is just uninspired. \\"Fire\\" and \\"The Heist\\" are decent tracks, but otherwise, this album is instantly forgettable. Maybe I just can't appreciate this style of rapping..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this CD.

Busta lays it out there for you and if you dont like it then too bad. He really came back with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anarchy","review":"After Jay Z's \\"Hard Knock Life\\" I wondered who would be the next artist to come with kids in the chorus (which is nuttin' nu). In \\"Get Out\\" Busta Rhymes' kiddie chorus is not just another on the bandwagon song. It's a certified head banger. My advance copy of Anarchy is constantly being pumped throughout my office and always in my whip (sorry dats car 4 da ebonically impaired). If you ain't feelin' this joint why u even brother browsing thru da Hip Hop section. \\"Get Out\\" and stay out. Anarchy is definitely one of the top Albums to cop this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoo Haaa","review":"This cd I would consider slightly above average, based on Busta's rapping skills alone. A lot of the tracks have Swizz Beats-like backgrounds, which is different from Busta's usual style. The DMX, Jay-Z track was kinda disappointing, but its still a solid track. \\"Get Out\\" is getting played out, but overall I would suggest this cd to the true Busta fans..the more you listen to it the more you will like it, he's one of the top rappers in the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One o the best CD in my collection.","review":"This Cd is humorous,and nice to listen. you can never get bored of it. My favorite song on it is \\"GET OUT\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the illest","review":"Busta Rhymes never suprises me ! with his first album being very good, his second being great his third being spectacular and this one being just as good. this album is Great but unfortunately it is not his best one yet, i still like E.L.E. but to all you heads out there that like busta ! this is another one to add to your collection !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta does it again!","review":"Once again, Busta Rhymes makes another album full of great songs. Just like E.L.E., The Coming, and When Disaster Strikes, Anarchy is full of great beats, and catchy tunes. If you like Busta's other CDs, be sure to pick this one up. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I think that Busta's best work has already come and that this stuff isn't Busta anymore. I think Busta is trying to conform more to what rap is now, which is lazy and done without much thought. Busta is better than that, and better than this! What happened to the energetic Busta who had all of the crazy, colorful videos? That was the real Busta, that was when he really had style. Now all we get is Busta standing in front of the camera wearing his own hip-hop label. It was cool when he was creative and wore all of the costumes. Anybody can stand in front of a camera wearing some label. Busta used to be better than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phat Rymzzz","review":"In my opinion, \\"Busta Rhymes\\" is the Phattest Rapper in town. I find his work in the \\"explicit lyrics\\" genre remarkable, mych better than in the \\"censored\\" version. No doubt about it, \\"Busta\\" is going to be bustin' up the chartzzz with kickin' rhymes like this. And if you like Busta Rhymes, check out anything by Richard Wagner - that's how I got into Busta."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the video.","review":"I respect that you people like him but I can't understand a word he's saying. I think that it's cool that he can rhyme that fast but if you like pop music then this isn't the best CD for you but if your heart's set then by all means buy it. The song \\"Fire\\" was pretty good but I just couldn't understand him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta is all about Anarchy","review":"Busta brough it more to a street level, w/ this album hes always changing and evolving this is a good CD lots of high tempo beats and lots of energy, good cd to party with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Busta-Bus does it again!","review":"This album is blazin! The album, Anarchy, shows Busa Rhymes' continous evolution and maturity in his hip-hop flow. It is not better than ELE, in my opinion, but is definitely worth your money. If you like Busta's style and hot beats, you will not be dissapointed, but if you are a casual Busta fan, then Anarchy may not be your choice. Busta, once again, keepin' it real, keepin' it tight and keepin' the beats bumpin! Do your thing Busta, you the man! Loved you in Shaft too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter than Fish Grease","review":"Aiight, here we got Busta Rhymes. First thing is first- this CDis HOT! . His last CD kinda was a disappointment, but this ishis. Songs like \\"Fire\\", \\"Get Out\\", \\"The Heist\\", and \\"Why We Die\\" are all great songs that make the CD a whole lot more live. I would buy this CD if you liked Busta's other songs before, and if you didn't like it, still, Buy it. I'm telling you, it's worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"This new cd from busta is one of his best three. He starts rapping alittle more \\"under control\\".

Not long thereafter I was sick of \\"Shine,\\" and this disc's value went to about zero. This isn't really bad music, I suppose, it's just completely unmemorable and bland. Once I was done listening to it, nothing lingered, almost nothing struck me as original or exciting in the least. \\"Scream\\" isn't a bad little rocker, and \\"Wasting Time\\" is fair enough southern pop, but I can't even recall what any other songs sounded like.I sold this disc for $3 to a local used shop, and have never missed it once.

Compared to all of their other albums this just is not a quality recording.Now, the songs...that's a different story. I do love listening to this CD, for it is packed with very good music. I don't feel like skipping any song on this. I do daily workouts to music, and I use 'Hints...' for my workout from time to time. So I divide the songs on here into two catagories: workout worthy and other. Here are the one's I consider workout worthy:*Shine*Goodnight, Good Guy*Wasting Time*Love Lifted Me*Breathe*AllPlease, whoever is reading and can do anything about it - REMASTER THIS CD!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unorganized, but full of promise","review":"I actually heard \\"Shine\\" as early as November,1993 about 4 months before this album came out. I guess it pays to live down south. I found \\"Shine\\" to be a thought provoking song; don't ask me why. I heard the other song \\"Breathe\\" a few months later, and the direction is as different as night and day. \\"Breathe\\" is techno-pop that sounds like what Nine Inch Nails would've sounded like if they came out of Georgia like Collective Soul does, but \\"Shine\\" is a good piece of Southern Alternative. Other songs noteworthy are: \\"Burning Bridges\\", and \\"All\\". The rest is all over the map which to me is not a good thing as a group should start out with an identity to let the public know what they're all about, but with Collective Soul the style of music matches the title name of this album: \\"Hints Allegations, and Things Left Unsaid.\\" They tried to cram too much into an album that wasn't necessary to have in there. They do get better trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my faves","review":"Excellent Collective Soul CD. Their best CD by far.

Using photo ink and glossy paper, it produced some beautiful pictures. Unfortunately, the amount of ink it consumes makes it very uneconomical. After spending about $75 on two cartridges, and having them run dry after only a few sheets, I gave up.Although I still have the printer, it's ink dried up months ago and I don't plan on buying any more.

Just FYI for those Windows XP users looking for a printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lexmark: Latin for \\"GOTCHA!\\"","review":"I bought this... because it was affordable and offered decent print quality. Each printed page is quite precious, because you'll probably only get a few dozen of them before the printer commits seppuku.Their supposed \\"accu-feed\\" technology was nowhere to be found, with perfectly-loaded sheets getting crinkled diagonally about half the time. The exit tray is a joke. The mechanism jiggles envelopes violently, causing your intended black ink to arrive on the paper in components.

This tape is in fact more slide show than video, as there is no real moving footage - just a limited selection of photographs shown (often repeatedly!) beneath a rather overdramatic narration. The picture quality is not even very clear and colors are washed out, making it difficult to appreciate the supposed beauty of the city at the focus of this production.While some of the highlight attractions of the city are shown and some of its history is discussed, there is little focus at all on the artwork of the city, and not much information that will be useful to those planning a visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris City of Light,","review":"Here is a video, unlike any other, void of cliches, interesting, romantic, exciting, yet clearly stated.

I contacted MacAlly tech support and they suggested I power the unit through a switchable power strip. They also confirmed that the drive can't be spin down through software, such as OSX's energy saver control panel.

My friends said they were totally cool.I read his book, The Initiation. At first I thought it was one of those Eastern GURU baloney books.

How many people have been in the presence of this awesome man. How fortunate they are.The Initian is not just another 12 easy steps to a happier life. It is a guide book of a journey to self. Through his melodic writing the songs of love and gentle healing emenate forth from the pages.Dr. Schnell takes us on his journey and through it we discover just how close to balance and well being we all are. Just how close spirituality is and how easy it is to grasp it. A passage comes to mind . . . Dr. Schnell is riding in the back seat of Babu's taxi. In the chaos of Indian roads and perhaps drivers Dr. Schnell goes deep into mediation --methodicaly honoring all that insinuate themselves into his mind and releasing the thoughts until he is still.If he can do this in a taxi in Southern India then we all can do it in the quiet of our homes.Thank you Dr. Scnell --your words will always have a special place in my heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"contrived?\\"","review":"This book appears to be a poorly disguised attempt to win followers among the feeble minded.

It was not until the recipe was passed down generations that the added raisins were apart of the Irish Bread recipe. Back in the early 1500-1700's raisins were not available, but during the harsh winters, Irish women began placing raisins in the Irish soda bread as added fullfillment and began using it as more of a breakfast or mid evening snack with a small cup of hot tea.My family is deep rooted with the Irish Soda bread recipe, as is your recipe which I think is great and it is what you are accustomed to, traditionally Irish Soda Bread did not have raisins in it.Thanks for sharing your recipe with us.Susan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Irish Soda Bread","review":"A nice bread, but not Irish.The first clue for this product is the package.

Look at Telarc's Cincinnati Orchestra Xmas CDs to find glaring examples. So here we have Roger Whittaker singing with Boyd a new song that is about as feeble as possible, lame words and even lamer music, totally unoriginal and derivative that sounds like it was cobbled together in a ten minute session and I am being generous. Then we add an adult choir and a children's choir and a child soloist and the skimpy 40 minute CD leaves little room for Boyd's guitar so I advise classical guitar devotees to skip this CD and I advise Boyd to get a new producer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts political arguments in the proper perspective","review":"Arguing from the humble perspective of one of mankind's observers rather than the conceited perspective one of its shapers, Mr. Bastiat effectively defines the only rational purpose of Law.What is the purpose of Law, according to Mr. Bastiat? To establish a constant force of lawful defense of each person's natural right to defend his life, liberty, and property against any unjust attack. In a word, Justice.To establish his point, Mr. Bastiat challenges anyone to name a single endeavor that a government can do in addition to securing these rights that does not itself trample upon them, and then analyses the numerous feeble attempts by legislators and philosophers to do this. In his trenchent analysees, he exposes the absolute absurdities of such proposals.A delightful and tremendously important book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most powerful books ever about individual freedom","review":"Bastiat hit the nail on the head when it comes to what's wrong with government.

Macalpine is a terrific guitarist, one of the rare breed who doesn't let his technical abilities overpower a sense of melody and purpose in his solos. His rhythm playing is really good, and his writing is mature. He's no slouch on keyboards, either. Tommy Aldridge has always been a monster - his double kick stuff is imaginative and used with taste. Even Bob Rock's peculiar, bellowing singing style doesn't take away from my enjoyment of this record, somehow it all fits together. \\"Nostradamus\\" is a standout cut.The picture on the back cover says it all; massive, 2 ft high permed hair, androgynous clothing, those serious gazes... you just gotta love the 80's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what the professor requested","review":"The books was for a required college class.Arrived quickly and ready to input.Instead of selling it back, some of the chaptersare informative and would be welcomed into mycurrent working status."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written problems","review":"Lots of missing information and assumptions plague the problems that are found at the end of the chapters.

I did not notice anyone mentioning that B-Tribe has a very young Vicente Amigo on guitar and one of the leading Flamenco vocalists Enrique Morente joining them, very impressive.

Then a new theme is introduced and given the same treatment. Most of the themes are very nice and show promise, but they never go anywhere. This happens on every song on the CD. I find that I can't listen to any of the songs all the way through anymore as they annoy me with the predictable repetitions. I understand that Asbjornson's music is often used for massage, and it would certainly lull someone into a nap! Personally, I'd have to ask them to change the music!

If you find that it doesn't stay attached to your wall very well, it is still a nice bag to put toys in and leave it in the bathtub. The mesh allows for the toys to drain and still keeps them all in one place. It is also a nice diversion for young babies. My youngest daughter loves to look at it hanging on the wall.

What they don't mention is that the holes to put the toys in (at least in the ducky one) are only about 3 or 4 inches wide. Pouring cups and such are a struggle to get in there. Larger \\"bath meshy\\" type animals, very popular on the market for children to bathe and play with, forget it. They won't fit. it's okay though, because even if you could get them in, it would just fall to the floor - so it's actually saving you some time by being so dysfunctional in that area too.

The friendships that actually last and will stand the tests of what ever is thrown at one during life, and what you'll throw back at life to keep that friendship.Its just a wonderful book, that every girl should read. Even if its about two wildly different Japanese girls and neither is really a 'mainstream underground' in America, everyone LUVS a E.G.L. and who doesn't want to be a big bad Yanki sometimes?word of warning, there is some cussing. artfully and tastefully done. and yes I apply those types of words to cussing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an injoyable summer read","review":"I saw the Kamikaze Girls movie a while ago and found it quite fun.

Heroine is of strong character. The Hero is flawed but a good man. Their attraction is realistic. The romance takes time to develop. The sex is sizzling. The story line was entertaining. The only thing I would recommend is that you read the \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\" first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"This is basically a follow-up to \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\", which I loved. Sweet, funny, romantic and at times heartbreaking. Read that one, and then stop. This book is slow to start, and extremely convoluted, with no clear explanations as to the meaning of the other races/people described in the book. In addition, the author had the nerve to put in a shameless plug for one of her other books in the middle of this one. Is she that desperate? That came about 1/3 of the way into the book, and from that point on, I was so turned off that it was a real struggle to finish. What a disappointment...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as \\"Kiss of the Highlander\\"","review":"The heroine was weaker I felt in this book. I found myself frustrated with her whereas I had more respect for Gwen in the Kiss of the Highlander. It was terrible that Silvan tells Daegus that he's the favorite over Drustan, no father would say that to one of twin sons. And the whole story about a tortured hero who can be saved only by the one mate, and uttering a binding spell was shamelessly unoriginal and imitative of Christine Feehan's \\"Dark\\" series... Otherwise he will become \\"a dark one\\" and lose his soul, again just like Feehan's series.Easy ending, too easy. No good twists like Kiss of the Highlander.I don't know if I'll bother with the next one, Highlander's Touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This book was wonderful.

Hope to see more from this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed with this one...","review":"In this book about Adam Black, I found myself dissapointed and surprised by the lack of consistency of Adam's character compared to the other Highlander books that he appeared in. He was positively horrid in the past books and down right hateable. I felt that his character as that hateable fairy added to the last books and made you understand why is son didn't want anything much to do with him in \\"The Highlander's Touch\\". His lightening fast change of character in this book was just too unbelievable to me. I couldn't even finish due to the fact that it just wasn't even ficticiously believable as Moning's past books have been. Oh well, you can't please everyone. I'm glad that someone enjoyed it. I do look forward to more about the MacKeltar brothers in the future. Pleas don't wait to long to pick up the Highlander series again, Ms. Moning.

Her description of Him and Her is so annoying and irritaiting, I am still trying to finish the book, believe me it's hard!

To be willingly identified as the author of such [stuff] is brave indeed.[Cheap thrills] disguised as romantic fiction is an old genre, and this book does not pretend to be anything else, but it is arousing only if your idea of a desirable male is defined solely by arrogance and physicality. Knowing that there are women who feel lust for the fictional Daegus MacKeltar makes me ashamed to be a woman.The writing is shallow, the storyline is shallow, the characterization is shallow. I would give it 0 stars out of 5, but Amazon.com doesn't allow ratings that low."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite romance novel!","review":"I found the heroine very likeable and easy to relate to, probably especially because I am a bookworm myself!

I mean really, who could even think beyond all that sexy, huge, magical Highlander? Well, Daegus' story made my heart beat really fast and wonder just where my Highlander was. \\"The Dark Highlander\\" is really, really good. Plain and simple. Daegus and Chloe are so perfect for each other, just as Drustan and Gwen were. The chemistry is electrifying, and Ms. Moning makes you believe traveling through time is real, and that love is forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense tale!","review":"I recently discovered Moning's book when my sister recommended this author to me. I've been working my way through the Highlander series, and thoroughly enjoying it. I thought I'd be put off by this one's plot, with all the \\"dark\\" elements, but it was a good read. Love those MacKeltar twins! My only criticism is that Chloe, the heroine, seemed so similar to the heroine Gwen in Kiss of the Highlander. Do Scottish men only like wee, petite women? But, nonetheless, this book is well worth reading and, for me, a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe everybody else liked it, but ....","review":"I felt compelled to give notice: There was not one original idea, not one surprise, not one character that was believable (whether corporeal or not), and even the brighter parts have all been written and read many times before.

OK to read if it is free and you are stuck on a runway."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was bad....","review":"I don't know why...must be cause this story lacks something.

After reading all of her books, I want my own Highland Warrior!!! She is great in her descriptions. She explains each of the characters so well. She doesn't just give one point of view, but takes closer looks at every character. Daegus is a very strong, sensual character. And I do feel a close kinship to Chloe.I am a bit upset that her next book won't be out unitl August 2004. My guess is that it will be about Adam Black (he is mentioned in a couple of her previous stories, including this one), but I could be wrong.If you enjoy a great romantic historical, with a twist of magic, and a lot of sexual tension, you should pick up her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!!","review":"Could Ms. Moning have run out of fanciful ideas, lost her touch with hot scenes of passion, and created the most dithering and boring female character yet? Och, aye!This book could have been about 100 pages in length, since it basically starts 70 pages from the end. Too little magic and too much circling-and-sniffing. In a nutshell, the lead character, Dageus McKeltar, needed animal-level sex to keep his internal evil at bay. There's a concept! Remember Adam Black? He's not even part of the major story line...did I say story line. Yea, right.I have found Ms. Moning's other books at least entertaining, and some rather stimulating. One of her characters even made my Listmania List, Historical Hunks and Heroes. I am facinated with the concept of time-travel. Oh well, I guess this was just a filler to sell a few thousand more books, riding on the coattails of her past stories.

The lids on the pans are interchangeable (the lid for the medium saucepan fits on the 8\\" fry pan and the lid for the large pot fits on the large fry pan) and the steamer has a tiered bottom so you can use it with any of the pans; very useful when you have a lot of things going at once. The pans are fairly light and easy to handle, and the all metal design is nice because you can put them in the oven. My only real complaint is that the handles can get kind of hot. I also have one of their non-stick fry pans (the lids are interchangeable between the different pan series as well) and am very happy with that.

They just kept being civil to each other. No fun in that lol.Honestly though, I don't think I liked Sarah all that much. She's such a typical personality. I'm meek, quiet, and shy. I've never been anywhere in the world. But I'm a wildfire when you get me really mad or naked in the bed. And honestly, how hard is it to learn not to slam the foot down on the pedal? lol.

It needs care when shooting at maximal focal lenght because it is so small that it is easy to make \\"sea-sick\\" productions.I previously ownen a JVC which I hated with all my heart.

Even though the unit is under warranty for one year, it's only under warranty for parts -- not labor (which is the most expensive part of fixing something!!!).

And don't bother with buying a USB cable, since the images turn out awful. Get the Firewire cable.

Overall, the deal you get on this isn't worth all the extras you have to buy to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good for TV viewing","review":"I purchased this for my husband and it was a huge hassle. The camera itself is fine, but if you want to upload any footage to a computer, good luck. I purchased the ilink cable just to make sure I could do it, but despite having a new, expensive computer and a new laptop, neither had the port necessary to accept the cable. So I had to go to three different stores to find the USB cable necessary. Finally I had video on my computer, but the cd-rom supplied with the camera didn't work. It insisted I couldn't open the main page without macromedia flash, which was already installed on my computer.So, essentially, if you're planning on not having your video on the computer, this camera is fine. Otherwise, it's way too expensive to waste your money on for a whole lot of hassle.

If the cable was at the end or it opened a little wider it might be possible to lay across the top of the keyboard next to the hinges.IF this quality of speaker were for a laptop I would give it a 3.

It's the old 'Hatfield/McCoy' family feud scenario, complete with gunfights, cowboys on horseback and young lovers that cross the enemy lines to stay together. There isn't anything particularly Earthshaking or memorable here.Perhaps the most interesting feature of \\"To the Last Man\\" is the presence of a five year old Shirley Temple in a small role as Randolph Scott's daughter. She did the film well before her child star days, while she was under contract at a Poverty Row studio and doing bit part and walk-on work around Hollywood. Her screen brother, Delmar Watson, appeared with her again 5 years later in \\"Heidi\\" at Fox.If you're a fan of early talkie Westerns you might like this movie, but if not, \\"To the Last Man\\" might not keep your attention for long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track listing","review":"Amor E Paixo 2EsquinasTanto E MaisMania De VocRaras ManeirasEm Flor (Too Young)Amor ExplícitoIolandaBálsamoRei Por Um Dia"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could be so neat....","review":"My kids (4 and 6) were so looking forward to this.

I'm sure this book has use as a backup technical resource, but if you're learning the software and need one book, this AIN'T it. Nolan Hester's Quick Start is just ok, a beginner book by comparison.

This type of basic instruction, while important to beginners, is a waste of paper for intermediate to advanced developers which is its target audience.

The examples are difficult to read and even harder to implement. The author often points the reader to pre-built databases on the included CD. Although these examples are nice have it would be better if the author taught the reader how to build such databases. I have also found that it is very inconvenient to convert FileMaker 5 & 6 files to FileMaker 7.

I was extremely disappointed.When I first opened the box I was concerned by the fact that there was a hole in the plastic packaging but I hoped that wouldn't matter. I don't know if that is to blame for the sorry state of these shears but it could have been a factor.The blades were sharp enough but they were coated in a thin layer of an oily substance. I wiped this off with a paper towel. From the very beginning they were very difficult to cut with - jerky and hard to open and close. It was misery trying to cut out a pattern and fabric (a thin, soft fabric).I am sending them back immediately. I thought about exchanging them for another pair in case I just got a dub but I didn't feel it was worth the risk.

The translation is solid, though perhaps a little flat at times, and the price is right.

In spite of this being almost a rehash of 'Arthur' - which, as I said, was an excellent movie - I give it 4 stars because it is still very funny...........in places. However, the script is too predictable and the acting undistinguished - with the notable exception of John Gielgud who excels naturally.

The writing itself is very basic, and you get the feeling he thinks EVERYTHING the band did was awesome.....ie: and then they trashed the hotel room (how cool!), they smashed their instruments (it was cool!) etc etc. The heavy drug use is written as almost trivial, and the Courtney/Kurt relationship portrayed as 'cute' (at least it read that way to me). Poor Dave Grohl is written as almost inconsequential.Kurt was/is my age, I knew many guys like him, looking down on the popular/'in' groups - rejecting them before they could reject him. This isn't punk, it's insecurity. Was he talented? yes, and I am/was a fan - but Nirvana's music is not holding up to time as much as some of the other 90's 'grunge' bands.

The stories are candid, Michael Azzerad really holds nothing back. Besides the in depth stories, it has many rare pictures, and a great amount of info on NIRVANA recording sessions and songs. If you like NIRVANA, then you have no excuse not to own this book. It is the NIRVANA bible. Accept no other but this, the ONLY authorized biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much speculation...","review":"The author presents his own view of the meaning behind the lyrics of some songs as definitive and without qualifications. For example, the book presents \\"Rape Me\\" as being an about Kurt's struggles with the lack of privacy accompanying his new fame, while the song was actually written before the release of \\"Nevermind\\" and Kurt himself said in interviews that the song was about literal rape and a revenge fantasy of a rapist being raped in jail. The book doesn't even mention the second meaning, and perhaps both are valid, but the presentation in the book is one-sided. This error was very obvious to me when I read the book and destroyed the credibility of the whole work."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book that focuses not only on kurt","review":"don't get me wrong, kurt ruled, but there was a lot more people involved in nirvana. this talkes about everything that had to do with nirvana."},{"rating":"1","title":"nah...","review":"i'm a huge nirvana/cobain fan, and i think i've read every book out there writen on them/him. this was one of the most boring and inaccurate ones, by far. it especially paints a dull and wimpy picture of dave grohl who's anything but. it also depicts a false, i.e., flattering, picture of courtney that's quite annoying. i was bored to tears reading this book. it leaves a lot to be desired. although \\"heavier than heaven\\" also contains a lot of courtney schmoozing and inaccurate info, it makes a far better and more entertaining read. you're better off getting that instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"If you are Nirvana and/or Kurt Cobain fan, then definatly read this book.

Plus, it's hard to clean off your hands and the hands still feel dirty even after washing them with water.

This is simply using natural Lemon juice which removes the tannin stains instantly.

It's not especially deep nor excpetional mind you. And Jamie Walter's vocals may lack particular distinction compared to others. But...there's an atmosphere of smoky melancholy that permeates at times that enchants as well as an earnesty that lesser peers lack. Jamie Walters serves as an example of what well made mainstream straightforward pop & bluesy inflected rock can be about. It's a good listen overall. Standouts are the haunting \\"The Distance\\", the catchy \\"Comfort Of Strangers\\", the spirited balladry of \\"Hold On\\", and the not overwrought closer \\"Perfect World\\".The other tracks serve as a nice counterweight and exercises in a more rolicking manner of rock overall. One of the better mainstream pop records of the mid-1990's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this cd!","review":"It is really good.Very catchy.Something you can listen to over and over.

Watch this video.We often use the term 'revival' too lightly, referring to a particularly inspiring meeting. In this video, revival describes an entire society being reformed. Depending on the city, this has different 'symptoms'. For example: bars being closed, due to lack of business; jails being closed, due to lack of crime; increased harvests; reduction in drug trade; all-night prayer vigils held in the sports arena, with tens of thousands of participants, etc.There are four segments, each about 15 minutes long, each featuring a different city around the world that is currently undergoing revival. I was most impacted by the commonalities between these stories. In each case, the story started with sin and darkness. In each case, there were praying believers. In each case, churches united in partnership. The lessons seem obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Two years ago I attended one of George Otis Jr seninars in Australia.

It breaks down the areas,such as Palenque, Calakmul, Yaxchilan, Capan, and Caracol, and there respective leaders. The sculptures and other images contained in this book are clear and distinct. This book is on par with anything written on ancient Egypt. However with all the different variations in the names of the Kings and Queens, I just wish the author would have broadened the index and made it more concise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too academic for a generalist audience","review":"The authors may be stars in the Maya world, but I didn't like this book much - especially after paying almost US$50 for the hardback version. It may have great illustrations and very informed analysis of certain city lineages, but it doesn't give you a good flavour of the history of Mayan civilisation. It's very academic in its approach and covers less than a dozen cities in the region. Its conclusions on the rise and fall of one of Mesoamoerica's foremost civilisations were a bit perfunctory for my liking. Stylish but dry.

(And don't worry, the answers are on the back of the card with the question!)While the primer focuses on the basics, it is full of meat. It begins with the foundation-- What is a worldview? What forms the foundation of a worldview?-- and then builds on it, addressing a wide range of issues. In simple sentences, you define terms such as moral relativism, Deism, and agnosticism. And you cover topics ranging from the essence of beauty, to three institutions ordained by God, and cults.The simple, charming color illustrations and side-bar remarks are icing on the cake. This is a great tool for Christian families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Definitive Version","review":"I loved this book. For fans of King Arthur,this is where you must start. It is derived from the original manuscript of the 16th century. Even the old english has not been translated! It retains all of the original text. Only dissapointment is that there is not much of an introduction. I only wished that the introduction from the hardcover version was reprinted. It gave a long story of the book itself with lots of notes on the novel. This book should be produced today and put into the major shops. It certainly beats Penguin's translated versions. As I said, for people who want the ORIGINAL, start here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotising","review":"I'm not a music reviewer, so I can't really explain the ins and outs of why I like this album so much, I just do.

The style is mostly trip-hop with a bit of world flavor to it (as reflected in their song titles). Barb Cohen's vocals are just unbelievable -- soaring, chilling, soothing -- on top of Paul Robb's tripped out beats and grooves. This group takes trip hop and makes their own unique version. Snatched up by a major label only a scant few months after their debut, I'm guessing you'll be hearing much more from this band. Just give one of the tracks a listen and you'll need to hear the others.

He doesn't write his own rhymes and his flow is incredibly slow and clumsy, and it's obvious he wouldn't even be recording an album if Violent J were not his brother. Outside of the guest appearances by Violent J and Myzery (who I loved while he was on Psychopathic) there is nothing stand out about this album. Sorry Jumpsteady, but don't quit your day job bro."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Price is Right","review":"When I bought my Motorola V220, my Cingular Store charged top dollar for the car charger - and they were sold out. I was thrilled when I found this starter set on Amazon. The car charger is compatible with the V220, and it comes with case and hands-free ear bud - all for less than I would have paid for the charger alone. The ear bud does not have the best sound - voices come across as somewhat muffled, though still audible - and the case is adequate. I wouldn't buy this set specifically for those items, although they both work with/fit the V220. As I see it, they were bonuses for purchasing the charger.Five stars for the charger, three for the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"The headset really has bad sound quality.

For me this is one of those ultimate feel good albums, I put it on and by the end I have a huge smile on my face and my spirits have been lifted. It's even better in summer, played loud as you're driving in your car! Michael Hutchence had distinctive vocals and INXS as a band had a distinctive sound and this album is a great place to go to hear both.

I was shocked when I heard of his death a few years ago, it was so hard to believe. I remember watching them on VH1's hard rock live just months before it happened. INXS was a cool group, and this is a very cool hits collection. I've owned this CD since it was released back in '94, and still remains a favorite in my collection. 16 stellar tracks, though my favs are the 80's songs from the 'What You Need' and 'Kick' albums. 'New Sensation' is my fav, 'Never Tear Us Apart' is a close 2nd. All the rest are a very close 3rd. Their style was unique, it blended different styles of music all together to make a new wave progressive rock sound. And who could forget all of their cool video's from back in the good ol' days of MTV in the late 80's. Great songs, great band. If you don't have it, you know the drill. ROCK ON!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not complete","review":"This could have been compiled a whole lot better but you will probably be forced to pick it up for now since it contains so many popular songs from a band known for their awesome singles.

From the woefully represented \\"Welcome to Wherever You Are\\" album, the tracks Not Enough Time and Taste It are missing. And from the old days, the retro classic Don't Change isn't here either ! Is this a joke ? There are way too many easily forgettable tracks here in their place. Songs like Heaven Sent and The Stairs are hardly greatest hits worthy.Also the two \\"extra\\" songs on here are horrible and were probably collecting dust in someone's closet before being pulled out to fill up some cd space.

Mr. Priestley's gift is characterization and here he takes us on a merry dance around the traps with as fell a cast as ever graced the none-too-genteel provincial stage. It is a book with laughter for itself and for its comic characters and, as always with J. B. Priestley, it has its moments of social satire in which we can all, perhaps, feel we might be at home. Like the longer, sturdier tale, \\"Good Companions,\\" \\"Lost Empires\\" will leave you on a high, having completed a very satisfactory tour of a world long vanished, but whose echoes are still recognizable today. Language and craft, satire and straight-out good fun all abound here.

Beginning in 1913 and for the most part concluding at the start of WWI a year and a half later, this story brings a by-gone era back to life and shows us how actors and actresses of the pre-film era lived, worked, and in a few memorable cases in this book, how they died as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"pond food","review":"this has a great mix for both house hold fish tanks and backyard pond fish,my fish jump out of the water for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FISHY","review":"Since the local pet stores no longer carry this product, I order it and it comes in a very timely manner and the price is good.

Hard to believe it is contemporary with its chant and canon like qualities, but the real accomplishment of the composer is that he creates such harmony and melody with dissonance and modern chord structure. This music healed every cell in my body and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that warms the heart and stills the soul","review":"Morton Lauridsen, so well known in choral circles for the beauty that he injects into his music, has combined with Stephen Layton and Polyphony to create a masterpiece. The blending of voices in this CD speaks to me as few have done lately. I first heard his O Magnum Mysterium several years ago and was touched by the awesome beauty of it. And then I found this, a gem of a CD that I will be listening to over and over. Don't take my word for it, however. Buy one, turn down the lights, light a candle and let Lauridsen's music speak to you.

Every chapter referred to his constant Hard On. Ew! In chapter after chapter of this book was the same scene played over & over, just phrased a little differently. I had to skim alot....... I felt more repulsed than drawn into the story. Sorry the book just wasn't that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE IMMORTAL HIGHLANDER","review":"I ENJOYED READING THE BOOK.

While this one was a bit shorter, it was an enjoyable book and hints of yet another sequel. I have only one small complaint regarding immortality vs mortality. Without giving away the ending, I wished the book had ended the other way than it did and I didn't like how the ending was changed for some previous characters in one of her stories, too. I hate it when immortality is portrayed as something less than desirable. It's like Moning did a complete philosophy change from her earlier books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!","review":"I loved the final book in the highlander series.

Adam Black has not been my favorite character , but boy did I ever change my mind! Have even considered reading it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't like this book","review":"Adam Black a mortal? I didn't buy it-period. As much as Adam Black loved being a \\"bad boy\\" fairy, their is no way I could believe he would become mortal by choice. Not for any reason. As much as Adam Black was interpersed throughout Moning's previous novels, I expected more of a story. This book was a disappointment. I actually returned it and got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"As someone who reads constantly, I go through phases. Currently being into romantic/erotica, and a HUGE fan of Diana Gabaldon, I took a chance on this book. The ratings were good, story line sounded promising. However, take my advice; don't buy this book!! Rarely do I give up on a book after 4 chapters, but it was so poorly written with dull, predictable characters I had no choice. If you like this, cheaper Harlequin romances should do just as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic in every way","review":"i never write reviews. but this book the immortal highlander is truly a beautiful love story. when adam black appeared first in the first book of this series i didnt like him. but by this book he is definately the most lovable of all the highlanders that came before him. and in the end his love is the truest love of all for he paid the highest price of all. everyone should read this book. i loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best yet...","review":"I've read previous books in the series, enjoying Kiss of the Highlander most, with The Dark Highlander coming in a distant second. I took a break from the series after that thinking that it had lost its spark for me. Now I regret the break! This one the best one yet... the pacing was great, and the tension between the hero and heroine was perfect. The plot was one of the author's better ones, propelling me to root for Gabby to find out where she belonged, for Adam to find his soul, and for each of them to recognize each other as their soul-mate. I usually prefer reading to listening to audiobooks, but if you've never heard this series in audio, give it a try. The voice actor is Phil Gigante - one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Really like this book.

Adam, who thought he couldn't fall in love, (The Tuatha Dé feel no emotions) meets with Gabby O' Callagahan his perfect match and he falls very hard for her. A Tuatha Dé and and a Sidhe-Seer, that seems to be immpossible, but wait till you read this book. I say only so much, the sparks are flying between these two. You will also meet some old friends, from earlier books, again in \\"The Immortal Highlander\\".\\"The Immortal Highlander\\" is a real treat and real page-turner. It's one of the best books I have read for a long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting! Need I say more?","review":"She's done it again! This was an awesome book.

Boy was I sorely disappointed. I tried my best to delve into the story but found Gabby, her abilities and Adam to be quite boring. I found myself skimming past descriptions of his pants, his life with Fae and Gabby's life as a lawyer. I couldn't make it through the end so I can't say if it got better or not. Adam's story line was so unique, I was sure that his book would have been done more justice than this. Perhaps it's time for me to move on to a different series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying, boring.","review":"I've read all of the Highlander Series up to this book and loved them all. I am still reading this one and will surely update my review when I finish, but I am so frustrated that I have to start the review now.I'm over 1/4 of the way through the book and all I'm getting is pure annoyance, especially with the main male character (Adam). I know the heroine is supposed to be annoyed by Adam, but surely we can MOVE ON ALREADY!?!? I don't care how hot he looks, Karen is making him out to be the most irritating character. Nothing sexy about this one.Agh! I want to give up on this book! So stupid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok...","review":"Not my favorite book of the series, but still a good story. The story of the feisty Gabrielle and Adam Black does introduce the Unseelie Hunters and Darroc into the storyline. Characters from the Fever series, which now I refer back to and remember that the MacKeltar clan played an important part in the storyline as well.I didn't realize these two series were intertwined, which makes me think I should reread the Fever series with the background gained in the Highlander series.

After years of being distracted from reading, this book somehow found its way into my hands. I've never been into period-type romantic fiction or magical stuff, but somehow this book is so much more than that. I read it in about 2 days and immediately sought out every one of this author's books, falling in love & speeding through them as well - wanting to know each conclusion, but not wanting it to be over. But this one is still my favorite - I adore Adam Black, the darkest Fae - I've read this book twice now & am holding back from reading it again.

This fae with human tendancies is a great leading man and you'll fall in love with him despite some of his bad boy tendencies.The only part of the story I didn't like was a twist that made Moning have to go rewrite the ending of Highlander's Touch. I understand why she did it, but fans of the series will probably be irritated by it like I was. Still it was a great story with lovable characters, including cameos from favorite characters from earlier in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy Series","review":"If you like Feehan's Dark, Hamilton's Anita, and Miller's Vamp series.....

At least I only wasted time and not money (saved money by checking it out at the library)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disapointed","review":"I was looking forward to this book after reading The Dark Highlander, I ordered it months ago. I have to say I was also disapointed.I felt it was skimpy on the pages...like about 40 pages too short and the story line felt rushed. One moment they're in NYC and then they are in Scotland. It was a lot of what my past english teachers would call 'telling not showing'. I agree with what another posted said about rushing for a deadline. I normally buy UBS and only buy hardcover if I really like the author. Next time I'll wait for used paperback on this author before buying a new hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great until the end","review":"This book was wonderful.

Now, there are many people who will relate to this book on a very base level and for that reason will recommend it and talk lovingly about it, but the writing style isn't \\"good\\" and the \\"message\\" is pathetic. Having been witness to kids much like these (and the adult's they've become), I can't even begin to tell you how disheartening it is to have to read another story about them.

As long as the printed text is good quality--which most is these days given laser printing--the Infoscan is quite accurate. The screen allows one to quickly verify accuracy, and there is an un-do button if you find you've scanned too carelessly and thereby gotten errors. Taking this tool onsite to collect data from archival records is much quicker, less of a hassle, and less disruptive (if you are collecting from someone else's files) than carrying in a laptop and typing in data. Overall, I'm very pleased with the Infoscan, and I'm surprised more folks aren't using these in research contexts. From reading online reviews, it appears some alternate models may be better for people wishing to scan full pages or large portions of text, but for small snippets and notes, the Infoscan works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble","review":"This item does work, but you have to scan very, very slowly and carefully or you end up with a garbled mess.

After buying \\"Walking Wounded\\", the only reason I had really bought \\"Amplified Heart\\" was for \\"Missing\\" and the fact that it was in the used section. And then recently I put it on from the beginning listen to it, and was very pleased. This album is near perfection. While \\"Walking Wounded\\" focus on the electronic beats sometimes muddles the emotions and lovely Tracey Thorn's voice, \\"Amplified Heart\\" shimmers acousticly. While people on these reviews seem to hate one and love another, I respect both very much. But I must say, in the end Amplified Heart is a bit superior. It's becoming one of my favourite albums.Ben Watt takes the leads on two of the best songS (Walking to You, 25th December) and Tracey mellowly brings us through the rest of the album. These are beautiful melodies people. If you're a music fan (like a crazed one haha), get this album! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better late than never.","review":"Now that this has been out for 10 years, I thought I'd pick it up. God I hate it when I miss out on something this good for so long. \\"Amplified Heart\\" is refered to as their best album, and I can easily see why. Their biggest hit \\"Missing (Todd Terry Club Mix)\\" is on here, as well as the original, and though the whole album has an electronica feel to it, it's really not. Most of the rest is just kind of smooth acoustic pop, and reminds me a bit of \\"Sade\\". Anyway, it's very pleasing to listen to, and I find her voice soothing and comforting. The two songs I currently like the most are \\"Troubled Mind\\" and \\"We Walk The Same Line\\", both done very well. This album is a must for any collection, even if you have everything but \\"Everything But The Girl\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible, a must have for lovers of music...BUY IT NOW!","review":"This is one of the few albums that I can play from start to finish. In short, it is calm enough to have on while reading an important piece, or jam too during the workout. Few albums offer that diversity but the mellow downtempo beats provided by Watt and the stirring vocals of Thorn provide an usual type of song that can evoke all sort of feeling. Best tracks on the album3. I Don't Understand Anything 5. Get Me 7. Two Star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Walking Wounded did it better","review":"The non-remixed version of Missing is one of the most touching, haunting depictions of lost love ever recorded. Alas, the rest of Walking Wounded is - despite Tracey Thorn's incredible voice and Ben Watts charming musical arrangements - uninspiring and frankly unmemorable. It lacks the lyrical bite and the slow-burning darkness that made their following album (1996's Walking Wounded) such brilliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panacea For the Broken-Hearted","review":"No one else can sound as lovelorn and earnest than the divine Tracey Thorn... Her plaintive alto voice is more emotive than the histrionics of all the screaming divas and banshees combined.While 'Missing' put them on the dance/electronica map, it's the other love songs like 'Rollercoaster', 'I Don't Understand Anything', 'Troubled Mind' and 'Get Me' that tug at the heartstrings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amplified Angst","review":"Just over a month ago, I ordered this CD from Amazon. So far, Roller Coaster and Troubled Mind are my favorite songs on this CD. They're beautiful and I listen to them repeatedly. I also listen to Get Me.

All of these songs are about the same thing, you left me, and now I'm sad. They are BORING! There is absolutely nothing to them! If you like Missing, don't buy this CD, buy one of those Dance compilations that has it. If you want some good EBTG stuff, then get Walking Wounded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever....","review":"Tracey Thorn has a great voice, but most of the lyrics are pretty much like a lot of other pop music. Aside from the mix of \\"Missing\\" there isn't much to recommend this over a lot of other really good pop. This was my first EBTG .. and probably my last. It's OK, but pretty bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amplified What?","review":"This album is pretty much known for \\"missing\\" and that's what it should be known for. It's a very good song and it's the only good song on this entire album.

It's so well written and the music and lyrics are very intelligent and creative.There is one song on here that really amazes me is the song Missing.

Go out and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of....","review":"Amplified Heart is definitely EBTGs best work.

Each song touches you in a soft spot in your heart and makes you believe that a soul can be touched through the power of music.

My buddy and I interviewed them for the college radio station we were working at and the girls were really nice. I think one of them liked me and was going to invite me and my buddy for a late night breakfast at Denny's. But the damn road manager squelched the invite. I think the bass player liked my stupid new wave haircut. In this regard, I wish they would've been more like the Go Go's.

This book amoung other things claims that satan doesn't really exist, and is just another side of the almighty God.I assure you satan does exist, and is going to be shortly bound a thousand years. This isn't a Christian book.Which is too bad, because it takes away from Charles Shultz own Christian cartoons, and in particular the much beloved Christmas special, A Peanuts Christmas.I suggest getting that video, and ignoring this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another below average album","review":"Nu-metal sucks and is dead as is rap and grunge but this album is just a below average album from and below average band.

However, the first track \\"Dig Me Up To Bury Me\\" is extremely fast. New drummer Craig Nelson, replacing a tired Kelly David Smith was a step forward in the right direction. Perhaps Metallica should consider replacing Lars. His drumming technique has reached new standards of being \\"tired\\". Ed Carlson is ripping leads again as opposed to the last several albums and A.K is singing with more passion than ever before.Most impressive of all, is their ability to remain creative in a stylistic and studio engineering point of view. See tracks like \\"Trash\\" and \\"My God\\". While sticking to their original roots, they were able on this album to keep from sounding repetitous and contrived.I'm not sure if the other guy from San Francisco even bothered to listen to the album. He doesn't seem to make a great deal of sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrashin it Flotsam Style!!!!!","review":"I just want to say first off that I\`ve been a Flots fan since way back and these guys never dissapoint. What we have here is yet another solid mix of mature, moody yet heavy as hell metal. These guys have always had the knack for creating super catchy hooks and memorible riffs. You will find them in spades on this record. The production is also top notch.The standout tracks to me are \\"Dig me up to Bury Me\\", \\"Camera Eye\\" and my personal favorite \\"Trash\\". (Which by the way is also included as an acustical bonus track). I really like the two newer members Mark Simpson & Craig Neilson because they seem to add some new kick to the already solid songwriting tandom of Erick A.K. ( Always Awesome!! but, who I might add also sounds better than he has in the past few releases) Jason B. Ward who is waaay too underated and original guitarist Ed Carlson. For everyone or anyone into what real metal is. Come and Get it!!!!! You wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of F&J's best CDs!","review":"I've been waiting for album for a long time and it's received a lot of hype lately. All I can say is that it lives up to the hype and more. This album isn't like their last (Unnatural Selection), it's more like some of their older stuff. Some of the songs on here are just so heavy and brutal, only Flotsam and Jetsam could pull it off. Eric's voice is stronger and better than ever. F&J need to make it big and this is their perfect chance. I recommend you buy this album if your a fan and even if you've never heard them before, I know you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Times on Planet Earth","review":"I am touched at the Poet's combination of style of music to the tone of his poems. His poetry is deep, reflective, heart opening and soul touching. Surely a poet for the new millenium as we are all indeed experiencing \\"Hard times on planet Earth\\". I feel the poet's compassion and love for humankind encompassing our vulnerabilities and strengths. Truly a master of emotion. I look forward to more of this artist's work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could take it back","review":"Since this was recommended by a guy who worked in the paint and stain department at a local Menards, I thought great! Now, not so much. First, once you assemble the pole attachment it doesn't come apart again...I had to call Wagoner to find this out. So much for easy storage. And that fancy little brush that's attached for the purpose of getting in between the deck boards? Forget about it--because it doesn't. The flow knob works okay, but you have to constantly adjust it and more importantly remember to close it. This product is really just kind of a pain. A regular paint pad on an extension pole would work just as well and not cost as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"We bought one over the weekend and while my husband was using it the handle snapped (where the metal meets the stain bin) and pinched his finger, ripping the tip almost off. We ended up at the hospital and 6 stitches later, I had to finish with a brush. Not worth the price or the hassle. Plus, Wagner customer service won't even talk to us! I wouldn't even give this 1 star!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuts staining time in half","review":"I purchased the DeckMate to stain a new deck and am so glad I did. It cut my work time in half. You have to treat this 'tool' carefully, almost like one of those Swiffer wet mops you use inside, if you manhandle it, it will break. The flow adjustment took some getting used to, either too much stain came out, or too little. I bought an extra pad just in case but didn't have to use it. The deck is 16 x 16 and 6 x 8. Will definately be using it again in the fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wagner took my money and wasted my time, shame!","review":"Bought this at Menards, it's a piece of junk! Seriously do not purchase it. Frustrating regulating flow besides the control being in an awkward place. Used it by letting some stain out than shutting off and dipping it in a tray of stain, pad was showing signs of wear after a 3' x 15' area. Ended up using a roller made of foam for textured ceilings, attached to a broom handle, worked nice(the roller) still went between boards and evened it out and worked it in with a brush, did this with DeckMate also. And the brush to go between boards on the pad did not work so good and got in the way. Never even wasted mineral spirits to clean it, its garbage. I do and have done a lot of painting and staining in my life, and will never buy another Wagner product. Wish I had read reviews here before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheated","review":"Seemed like great idea when I read the catalog description.I suspected that there were going to be problems when I saw the warning not to move the valve setting until the \\"tool\\" was assembled.That was confirmed when the valve assembley and spring fell on the floor when I took that section out of the box.Never did get it to work properly. Gave up and finished with a brush.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you can have mine","review":"I never actually used the deckmate. I followed all directions and could not get the stain to flow to the pad. I called customer service and was instructed to press the tank all the way down the pole- there is no reference to this in the directions. The girl at customer service told me it had been a long time since she had read the manual. I was able to push the tank down but this takes a great deal of force. I tried it with water and did get a flow. I wish this was all in the manual because I had already applied the stain with a brush at this point and spent less time applying the stain by brush than the time I spent fooling around with the deckmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is one of the worst products I have ever tried to use. Semi-transparent stain clogged the feed tube within 2 minutes of the first filling. And it leaks. Save yourself the aggrivation and just plan to use a brush."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This thing is useless. It only works on horizontal surfaces since it is gravity fed. Also stain just seem to run out of this thing the flow control is very difficult to get just right. I wasted half a gallon of $30.00 dollar stain before I tossed it into a garbage and went back to brush and roller. I would not buy this product again or any paint allocation product from Wagner since quality and good engineering are lacking in their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This DVD was the same company as one we already own for our office and when this one and the TropicalJungle came they are both of terrible picture quality.

Jim was in the process of finishing the manuscript for this outstanding book in which he shares many life changing moments with his five unusual friends. Jim delightfully reminds us of his firsthand experiences with them. Throughout the book, he gives us a clear understanding of how these historical icon friends impacted his life. Each of them, 'The Uncommon Friends,' had high standards of personal and business ethics. Reading the book is a flash back in American history. You may have heard some of these stories previously. But they were secondhand. Now you can read in his book as Mr. Newton relates many of these firsthand, intimate moments with Edison, Ford, Firestone, Lindbergh and Carrel.

Nevertheless it was working.But in the end my hopes were dashed. After 4 months, the black ink prints with large streaks through it, even with a brand new ink cartridge.

When I called Garmin they told me that their cartographic dept. was aware of the problem, and ascribed it to \\"map digitization\\" problems.

The MapSource Topo US 2008 software showed an offset error of about 800 feet. Google earth showed it dead on (so I knew it wasn't a problem with the GPS unit itself).

The resolution in the newer (24k) maps is better, more like what you get with USGS 7.5' quad maps/NG Topo/DeLorme Topo.Note that Garmin products purchased for one GPS unit can NOT be transferred to a new/replacement unit (except by Garmin via warranty replacement). Garmin's anti-piracy \\"unlock\\" procedure is archaic and tedious. If you ever upgrade your Garmin, you must buy your maps again.

I admit that I have not spent much time with this so far, but my initial impression is pretty bad. Until I ordered this product, I had been driving around San Diego, recording my tracks. When I loaded this product, I was startled to see how far off my tracks are in some places from the roads indicated on the map. For example, the east end of Sorrento Valley Blvd is pretty good. The west end of this road appears in this map a full 1000 feet (Yes. One thousand!) to the south of the actual road! It's not like there is an overall shift of coordinates or anything like that. The roads are right in some places, and then just wander off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roads are not accurate","review":"I purchased this map to update the maps that came on my Garmin GPS. The original maps had roads that have not been updated in 20+ years. When I added the new map I learned that the local roads are inaccurate by 400 to 600 feet. I asked Garmin and was told that roads are just for reference. This map is only good for Topo and little else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great software","review":"I just got my first GPS, a hand held version (Garmin) in the fall and planned on using it mostly for hiking. I needed Topo information for the mountains I hike and this software is working very nicely for me. I would give it a 5 except that I have found several flaws in the road layouts and it has no trails in the Catskill Mountains of New York. I have used it hiking in the Catskills, the Grand Canyon, and in the Mojave preserve in CA with good results. It helps you see where you have been as well as you progress when traveling. I also use it considerably more often while driving and other then a handful of roads displayed incorrectly both in New Jersey and California it's been great for finding locations and for seeing where I've been. I also ran into a few shortcomings with regards to routing to locations but I don't know if that's an issue of this software or the GPS but it sometimes suggests routs that are not possible because the roads don't have an exit or similar errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin Topo US 2008","review":"Garmin Topo US 2008 is a big disappoint. I have owned and used Garmin United States Topo for quite a few years and often wondered when Garmin would announce a new Topo product. Unfortunately Topo US 2008 is not much different than their old version. The terrain shading (only viewed on your computer, not on your Garmin Unit) is the only difference I can see, with the exception of a few more trails and roads added in (though still missing many other topographical points).If you already own Garmin's older version of United States Topo don't bother purchasing Topo 2008 unless you really need \\"Terrain Shading\\".If you don't own a previous version of US TOPO then I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of details","review":"Simply put it, there isn't enough details to do much with it. It is slightly better than the base map. Go to the Garmin's web site and do a side by side comparison of this one and the 24K topo series. You'll see how bad this one is.Garmin, stop sell us maps like this one. All your topo maps should have the 24K details. Otherwise, what's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin 2008 software","review":"I was concerned about the 2008 Garmin edition of MapSource Topo. I have the previous edition. Apparently they have not updated the map detail in keeping with the regular updates done by the USGS. I called National Geographic about their Topo!GPS maps USA that are on a state by state basis but are 1:24,000 and are very detailed. You cannot transfer these maps to any Garmin unit as Garmin is very proprietary. You can transfer waypoints and POI's but not the maps. However National Geographic told me they have just completed arrangements with Magellan that will allow transfer of their 7.5 maps to the new Triton GPS that will become availabe in the near future. So their is still hope for better mapping but this will require purchase of a Magellan unit.LJB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless if you have Garmin street maps","review":"I had heard that this is a useful complement to the Garmin US Street Maps. My view is that is us useless as a companion. Huge amount of memory is taken up on the street maps, which are redundant if you have City Navigator NT. Then, the scale of the topo maps (1:100,000) turns out to be useless for hiking purposes. This was just a mistake to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin TOPO Software, terrible for Geocaching","review":"This software is semi-useless for Geocaching (and probably other useage). Many major highways 5-6 years old are not included. In an expanding urban enviornmental area, few things added or changed in the past 5 years are included. I often find muself driving down the middle of someone's cornfield, according to TOPO U.S. 2008. A big waste of money, as far as I am concerned. Since, unfortunately, you are stuck with Garmin, for mapping software, pay the extra and get Streets and trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOPO Map for Garmin","review":"I am new to the GPS hobby, as a walker/hiker/biker, and wanted to upgrade both my GPS inventory of tools, and my skill using them. I have the Garmin GPSMAP 60, and needed some mapping software to use with it. The TOPO is as it is advertised: a US Continental map, loaded with information, color, symbols, menus, and mapping tools. It is overwhelming at times, but still very interesting to use. I find the lack of drop down menus, to assist the ham-handed rookies among us, to be needed. I often find myself asking,\\"Why does it do that?\\". It is possible to switch back and forth between your GPS and the laptop, which makes the whole operation seem surrealistic. It is truly like living in the future. I am still jazzed by this purchase, and often just look at the maps because they are cool to look at. You can have a lot less fun and spend a whole lot more money. This is a good deal, and you may even learn something about maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Topo 2008 a Nice Upgrade","review":"I have found this new version of the Garmin Topo maps to be an improvement over the older version....more detail, especially.

The installation was straightforward, but quite time consuming. The problem seems to be with the accuracy of the roads on the map. The vessel is almost always way off the road -- probably 30 to 50 feet. Sometimes so far off that it is difficult to tell which street it is on. I called Garmin and they said that this is normal (???) I tried the Garmin City Navigator maps on this unit and they are spot on. The Garmin consultant said that the Topo 24K maps are as well, but I have no experience with these. So, I would say this is a questionable product, not up to any reasonable standard of accuracy. If you are interested in off-road usage for your GPS, you might look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garmin update a waste of money.","review":"I used to like my Garmin, that is until I updated it.

Since I am currently residing in Arizona, I use the updated program with a GPSmap 60CSx for hikes in the State. I had hoped the new version would improve on the shortcomings of the previous version where lots of well-documented trails/hikes were missing. Not so.

I would not recommend this program to any serious hiker.Claus Pohl"},{"rating":"1","title":"no trails","review":"Bought this product for hiking and following trails in the northwest.

The Pacific Crest Trail and any trails in Forest Park are not on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Topo US 2008","review":"Better than the previous, but still lacking when compared to USGS TOPO. Why don't GARMIN include the navigation (ability to track your route via computer and GPS) ability on their map products free? I use both GARMIN and USGS TOPO to plan routes and establish waypoints. This is because I have two GARMIN GPS's and they only take GARMIN maps for uploads. I can upload waypoints and routes from the others, but not their detailed maps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product For Hikers","review":"This product is great for hikers, but I wish Garmin would combine the TOPO map software with the City Navigator Software, so those of us who like to drive and hike don't have to drop $200 and use two software packages. Regardless, it's great. It has a up to date street map and good TOPO information. I was disappointed that it didn't show hiking trails in my local area. I'll have to get separate paper maps for that I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an accurate map at all.","review":"This map is just not trust worthy. It's pity that Garmin makes good GPS but when you plot the recorded tracks over it's map, the two produce such a discrepancy that makes you wonder if it's the map or the GPS devices at fault. Then you map the track logs on Google Earth, you realize the GPS devices is not at fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this TOPO!","review":"Been used to Delorme Topo.. Only got this because I had to have it with my Garmin GPS-60 hand held.. Very poor trails.. hard to tell anything.. Trails , gradients etc all look alike.. when they are there at all.. I read reviews and they were not good, but thought they were not right or this bad. Lots of 5,600 foot hills with not any gradients shown at all.. Maybe be great for some places, but in Four Corners USA, this product is pretty much useless. It may be Okay back East or where ever.. I wish I had never went with Garmin as it now all sets at home unusable to me.GO WITH ANOTHER BRAND.. I now am doing the DeLorme TOPO 7.0 USA And very pleased with it over the Garmin GPS-60 product.. This Hand held also requires you to purchase the TOPO software that does not even come with it. And it is POOR.My Advice.. Waste of money.. AVOID! Much better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior to competitiors products from four years ago.","review":"I recently switched from a Magellan Sportrak to Garmin Legend HCx GPS. I bought the corresponding Topo Map- Garmin Mapsource Topo U.S. 2008. While the contours are reasonable, the integration of the roads into the map is simply ridiculous. On a recent walk I took, it shows my track crossing a road that in reality I never get within 1/3 of a mile of. The actual road layout looked like they are from at least 10 years ago in my area. For curiosity I dug out my 2004 Magellan Topo 3D and plotted the same track. The information was correct. So as long as you have no need of how the terrain and roads are interrelated, this product is fine. But for those of us that do occasionally drive to a trail, or want to reach a civilized place while on a hike this product is of dubious value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks sufficient detail for hiking/backpacking","review":"In theory, you can use this product to download waypoints, an entire route, or even a topographic map to your Garmin mapping GPS. However, the maps are so lacking in detail that they are nearly useless for hiking or backpacking. For one thing, vertical contours are 150 feet each, compared with 40 feet for typical topographic maps. Contour lines, roads, and trails all look pretty similar to one another, and are really hard to view.The interface is really easy to use -- it took almost no time to figure out how to import and export maps and waypoints. However, the program has a very definite Windows 95 look with really simple graphics and colors.It's amazing that Garmin has created a line of terrific mapping GPS units, but then left out the maps. The bottom line is that there are currently no good options for getting detailed topo maps onto your garmin mapping GPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software bugs fatal; BEWARE","review":"Simply unable to transfer any useful data to Garmin etrex vista. Software surprisingly useless. Tried many ways to modify parameters both with the unit and download wizard and this software seems to always end in \\"communication error\\" which is disappointing after a long download. Attempting to download for the Topo US 2008 CD also erases the database that comes on the unit!!!

The maps that come with the etrek are woefully deficient and you need to upgrade them. But even these maps could be more detailed especially for the hiker or geocacher. For topographical maps, these are not very detailed and if you want to route plan cross country you will need much more detailed maps.

There is not a single white page in this book; EVERYTHING is illustrated. This book is literally stuffed with watercolor / professional colored pencil illustrations, dragon lore drawn from history, mythology, and classical literature, secret codes, riddles, just all sorts of cool stuff. The cover is red pleather with a foil emboss of a dragon and a celtic design. There are even recipes for draconic \\"spells\\", and instructions on how to handle diplomatic dealings with them.

Many of the songs are severely edited. Santana's wonderful \\"Soul Sacrifice\\" is greatly shortened (you can get the full complete performance on the 30th anniversary CD of Santana's debut album), as well as Ten Years After's amazing performance of \\"I'm Going Home\\". \\"I'm Going Home\\" was MUCH longer than the version that's on this CD. They completely butchered a classic performance.I really can't recommend this CD, it could have been so much more. They could have at least included the complete songs without editing them so drastically. It would have been much better as a 2-disc set. I have to give them kudos for including Richie Havens and Canned Heat, though.If you want the best of Woodstock, then the 4-disc Woodstock box set would be your best bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut Rate Copy","review":"Great songs, lousy recording.

On a technical level this CD is sloppy at times, but the overall effect is wonderful and makes one yearn for more. Pop music has become so lame and such a forum for people who have no talent outside of studio and the effects that can be produced with electronics that it makes one yearn for a time when true talent and musicianship were all that was necessary for an intense musical experience.

However, as it claims to be a science book for children, it would have been nice if the 'facts' presented in this book bore some passing resemblance to scientifically accepted thought. This book contains several errors. For example, the author is mistaken in the time periods in which humans and dinosaurs exist, the amount of time it takes for a fossil to form and in the diet of certain dinosaurs. Knowledge of general geology and biology/anatomy is sufficient to discover this book is riddled with error and inconsistency.

There are no facts from either scientific or religious sources to back up any of the outrageous claims that Mr. Taylor -- a man who obviously has no expierence or knowledge of dinosaurs, biology, geology, evolution, history, or Christianity -- presents here.

Everything about it is great. That's about as much as I can elaborate. Just listen to it yourself so you can get your own impression. \\"Army Ants\\" is another edgy song and the opening reminds me of something that Joe Satriani would do. Again, don't ask me why. Last but not least, there is a hilarious bonus track which is on a few minutes after the last song. It reminds me of Monty Python. I think they mixed up the titles on this album.

I remember some line in track 7: \\"save the pig with a dime.\\" What is this? This is crazy. I liked Interstate Love Song. It displayed some inventiveness. Big Empty was an excellent song.

One other noteworthy song is the acoustic \\"Pretty Penny.\\" These songs are good, the CD is pretty decent over all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alt-rock CLASSIC","review":"This CD complements the STP sound that came out with 'Core' - the songs here are intense, quirky, rockin, mellow - yet they all blend into one of the best alternative rock CD's of the 90's BY FAR.'Interstate Love Song' is simply classic, 'Meatplow' is a great aural infusion of heavy-alt, 'Vasoline' takes us to a new level of upbeat alt, 'Pretty Penny' eeks out a folky-intense sound, and 'Big Empty' is a wild combo of chord-crashing and mellow interludes that has found it's way to alt-rock station's playlist (what a feat!). What is it all up? Simply a mix of a lot of musical styles that blend well together into a great CD - we are not talking anything TOO weirdly diverse - just a CD that weaves lots of different styles together into a definitive alternative rock that doesn't do the simple '2 hard ones, 1 soft one' formula. You just have to hear it to believe it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The second album","review":"Although Core had been consistent enough, STP only came into their own with the follow up, which has a little more fun by adding a little more psychedelics, a little less straightforward power chord crunch, and a lot of subtly effective songwriting enhancements to produce what is rightfully referred to as their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album !","review":"STP continued their high songwritting/playing standards in this 1994 album, their second effort following their big hit album CORE.Actually all their albums preceding the departure of vocalist/lyricist Scott Weiland (to be a member of Velvet Revolver for a couple of albums)are consistently very good R'n'R albums with the occasional ballad.You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"STP completely revamp their entire sound","review":"Nothing like their 1992 release with Core but equally as good, the distorted riffs are toned down on this album and Weiland sings in a totally different style, a true testiment to his abilities as a vocalist, often agreed by many to be their best album, Purple is an alt-rock classic and one of the most creative records of the 90's, songs like Vasoline and the always amazing Interstate Love Song, which everyone likes, fan of the group or not remain radio staples today, even the lesser known songs easily could have been singles. How the beautiful \\"Still Remains\\" never became a single will continue to baffle me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique","review":"STP could have been a major force and the standard by which all other bands should be judged. Instead, given the problems of the band, we have flashes of brilliance and this disc has them like their other works.There are very few songs that always put a smile on my face but 'Interstate Love Song' does. I have never tired of it even close to 10 years later. Classic disc that everyone should own."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Bombfire boy' was right","review":"I cannot beleive people liked this album,'You have to wonder when everyone is giving a CD 5 stars, and then 1 person gives it a 1 star.'Said one review.The person gave it one star was right, this is a poor album. Just because he was outnumbered, it does not mean he was wrong. When Christopher Columbus said the world was round, everyone disagreed. When Charles Darwin said that we evolved from ape like creatures, most people laughed at him. But now we accept their theories to be true!As for those of you intent on taunting 'bombfire boy', he may mis-spell the odd word, but hey, you bought this album, you make him look like a real Genius!Death to grunge!

However, upon further listening, I found that each and every song was brilliant in its own way. From the hard-edged, organized insanity of songs like \\"Army Ants,\\" \\"Meatplow,\\" and \\"Vasoline,\\" STP goes into softer territory with \\"Big Empty,\\" and \\"Pretty Penny.\\" There's something for everybody out there. If at first you only like a couple of songs, force yourself to listen to the whole CD--you will love it! Oh, and don't forget the secret song after #11 (\\"Kitchenware and Candy Bars\\")-it's hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is one of the best rock CDs of all-time","review":"The album purple rocks the whole way through with grinding ballads like \\"Vaseline\\" and one of the best songs written. (Interstate love song). This album which debuted at #1 in 1994 goes beyond the boundries of grunge with its 12 gracious melodies. The foursome stands above the rest with this masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Well, i'd say that this album is very good, but i have to be in the perfect mood to listen to it.

Everyone has different music opinions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"You have to wonder when everyone is giving a CD 5 stars, and then 1 person gives it a 1 star.

This is a really good CD, I recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough time has offically passed. The dust is settled. And this is a classic album.","review":"It's good to see decent \\"modern\\" rock albums like this one are still getting some play.

Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh Sounding","review":"Fresh sounding and good songwriting. Heavy songs with good hooks. I wish that more bands would incorporate good melodies into their songwriting these days.Beatles and Stones influences abound here.The drummer is excellent. No frills, just great timekeeping. That's the mark of a great drummer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good listenin'","review":"Each STP album sounds a little different than the other, yet somehow they all sound the same. Interesting. Anyway, \\"Purple\\" is a fine album. Songs like \\"Meatplow\\", \\"Lounge Fly\\", and \\"Unglued\\" are awesome, and they keep that hard rock feeling essential to their first album. Other songs, such as \\"Interstate Love Song\\", and \\"Big Empty\\"(one of their best)are great and are very straight-forward tunes, and some of the most memorable of the 90's, and \\"Pretty Penny\\" displays a little classic rock in it, possibly a little CSN? As for the other songs, they are also good, and the album is very eclectic. Also, the secret song is pretty funny: I think it's called \\"12 Gracious Melodies\\", but it's from some other artist, I don't know, now I'm just getting confusing oh, well. Buy the album anyway, it's worth it.

I purchased it to match the two couches you can barely see in the background of the photo in this selection. The design on the wood is quite eliquent and definitely belongs in the home of any fellow lover of classic furniture.The only quam I have with this table thus lowering it to a four star is, it is quite larger than the picture shows and has picture only instructions for assembly (one page). I almost broke the table attempting to install the bottom shelf. After some great pondering and several different attempts, I found the best solution was to keep all the legs loose and slide the shelf from the top down when the table is upside down (Believe me, at first your going to think that the wood isn't cut right, but it is. The bottom shelf does fit in there.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This is a very inexpensive combination, but you get what you pay for.I really bought it for the tripod, so I can't complain too much, and the tripod itself is moderate...

I sent it two months ago and I haven't receive any money back. I also bought Wolfang's 1.6 HP power blender in HSN and stop working after 5 months. Wolfang Puck's products are pure garbage. I would not recomend wolfang's appliances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen necessity","review":"I bought this grill 2 years ago from a TV shopping channel.I have used it 4-5 times a week and it is still in great condition.I use it for pancakes,french toast,grilled sandwiches,steaks,kebabs,fish and so much more.Everything tastes like it was grilled outdoors and burgers and steaks are juicy and not dried out.I don't find the drip pan an issue as some reviewers have but I do check its position under the drainage holes before I grill anything greasy.Storage is not a problem as the grill is quite light weight and I keep mine on top of my refrigerator.Clean up is very easy. I just use a plastic scrubber and a little dish soap.If my Wolfgang Puck grill stopped working tomorrow,I would have to get another right away. I consider it a kitchen necessity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was very disappointed in this product. The main problem I had was that it smoked up my entire house when I cooked bacon. I removed the bacon, and the smoke was so bad, I had to open all the doors and windows so it wouldn't set the fire alarm off. I was using the temp listed in the manual for bacon. I lowered the temp and the smoke still occurred.One of the reasons I bought this griddle/grill was because it was dishwasher safe as I hate washing dishes. I was very disappointed when I discovered that it was to long to fit in the dishwasher and I had to wash it by hand.It is ok for making some things such as grilled cheese sandwiches, but the overall hassle/annoyance factor isn't worth it.

It goes into a lot of details on very simple calculations and manages to make them seem more complex than they actually are. This is sepecially true in the first chapter on interest rates.When it comes into advanced topics, there is a lot of hand waving and pulling of critical results from nothing. Worse is the fact that when these handwaving occurs, the reader is not informed.The authors also tend to over simplify advanced topics and do not ensure a consistent notation. People should not depend on this book to build their foundation in financial maths as you would pick up a lot of misconceptions that will hinder understanding of more advanced topics later. This book serves best as a collection of formulae in basic financial maths that you can refer to when you can't remember a formula.Both the CFA notes and IOA notes on quant do a much better job of explaining financila maths compared to this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quant for 'non-quants'","review":"This book targets readers who have little or no familiarity with statistics and calculus (or who, like me, has forgotten much of these two disciplines.

This video has pretty simple songs that go along with each type of baby animal. As an adult, I find the songs a little silly but easy to remember and sing along with. The main point is that my daughter enjoys them quite a bit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun videos of real animals","review":"My 22 month-old really enjoys all the video of the zoo animals. There are many close-up shots and a large variety of animals. This video is mostly shots of the animals with some overlay of the Baby Genius cartoon characters- not the quick switching back and forth between real and cartoon images of the Favorite Songs video- a quality that I think improves this video.The songs however are not quite enjoyable or memorable- only one has stuck in my head. They consist of verses about the animals set to popular children's tunes- not bad, but not astoundingly great. The worth of this video is in the videos of the animals. If your child, like mine, is in love with all animals I would recommend this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Disposable Blades","review":"I use these blade in my Orchid seed germination lab.

The video vignettes give meaning and life to Lily's amazingly developed characters and their activities. She must be in good shape because she never gets out of breath as Chrissy - a participant in an aerobics class who gives a non-stop monologue as she exercises.It does get a bit long - but it's worth it.

While the two ladies battled for surpremecy at the top of the charts, they both belted out many a great tune. The only difference is that Ms. Gibson wrote her the majority of her own material, and what a fantastic job she did. Many of her hits include \\"Electric Youth,\\" \\"Only In My Dreams,\\" and \\"Out of the Blue,\\" all included here. As well the beautiful piano piece \\"Lost In Your Eyes,\\" my fav, is found here as well. This greatest hits package covers her first three albums and is an excellent showcase of her early career.

Her hits: SHAKE YOUR LOVE, FOOLISH BEAT, OUT OF THE BLUE, LET'S STAY TOGETHER, ONLY IN MY DREAMS, LOST IN YOUR EYES, ELECTRIC YOUTH, and NO MORE RHYME made me feel good and her singing and songwriting talents are proof. Most of all, she is courageous enough to branch into Broadway music and perform American standards. Debbie Gibson is not only a great singer of the 80's but her songs transcends her time on the charts. Debbie is a close second in the list of my favorite female singers all time; only the equally transcendent Petula Clark from the 60's is a notch higher but Gibson's singing is still something to treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"talented 80s teen pop princess","review":"Of the teen pop stars in the 80s, Debbie Gibson was my favorite.

Many times it is very difficult to obtain specifics on an engine. An example is, they may mention the 3.0L and not he 3.8L which leaves you many times guessing about the location of a sensor or a wire harness.

I don't see these people or the dull landscape (or if it's not dull, then I don't see that either), nothing. There is no pace in this plot, no intensity, no dynamics.

That means she spends half her time looking down at the \\"trailer trash\\" surroundings of her Syracuse, New York neighborhood and the other half feeling guilty about how her family poisoned the environment and exploited the region's labor pool to make its millions.

I read until the end cause the author of my favorite sociopath, Jack Reacher, cheered for the book. I read the glowing reviews and I shake my head.

Yes, Madeline Dare is whiney and snarky and intensely unhappy living in Syracuse. But this isn't the fault of Syracuse, and Madeline knows this. She's the sort of person who is going to have a hard time being happy regardless of geography. And I think as the book progresses she figures this out.That being said, I liked \\"Field Of Darkness\\".

While the author did occasionally show some flair for writing witty sentences and funny descriptive phrases, I found all of the characters unbelievable and unsympathetic, and their motivations completely unconvincing. The real teller of how self-consciously congratulatory this book is appears at the back, where the edition I read actually had readers' group's discussion questions included! REALLY? For something as shallow and frivolous as this debut novel, soaked in blood and gruesomeness? And of course, all this horrible stuff happens to her while her husband is away and unreachable (hence the placing of the action in the pre-cell phone days!), and no one thinks to have the heroine go stay with someone to keep her safe? Or to accompany her when she places herself in ridiculously dangerous situations for no reason? Self-indulgent, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Obviously a Beginner-Writer","review":"As with so many inexperienced writers, this novel gives away a lot more about the writer than the written-about. Hopefully, Ms. Read's personality is not as harsh as her semi-autobiographical writing would imply. The plot was workable, the protagonist credible (if a bit obnoxious) but the rest of the characters were portrayed negatively. Also, 6 pages of the author's autobiography - complete with pictures - was more than I wanted to know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manipulated and Loving It","review":"The Last Time They Met manipulates the reader. Fortunately, in this case, I really ENJOYED being manipulated. While I was reading it, I was aware that the story was being told in reverse but could't understand why--until the end. Although I was generally enjoying it throughout, the surprise ending enhanced my experience and elevated my ultimate opinion of the book. Yeah, I guess you could say it was gimicky, but it worked for me. I certainly thought about the book a lot after I finished it, which I cannot say about most books, and one of the things that stayed with me the most is that, after finishing it, I realized that the main character was someone completely different. Ha-ha!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this before Weight of Water","review":"Although this is the most recent of Shreve's books, I recommend reading it BEFORE her earlier WEIGHT OF WATER.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Time I Will Read Anita Shreve","review":"Self absorbed, poignant, pretentious, plenty of Catholic angst, details that move boringly slow, nuance in the mundane - not at all my kind of book. Linda is a woman who seems to have given up on life when she hit middle age, who orders food over and over again to not eat it. She meets a former lover at a literary convention, and maybe things will pick up? [Hint: don't count on it.] In hindsight, the italicized speech and italicized thoughts make a little more sense - but were annoying and rather affected. And, yes, the ending is a very contemptible, condescending trick and renders the book insignificant."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I am an avid Anita Shreve fan but unlike the other reviewers of The Last Time They Met, I was very disappointed in her latest effort. I actually enjoyed the book (although less so than many of her other novels) until I got to the end. The ending, though, was so contrived and so gimmicky, it ruined the book for me. It insults the reader's intelligence. Plus, is \\":A Novel\\" really necessary?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning ending...and wonderful story!","review":"I won't give away any of the plot devices that Anita uses.

Sometimes you can't undersand the plot due to the long sentences with strange constructions. The love story is such that you feel the ache of the characters. But why the ending? Nowhere does it explain this. It doesn't fit the story at all. And you wait until the last paragraph to get it. Is a sad book and you never really feel happiness. Drags you down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending Felt Like a Cheap Trick","review":"I loved \\"Strange Fits of Passion\\", and was looking forward to this book as my second date with Anita Shreve. However, I was very disappointed. I liked it enough going along to overlook certain problems, such as the only-somewhat-believable passion between the protagonists and the occasionally-unrealistic dialogue. However, at the very end of this book, information is revealed that pulls the rug out from under the whole rest of the story. The ending wound up feeling to me like a gimmick.I tried for several days to ponder it, but could never fully make sense of the story. Did Thomas really go to Africa? really marry Regina? if so, what really broke them up? etc etc I think I vaguely understand what she may have been trying to do here, but it just didn't work for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, Anita, you can do better than this!","review":"While Anita Shreve's prose is always haunting and lyrical, her use of a manipulative plot device leaves one not breathless, but infuriated. I have been a fan of Shreve's for years, and when she is good, no one does it better. This book, however, is a huge disappointment. Perhaps she is being rushed to press. Perhaps she simply underestimates her audience. Whatever the reason, this reader was both and annoyed and irritated with Ms. Shreve for so hackneyed and trite an ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a stupid book","review":"This book was very easy to put down. I only read to the end of it just because once I start something, I don't quit. I kept reading other books in between, it was that tedious. There were parts that were extremely boring that you really wanted to skip over them. The ending, well, you felt like you had just wasted your entire reading time because none of it really happened. What a poor jokester this author is. No one imagines all of their future that will never be as their life flashes before their eyes in the moments before death.What did someone say about it being reminscent of the shower scene after the entire season of Dallas after Bobby was shot? Well, they described it well.

I even checked to see the copyright years on both books - 2001.I thought the story moved very slowly, and I too, as mentioned in other reviews, had little sympathy for Thomas. I didn't like his character very much at all. The teenage romance hardly seemed as deep and long-lasting as the beginning of the book described. And I saw the \\"uncle\\" story coming a mile away. Of course, I didn't predict the ending, but then I just read nearly the exact same ending in \\"Atonement\\" so I was hardly astonished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Trite","review":"This book is so boring... You're led to believe that there is essence in the endless details, and so you trudge forward. Eventually, you determine to finish the book only because of how far in you've gotten; however, by the end of the book, you're sorely disatisfied. It reminds me of every time a lousy movie ends with the character waking up, only to realize they dreamed the whole thing. The audience is supposed to be shocked, but most of the time, we're just miffed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Dallas - the dream","review":"I think this author got tired of writing the story and decided to end it in a quick bizarre way. I was warned about the bizarre ending but I read the book through to the last page and was astounded by how she ended the story. It's the first book I've read by this author and it will be the last. I don't always ask for a happy ending but this ending left me feeling I wasted my time reading the book.

I actually liked this novel until the ending. I don't want to give it away, but it seems to me unfair to have the 312 pages that have gone before completely overturned by the final page. Writers should not set out to deceive readers unfairly. Yes, Thomas and Linda have a beautiful relationship, and Shreve writes with evocative images, a taut plot (even if a few too many coincidences), and terrific scenes--especially in Kenya. But the ending undermines all that has gone before. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dallas Revisited","review":"Remember the season of the old TV show Dallas that turned out to be just a dream? Remember how it seemed like a total cop out? Well, that's a good comparison to the ending of this book. I've read most of her other books and enjoyed all, except for Fortunes Rocks.

Turns out to be the latter. SLIGHT SPOILER WARNING!!! ahead--> I didn't really like the ending, for the reason that, if a person is going to imagine a whole life for herself, why wouldn't it be a happy one? I needed that to be shown, not just taken for granted. Was the author trying to say that the girl's background prevented her from imagining happiness, even at the moment of death? There was nothing really said about it, but it was the major plot device. So I found it unsatisfying, and the writing kind of mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this book","review":"As soon as I read the last page of this book....I was angry.

I had thought it so very good, beautifully written and cleverly structured. The sections on Africa were truly well-done and enlightening. And then came the end. I don't believe I have ever been so angry with a book--with an author. My face actually burned. To me, the ending cheapened the entire work. It was NOT clever. And no, it is not that we always have to have a happy ending. I wept at the end of Cold Mountain but know that book could not have ended any other way. I would love to hear what must have been some very interesting discussions between the author and her editor. It takes so long to write a book. You care about it, you're with the characters and the story every single day. And then to do this? As if it has all been a trick, a joke?

She is merely mentioned in passing... \\"she is somewhere in Australia\\".His wife in this book --who surely everyone hates-- is Regina, not Jean.Any one who can actually follow this story will be not just disappointed by it's ending but disgusted by it's artifice and completely uncalled for dishonesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Time","review":"I wish I had read the reviews of the readers from Portland, OR and Mississippi before I paid good money for this book. What a waste of my time! Can someone please explain what this book was about? After reading the ending I have no idea. Plus, Thomas and Linda are not particularly likable people.

I agree w/ the reader who recommended reading the last chapter 1st. In fact, one could read ONLY the last chapter and then NOT go back to read the rest as it would only drag on to a pointless story. I love a story of deep and undying love as much as the next person but I could barely begin to care about these two lovers until the last few chapters. The reading was slow and felt as if Shreve was just trying too hard to be a writer of great talent and for her characters to be as well. I suggest passing on this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious,pretentious, pretentious","review":"I don't get it. Why the positive reviews? This book is easily the most irritating thing I've ever read. Why can't Shreve do her dialogue like all the other writers in the world? No, she has to put them in italics and make them blend in with the rest of the narrative. And the two main characters - Poets my God - are boring, boring, boring. The love story is totally unconvincing. No doubt it's a take-off of Bridges of Madison County. This one is just as superficial, only wordier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it's finally over...","review":"I really had a rough go on this one! For me this book just dragged on and on... I never thought I was going be done with it. I guess I don't care much for the present to past story lines and this is how this one was written.

They somehow missed the point of the book - What if?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending is a child's trick","review":"Shreve isn't the first to employ the backwards telling of a love story, despite the reviewers who call this \\"unique.\\" It isn't. It's a ripoff of Harold Pinter's technique in \\"Betrayal,\\" also the story of an obsessive affair, and was also used by Martin Amis in his novel about the Holocaust.Shreve is a good writer but her books ALWAYS have disappointing endings; in \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" it's a sappy and unconvincing romance; in \\"Fortune's Rock's\\" it's a convenient and unconvincing pregnancy. But this one is just ridiculous, it's nothing more than a cheap, childish trick.This is my last Shreve novel. I keep giving her a chance to live up to her own promise, and she never does. Feh. Into the dustbin with this, and never again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ouch. That unbearable foreknowledge of loss...","review":"Another Anita Shreve's hit, sober, heart-wrenching and full of texture. I had no idea it had a connection to one of her previous books, \\"The Weight Of Water\\", which I read years ago (and liked very much). It connects us with one smaller character in that book, Linda, but it is not necessary to read its predecessor to get into this one, as it is not a sequel.Linda and Thomas meet and fall in love as teenagers, but the story unfolds backwards, after a chance meeting in Toronto, when they are both in their fifties. They have not seen each other in twenty-six years. Their past life with all its joys, flaws and pains resurfaces. The anatomy of a very deep, moving true love is described with such emotional substance, its essence never lost to the reader.And the end. The surprising ending. I found this novel to be a page-turner and possibly the best one I've read by this author (I've read almost everything written by Ms. Shreve). A love story to be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book you'll think about after you read it.","review":"Most of the time when I read a book, I just read it. I do not need to think about it because typically the endings of the books I read resolve the plot. However, the ending of this book made me examine the plot again and question what had happened and why which made this book a total reading experience. I'll admit that the first part of the book was a chore to get through but towards the end of it, I could not wait to get to the next part. The second part of the book I felt was more of a visual experience due to the vivid descriptions of Kenya. The third part was an emotional experience because of the highly dramatic moments that occur. This is my first time reading anything by Anita Shreve and if her other books are as spellbinding as this one, I think I might become a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow start, but a strong finish!","review":"I had a difficult time with the beginning of the book, but thanks to long airport lines and two delayed flights, I am glad I hung in there until the end. For anyone who doesn't believe that true love still exists, read this book renew your faith!Quite a story, and a great storyteller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quelle Déception","review":"What a disappointment! I expected Anita Shreve to \\"weave a web of suspense\\" and that this would be a novel that I could not put down. Instead I found the book a chore to read -- and I was only reading it to get to the end and be finished with it for good.The \\"twist\\" does not redeem a few hundred pages of overly flowery writing, and characters that are outrageously far-flung in their idealistic romance.What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pondering life","review":"So, I was reading this novel and thinking, \\"what's the big deal?\\" I had read about three of the author's novels before and found them to be well written with surprising plot twists. This one had me stumped but I kept on reading and I am glad I did. The story began to pick up and I began to care about the characters and we delved into their pasts. But it was the last page that blew me away. I read the page once, twice, read the first couple of chapters and just stared at the cover.I immediately lent it to a friend, who like me found it a slow go to begin with. Finally she found what I found, a novel that made her sit and stare at the cover while trying to wrap her mind around what had just happened.If you don't believe me, read it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until the horrible ending","review":"This is a compelling love story, told backwards in time. Two poets meet at age 52, at age 26, and at age 17. There are hints of tragic things that happened in the past, and the story unfolds in a page-turning kind of interest: you care about the characters and want to learn more about them.HOWEVER, please do not read the last page! I thought it was gimmicky, and unnecessary. If the last page is true, then the whole rest of the book would make NO sense. It's like the author just tacked on a \\"suprise\\" ending for no reason, even though it completely contradicts any logical reading of the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Trick","review":"The title of my review says it all, as far as I'm concerned. Totally unbelievable. You just do NOT do that to your readers. I went back and leafed through the book again to see if it worked, and it didn't. A real stretch.I give it one star because there was some fine writing in the Africa section. Otherwise, if I'd not been on a Philippine island on vacation with little else to read, I might not have finished. And I felt cheated when I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Ending","review":"I was able to finish this book, which rates it at least 2 stars, but I was sorry I did, because the ending is cheap. The ending essentially says, all events you read about and thought were evocative, thoughtful, sad, or whatever, were simply the imaginings of a secondary character. Why bother? If it was all Thomas's imagination, don't you think he would imagine something a little happier? It becomes the story of a sick and obsessed mind, rather than a poignant story of love lost. I had read Pilot's Wife and enjoyed it, but I don't think I'll be reading another of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I found this book to be absolutely horrible. I enjoyed Sea Glass and the Pilot's Wife and cannot believe that the same author wrote this garbage. I recommend saving your money by not buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run That By Me Again","review":"Having read a few of Shreve's earlier works I expected more from this book. I was disappointed in \\"Fortune's Rock\\" but really disliked the ending of this book. Since this was suppose to be a continuation of an earlier book the ending made me feel like I wasted my time twice. I had to re-read the end three or four times because I didn't think my understanding of it was correct. It made a mockery of the intensity and complexity of thier love story and was insulting to the reader. I just picked up \\"Sea Glass\\". If Ms. Shreve doesn't redeem herself here I won't be reading anymore of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still thinking about it.","review":"I was \\"SHOCKED\\" to say the least after reading the last page of the book. I reread it about 5 times to see if I read it properly, and to make sure I was understanding the words. I felt like I was reading the last page in a foreign language that I wasn't too confident in. I thought that maybe I wasn't comprehending the ending because it was so unbelievable. I couldn't believe that Thomas could make up all these events in his life. As the other readers mentioned some of the story was told in Linda's narrative. Thomas really had some imagination. I thought the first half of the book was TOO slow and the writing style was excruciatingly descriptive. I had to put down the book and then pick it up the next day hoping it would get better. The second half of the book did get a little better until the end of the book. I thought the love story between Linda and Thomas was beautiful (if it really had happened). But to happen just Thomas' imagination - now that's just scary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't bring myself to keep reading","review":"A number of the reviews mention the \\"slow\\" beginning. Slow! Slow?! Slow hardly describes it. Torture would be a better description. Horrid torture actually. I can tolerate a slow beginning, but this is beyond slow. It's just too bad to keep reading. Save your time, save your money and find something you actually enjoy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"great ride, crash ending","review":"Wow! I was so drawn in and involved with the characters as I was reading, only to be shocked and dismayed by the ending. Frustrated! I completely agree with \\"Speechless's\\" review below, and I won't be reading another Shreve. Dang."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate \\"what-if\\".","review":"This was the first novel I had read in many years, and I found it to be magnetic from the first to the last (or the last to the first). The end was just the beginning; the beginning was the ultimate \\"what-if\\". So much has been written in previous reviews about the disappointing ending, the clues throughout or the magnificent ending, but I was enthralled over the eight continuous hours I set aside to read it by every aspect. The single thread that was woven from the first page to the last was beautifully illustrated by evocative prose and hinted thoughts. I will read and reread this book again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious drivel","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book after hearing so many positive things. I'd never read Shreve before...and I never will again. Her style is stiff, pretentious, & unnatural. Especially in her descriptives (overwhelming use of superfluous adverbs) and dialogue. I challenge any reader to think of a person they know who actually speaks like these characters.The ending in particular was silly. That last paragraph - unnecessarily tragic. Like a typical Hollywood tear-fest. Sad for the sake of being sad. Silliness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I thought it odd that the book was written out of sequence and stopped reading it several times. I finally finished it. After reading the ending, all I could think about was the time that I had wasted reading the book when I could have been reading something worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible waste of time","review":"This was an awful book to read. I hated it from page one, but because it had such good reviews, I struggled on to the end. I found it to be bland and contrived, the characters were not at all likeable, and as for the end....Pretty disgusting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was robbed!!","review":"I love almost all of Anita Shreve's book but the twist in this one about broke my heart. Ranks right up there with the twist on the old show \\"Dallas\\" where they made the whole season about J.R. being shot as a dream. Ticked me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have read most of Anita Shreve's book and was really looking forward to reading this one. I read the Amazon reviews first and even though they were so so, I decided to read it anyway. This book bored me to tears! The only reason I finished it is because I kept reading about the surprise ending. I couldn't wait to get to the end of the book and read what everyone was talking about. I thought if I made it to the end and liked what I read, then the 313 pages of agony would all be worth it. I was wrong! Do yourselves a favor and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, confusing, and a waste of time...","review":"I think I may be the only person who didn't fall in love with The Pilot's Wife, but after my friend recommdended this book to me I thought I'd give Anita Shreve a second chance. Big mistake! My friend kept raving about the ending so I suffered through this aweful book until the past page, only to be even more disappointed. Shreve leaves the reader thinking \\"What just happened?\\" The whole book is confusing and a waste of time.I recently saw Shreve read an excerpt from this book at a local Border's and she was putting me to sleep then too. Perhaps she modeled Linda after herself when, at the beginning of the book, the main character gets bored to death giving mandatory readings. If you have trouble sleeping at night, this may be the perfect remedy. Otherwise, do yourself a favor and pass on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Imitates Art","review":"That Anita Shreve is a very good writer is without doubt. She is a good storyteller and very good with words. However, what struck me about this book was the almost perfect way she captured the exhilirating, wild, throw-caution-to-the-wind, and yet, ultimately disastrous effects of head-over-the-heels love. Such love apparently cannot be sustained and the price one pays for experiencing it is very, very high. That was certainly the case in this novel. Heck...maybe that is the case in every case. I really enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still mad 5 years later!","review":"I read this book when it first came out, and I'm still not over being mad at the ending. I had previously read the \\"Weight of Water\\" so I knew the premise of this book couldn't really work, but having faith in Ms. Shreve I went ahead (with heavy doubts). So when I got to the end and found out that I was right all along, I was very peeved! Although I enjoyed \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" and \\"The Weight of Water\\" I haven't read another one of her books since because of my experience with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO disappointed...","review":"Just finished this book and feel a combination of depression and anger. This book was tedious reading for a long time, but I stuck with it, sure I would be rewarded. It wasn't worth the \\"sticking-with\\". What a waste of my time! And for me, who had bought every Anita Shreve book to date, to say this, is something."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSED","review":"I have not finished this book yet. It is going to be hard to do so. The way the dialog is written, sometimes I can not tell who is speaking. Everything jumps around from past to future to now I am not sure what is going on. Nothing is clear, I can't figure out the characters or if I even care about what happens. I purchased it because of \\"The Pilot's Wife\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet","review":"I've read a couple other books by Anita Shreve, and this one was by far her best. The story is good, and the drama builds as the book goes on. She does a great job of creating two characters that you care about, and the ending is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Visitor by Lee Child.","review":"A really great read, a murder mystery but much much more than this. Half way through the book, and I still did not know why Reacher (the main, tough guy character) was involved, if he was involved, and what the main aim of his mission was. There were so many mysteries. So for anyone who likes a tough professional character, like Reacher is, and does not just want a straigtforward \\"who did it\\" mystery, then this is for you. Even with the attention to detail the narrative moves like a high speed train. tis Good. David."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time nor you money","review":"It is rare that I am so disappointed in a book that I can't find much to redeem it. This is one of those instances.This was the choice for my book club. Right from the get-go I had problems with the way the author writes the dialogue. I guess that should have been a clue as to what was up, but I missed it. It was just irritating.The there was all the coincidences in Linda and Thomas meeting at various times.I hate when someone tells too much of the story in a review, so I won't go into too much. I shall say this - the author let me down as a reader. What she does at the end, she may feel is a new \\"gimmick\\", but it has made me determined to not read another of her books.If you are so inclined to read this, or as in my case it is your book club's selection, I would suggest checking it out at the library. Also, don't get too involved in caring about the characters. It will be sure to save you money and the agony of feeling what a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, PUH..LEASE....","review":"Someone had recommended this book. The beginning was so boring that I almost didn't finish it. About halfway through, I got interested. Then, it was all a dream. I hate when everything is a dream stories. Remember when the show \\"Dallas\\" got mildly interesting in the middle, but at the end it was all a dream? Same thing!!! How silly!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thoughts","review":"I think the reason why there are so many harsh reviews for this book is that people don't like having to think about what they've read. They also don't like feeling tricked. As soon as you finish reading this book - really as soon as you come to the last page - you are instantly forced to reevaluate your interpretation of the entire book. Frankly, I find that amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is AWFUL!!","review":"I can't imagine a publisher accepting this book for publication. It's boring and a total waste of time. Some authors truly are one book authors. Anita Shreve is one of those!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it with no preconceived expectations","review":"This was the very first Anita Shreve book I ever read, so I was fortunate enough to hold no expectations about her writing style, etc. I absolutely loved \\"The Last Time They Met\\" and have read many of Shreve's books since. I think Shreve was brilliant with this story; I was so surprised when I got to the end! I have reread the book countless times, and still cry at the end.Though I can see how fans of past books were disappointed or confused by this one (and would urge them to give it another read) because the style is very different then most of Shreve's other books. However, I do believe that if you begin this book with an open mind, with no preconceived expectations (and work through the writing style within the first portion of the book) you will not be let down. \\"The Last Time They Met\\" is a beautiful story that I would (and have) recommend to any book lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read take the time to digest it.","review":"A co-worker loaned this book to me, I called and thanked her the second I was done. Starts out slow but stick with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"What a disappointment this book was! Even on a long plane ride, I was bored stiff! I had eagerly awaited something new from Anita Shreve because I enjoyed the Pilot's Wife. This book is boring, very weak plot. It takes up pages and pages describing the most unimportant details of surroundings."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story was a waste of my time","review":"This is the third book I have read by this author, and it will be the last. I was so disappointed in the way the story ended, and also confused, as some of the other reviewers mentioned. I liked the story very much, but the ending ruined the whole book. Overall, I was glad that I got this book at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera","review":"The novel has finely drawn characters, and the scenes of life in Africa are interesting; however, the characters never do anything which is not easily predictable, and nothing not easily predictable happens to them. The novel concludes with such a non-ending, I wonder if Ms Shreve just got lost in the morass of her non-plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Weight of Water first -both are fabulous","review":"This story begins at the end and I couldnt put it down. Anita Shreve is a master in manipulating time in her stories. We meet our main characters in the present after a 34 year separation and we go back in time to the first time they met. This is a frustating love story. I have no patience for cheaters. If they loved each other so much why didnt they leave their spouses but I guess this is part of the intensity of extra marital love.Thomas is the same character from The Weight of Water . This is his story before and after the events on the first book. I think you dont have to read The Weight of Water to appreciate this book but I think it would be pointless to read this book first and The Weight of Water second for this book gives you the surprinsing end of the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read to help you fall asleep...","review":"I am so sorry I bought this book, I simply could not get into it. I was too busy trying to figure out who's perspective was being shared throughout each chapter. I found it boring and to difficult to follow. I wish I would have read some of these editorials before I bought it, it is the only book on my shelf I couldn't get myself to finish..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most memorable books I've read","review":"This is the first book I've read by Shreve, and certainly won't be the last. Her writing is like poetry -- every page a descriptive melding of action and emotion. She is wonderful at pinpointing the human psyche and explaining why we do the things we do.This book would be excellent for a book club, as it lends itself nicely to long, philosophical discussions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever","review":"If you have seen the movie Memento you will recognize the way this book is constructed. Told in reverse, this clever way of telling a troubling story is absolutely engrossing. I liked this book more than The Pilot's Wife. Highly reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This was my first Anita Shreve book, and I loved it from page one to the end. The writing is very poetic and atmospheric, such that, even though the plot may unfold slowly at first, it doesn't matter. The writing is so good that I was just totally absorbed, as you always want to be by a good book. The ending truly is a total surprise, and in fact, I didn't at first grasp the ending until later in the night...I literally woke up and realized what had actually happened on that last page, and it made the book all the more impressive. I'm onto \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" next, and will probably read all her books in quick succession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Asking Questions..but LOVED IT","review":"I could not put this book down and was late for work in the morning while finishing it. The ending has me confused.....can someone please clarify that. Must read!!!!!! You will not be able to stop turning the pages and most of all DO NOT SKIM....otherwise you will have to go back and read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Time They Met","review":"Great book, starts a little slow but ends with a bang. I'm not usually surprised by endings but was by this one. It made me want to go back and read again so I could pay more attention to the \\"little details.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I was dissapointed with the ending seeing as how I read The Weight of Water first. Since I read The Weight of Water first, I felt that, by the ending, I should have known about Linda, since Shreve says what happens to her in that first book. Even though, it was such a shock and just as you read the last sentence you are forced to say \\"what?!!!\\" It's a great book...as is The Weight of Water...I feel for the characters. I love how she makes them seem so real. You know the author is great when he/she can do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have read much better!","review":"I thought this was awful! It was confusing at times and the ending certainly didn't tie up any loose ends. If anything, it made the confusion worse! The description of the book sounded quite interesting, but I was far from interested after the second page. I think the best part of the book was the vocabulary Shreve used. The story though left an awful lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shreve got tired of this book too!","review":"What a disappointment! It was like Shreve became tired of her own story and just gave up. The Pilot's Wife was great! The Last Time They Met isn't even in the same league. After finally being drawn into the story, I felt completely cheated by the ending! I've never felt compelled to write one of these reviews, by doing so this time, I hope I can save someone from wasting their time and money on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this!","review":"I loved the first 311 pages of this book, I was into the characters, moved by their situation, loved the description of Africa, but the last sentence of the book ruined the whole thing for me. I felt cheated, manipulated, and deceived. I feel like I'm a good reader, that I pay close attention to details and plot and character development, and I didn't see and still don't see the clues to that ending...it was as if Shreve just didn't know how to end it. Even if there were clues, it wouldn't have been worth it. I would never recommend this book to anyone else and I will never read another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt ripped off!!!","review":"It is hard to discuss the reasons why I felt betrayed by this book without giving away too much, but suffice it to say that the ending of this book left me with a feeling of \\"Why did I bother?\\" In addition to the let down I felt at the end, I found that Shreve described every detail ad nauseum. I felt the need to break out the thesaurus on more than one occasion just to make sure I really knew what she was driving at.I haven't read Weight of Water, so I did not know Thomas going into this book. Maybe if I had, I would have felt more connected, but in the end, I really felt as though the whole novel was a waste of time; a waste of my time, a waste of Shreve's time and especially a waste of time and energy on behalf of these characters.In my opinion: Not one of Shreve's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read all of Anita Shreves books and have enjoyed them , however her latest novel has left me wondering if she wrote this book or had one of her students write it. The ending was disappointing and I found myself daydreaming about other things while I was reading the \\"meat of the novel\\" perhaps that is why I did not understand the ending. I hope in the future Ms Shreve will cover some new subjects she is a wonderful storeteller and I will give her another chance, however I couldn't get over the feeling of being gyped and wanted my money and time back after reading the novel Good luck in the future Ms Shreve - Stick to the basics and let Hollywood have the crazy endings...."},{"rating":"1","title":"fascination with lost love","review":"Terrible book...boring till the end (which is the only part I liked).If you are wondering why Shreve likes stories about lost love, and the \\"what if\\" theme that runs through many of her books, read her book \\"When and where\\"...which I strongly suspect is autobiographical. She seems well-versed in the emotions of love rekindled and its adverse consequences on families because it reflects her own story."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY DISAPPOINTED","review":"After reading the Pilot's Wife and Sea Glass, both of which were interesting, entertaining, and well-written, I'm really disappointed in this book. I can sum it all up in one word: BORING! It's more a book by a writer about other writers, more so than a \\"love story\\". I couldn't get past all the italicized dialogue, and gave up about halfway through. I checked this out from the library, and I'm just so glad I didn't buy it! It would really be a waste of money. I won't give up on Anita Shreve, because I think she's brilliant, but I definitely wouldn't recommmend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"$2.00 Too Much!","review":"Some time ago, I picked up this Audio Book @ a Public Library book sale. I just listened to it this week while traveling on vacation. I had never read Anita Shreve but the title sounded interesting and the price was right! The teen age years: not believable. The description of Africa: made me think she had truly spent time there. Very interesting. The ending: SO ridiculousI thought I had missed something while listening(CD skipped?). I had to check it out on line to see if I was mistaken. NOPE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my top 10 favorite books","review":"I loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Brilliant. I'm off to check out what else she had written, hope it's as good as this one. It was just a simple love story but it was hypnotic. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A beautifully written book with a disappointing ending.","review":"I read this book because I read \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" and loved it. I also very much enjoyed this story until the last page. The author did nothing whatsoever to prepare me for the ending. I felt extremely cheated. This is the very reason I quit reading Dean Koonz - stupid endings that don't fit the books. I may or may not give the author a second chance. I don't need a happy ending, but I sure do need one that fits the rest of the book. I think Ms. Shreve went for \\"clever\\" and failed. Had she given me even one little inkling of what she had planned, I would say okay because I wouldn't feel cheated. Before the ending I would have given it a solid four stars, maybe even five. Now - not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"d isappointed","review":"I found this book to be too contrived. As Shreve kept shifting back and forth in time she kept hinting about deep secrets that would be revealed as the book evolved. The anticipated hidden facts were really not worth waiting for. I found the characters selfish and self-involved. The fact that they were \\"artistic\\" and thus more sensitive (for themselves) allowed them to hurt others. The ending disproved the entire premise of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"w-h-a-a-a-a-a-t?","review":"I have such mixed feelings about this book...for the most part I was quite engrossed in the story and involved in the characters; I truly felt like I was living the book. But, when I finished it, I found myself muttering \\"w-h-a-a-a-a-a-a-t?\\" so loudly, I woke up my snoozing cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down!","review":"I really looked forward to reading this book. I thoroughly enjoyed The Pilot's Wife and thought that this book would be equally as enjoyable -- WRONG! This book was a terrible disappointment and waste of valuable time. It was monotonous, going on and on about Africa for no apparent reason and about the signifigance of Mary Magdalene. In spite of this, I kept reading. I knew it would get better. It didn't, though. The ending made NO sense. Like another reviewer, I went back to the beginning to see if I had missed something. I even made my husband listen to part of it, to see if he could make any sense of it! Final words: Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel like I've been \\"had\\"","review":"I just finished this book and was told by several people, \\"Wait til you get to the ending!\\" . Now I have and I feel like reading it was a total waste of time. What a cheap literary trick. I also found the dialogue and the way it was written in the book, in italics and without quotation marks, very irritating and distracting to read. Glad I only borrowed this one from the library - I would have been disappointed to waste my money on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Anita Shreve's books The Pilot's Wife and The Weight of Water; I was quite disappointed with this, her newest book. The dialogue between Thomas and Linda did not ring true (it's hard to believe that people really talk this way). The letters back and forth do not distinguish one author from the other. And worst of all, the revelation at the end was very predictable. I expected better from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time.....","review":"I was saving this book for vacation next month, but finally had to break down and start reading it. At first, I couldn't put it down. I was thrilled with the characters Linda and Thomas. About mid-way through the book (somewhere in Africa), I CHEATED! I read the last few pages. What a total disappointment and sell-out. Was the author thinking that this story should end (or begin) this way for the sake of a future screenplay? C'mon Ms. Shreve, your readers deserve better......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"What exactly was the \\"twist\\" at the end? I consider myself pretty intelligent and I read a lot but I couldn't figure out the end. The story was interesting enough although I had no problem putting the book down and doing something else and I usually have trouble when I'm in the middle of a great book. The characters were not particularly credible, but my biggest question is - what exactly happened at the end? Not highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long read","review":"I had to look twice to make sure I had not written the review from Naples, Florida. My comment-- Ditto. A complete waste of time and money. The \\"Pilot's Wife\\" was such a great story-- I felt sure this would be of equal quality. WRONG!! I guess I was given thought to wonder how many kids in high school speak in such literary phrase. None that I can recall. Will definitely read Amazon's reviews before I purchase anymore of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing - Questions Left Unanswered","review":"I finished this book last night and couldn't believe - the \\"accident\\" the book referred to throughout its entirety was described very poorly. And it certainly never said WHY the accident caused the couple to break up - it just ended - saying this \\"was the last day of Linda's life\\" - no explanation of why a car accident would keep two people so in love apart. Furthermore, I don't understand the relavance of both characters having both been married twice - I can't put it into words, but I feel like I finished this book and still had no answers to several questions. I won't be reading anymore of Shreve's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it less than 1 star I would","review":"I can't say that it was the worst book that I ever read because I actually did finish it, it took several months and I am a 2-3 book reader a week. The best that I can say about it was I paid $1 for it. I would have been more angry at the price than the end of the book had I paid more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Ever!","review":"I have read many books & all of Anita's, but this was by far her worst ever.She wandered into some flatline space. Not like her at all. Her novels are going downhill. Not recommended to start with for a Shreve read. The Pilot's Wife still is her best work. I can follow most any script but this was just impossible. Sorry. Anita. I would have given it a minus 10 if that rate was available."},{"rating":"2","title":"very satisfying! I loved it","review":"The descriptions of the settings and people they meet are second to none. I liked the meandering off-beat way the story weaves thorough the small details of life. The characters are rich and satisfying. The romance was powerful but I did not feel it was \\"overly dramatic\\" like a soap opera since the characters had the proper setting and history behind it.I was happy to see the reference to her other book The Weight of Water, I did not realize at first it's the same Thomas. I think that gave grater depth to the story since I had the begging and end from this book, and the middle from the other story. I can see how this book may not be for everyone, but I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally confused","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed her previous books.The beginning was a little slow, but once I got into it I found myself enjoying it,until the END!!!Can someone PLEASE explain what happened???? Was it real or just symbolic. I am SO confused and frustrated that I feel like I don't want to read any more of her books!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Time They Met","review":"I found the first 80 pages to be sheer torture, but I persevered and was richly rewarded. I could not put the book down until I finished it. I am not convinced I understand the ending which leaves me frustrated. Having read both The Pilot's Wife and Fortune's Rock, which I devoured, I was excited to read this book. Would someone please confirm the ending of this book to me please?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I checked it out for free at the library!","review":"I didn't think this book would ever get going. I literally had to force myself to read it. Especially in the beginning. B-o-r-i-n-g! And then after reading the part about Africa, I kept telling myself over and over again that I will NEVER visit that country. The book finally started to pick up some speed in Africa and then I began to enjoy it.........until the ending. I just sat there with my mouth hanging open. I don't think I care to read another of Anita Shreves books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first time --probably the last time","review":"The book was weird! The fact that it went backwards was strange enough, but I had to read the last page three times just to figure it all out. This book requires time to read slowly and think. All in all, ok. Just not so sure I want to read it again. Buy the paperback! Not worth the hardcover price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Started The Book, and....","review":"I have just started reading this book, but I really got turned off by the dialogue being set out in italics. It took me several pages to figure out what the author was trying to accomplish. As far as the story, I haven't gotten that far into it to make any comment, but the italic thing really distracted from the content. I have read so many reviews of what a great book this is, so will have to get back to it to find out. I read one other review that mentioned the italic printing, so maybe I am not alone in this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time and money!","review":"This is the last novel by Anita Shreve that I will ever read. It was slow at the start, and by the time I got to the end, I was curious to see how the story would come together. I was unbelievably disappointed by the ending -- so much that I walked off a plane and promptly threw this book into the first garbage can I saw. I wish I could have the hours I spent reading this novel back to do something more worthwhile with! Don't waste your time or money on this one! If I could have awarded this book no stars, I would have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh -- NOW I get it . . .","review":"Thank goodness for Amazon.com book reviews!!! At the end of this book, all I could say was \\"I don't get it.\\" After reading about 40 reviews and piecing together bits of information, the light dawns -- I've got it!I'm an avid reader -- 3-4 books/week -- this one took me almost a month to finish. The first section was lackluster; the second confusing; the third (finally) interesting. And the italicized speech -- found myself flipping back and forth, trying to figure out who said what. Although now that I \\"get it,\\" that makes more sense (and is actually quite clever).I read The Pilot's Wife and found the story intriguing, but was never \\"hooked and drawn in\\" by the characters. I had some misgivings about reading Shreve again -- once more, an interesting story line, but I just didn't have that tug-at-my-heart feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Typical Shreve","review":"I could not even believe that this was written by Anita Shreve. I absolutely love her other books, but I found this one such a disappointment. The cheesy dialogue between the two main characters and the constant referencing to Mary Magdalene were very annoying and grating. The ending, which some may find clever, only further unnerved me. For all you Shreve lovers out there-trust me-SKIP THIS ONE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL...terribly contrived AND a letdown!","review":"I had such high hopes for this book when I first heard about it. Every ten pages I read I thought to myself, \\"Gosh, when is it going to get better?\\" Sad to say, it never did. It was muddled and confusing from the start, and by the time I got to the end (I was skimming by this point), it was just a cop-out ending. A big time let down. The whole novel was contrived and just a terrible read. I don't mind a little confusion and mystery, but this was just too much. If you decide to read it/buy it, I hope you fare better than I.I would have given it only a half star, but that option wasn't available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flabbergasted in Florida","review":"Having read previous books by the author, I believed I knew more or less what twists and turns to expect. Plot twists notwith-standing, her writing makes one feel as if you are there. I cried, I held my chest, I felt the love, the loss, the desperation, the resignation that man may make plans, but the universe has designs of its own. I couldn't put it down. Then I read the final page. I put it down, dumbfounded, and read it again. I wasn't sure what I had read. I have never experienced this type of feeling after reading a book. I didn't know if I loved it or hated it, I just knew I had to read it all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Time They Met: a Novel","review":"Disappointing! I also do not want to spoil the ending but I found it extremely contrived and not satisfying. Almost like the T.V. series that have some \\"strange\\" endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise Ending? Please!","review":"While reading the book, I found Shreve's writing almost pretentious. Finally, the surprise ending (discounting the first two sections of the book!) was unbelievable, and wrapped up in less than a page. It reminded me of the ending in Dallas (when Victoria Principal woke up from a dream) or in \\"Tootsie\\" when he revealed that he was a man and made up some contrived story as to how s/he got there! I just thought it was cheap and surprised that a professional reviewer would give it any high marks! I have read The Pilot's Wife and The Weight of Water and enjoyed both of them, but this one should have had either a different editor or should not have been published in the first place. I definitely feel like I wasted both my time and money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of ending is this!!?","review":"Anita Shreve could've gotten away with a happy ending. She is an enormously gifted writer and this book is a true testament to that. However, she truly blew-it in the ending. I felt cheated and used - like I was the blunt of some stupid joke. I would've put Shreve's talent above ending this book on the last page -- in the way it was done. An insult to both myself and the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I HATED the ending, which was not even believable. I felt manipulated and cheated. I found the rest of the book mildly interesting, but I would not dream of re-reading to \\"look for clues\\" as other reviewers have suggested. It's not worth my time. While the idea of writing backwards (from present to past) is clever, it cries out for an ending which justifies the preceding 312 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad; it's been done better","review":"I thought the \\"gimmick\\" didn't make much sense.I do like the idea of writing about unrequited love and a long search for love extending over many decades. If you do too I'd recommend reading \\"Love in the Time of Cholera\\" by Marquez. I think it's a better book in every respect.Askold Wawryszyn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everlasting Love","review":"I thought this book was a beautiful love story. I really got wrapped up in the love the two had for each other. The book started slow at first, but it soon draws you in. Using the flashback technique kept you wondering what had happened, but overall, I think it was a good approach. I was somewhat dissapointed with the ending, but I think it presents a good point about everlasting love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated the ending","review":"I enjoyed the book, but think that the ending is a terrible betrayal of the reader and the characters. Its just doesn't fit. Like she didn't know how to end the book and took the easy clever way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Shreve For Me","review":"I was looking forward to reading this latest novel of Anita Shreves. I loved Strange Fits of Passion, but this story doesn't even come close to that. As other reviewers here have said, it took a while to become involved in the story line, and the chapters that took place in Africa were sometimes grueling to get through. But, because I liked Linda and Thomas I plowed through the boring parts expecting the book to have a plausable ending (who would have thought it wouldn't?). The ending was, to say the least, a shock, and not at all plausable. I also agree with a reviewer here who stated that this was a \\"mean trick to play on the reader\\". Was that Shreve's purpose? Did she want to have readers sit staring at the last page totally dumbfounded. Like another of the reviewers, I am also a mental health professional, and I have to ask myself, why would an well-loved author play a nasty trick like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost very good","review":"After thoroughly enjoying the book, I was completely disappointed with the ending. It seemed as if Ms. Shreve didn't know another way to end it.Some stories are magnificent with a twist(Sixth Sense). This story didn't support the twist in any way I could see.My opinion? Good try, but it left me empty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless and speechless!","review":"I finished this book just 10 minutes ago and am still in a state of mild shock at the ending.I simply hadn't realised that Anita Shreve was capable of writing such magnificent prose ! She lifts you up and floats you along on such an ethereal cloud-filmy but magically intense-so that you can literally forget where you are. I don't normally rabbit on about prose but this is very special. The story is simple and I don't want to give anything away as it would ruin the reading of the book. Girl meets boy in teenage years--they part and meet again in middle age to discover that the deep feelings they had for each other have never gone away. I suppose that most women have an old love about whom they wonder-\\"what if \\"? I gave it only 4 stars as the ending left me curiously stranded and ambivalent about the final outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G","review":"Unless you have committed adultery it's really difficult to identify with this novel---my opinion. Nothing about it is exciting-honestly. I resent the reviews that state it is a book you cant put down once you have started reading it and you can't wait to turn each page. The truth is I kept hanging in there reading every page, every word...hoping it got better. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A friend of mine passed this book on to me, and at first I was really looking forward to reading it. I've heard good things about Anita Shreve, and I still want to read some of her other work. However, this book was just one big disappointment after another, until the very upsetting and unbelievable ending. I believe a book should keep you guessing, and I respect an author's ability to keep the reader in suspense. But the end of this book was totally unexpected- but not in an interesting, clever way that some authors are capable of pulling off. Instead, this ending was just totally out of the blue, as if she knew the book was really boring and the only way to get people talking or to even remember this novel would be to add some crazy surprise ending. I feel deceived, like she thought if she added this insane ending, her readers would be fooled into thinking she is a literary genius. Instead, I just lost some respect for her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"CALL ME CONFUSED, TOO","review":"I, like some other readers, was confused by this book. I started skimming about a third of the way through. Then I thought I was going to be disappointed if the ending was good. As I got closer to the end, however, I realized there was not to be a happy ending. When I finished, unlike other readers, I didn't feel like going back and rereading from the beginning. I got bogged down a little too much in all the references to Africa. I have not read Shreve's other works, but I will likely skip them now."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mouth dropped open","review":"This would have been a 5 in my mind except for the dreadfully difficult time I had with the first 20-25 pages. I read and re-read trying to get into the story. Why the airport detail? Why the hotel detail, etc.? But, if you can get past that, what an intriguing and interesting book. I was sucked into each period of the lover's lives and was delighted that they had found each other again in later years. I was desperate to get to the end to see where they would take their relationship this time. My mouth dropped open. I was one of the people who had to go back through the book several times to look for clues about the ending. I sat for two days with my mouth open wondering at that ending. I think anyone who enjoyed any of Anita Shreve's books would be thrilled with this one. I love the way she hooked two novels together with the same characters--\\"The Weight of Water\\" is good too, but this one was really pulled it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Depressing to Be a Good Read","review":"I am an avid reader and I read for enjoyment. Many novels have tragic events which cause the reader sadness; however, \\"The Last Time They Met\\" is too depressing to enjoy. Whatever hopes you have for the characters are terribly crushed by the ending. Do not look for any happiness in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit Over the Head!","review":"The novel took me awhile to get into -the events move backwards in time, constantly teasing the reader with things to come. Initially, I found this frustrating and confusing. It finally settled in and I enjoyed it enormously. The ending struck me so hard I felt like I was hit over the head!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrrrrring!","review":"I found this to be a totally insipid novel about two whiners. I had to force myself to finish it. The last page was the most interesting. I read The Weight of Water and liked it better than this story - even though I found Thomas to be self-centered. I won't be reading another Shreeve novel. The characters are egocentric and uninteresting. What a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point of this book?","review":"I gave it a try, but just couldn't get interested. Then I read the last few pages to see what bothered people about the ending. It doesn't make any sense to me. I would give it no stars, but that isn't on the scale.I could relate to \\"The Pilot's Wife\\", but not this book. I doubt if I'll read another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be tricked","review":"After finding this book in a drawer after many years (I bought it new and never found the time), I opened it up. I've read other Anita Shreve books with mixed results, the best one being \\"The Pilot's Wife\\". After reading intriguing reviews about this one, specifically about the surprise, \\"shocking\\" ending, I decided to give this one a try. I plodded and slogged through the snail's pace, determined to once and for all get to that riveting shocker at the end of the book, the last few sentences to be exact. Boy, was I fooled, and I sure felt like a fool, too. Another Amazon reviewer suggested \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" instead. I am now reading that and thoroughly enjoying it, so thank you. Please, I am begging you, don't waste your time on this one, you will be as sorry as I was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all disappointed","review":"This book was one of the best books I've ever read. I recommended it to all my friends. I read and re-read the entire last chapter 3 times. I actually was relieved at the ending. Like most Shreve novels, you aren't looking for \\"and they lived happily everafter.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start but weakens at the end","review":"While this book kept my attention and seemed believable in thebeginning, it lost it by the end. As older characters, Linda and Thomas are real. Yet as teenagers, who's love lasts a life time, its pretty far fetched. As teenagers, the characteres seem good friends, but there's no evidence of strong feelings. Yet, these two people become obessed with each other later in life. I found it disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Languishing Sentiment","review":"The story begins with Linda, the object of Thomas' love, but the story is really about Thomas, a poet. The relationship starts in high school & is severed for the first time when the two are involved in a car accident. Years later they meet in Africa, where they begin a short lived affair. They meet again at a writer's conference, over 25 years later. Ultimately, Thomas learns that there are consequences to his decisions, missed opportunities, time lost. The story was a disappointment, too slow paced, the only excitement - the denouement at the end. The story labors over Thomas' feelings, but there is little elaboration on Linda's feelings - her personality seems flat, almost indifferent. The story reads like a bleak rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"Got through the first 60 pages and gave up. It's a good thing I only paid a dollar for the hard cover version at a library sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"seen myself in certain characters","review":"What a good book. I seen myself and others around me in the characters. They were completely believable. I enjoyed the story and was very interested to find out what happened. The ending is completely shocking. It's a book that I will read again just to enjoy Shreve's wonderful way of telling the story. When I finished I wanted to almost immediately go back and start again to see if there was anything I had missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"It just leaves you wondering \\"why did she write this anyway\\"? It smells like commercialism to me. I'm a big Anita Shrieve fan. This one is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Shreve Book I'll Read","review":"This book is shallow and predictable... like Shreve's general writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Time They Met","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I had expected better after all the praise for Ms. Shreve's works. The beginning seemed to drag on chapter after chapter with overwhelming details that didn't seem necessary. The imagery was good, but the characters themselves did not interest me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read The Pilot's Wife and loved it. I found this new book pretentious and a waste of time and money. It was almost like the book was written because a contract required it. The writing was utterly boring. The characters were pathetic, they both had good lives but were obsessed about a love they had long ago, then get divorced and do it already!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ug!","review":"I'm sorry. I wish I could get my money back on this book. It was far too depressing, so had to toss it in the garbage after halfway through the catterwolling and moaning! What a waste, and the author obviously detests fat people and old people. save your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunted by this story...","review":"My introduction to Anita Shreve was \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" which I devoured on a transcontinental flight. I was very close to dropping \\"The Last Time They Met\\" because I was not in the mood for a story where the characters suffered such tremendous loss. I became totally absorbed with Linda and Thomas in Africa and kept looking forward to the explanations of the \\"accident\\", \\"Magdalene\\" and how they met in high school. I was blown away by the ending...not suspecting a thing. When looking for a quick and engaging story, look no further than \\"The Last Time They Met\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time....","review":"I found this book to be very disappointing. It was tedious to read, especially the beginning half. I expected a story that flowed similiar to The Pilot's Wife. What was this author thinking? It was almost as if she wrote the last page on a whim! I regreted the time I spent reading this unbelievable and unreal novel... Now it is time to get onto my new Linda Howard book, Open Season... I am confident Linda won't let me down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better ways to get this story","review":"If you want to read about the anguish of adultery, try Anna Karenina. If you want to read about Africa, try Out of Africa. If you want star crossed teenaged lovers, try Romeo and Juliet. If you want a twist ending, rent The Sixth Sense. Put all that together and you'll still come out ahead over buying or reading this book. It's got great themes, they've just all been done,,,,and way better I might add."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've read all of Anita Shreve's books and found this one to be very disappointing. It certainly isn't up to her usual standards. The ending makes no sense and is just a device to fool the reader. Read \\"The Pilot's Wife\\" or \\"The Weight of Water\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it...","review":"The first part of this book, as pointed out by other reviewers, was absolute torture. The scenes in the hotel were boring and drawn out. The book continued to get progressively better as the story moved along, with my favorite parts occurring during their time in Africa. I was, of course, blown away by the ending- but I loved it. Looking back everything seems to fit into place- it was hard for me to accept that Thomas would not have tried to track down Linda at college or after his divorce from Regina and/or Jean. Their love for each other was so vivid it was hard for me to imagine that he would not have sought her out. I've also read Pilot's Wife by Shreve, although I enjoyed this book even more (once it got rolling..) If only she could combine the feeling at the beginning of Pilot's Wife with the intensity of the middle and ending of this book she would have a phenomenal hit on her hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS CONFUSED","review":"Anita Shreve has talent for sure. She is a wonderful writer. However, I was disappointed by the ending..not because I always have to have a happy ending...but because it totally made everything I read non-existant. Even in the confines of the story..these things..these lives never really happened..and I guess I resent that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunned by the ending","review":"I was cruising along, eagerly awaiting a happy ending when the protagonists could finally be together as was meant to be.....and then SHOCK. It can't be! I felt upset confused and betrayed when I got to the last page. It was all a ruse. If she was going to do that to us then maybe she should have developed that plot twist a little more instead of just cutting everything off. For this reason I don't feel I can recommend the book and will probably not read another by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Betrayed","review":"I felt utterly betrayed by the last pages of this book. Anita Shreve is a talented and gifted writer and while I have enjoyed her other work, I will hesitate before reading her again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing effort...","review":"I love Anita Shreve's writing, but this story was definately a disappointment. Her earlier books were missing something -- just short of greatness -- but then she seemed to break through with Pilot's Wife and Fortune's Rocks. With this one she seems to have taken a step backwards. I don't mind that many of her books seem to have somewhat fatalistic endings, but the end of this one seemed to be trying to manipulate the reader's feelings. Can't recommend this one unless you've read all her others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great writing, a very emotional and heartfelt love story","review":"The Last Time They Met is a very well-written story about star-crossed lovers who keep meeting by chance throughout their lives. The beginning is very drawn out, but as the story progresses and moves back in time, scenes happen a little faster, which seems like part of a techique (life seems to go by faster when you're younger). My favorite part of the novel was their time spent together in Africa. The ending is absolutely genius and will make you want to re-read the whole story for bits and pieces that seem to tie together once you finish the story. This is the first novel I read by Shreve and I'm online now to buy another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Climactic disappointment","review":"Although I had looked forward to reading this book, I was very disappointed. It started slowly, and I did not become interested in the characters until near the middle of the story. However, after reading the last page, I felt my investment in the characters had been a waste. I am a fan of the Weight of Water, and I know that Thomas is self destructive, but this ending left me flat.I love Shreve and find her work interesting, but next time I will pay closer attention to the reviews before buying the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and breathtaking","review":"Like most of those who reviewed this book, I, too, was shocked by the ending of this book. I knew something was coming, and I tried to predict it, but I was way off the mark, and left stunned by the end. However, unlike most others (it seems), I loved this plot twist. It was believable and heart-wrenching. This is undoubtedly due to the way Shreve writes her characters, as multi-faceted and fallible. I found the love affair of Thomas and Linda to be too painful to turn away from, a fact made all the more powerful by the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Story...","review":"Agreed - it starts slow with too many unnecessary details. But, get past the first few chapters and find yourself entrenched in a bittersweet love story between a man and a women you will agree are destined to be together. The story of love between Thomas and Linda is unforgettable, tearjerking, and frustrating. I never knew a man to have such deepness, especially in his younger years.Only problem with the novel: the final paragragh. Completely unexpected, completely unwanted... Other than that - BRAVO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Shreve, Didn't Love this Book","review":"I had a hard time getting into it. The main character was really irritating, the story moved with the speed of a striking slug.Great prose in some sections, fantastic descriptions. It wasn't my \\"cup of tea.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Enjoy","review":"I didn't enjoy this book - it was a chore to get through and then when I got to the ending, I groaned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"Ms. Shreve has a writing style that is poetic without being lofty and distant. Her descriptions of Africa, particularly the open air bedroom, make the reader actually see what she is describing. You can almost feel the oppressive heat. I liked the Pilot's Wife and chose this book on that basis, but this is a book that I will want to read again and recommend to friends.Generally, I have issues with any popular entertainment that attempts to make a cheating spouse a sympathetic character - hated the English Patient for this reason. For some reason I did not have that reaction to this book, until I was explaining the plot to a friend of mine. There was something timeless and basic about the relationship between Thomas and Linda.Brilliantly written. I recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling, but often confusing","review":"The Last Time They Met is a facinating novel, full of time and plot twists and turns that can, too often, leave the reader feeling somewhat confused. You really have to pay attention to keep the story straight, but the discriptions of setting and emotion were so compelling that I couldn't put the book down. I liked Linda very much, and Thomas as well, better than in The Weight of Water. The ending was sudden, took a while to figure out, and ultimately very unfulfilling. I understand what the author was striving for, but with such a great story and beautiful writing, the contrivance was a disapointment. I recommend this book, but watch out for that ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The ending made reading the book a waste of time. I felt the author alienated her loyal fans. Perhaps she was trying for an avant-garde questioning of the nature of reality, or something like that... but I just wanted to read a straightforward novel with engaging characters. If I want to read a book by Italo Calvino, I'll buy a book by Italo Calvino. I would highly recommend \\"The Weight of Water\\" instead, which was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This is the first book I've read by Anita Shreve and I intend to go back and read her previous works. Like most of you, I read often so I am rarely captivated by a book and most often can guess at the ending. Not so here, I could not put it down, and as the other reviews mention, I plan to read again. Thanks, Anita, for giving me such a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two and1/2 stars","review":"I have red the readers' revews first and tried to pay attention to all the details from the beginning, and yet there was no surprise at the end of this book for me. Besides, in The Weight of Water, I really disliked Thomas' charecter, and now I dislike him even more even though he is supposed to be a positive character in this book. I really do like the way the book was written, but I wish the story itself was more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"The beginning was tedious and the middle just dragged on too long. It wasn't until the third section that I felt the story was coming together - and then the ending. It was as though the author just couldn't come up with a plausible ending - so chose to wind things up the way she did. I enjoyed The Pilot's Wife, but I can assure you I won't be buying another one of Ms. Shreve's books again. I'm giving the book a two instead of a one because it did manage to keep me reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I finished this book over a week ago and the ending is still driving me nuts. Of course-I won't reveal it; but it really does make you re-think the whole book. I enjoyed the story up until the end-it is definitely a page turner. But that ending just about ruined it for me-as I'm still trying to make sense of it. A similar book that I enjoyed much more- that I highly recommend- is \\"Evening\\" by Susan Minot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever, clever lady","review":"This book is so cleverly written. Ms. Shreve's method of beginning with a character in her 50's, and then jumping back through her life was captivating. I had to read the end twice to make sure I understood what happened. I would highly reccommend this book if you enjoy the unpredictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing","review":"Although her writing style was interesting, I found the end of this story to be bitterly disappointing and certainly not worth the journey!! Actually, the end makes no sense and left me feeling cheated. I've enjoyed other works by this other, but feel I cannot recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointment","review":"I was disappointed with Anita Shreve's \\"The Pilots Wife\\"; however, I read an intriuging review of this book and my curiousity was peaked. Once again, I felt let down. I plodded on and on to what I thought was going to be some major revelation, only to be rewarded with a copout of an ending. I also found the dialog in italics to be extremely distracting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"Excellent romance. Great characters, good reader. I was saddened by the ending, but I loved the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal about this book?","review":"This is the first Anita Shreve book I've read and maybe I'm just not comfortable with her style but frankly this book just didn't get to me. I kept thinking it would grab me but it never did. I didn't [care] what happened to the main characters. They seemed totally self absorbed and not in the least likable. I was glad to get thru it and put it away. ...

I had the same feelings toward Aaliyah at that same time. To be as young as they were it was very hard for me to grasp the concept of who this album was being marketed to, because \\"I Wanna Be Down\\" carried some very adult themes and the remix with the female rappers only made my fears worse.

The clothes tight in all the right places, and loose everywhere else. She was cool, and didn't try to hard to get the attention of her guy. Further than that, however, her debut was very well put together. Her duet with Wanya Morris of Boys II Men, Brokenhearted, is also a highlight of the CD. Brandy takes you from heart break, to new love all in the switch of a track. Pick up this CD if you like the Monica, Mya, Aaliyah of the early to mid 90s"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Albums of the 90's.","review":"It's so obvious that Brandy Norwood is very talented. What new female could just come out and sale 4 million copies of a debut album, especially for and urban artist. On this album entitled Brandy, Brandy shows us that beats don't make and album for her, she does. Brandy singing each and every song as though she had wrote it herself. Each song is very versatile, she a sprectrum from a Bohemian Rap feel, to Hip-Hop, to R&B and even some Rock Ballads. Her voice is definatley unique, being one of the only few altos, with an 3.5 octave span, she bring the feel of the 90's to life. So when you first hear this album, the first thing you will think is, \\"what was I first doing when I heard Brandy\\". This album is truly amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a shame...","review":"I discovered this CD at the bottom of a box of CDs I had received as a gift three years ago. This is an incredible debut album. It has improved the way I look at Brandy as a vocalist. On this album, you can feel the ambitious young voice of an artist untainted by the need to outshine her contemporaries or her critics. Her production on this album was more versatile than on \\"Never Say Never\\" and the strength behind her voice definitely hinted at what she possessed the potential to become. Unfortunately, due to a case of stage fright and an obvious loss of confidence, that potential has yet to be achieved. Hopefully on Brandy's third album, which I hope she does have planned, Brandy will return with the mature vocal skills that she developed on her second album and the self-confidence that she possessed on her first."},{"rating":"2","title":"quick shipping","review":"The seller sent it out quickly and the book was in the condition specified.

How on earth did Ridley Scott come to the conclusion that he needed Vangelis to do the music to Blade Runner? Admittedly, the movie has the greatest cinematography I've seen in a movie in a long time, but the score just ruins the whole thing! It's just plain awful! From annoying high-pitched synthesizer to a cheesy saxaphone (completely unneccessary!), this soundtrack is full of complete garbage. The only plus I'll give it is adding in the voice overs to accompany the soundtrack; it really spices it up and makes it just a little bit creepier. The score by itself with no voices would sound incredibly bad and dull.While this soundtrack does have its fans, I am not one of them. All I can say is shame on the Blade Runner crew for choosing Vangelis of all people to do the soundtrack.

They are flat out lies. The fact that Vangalis wants to release new music and keep certain tracks unreleased is his prerogative. That's not the issue.

I cannot seem to stop listening to it. The movie and soundtrack compliment each other very well. Experiencing one makes you desire experiencing the other. The only flaw in this work is the inclusion of song number 6, \\"One More Kiss, Dear\\". This roaring twenties throwback is very inconsistent with the futuristic nature of the remaining pieces. I would say that all the other tracks are not just good, but excellent! I was first exposed to the Blade Runner soundtrack many years ago during a very depressing period of my life and this is the only music that I have allowed to survive that period.

Don't get me wrong, I love both music and movie (saw every version in the cinema upon their various releases) and as works of art, they both earn 5 stars. I just would be happy with one version of each, unadulterated. For me the 1992 Director's cut made a great film better -- now stop there. As for the music, the bootleg Esper edition did the best job giving fans most of the score, in sequence, with some key dialogue (lots of Deckard & Rachel, and Roy's valedictory speech left intact), and with the extra music Vangelis included on his official '94 release. My attitude towards soundtracks is that if I like a film's score, I want it, so strip out the dialogue (well, maybe not in this case!) and let us hear the music as it appeared at the moment of viewing. I love all classic Vangelis (Spiral, China, Masque -- you name it) but this triple-disc set is just a scam. Or a sham. Or both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I have been looking for the original soundtrack to Blade Runner for years,I even recorded the love theme from the movie I had on tape. I was sure thrilled to see it was available on CD years later. The \\"Love Theme\\" is my favorite. \\"Rachel's Song\\" and \\"Blade Runner\\" are my next two favorites. The tape recorded version was very hissy and full of noises, but the CD is so crystal clear, and an extended version of total perfection. Vangelis is great, and this CD is a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-awaited Wow.","review":"At the time, I didn't realize my New American Orchestra version wasn't Vangelis' soundtrack. I'm glad to have them both for the slight variations of some tracks and the blatant, uniquely Vangelis' own cuts which take this version far beyond the scope of the latter. Enter a dark and dreamy futuristic world which often feels cold and lonely, sometimes steamy and hot, with this somewhat bluesy/jazzy new age electronic masterpiece filled with bittersweet imagery and dialogue from the film. Even if you never saw or liked the movie, you'll be hard pressed to resist the sexy, saxy love theme everyone should have in their music collection. Brooding, mysterious, hopeful, energizing Vangelis brings you one of his all-time best collections under the title of Blade Runner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mezmerizing...","review":"The Blade Runner Soundtrack, despite it took 12 years to release it, since it was originally a \\"PolyGram Recording\\", but was changed to \\"Atlantic Records\\", still is astonishing for it's time. The Music is very jazzy and electrical, since it's about the future society. Most the tracks contain Film dialoge straight from the film. One weird thing about it is that most of the tracks where unreleased and weren't in the movie, such as \\"Memories of Green\\" and \\"Tales of the Future\\". In which is also contains classics from the film, such as \\"Blade Runner Blues\\" and \\"Love Theme\\", which is my favorite. Definately a good soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Is this the definitive Blade Runner soundtrack? Not from what I can tell. But who cares? This is great. It has most, albeit not all, of the music we loved from the movie, but that doesn't make it bad. So why only 4 stars? Because of the few songs it's missing. Having said that, this is good. It is Blade Runner. It is either Soundtrack, or music inspired by the universe that is Blade Runner. Could have been a tad better, but not worth a low review. Unless you're an anal meerkat that loves crying. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Solid Basic Tilt and Pan Head","review":"This head has been around for a long time... decades I think. The reason to me is obvious. It is a bombproof and dependable little head. I have been using the Bogen 3025 head on different tripods for about 20 years now. It has served me well on many photo trips into the wilds, for weeks on end where a lighter, more minimalist approach is needed. It's great for 35mm film, point and shoot and digital SLRs with up to a medium telephoto or zoom lens. If you're shooting vertical using a longer lens with this head it can sometimes slip down if the attach knob isn't fastened tightly. I wouldn't recommend this head for use with a medium format camera unless you're using only a normal focal length lens.Another plus for the 3025 is that if you're out on a hike and it happens to get sand in the moving parts, it is easy to take apart, clean and reassemble, although I've never had this head jamb, even when exposed to some very extreme conditions."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect gift","review":"My son in-law has a 4x5 box camera and found this head for his tripod.

Even though it is listed under the Accessories. I am incredibly dissapointed. I ordered both while at college, had them shipped to my house with express shipping so shipping cost twice as much, I get here and they don't fit. I ordered them for the trip I'm going to tomorrow to England. Looks like I can only use the monopod. Do not buy this if you are planning on using it with the Bogen - 4 Section Light-Weight Monopod. It seems sturdy and is smooth so I assume it is a decent product, but I just dont know what else to say other than I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album is Just Not Good at All","review":"The song lyrics are laughable, the vocals are sorry, and the guitar is even below Ted's previous capabilities.

However, I sincerely and completely love Spirit of the Wild. I listen to it daily (at work, in the car, heck, I even jog to it) and have yet to get tired of it. My personal favorites are Tooth, Fang & Claw, Fred Bear, Heart & Soul, and Spirit of the Wild although I like them all. I got the extreme pleasure of seeing Ted at a small county fair. Amazing performance! He \\"warmed up\\" for Bad Co. Let's just say, when Ted was done and Bad Co. started, it was so anti-climatic, I had to leave.

Not much to add to other reviews other than I use with Audible.com, and the download speed was very fast. What really made this a great unit is the fast forward button, which I did not expect it to have. You can listen to recordings, and if you miss something, go back and relisten to any section easily. Other MP3 players can stop, and start at same spot you left off, but here it is like a tape player. I record off of my PC webcasts and other events, and they download perfectly into this unit.

However, most of the film is spent showing the characters chasing each other through the dorm, looking for a purse full of money. Where the money came from is never adequately explained. All we know is it was the result of some crooked operation. After the first hour, you just wish the movie would come to an end. But it drags on for another 35 minutes.

While some of the science was interesting, the characters remain static. The description of terraforming Mars is handled well but becomes tiresome after several hundred pages. The characters get older and continue to bicker, but somehow Robinson believes that sex can remain the central motivating force for 100+ year old characters. I'd have trouble believing that for characters past 25. Wisdom does not seem to accompany the age of the characters. Perhaps this goes unnoticed by adolescent readers, but reading about 100 year olds behaving like teenagers is hardly credible. All in all, this book should have been cut to half its length.

This is the last of the series I will buy. The books are long on breadth, science, and scientific concepts.

People drive around for months by themselves, plants grow, sometimes people have sex and it moves at the same pace as the ancient glaciers just below the martian surface, that are described in nauseating detail. Seriously, I get the thrill of the science, but what could have been explained in 1 page takes 10. This book could have been 250 pages long and nothing would have been missed.

I found the discussions on terraforming interesting as a scientist, but I think a lot of readers will find it boring. Nothing really happens till the very last chapter and even then, it isn't all that exciting. Robinson's books are really technology driven, characters and a plot take second place.

Green Mars took a long long time to finish.I'm talking months. Painful, depressing months, in which I would pick it off the little wall-shelf thing above my toilet, read a chapter or two while tending to my business, sigh, and put it back.Why? Simple. Red Mars was fun, because it was a proper sci fi book, with the additional colonial political bits. Green Mars is 90% politics/talking about a revolution, and maybe 10% proper sci fi.In short: Take a good idea, then write a sequel and make it suck. No fun here.At least, by the time Robinson started with his political-environmental social responsibility of the scientists babbling in The Years of Rice and Salt, he'd already written a thousand years of cool alternative history, so it wasn't so painful.I dread the concept of starting Blue Mars, even though its sitting on my bookshelf right next to Red and Green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring and dull, dull, dull","review":"I waded through Red Mars and have been given Green Mars as a present.

I could sense that Robinson was extremely proud of the detailed world he created, but the story is horrible. The story unfolds glacially, with no sense of movement. Just when you think you might be getting attached to a character, he/she dies. Interesting story lines get dropped. There are long, long stretches where Robinson just describes everyday life, in excruciating, boring detail. There is no excitement or suspense, no character that grabs you. It's like some dull person's real life, full of routine, disappointment, and boredom. Robinson's typical character has a dream, begins to pursue it, getting you inspired, then gets killed or just gives up and joins the cause he was fighting.This was the worst science fiction I have ever read.

Where to start? First it was boring and tedious. \\"Red Mars\\" at least kept a half-way decent pace, with imporant or interesting events happening every couple of chapters or so. I can scarely think of one in the whole of \\"Green Mars\\". Instead of focusing on the sorts of interesting happenings taking place on a planet in the process of being terraformed, Robinson instead used this book as a soap-box for enviromentalism and anti-capitalist crap. It consisted of people that were either anti-terraforming (that seems to be totally insane to me), communists (or socialists, or eco-socialists or whatever), or people with any other number of weird political stances.

I could probably put two cats in it, in fact.This carrier is quite sturdy and I like the edge-locking system. The top door is a little hard to open, though. It kind of sticks a little; not enough for me to dock a star, though -- I assume it'll loosen up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Use Handle","review":"I'm very disappointed with this carrier. I can not use it for our 14 lb cat because the top door pops open when lifted by the handle. Then when you want to open the top door, you can't because of the poor design of the catches. The top metal wires are all bent up from trying to pop the top open. Seemed like a good design, but I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal.","review":"Lady at the local pet shop recommended this for our 11-lb cats, who are very fluffy and take up a lot of space.

Jared Diamond, after all, can tell us exactly how many domesticable plants there were per square mile on any given coast, and a phalanx of econometric historians tells us how taxes or wages impacted growth at given points in the past.

Books like this one are supposed to be fun and lighthearted. This one definitely is.Most forms of media and entertainment portray the negative shoot 'em up/pregnant teenager/cracked out african american. Other forms show black people shucking and jiving like minstrels. It's fantastic that these women took the time to write about the modern day black woman. Whether you fit into one of the categories or not, doesn't matter. The book shows that there is more to the black woman than the stereotype of a loud, gum popping, neck rolling hoochie named Bonquita. It highlights women with class.

If your parents were not Doctors or Lawyers, if you did not belong to Jack and Jill or the Links cotillion you were unacceptable. Amazingly, they even picked their friends by their complexion. If you were extremely light with long straight hair then you could overcome these obstacles and be apart of the group. I know this book is meant to be funny but my school experience with these kind of women was definitely more of a tragedy than a comedy. Several of these women would not date men who did not have the proper lineage eventhough they had the drive and ambition to attend some of the best schools in the United States.

Worse, our soul purpose in life? Landing a husband. The book strives to be witty and tongue-in-cheek, but is poorly executed; leaving me to ponder: perhaps the writers should have spent less time shopping and husband-hunting in college and more time attending English classes. Many of the famous BAP's listed are bound to be offended, and with good reason: their names are often misspelled. Contrived, mean-spirited, and full of typos, The BAP Handbook fails to bring insight into a fascinating African-American subculture. Instead, it reveals authors that are shallow, and self-indulgent.

I've got a couple of BAP friends and one super BAP-py cousin, but that's it. I can't even claim Butterfly status. So since I'm so far removed from the world of Vineyard summers, cotillions, and Kate Spade (although I do buy MAC Chestnut lipliner religiously and repeatedly remind my children to remember their \\"home training\\"), it was hard for me to tell when this book was being tongue-in-cheek and when it was just plain out pretentious.I can't recommend this book, but I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it, either. It has it's funny moments, but I just could not relate. And I don't think any self-respecting \\"GDI\\" will relate, either.

This album stays true to its roots, but also pushes the envelope. The pushes are subtle, as Bruford's latest edition of Earthworks performs seamless riffs and signatures, like 11/4 (whoh!). If you're looking for Crimson or Yes here, be reminded that Bruford (like Steve Smith, formerly of Journey, and Sting, to name a few) started out as jazz wannabe's, but were drawn in different directions. So, it's no accident that the progressive groupings of the 60's and 70's came about as a result of the widely varied musical background from whence they came. Some - unfortunately few - are still at it and naturally seek out the new talent to keep it fresh. Bruford, in any musical setting, remains in a class of his own. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Earth Works CD to have","review":"This is a great jazz CD. A bit avant agrde, a bit ecclectic but a great listen. Acoustic bass, drums, piano, sax and horns from a great but mostly unheard and unknown 4 piece. Bill has been around the block a time or 2. Most all Bill Bruford music is hard driving modern jazz/fusion but most importantly with melody, pace and rythmn. The other Earth works issues contain none of this to my ears. APart... is a breath of fresh air. Very nicely recorded, audiophile sound with great piano and bass miking. And of course Bill is there but more in the back ground than ever before but still driving the bus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not GNC! - But...","review":"I know the photo shows the GNC box next to the bottle that says Arginmax in GNC lettering but this product comes in a different box and is made by another company.

I noticed the difference almost immediately in firmness and spontaneity. As I qualifier I have to say that I began taking this at pretty much the same time that I quit smoking, after 30 years of puffing them down, so I really can't say if the result was due to this product or the quitting smoking or a combination or the 2 factors.

She did however have an African American friend Christie who had an African American boyfriend (can't remember his name, but it wasn't Ken). She also had a Hispanic friend, a red-headed friend, and a brunette friend, and none of their names were Barbie. In this age of political correctness, I see more reverse racism then anything else.

This makes me queasy about the rest of the \\"stories\\" the author cites.Besides, the Rosenblatt falsehood, I found nothing concrete to find a soulmate.

The author's theoretical knowledge of clinical psychology and her spiritual strength and understanding combine to elucidate many of the pitfalls that we all fall prey to in our pursuit of romantic love. Capturing another's heart, as we all long to do, requires knowing what you are doing, and the author supplies the reader with what appear to be the necessary tools. It is written in a lucid, witty and often amusing style that is succinct and fresh in its approach.

The doll was boring, and my daughter ended up in tears wondering why Santa wouldn't just leave a note saying the toy didn't work well, and give her something else.

She was very frustrated that the doll didn't respond to her movements in the play with me mode. Needless to say, she ended up ripping off the bracelets and storming off to another room.

What an expensive, overrated, piece of plastic clicking junk. Mattel, you should be ashamed of yourselves putting this product on the market and raping the blue collar man of his hard earned money. My daughter was anticipating getting this from Santa. Of course, Santa brings it. The most exciting part of this toy, was watching her rip it out of the paper and box. To her dismay, and crocodile tears, it did NOTHING like the commercial. We traded it for \\"Bella Dancerella\\". Now she has a toy that she is content with. Seriously, if you want a good toy, DO NOT buy this Barbie product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing, and poor quality","review":"After considering whether I properly managed my expectations, I am confident that 1 star is an appropriate rating based on my daughters reaction. A Barbie fanatic, she quickly tired of watching the the underwhelming \\"following\\" feature.The doll reminds me of the jerky toys from 20 to 25 years ago (that I grew up with). The doll produces a noise similar to large hydraulic construction equipment, which it attempts to drown out with a very loud soundtrack. Also the set requires a whopping 13 batteries to operate...13!!! Seeing how the base set is not easilly mobile, a corded option would have been an easy upgrade to this set... saving batteries and improving performance. That is the whole point... it feels as if the designers did not care that an extra few pennies in production cost would improve the product.In a nutshell... Mattel is reallying on the Barbie name to make a few dollars, and they do not care that they are dissapointing children and their parents"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"This was the one big thing my 5 year old asked Santa for this year. Needless to say, she was disappointed that the \\"elves\\" let this one through because it didn't work. There's nothing worse to a kid than a broken toy from Santa on Christmas morning. The only thing that moved on the doll was the leg. One arm moved a little and then clicked continuously and the other one didn't move at all. We bought a replacement doll only to find out that one of the arms was messed up on it to. We are now on doll number 3 and beginning to loose our patience. If she did not want this doll so desperately, it would definately be going back for good. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that the doll is exceptionally beautiful and my daughter totally loves her, even not working. Now if we can only find one that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought this for my 6 year old niece who loves ballet and barbie.

Pretty well everywhere in the book, at least on the Veritie side, is accurately the town where I live, and that makes for a lot of fun for the local reader (only Blackacre Farm is made up out of the whole cloth, SFAIK). How much that is worth to a reader 4000 miles away, I am not sure, but I think it probably helps to give the book depth.The book *is* very chatty and the plot a tad predictable, but it's pretty well written, and I suspect that it serves as the introductory volume of a series. I hope so. I'm not particularly taken by the Haven books, but I would certainly follow if it develops as a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawk and Fisher, where are you?","review":"Didn't really care for this. I really prefer the Haven/Hawk&Fisher books. The story dragged, the characters talked too much, and the ending felt rushed. For all of the 'end of the world is at hand' I didn't really feel any tension or threat from this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comic book without the pictures","review":"If you bought this book based on the rear cover summary, you're in for a surprise...and not a pleasant one. Instead of the expected semi-serious (or at least moderately dignified) literary excursion, you're treated to a tossed salad of comic-book style action, a jumble of confused and reused mythology, and heaping helpings of lowbrow humor. Toby, our protagonist, is the only character above the level of cardboard, and he simply alternates between a desire to fall in love and a fear of farting in public. I'd excuse it all if the jokes were at least funny, but they mostly set your teeth on edge.If you're the sort of person who finds nothing strained in Norse gods \\"getting with modern times\\" by becoming private eyes, and considers the characterization of Satan as a handsome, oily-tongued rogue in a three-piece suit as \\"new and refreshing\\", then you'll probably adore this book. If not, you'll have a hard time even finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept, but seriously flawed execution","review":"I picked out this book because the premise sounded interesting and I was looking for a light, enjoyable read; I couldn't have picked a worse book.The prose is painfully repetitious. Green seems to think that his readers can't remember basic plot points or character background for more than ~10 pages. The characters themselves are cute and funny, but barely one dimensional. The dialog is unnatural with many illogical jumps just to further the plot.For anyone who enjoys a good story with quality writing and characterization, don't bother buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"PASTY and TASTY.......","review":"The 'Lower Depths' aka L.A.

The movie is a brilliant classic that can seriously open your mind to the emptiness of the status quo life; the madness in being just another, normal, blank face in the crowd; the option we all have to live like royalty, by our own rules, in our own right. Most people won't understand because they've never explored themselves deeply enough and critically enough to simply let themselves go crazy. There is a real point to farting, belching, and getting the snot knocked out of you in a dingy alley, just like there is a point to climbing a mountain. It's about that internal journey one must face if he is not to whither away amidst the mundane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie, Bad DVD!","review":"I recently saw this movie on television and bought it.

When I finally viewed it I was very under-whelmed, I suppose I was hoping for too much. Faye Dunaway is tremendous, but the constant boozing and fistfights didn't seem like too much of a stretch for Mickey Rourke to play so it was hard to judge his acting in the film.

I remember watching it along time ago but now that I'm older (and hopefully wiser), it really had an impact on me. Of course Mickey R and Faye D. were both wonderful but the message which I received was really growth inspiring. The essence for me was \\"live and let live\\"! Faye D allowed Mickey to be the person he wanted to be - no materialism, even though she always looked nice and he looked unkept, she loved him for who he was and accepted him unconditionally.

It's unorganized and the research was sloppily done. After reading it, I still don't get what the author is trying to achieve.

This is a mediocre book at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most twisted book","review":"The author made many of her subjects look very bad from Krush, Vicary, Kosteniuk, Polgar, Gaprindashvili, Crotto to Savereide, etc. Her view about promoting chess and women's chess is completely twisted. Stay as a feminist if you wish but stay away from chess. This is an embarrassment to the chess community for a few bucks. As a chess player, the author supposed to know how to think ahead. The author didn't. She didn't care about the feelings or welfare of her colleagues. She's out to get fame and fortune and disregard everyone else. Shame on you! You're no role model for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful!","review":"Why use this title? Why Ms. Shahade? You're supposed to be our role model. Most of the female players in the 70's and 80's are lesbians? What's this about? It's pure gossip and speculation. This book is shockingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of positive flow","review":"This book has several major flaws. One of the flaws is the lack of positive flow. Shahade tried to be too fancy with her witting style. My advice is learn to walk first. She is very ambitious with her first real work. That is commendable but she failed way short of that goal. Way off on the mark! The chess info is adequate but her conclusions are quite shallow. She did not dig deep enough. She wants to be controversial but she's afraid to go too far. Her book resembles her chess playing style, lack of control and too chaotic. 100% attack without regard to King safety. The same can be said about the author sexuality, simply too confusing. Can't go through life that way. Like the author but can't recommend this book. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An appalling book","review":"You have no idea how disappointing this book is. It defines one of the problems in chess. Shahade is an excellent writer who's willing to write about sex, lies and chess to sell a couple books. There're tons of trivial mistakes and misinformaton which could have been easily checked. I shows that neither her or publisher cared enough to put out a good book. I would personally never buy another book from Ms. Shahade again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting topic, poorly written","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, I must say that I'm disappointed. There're plenty more exciting women chess characters out there. Shahade could have done a much better job with her selection.It's nice to read about Savereide and Crotto. My understanding of Shahade's assessment of Kosteniuk as an self-centered ego maniac / gold digger who married a much older control freak is right on. That's about the best part of the book. Her assessment of others are not deep enough. She should have gone a lot deeper.Shahade's writing is not smooth. It could use little more polishing. This book is too ambitious for a first book and she missed the mark. Therefore, I give two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird book","review":"To say the queen is commonly referred to as the \\"bitch\\" in chess is full of it. No chess player has heard of this. The publisher is trying to hype the book by trying to make Shahade into someone she's not. Shahade is an average writer at best. The book is very unorganized. Hanging out in bars till 3AM and listening to \\"alternative\\" pop when she's not at the chessboard is not a good way to be a good role model for kids. I think the author sold her soul to sell a couple extra books. It is unfortunate. However, the publisher did a great job marketing an average book."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt!!!","review":"Having read the reviews. I have no other options than to give 5 stars.When you write such crap in your review you should at least have the courage of writing your real name at the bottom of your review. Some reviews are so badly biased in one way (the way that hurts the author of course) that it looks like the reviewer felt that hiding behing a nickname or a fake name was mandotary.If you are currently reading the reviews because your thinking of buying the book, please be aware that you've got to have the book in your hand in order to be sure that some allegations made in those reviews are true.Luc Fortin from Canada"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do find the book's title odd","review":"I do find the book's title odd, given that most female players (Miss Shahade included) would be offended at somebody calling them \\"bitches\\". I certainly never thought of Miss Shahade as a \\"bitch\\". The title is just a silly, immature idea. Nobody in chess circles call female players of any strength \\"bitch\\"; I have no clue as to where Silman or Shahade got the idea from, but it was not chess, that's for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low values","review":"I don't understand the main idea behind this book. Is it to promote women's chess or is it to promote feminism and trashy values? Yes, there're some history of women's chess in this book. However, it also contains a lot of Ms. Shahade's personal feminist views. It would be naive to believe that the rest of America would agree with Ms. Shahade. It would be naive to believe that most of the female chess players in the 70's and 80's are lesbians as claimed by Ms. Shahade. This is the sort of outrageous opinion that makes this book somewhat like the Jerry Springer show with a touch of Howard Stern. I will never read anything else by Ms. Shahade again. I don't appreciate her style and poor values."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening attitude","review":"This book demonstrates the decline of the American society. It's sickening to see people cheering such trash. Have you no shame? The author is no more than a entry-level writer. The book is full of errors on many counts. Her view is quite shallow and naive. Even the author has no idea what she wants to bring out in this book. 1 star is more than generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way below expectation","review":"I was expecting a lot more from this book. Unfortunately, it's nothing like I had anticipated. Shahade is a creative writer. However, that alone can't carry this book. The researches were very poorly done. She made too many assumptions based on her narrow view instead of stating things as they are. It's truly a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bargain - Not worth the price","review":"It's unfortunate that Ms. Jennifer is portraying her friends Krush, Vicary and Kournikova wannabe in very poor fashion. She also made far too many errors in this book. She's a good loud spoken feminist but a very poor writter. There're some decent parts in the book but few and between. That's why I'm giving it this rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total gossip","review":"This is the most controversial chess book ever written. At first, I thought this would be a book about women in chess history. To my total disappointment, it turned out to be chess gossip book which includes some sexual fantasies of various chess players. It is too bad that a high level female chess player as Ms. Shahade would write such a book. Another problem with this book is the level of writing and the direction of the book. It seems that the author is way over her head with this book. There are also plenty of grammatical and factual errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating ! Thanks!","review":"Thanks for this book -- one of the best I've read on chess players. Fascinating insight into what it takes for women in the 20th century, from the intellectual efforts to the social battles. Playing chess like a girl, from socialites to exotic dancers, is rough.Good title. Drew my attention to this great experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two thumbs down","review":"Two thumbs down for this book. The offensive title is just one of many problems with this book. There're countless factual errors. There're also many other problems with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total gossip","review":"I have several problems with Chess Bitch. It's unorganized and the research was sloppily done. After reading it, I still don't get what the author is trying to achieve. The book is completely lack of focus and direction. It seems that it's part chess history, part gossip, part revenge and part of everything else thrown in.Some characters in Chess Bitch were made to look very bad such as Rachel Crotto, Liz Vicary, Alex Shabalov, Irina Krush, Sasha Kosteniuk, etc. Not sure why but it seems that way.The most silly mistake is Kasparov being a World Champion in 1980. Jenny also made Kasparov look very bad. One has to assume for personal reason. I hope the next book will be better. This one is quite disappointing. There were also oodles of other mistakes and poor research.Overall, the book is perfect for the liberal left wing feminists. On the other hand, it's not recommended for the rest. You'd be blacklisted and laughed at if you publish a book like this in some serious chess country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally shocking","review":"I can't believe this book. Lame! Very lame! The biggest chess smut ever! Who came up with this shockingly bad idea?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generation gap","review":"I met Ms. Shahade twice. She's a dynamic speaker and a beautiful young lady. However, this book doesn't match her qualities. One of the mistakes I found so far is Kasparov didn't become World Champion in 1980. Karpov was the Champion then. There were a few others.Perhaps I don't understand the feminist movement or perhaps we have a generation gap but I just don't understand the title. If you want to create a controversy to sell books then you got what you wanted. I view the title as a negative and for this reason alone, I cannot recommend this book to young people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"OK, maybe the title is a bit much but the book itself is fantastic, great story telling for both chess and non-chess players alike, many fascinating characters are described, and the book is hard to put down. A very enjoyable read.It appears that Ms. Shahade's book has angered a certain person in the chess world (who wrote a book on the Polgars) and that person has posted many fake reviews here. As you read these reviews you should pay much more attention to the ones where people used their real names."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this book with great expectation. I must say that I'm disappointed. The writing is fine but the chapters are so disorganized. Jennifer jumped from one place to another. It is almost impossible to follow. In addition, I feel that there're just too much speculations. It seems like the same style of writing as in chess gossips. I was expecting something much better and classier. She's a good player but her writing is not nearly in the same level. This is something I would expect from a HS student, not a serious author."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL AND AWESOME BOOK!!!","review":"Jennifer Shahade is a true role model for girls of any age. Now she brings to light what things are like for women in this traditionally male sport of the mind.I would also like to confront the chess staker and knock the **** out of them.I am glad that Jennifer Shahade has written the most dynamic and interesting chess book ever written. I don't care about the title and more to her for making such a smart marketing move.When are you going to write CB2? Or will it be title the CBReturns, or what? COOL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHOCKINGLY BRILLIANT WORK: Shows the true nature of the world of women's chess (just the way it is!!)","review":"WOW!!!Want the truth of \\"inner circle\\" of women's chess? This is the only book that has an author with the \\"guts\\" to tell you the way it is, the way people really are and how women (girls) can get ahead in chess.OK, so this is not a \\"G\\" rated approach. But, we don't really live a \\"G\\" rated world. This book is not written for little kids, so Jennifer Shadede's CHESS STALKER should grow up and stop making it an almost daily practice to write reviews to downgrade her book. This person should get \\"Breaking Through\\" by Polgar if they want a \\"G\\" rated book that shows everything and everyone as being rosey and every girl as \\"Snow White\\".Jennifer knows her stuff and tells it like it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising Combination","review":"I must say, based on the cover and the title I was expecting to find things in the book to dislike that I didn't. Shahade succeeds where many can't in providing a really comprehensive description of women in chess without the writing becoming dense or too mechanically structured. Very honest, very fun, autobiographical without being pretentious or self absorbed. I am only being captious when I write in this review that some pages on the psychology/neuropsychology of gender differences might have made it even better! Shahade has the courage to identify herself as and breech feminist topics without being preachy or ideological. Also, photographs that go well and add to the text, which many books do not do well. Good job Jennifer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Many problems with the book","review":"The big problem with this book is the poor choice of title and the amateurish cover that makes it look silly. Other problems are that it unfortunately isn't well organized and not particularly well written.The history sections are good but flawed. The fact that some were published as standalone articles does result in too many repetition of material. It is very disturbing to start a new chapter and then read almost verbatim some material you just completed.Also poorly done is the bias look at some of the modern players she knows, including her friends, showing their bad points including some very odd ideas some of them have. Her friends are made out to be sex maniac, self-centered shopping queen and Anna Nicole Smith who married for wealth and fortune.Overall, the book is perfect for the liberal left wing feminists. On the other hand, it's not recommended for the rest. You'd be blacklisted and laughed at if you publish a book like this in some serious chess country."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unusual chess book ever","review":"I can't believe the title when I first saw it. I was asking myself how could any woman write a book with this title? This book is similar to the style of B... magazine. I'm also very disappointed in how WGM Kosteniuk and WGM Krush are being portrayed. They are much nicer than the way they are described in this book. Mrs. Shahade is making WGM Kosteniuk look like fame and fortune seeker by marrying someone who is old enough to be her uncle and IM Krush look like an airhead selfish shopaholic. It's very disappointing to see how the author describes other female players. The oddest part is when the author talks about her attraction to her female opponents. Is this a coming out of the closet book? Very strange, the strangest chess book ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted views","review":"It's important to point out that, even in chess circles, the word bitch has never been used in a positive manner, and the (chess piece) queen has never been alluded to as a \\"bitch\\", as the publisher claims. Perhaps people not familiar with chess circles can buy into those silly arguments, but us real chess players (yes, I'm a chess player) know better than that.It's quite naive of anyone's part to try to justify the use of the word \\"bitch\\" as something other than an ill-advised attempt at drawing some attention to the book. In spite of the author (and Silman's) twisted explanations trying to present the word bitch in a positive light, the reacrtion is a natural one: no english-speaking person can point to an instance of the word \\"bitch\\" used in a non-pejorative way.The book itself is not interesting to people who are non feminist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype, not enough substance","review":"This book is more hype than substance. This book clearly benefits from the title Chess Bitch. It's unfortunate that the author is using chess to promote her feminist platform. It's highly inappropriate especially when she has many young players looking up to her.I find this book average at best. However, because of the outrageous title, I can only give it one star. I agree with many other reviewers in not recommending this book for young people under 17."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor taste. Bad example. Shameful.","review":"This book is in poor taste. Beside the hype, there's nothing else in it that is worth reading. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book - Very poor work","review":"This book is utterly ridiculous. Shahade doesn't seem to know where to go with this book. It has to be one of the most unorganized books. It totally lacks focus. This isn't about history of women's chess. It's about the dirt of some women players according to Shahade. The quality of the writing is extremely poor. Most of her subjects are not so interesting. Oh, and what about the dozen errors with chess facts? It seems that Shahade is clueless and was too lazy to double check her stuff. If you like sex and gossip, buy this book. If you like a good chess book, this is not the one. And no children under 15 should read this book. I was quite offended by this book. The title is also in poor taste. Yes, I'm a USCF rated OTB chess player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Facts are facts-- there are fewer smarter women than smart men, unfortunatley","review":"Most women cannot compete with men in chess on equal footing. Sure, there are some very smart women out there, but fewer than smart men. The IQ distribution for women is narrower than for men. Meaning there are fewer women geniuses, but also fewer women idiots. (See the research of Prof. Camille Benbow of Vanderbilt U.) That's why women chess players do not compete in men's championships. There are 1,300 male chess grandmasters worldwide, but only 13 women. (That's why the Chess Federation came up with a special rank, WGM-- Woman Grandmaster. Not equal to GM.)This book tries to go around this basic fact. Unfortunately it cannot.Do not misunderstand-- I'd love to have more really smart women around. I love really smart women; but unfortunately they are not that many. Certainly not as many as smart men. Perhaps they do deserve a chess book of their own. But this is not one such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prove it!!","review":"If women are the equal or the superior of men in chess-then prove it over the board. Look at the record of J. Polgar against the likes of the top 10. It proves she can almost play with the best. But where are the rest of the women? It is not in the female nature to play a mans game and the lack of strong females at the top reflects this truth of nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have !!!","review":"This is a great book! A liitle wooly and cunning lamb outwits a coyote - over and over and over. It's easy enough for children to understand and sophisticated enough for an adult to read over and over and over and just one more time mom, please. The illstrations will make you laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Borreguita and the Coyote","review":"I so wanted my children to like this book. The artwork is attractive and I like to expose them to literature from other cultures, but they just did not take to it.Although the story is fresh and has its amusing side, my son would just wonder away and no one (either the 3 y.o. nor the 5 y.o.) asked for it to be read again, even after multiple readings. (I don't assume that they will take to a book the first time.) Further, my daughter, who is the sensitive sort, was bothered by the fact that the coyote wanted to eat poor little borreguita.We love \\"Bringing the Rain to Kapiti Plain\\" by Verna Aardema but that book has more of a rhythmic cadence that this book lacks and perhaps that is why it was not a hit in my house.That said, you can see from the other reviews that other children loved it. And it is not that this is not a good book, but if your children are like mine you just might want to try it out at the library first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this story!","review":"After seeing this story performed at a children's theater with my granddaughter, I bought the book for her. It is a wonderful story and teaches about creative problem solving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful mexican folktale","review":"This book is very funny and is very imaginative. Very interesting to read folktales from my country Mexico that I even didn't read before. I also liked the illustrations and the fact that this book contains a Glossary with terms in Spanish so it can help teachers and parents pronounce the words correctly. I would love to read this book among 4 year old preschoolers and children in Kindergarten."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good record and performance.","review":"Very good record and performance. If any people interested on old music you have to buy it. This is a old music on a new record. But very difficult to find this label in any store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to give it one star?","review":"This book is bad. I mean really bad. My IQ has gone down significantly after two long, torturous semesters using this book. When I was in high school, physics was a reasonably enjoyable experience. Now, I would rather ingest a suppository than read this book.

It is a great movie. It had a lot more sex than I expected from a movie from 1968, but it was approached in a mature and realistic manner. The DVD has a cool documentary called \\"The Skydivers\\" that explains the men behind all the awesome freefalling cinematography. It also includes an insightful commentary track from the film's director. Gene Hackman is great in this movie as the hard partying Catholic stuntman. Burt Lancaster is relied as more of a stoic and recognizable force than a heavy-handed performance. See this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"a classic","review":"An old favorite film of mine that should be on DVD. Good performances but limited story that develops characters too quickly and ends too abruptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"D851","review":"D851 was my expert skydiving license number.From a techincal aspect i found it boring.Of all the great movies Burt Lancaster and Deborah KERR made as a team and individually,i felt this was closing the curtin on two GREAT careers.I would have elected to have had retired while on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this silly movie","review":"This glorified soap opera is a waste of a great cast. What other reviewers call \\"spare dialog\\" I call unnaturallly long pauses between phrases, especially on the part of Lancaster and Kerr.The plot seems to revolve around how these professional skydivers are afraid to jump out of planes and sometimes forget to pull their rip cord (I kid you not).There are some swell aerial scenes at the beginning and end, plus you get to see Deborah Kerr naked, but otherwise this movie is just awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Berware of spyware","review":"While I enjoyed the added mechs, this software and its counterpart clan arsenal contain the C-Dilla spyware. The Black Knight expansion pack also contains it. This is a copywrite protection program that installs on your machine and does not shut down after you exit the game. TurboTax also installs the program and the only way to remove it is to download and run the safecast uninstaller program from the intuit website. Including this program was a terrible thing for Microsoft to do, especially since it does not disclose the fact at any time."},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than keeping the phone in your pocket","review":"I used this for about a week before abandoning it. The good news is that it kept the phone handy, and it was easy to extract the phone when needed. The bad news is that the grip was too loose, and the release trigger caught on everything. My phone self-ejected three times for every one time I really wanted to pull it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Before I started taking this, I was real forgetful and I have only been taking this for a few weeks and already I can see a change. I would recommend it to anyone who is having trouble remembering and, also, it helps the nervous system and Amazon is a great place to order this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wild Read","review":"This was a wild read. Sex, romance, wilderness, wolves, good guys, bad guys, and a moral to the story. The story is about those who love the west and do battle to protect the land and its wildlife. Many of the characters and events are probably emulations from the author's own life that has been dedicated to the protection of wilderness and wildlife. If you want to gain a sense about why some people are willing to devote their lives to the wild then read this book. When you are done, choose your place to stand and defend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without A Warning","review":"I guess you couldn't really appreciate this CD if you never saw the live show which was innncredible. I worked for this band as well as til'tuesday and The Cars who were all playing the same clubs in and around Boston and New England in the same era. Laurie Sargent had the phenomenal range in her voice and the duelling guitar leads were nothing less than intense. If they ever had a chance to cut a live CD they would have went much further. Its a shame they were sold shot by their record company who thought they were going to make it as a disco band. This was high energy at its best, dance from start to finish, a marathon that was great to watch. These guys were hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her very best","review":"I've read all the Mary Wesley books I can find, and this one is my favorite. It's better if you have read her _The_Camomile_ Lawn_ first; but this is a very different book, lighter-hearted than some of her stories. It is funny, sometimes touching, and refuses to turn out the way you expect. Really delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. The writing is excellent. The author really paints a picture with his words, makes you feel like you are right there in the scene. It is full of adventure and the old West. I would rank this author among the greats, right beside Louis La'Mour, Zane Grey, etc.I would recommend it to anymore who loves a good story or a great western.

All the major themes that run through his other later books, such as changes in English village life, the relevance and imminence of the supernatural, and strong, well-developed characters both male and female, are all present here."},{"rating":"1","title":"ghost characters","review":"Salter's poetic prose at times reads too precious. Characters come and go, are left behind- vanish, in a picaresque of loss and despair. What kept me reading was Salter's evocative description of place. He has the ability to distill the essence of geography with the skill of a cartographer while holding fast to the invisible details that bring a terrain to life. Perhaps I am faulting Salter for the book he in fact aimed to write. Light Years is about what the poet John Ashberry calls \\"time's silent roar\\" and its indifference to all within earshot of its muted din. Salter's vaporous characters inhabit a ghost-like nether world intimating with each jaded aside: \\"We are here only for so long, and there's not a damn thing we can do about it.\\" They remain on the page, never jumping full to life- obscure, shadowed, and with the pall of death lingering over them like a coming storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"One dissenting voice","review":"I just could not get into this book. The pace is glacially slow, and the voice painful -- there is a singsong quality that is so sappy I just couldn't read on. I seem to be in the minority here, so my suggestion to you is to read the first page or two before buying and see if you can stand the voice. Some people love it, but you may not agree. I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares?","review":"I admire James Salter's Hemingway-styled sentences, or sentence fragments. They are pointed and powerful. They tell you a lot in a very few words, just like Papa did. The only problem I have, and it's a big problem, is that I don't give a hoot about his characters. They are a bunch of upper middle class snobs whose only problem is who is screwing who. They have nothing to overcome except their own pettiness and their stupid lives. Maybe that's Salter's point, but it is not interesting. Of course I may be jaundiced because I have been reading Toni Morrison and Erskine Caldwell and Richard Wright, whose characters were trying to find something to eat or pay the rent. These people had real problems. If you read a book just for the writing then Salter is your man, but if you want characters you care about, then skip this crap,unless you're a snob yourself.Ed Arnold"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice buy","review":"the quelity is good it catches the light the gold has a rich gold look to it ,the claps should have been a little bigger"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've found so far!","review":"My son has developmental delays and benefits from taking an omega 3 supplement.

Characterization remains shallow, and description is often extraneous. The present tense narration doesn't work well for the story, as the action is described in a detached fashion, for the most part. Considering what she experiences, Kat is one cool female--too cool for me to believe in.Awkward sentences and occasional grammar lapses were disengaging, as well.I'm afraid I can't fathom any comparison to Crichton and other well-known writers here--other than the plot. It's a good plot. Politics, medicine, war, romance, murders, your typical best-seller plot elements are all here. The book is in need of major editing and revision, though, if it is to catapult the author to the level of other bestselling thriller writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I have already written a review for this product. The book looked good when it arrived and it arrived on time. I was not aware of the delicate nature of the binding and it fell apart as I was reading. I wrote a review indicating my displeasure.The seller promptly replied indicating that those \\"pulp\\" paperbacks were poorly constructed and no one could predict when the binding might go although they said they do check the books. I did not ask for a refund. I am still annoyed because even a book that is said to be in \\"fair\\" condition should certainly allow the reader one read through before it falls apart in your hands.

A very few films are able to catch the feel of a time lost to us. This is one of them. It was made in the late '70's about the early '60's. The music helps drive the effect home that we are glimpsing the era as no early \\"60's style film could have shown us. Its a bittersweet romp about a Brooklyn gang-kind of a Junior Achievers Mafia. Nice little things like how Kennedy's assasination is experienced and the Bob Dylan \\"cameo\\" show the creators knew of what they spoke. The Ducky Boys final episode is masterfully spooky and still gives me chills. Too bad Ken Wahl pretty much disappeared after reaching the top in Wiseguy. If you lived in the '60's I think you will enjoy this nostalgic film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanderers rule!","review":"I loved this movie when I first watched in the early eighties. Gang members and fratmen can identify with most characters and groups portrayed in the film (Wanderers' leader Ritchie, strongman Perry, warmonger Joey, pathetically wimpy and psychologically disturbed Turkey, etc.). In a nutshell, an inter-racial conflict resolved through non-violent means (a football game!) with a climatic \\"rumble\\" uniting Italian, colored and Asian gangs. Fights scenes could have used more work, though (scenes in \\"The Warriors\\" and \\"The Outsiders\\" appeared better choreographed), but all-in-all a great movie with a memorable and nostalgic soundtrack (Four Seasons, Ben E. King, Dion, etc) to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CULT CLASSIC","review":"I stumbled across this film when I was about 13 years old. Since that day I have been a huge fan.

But im sure alot of the older generation would stand right with me on this one. I guess its just that the world changed in so many ways. And things are more complicated today.

But the cream always rises to the top and this soundtrack is simply superb. This is a movie steeped in urban New York mythology.Not to be missed. The movie could double as a Sociology class on the immigrant New York experience as we watch the Irish, Italian, Polish, Black and Chinese youth struggle over their piece of the turf in the Bronx of 1963.The movie works on multiple levels -- unearthing a tender love and care for the Italian youth who comprise the gang of the Wanderers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk like a man!!!","review":"Great film of the late 70's. Ken Wahl did a excellent job as Richie, a Italian gang member in the early 60's dealing with friendship, race and poverty in the Bronx. Shows in great depth of how people of different origins were looked upon in the early 60's. What I liked most about the film is how they were able to overcome their differences to celebrate Richie's marriage and stick together against the Ducky Boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ducky Boys.","review":"I have always liked this movie but damn when I think of it..all I can remember is being so damn scarred of the Ducky Boys..they seemed so homicidal.

This song is horrible. Its constant air play is beginning to induce anxiety attacks in me. The lyrics are unremarkable, hackneyed .... What is this trend to add ridiculous digital effects to voice, can't anyone sing anymore? It sounds like .... The single note guitar entry is just awful and dissonant. The insanely repetitive hook and lyric is enough to extract confessions to crimes uncommitted. The melody's carriage with the simple rhythm ...why am I going on? this song absolutely ... rat bones...I've never heard any on Starland Vocal Band's other songs (other than the one hit), but I bet this was copied from whatever album that was on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loyal PictureIt User","review":"I know people who spent a fortune on programs like Adobe Photoshop because they wanted \\"the best.\\" But they end up using PictureIt! because it's just plain easier.

I personaly think HOLY WOOD is his best work , because of the strong GUITAR and BASS work and the unforgetable LYRICS. i like all the songs on the album, from beginning to end. The best songs though some would say are THE NOBODIES, FIGHT SONG, DISPOSABLE TEENS. They are right those songs are incredible, but there is so much more on this album. One guys review i read on hear said he loved this album cause its basically the downward spiral part 2. That guy has to be smoking crack and a lot of it at that. these guys are way way better than nin. NIN doesn't even have many musicians and its all keybords most of the time, wippy da dippidy do, at least MANSON and crew have talent and know there way around the music. I'd recomend this album to anyone who doesn't want to listent to a fake........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Wood C.D","review":"Well what can I say this 1 is a \\"beauty\\" my heart was doing something like 1000 beates per second when I heard the its was comming to New Zealand, even more so the my fav music store Echo was havin a mid night opening.THE C.DSeems to me that it has not lost the elements of Anti-Christ nor Mechanical Animals but has added both sounds from recordings to Holy Wood, The sound is much the same as Mechanical Animals as in the mixing side of it goes and how it is presented. BUT ideally the lyics seem to be more towards Anti-Christ and about HATE,.Like any MANSON C.D there is alot of engery in it, I Love all tracks on this recording more so then Mechanical Animals. Its more intence and hard out then compared to the other two C.D's and I would recomend BUYING IT and reviewing it"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is his best","review":"This is one of my two favorite manson albums.(Antichrist Superstar being the other). The songs \\"Fight Song\\" and \\"Disposable Teens\\" are the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Before i actually bought this cd i had Antichrist Superstar and listend to Mechanical Animals,Smells Like Children,and Portrait of an American Family. I liked all of them so when i went to the cd store the nest time i decided to buy this one as it was the only one there. I kind of new what to expect but that was a while ago, now i really enjoy this cd. My fav tracks are Coma Black,The Fight Song,The Nobodies,Valentines Day and more.If you like Manson you should buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Wood - Amazing Album","review":"this is one of marilyn mansons best albums in my opinion. my favourite songs being the Nobodies and President Dead. If you like marilyn mansons 'gothic' sound then this is a great album, definately a worthwhile buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not a masterpeice","review":"Marilyn again assaults his audience with beautifuly dark images from the cover to the final track, but at times it seems that the art takes precedent over the music. While it can reach points of true beauty, it is marred by tracks such as \\"disposable teens\\", which seems to me to be the band's attempt at going trendy. Even the name of the track embodies the same message as \\"the beautiful people\\", but in easier, less cryptic terms so the rest of the Slipknot loving masses can understand it. \\"Coma Black\\" never reaches the true genius of the original, and that is a dissapointment as that was the track I was looking most forward to. Other than that there are many great artistic tracks, and while I think Marilyn is never going to be able to reproduce the sheer genius of Portrait of an American Family, he makes a good effort. Worth buying, but only if your attention span is long enough to recognise great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Trip to Holy Wood","review":"I bought Holywood yesterday and already I know the words to every song and can't stop singing. It is such a good cd. The Fight Song...that is one of the best songs that I have heard in a long time. I have all of Manson's other cds, but this is the first one that I have fallen in love with the same day as I bought it. Buy this!! Show America that Manson is here to stay. Let's make them number one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"On this album the king of Goth attempts to fuse his masterpiece Antichrist Superstar and his medicore Mechanical Animals. This is definitley one of my favorite CDs, almost all the tracks are worthy of praise. This is not quite as good as Anitchrist but its definiley worth your money if you enjoy Marilyn's albums. Highly Reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!.........POSSIBLY MANSON'S BEST!","review":"WOW! This CD is amazing! Holy Wood is possibly the best Manson CD yet! A must for all Manson fans.

Hes Outdone Himself","review":"alright check this out. im not a big manson fan but i have heard alot about this cd and soon to be released book. i have read everything about it and i still had no clue how good it was going to be. i came home, popped in the cd and listened. from track one it was one of the best cds ive ever heard. Manson really has outdone himself and has once again brought his name back, in my opinion, to the gods of rock. if your even thinking about buying this cd stop thinking and get it. i garuntee you will love it more then any other cd he has ever made.(Machanical Animal SUCKED)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whiny twit...","review":"This is probably the best comedy album out! Who could possibly take this whiny circus clown seriously? Your 15 minutes are up, Manson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but...","review":"Definitely not MM's best. That title for me personally is of course, Antichrist Superstar (my favorite because it is basically The Downward Spiral pt.II...) Holywood was still pretty MM heavy and not quite as pop/glam-goth as some of them were. Still recommended for fans of MM, NIN, and industrial goth in general, but only after you own Antichrist or Mechanical Animals."},{"rating":"2","title":"MANSON ROCKS !!!","review":"This is Manson's best CD to date it is the perfect blend of \\"Antichrist Superstar\\" and \\"Mechanical Animals\\" and is the one of the best CD's I have bought. Some of the my favourite tracks include \\"The Love Song\\" \\"The Fight Song\\" \\"Disposable teens\\" \\"Target Audiance\\" \\"The Nobodies\\" \\"The Death Song\\" \\"Burning Flag\\" \\"Valentines Day\\" and \\"King Kill 33\\" and all the others are good to. This finishes the trilogy that Manson started back in 96 with \\"Antichrist Superstar\\". I would recomend this CD for new and old Manson fans alike and anyone who likes good music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"Despite the cover, this CD is NOT the heaviest offering from Manson. It may be darker for some people, but it's not as insane as one would think of ACS. I'm only saying that to specify it, not to make the CD seem bad in comparison. Because the CD isn't bad at all.This is the kind of CD that takes a while to get used to. Chances are the first time you'll hear it, you'll regret buying it. How much you like it really depends on how many times you heard it.Angry/depressed teens will definitely seek refuge in the music contained in Holy Wood (as well as any other Manson CDs)I like to end my reviews by suggesting a song that curious people should download without the fear of ruining any surprises. For Holy Wood, I suggest \\"A Place In The Dirt\\". In my opinion, it's the most average song on the album, and the one you're most likely to forget. If you like that particular song, don't hesitate buying the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Near perfection!","review":"This album was GREAT! Since ACS, Manson's been adding on ballads and softer songs. But Holywood adds a good blend. High moments: Disposeable Teens and The Death Song. Lower moments: President Dead and A Place in the Dirt. Unlike their predecessor NIN, Marilyn Manson (the band)has been making BETTER music as their career goes on. It's probably one of the most stateful albums of 2000-2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Wood for the ACS Fans","review":"Holy Wood offers a sinister blend of the abrasive industrial sound found in ACS with the rock and roll rhythms of Mechanical Animals. The album as a whole has a more Anti-Christian tone to it, to many ACS fan's delight. The album's content pokes fun at society's ideas of God, Christianity, and a new theme for this album: Society's infatuation with guns and violence. The songs on the album are quite varied and the musical style throughout flips back and forth between ACS and Mechanical Animal flavors. Some songs sound right off of the Mechanical Animals' assembly line, the rest of the songs, however, contain the industrial genius that we know and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOLYWOOD","review":"Amazing, this has got to be one the best concept albums i have ever heard. If you enjoy Marilyn Manson this is one cd you have to put on your Christmas list. A wide range of different styles of music and writing have come together to produce an astonising concept album. This album ties into the past albums beautifully it has all the hard rock elements featuring songs like \\"Burning Flag\\" yet changes gradually into more acoustic songs like \\"In the shadow of the valley of death\\" a surprising album that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole ride through.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolution Man","review":"Take the Beatles punk Pink Floyd NIN turn it up to the point of distortion, mix it with flies buzzing over a drifters corpse- You have HOLY WOOD - it rocks and this is a talented band with melodic riffs and hushed pleasing vocals at times, It's LOUD too but don't be skeerd I like it better than MA it is more pounding speaker bustin' Rock n' Roll than ACS -my faves- Cruci-Fiction in Space, Born Again, The Fall of Adam .. but it's all good holmes"},{"rating":"2","title":"He does it again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Now this was the cd that completed my Marilyn manson collection I wasn't sure at 1st because of the sales but do not let that change your decision about buying this album! Its amazing It mixes the best of antichrist superstar and mechanical animals songs like disposible teens, burning flag presidents dead, cruci fixtion in space, definetly sound like soemthing off of antichrist superstar but songs like the nobodies, the fight song. coma black, & in the shadow of the valley of death sound like there from mechanical animals This is as another reviewer said like a history lesson. Its an amazing emotinal, & powerful cd. This album had the best marilyn manson band to in my opinion ( twiggy, M.W. gacy, John 5 & ginger fish) favorite tracks include the nobodies burning flag, & in the shadow of the valley of death. give it a chance.\\" I don't say to be like me, i say to be like you and to make a difference\\" - Marilyn manson"},{"rating":"1","title":"i never got this","review":"i never got this in the mail :( what happened?! i have been waiting for weeks! maybe it got lost?"},{"rating":"2","title":"4,5 stars Amazing album","review":"Yeah - another very gool album by Marilyn Manson. Its not like their masterpieces Antichrist Superstar - Mechanical Animals -The Golden Age Of The Grotesque , bu its very close to them. This album is a combination of industrial and cool heavy metal with very heavy guitars. The metal of uor days is Marilyn Manson. His voice is amanging and very very very cool. A must album for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manson's masterpiece","review":"Simply put, Holy Wood is Manson's finest work to date. This has the raw power of Antichrist Superstar and the studio glam of Mechanical Animals rolled into one monster of an album. From the slow and brooding \\"GodeatGod\\" to the fast and furious \\"Burning Flag\\", the acoustic \\"In The Shadow Of The Valley Of Death\\", and the John Lennon-like \\"Lamb Of God\\", Holy Wood covers a lot of ground. President Dead even has a hint of the old Portrait Of An American Family to it. It is paced very well, enough slow songs and enough hard, fast songs. \\"Count To Six And Die\\" closes out the album in a much different fashion (soundwise) than one would expect. It's the most delicate and softest piece in Manson's repetoire. My personal favorite tracks are \\"The Love Song\\", \\"A Place In The Dirt\\", \\"Coma Black\\", and \\"Valentine's Day\\". (...) This album has a lot of truth to it, and it's worth buying.....really it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old","review":"pity poor manson,no really do the poor guy only has a few more years to try and shock and disturb us then thats it.you see goth metal is an endagered species it may not look like it now but it is,its riding on the crest of nu-metals wave but unfortuntly goth metal has failed to evolve so basicly what your hearing now is what was aound 10 years ago.it happened to grunge and so it will happen goth metal.so anyway onto the album well its another slice of mansons tried and tested goth metal,hes still singing about the same subjects he was when he started.disposable teens is reasonbly good but the rest just fall into goth dirge which ok if you like that sort of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the shadow of the other albums...","review":"Holy Wood is definitely a much weaker album than its two predecessors, Antichrist Superstar and Mechanical Animals. It's derivative of previous albums, and adds nothing in terms of advancing the band musically. Sure, it's fine if you're an obsessive fan with no sense of anything but Manson, but if you're looking for something with edge, look elsewhere.Lyrically, the album is mediocre. Sure, it's a given that Manson has little to offer lyrically other than hacking out basic rebellion memes, but at least the previous two albums had highlights. This album is aimed squarely at the teen market, and unashamedly so.Holy Wood is an album which exemplifies mediocrity. This is a clear indication that Marilyn Manson is following the tired path of churning units for the label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything comes full circle, while still moving ahead.","review":"This is by far Manson's best album. As a Manson fan, he is by far one of the most talented, intelligent, and creative forces in the music industry. This album, in my opinion, is a means of combining the elements from both AntiChrist and Mechanical Animals into something new and exciting, and incredibly awesome to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"This album is amazing. Simply amazing. I enjoy how it has a few themes running through, such as religion and politics.This album also has a great variety of tracks, from hard gothic rock (like the great \\"The Love Song\\"), slow songs (like \\"Coma Black\\") and dizzying industrial (\\"Burning Flag\\"). Lyrics are sophisticated yet simple, sometimes brimming with raw emotion, as in \\"King Kill 33\\", and the music is outstanding! Love the synths, the guitars, drums and loops, and of course, manson's voice.Very, very scary too. First time i listened to \\"count to 6 and die\\" where in the end, you hear the trigger being pulled on the gun yet no shot comes out, over and over again, and you're expecting the shot.... creepy as hell!!!!BEST TRACKS: Love Song, Coma Black, Burning Flag, King Kill 33"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only the best","review":"This album, like all Marilyn Manson albums, are a 5 out of 5 stars. I like this CD so much that I got a tattoo on my arm of the mercury symbol that is printed on the actual disc. Out of the 19 tracks on this CD, there is at least one part in each song that I absolutely love. This is one of those cd's you can listen to entirely through from the alpha to the omega, from the first track to the last track, from the beginning to the end. At one point or another, each song on here has been my favorite song, and sense I've owned my copy of this (the day it was released) it has been my favorite album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, More Lame, Most Lame.","review":"Holy Wood DOES rock, but truly lacks the value I've come to expect from Marilyn Manson. The entire CD reeks of canned studio takes and retakes; it is very polished with exceptional sound quality, but still disappointing. It totally telegraphs every riff and rhythm from the first 30 seconds onward. Holy Wood gives me the mental image of being the product of some incestuous relationship between my Dad's Alice Cooper 70s stuff and my older sister's U2 collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Defining Manson Album","review":"Holy Wood is THE defining Marilyn Manson album, as it is Manson at his very best - vocally, lyrically, musically, and clearity of message. The sound and textures of the album range from truely gothic funeralistic dirges to black metal glory to industrial abbrasiveness and ambience. This is the album that Manson was always destined to make as only he could, and probably always longed to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"geez","review":"Wow, Marilyn Manson actually has some listenable songs for once. That makes the album passable. Unfortunately he's not a very good songwriter or singer, and the guitar playing is VERY average too. No need to even buy this album because of how average it is for the most part. Just a couple (rather predictable) songwriting moments make a few of the songs tolerable. The obnoxious way the guitar riffs and vocals come across means I give the album a big \\"no thanks\\". No point going into detail for each song since they all sound the same anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"enhanced???","review":"i was wondering if anyone knows if this cd is enhanced by putting it in the computer????and what happens?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this","review":"How does someone go from Mechanical Animals, lyricaly and musically wonderful, to this (...)? The only songs worth your time are the singles, \\"Disposable Teens\\" and \\"The Fight Song\\". It's clearly bent on being overly dark and pointless. Again, if your looking for Manson's best, move on to Mechanical Animals."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the world needs now isn't insanity","review":"And also ripping other artists off. I remember the first time I heard The Fight Song. I was thinking \\"You must be kidding me. This is the most stupid song i have ever heard. I don't even wanna think about it.\\"He also rips off himself. If you don't already own Antichrist Superstar that's actually just like this. The exception: This one is worse.I liked it better when TR and manson hated each other. Then he tried the directing for \\"Star----ers Inc.\\" That sucked too. And I heard other tracks in advance. This is garbage. If you already have ACS than you don't need this. This is just the wanna be heavy metal verson.Here are the REAL industrial rock bands: Powerman 5000, Nine Inch Nails, Static-X, Rob Zombie, Godsmack, Orgy, Filter, Gravity Kills, and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"a damp squib","review":"As a fan of some 6 years I was virtually in cardiac arrest when I saw the new album in my local cd store. I purchased it, roared home, put it on and lay down to be blown into oblivion....................only to sit up after about 20 minutes, wondering when the feeling would begin.What an overblown, lacklustre, limp-wristed damp squib of an album. The boys have LOST IT!! The lyrics are becoming such a HO-HUM affair - so predictable and so boringly repetetive. Had they been snarled(ala Deftones)or even shrieked incoherently, maybe then I could have paid a little more attention to the mediocre music.I find more evil in the music of Recoil than in this pathetic effort. Oh!Well! I'll just take out my copy of AntiC. Superstar and dream of what might have been. This new cd goes right back to the store for a refund. What a HUGE disappointment.

This is Oshry's translation from Hebrew to English of his original five-volume compilation of the responsa he gave in the Kovno Ghetto. In the English version, nearly all the halakhic argumentation is removed and the questions and answers are much simplified. It's still a wonderful, moving read, but if you want to follow Oshry's legal reasoning, you'll need to read the original in Hebrew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very powerful but easy to use!","review":"I just got this title and think it's great! I really like the new UI - much more like an Office-type application than in years past. It's much quicker to find the features I'm looking for and to make edits to my photos than with other graphics software. The UI also gives me more space to work with my photo rather than cluttering up my screen with navigation. The new file browser along with the mini lab (batch editing) make working with pictures from my digital camera much faster. It also comes with some free plug-in filters from Alien Skin in addition to all of the Picture It filters. Picture It Digital Image Pro includes some new options for adusting lighting manually and automatically.

So, it was a pleasant surprise when the PictureIt Digital Image Pro7 turned out to be easy to use & learn with intuitive menus.

Talk about a nightmare.Ultimately switched this Encore card out for a TRENDnet TEG-PCITXR and haven't had the problem since (even though both cards I received are based on the same chipset). So, for the extra 3 dollars I'm (obviously) happier with the TEG-PCITXR; at least I can now reboot the machine without having to spend 45 minutes opening and closing the case.Strange problem, I know... but it's the God's honest truth.

From the bluesy feel of \\"Remember Me\\" and \\"Newly Single\\" to the lullaby to his niece Maggie, Nelson amazes me with his wit and sincerity. Nelson's songs/stories touch all aspects of life: family (\\"Mirrored Ball\\"), love and the loss of love (\\"Two Hearts\\", \\"One Horse Town\\"), as well as the pains of middle age (\\"Let's Get Some Beers\\", \\"Old\\"). Do not attempt to do anything else while listening to this album; you will do neither task well.The only \\"disappointment\\" someone might have with the album is with his best-known song, \\"Summer of Love.\\" It is still a powerful, beautiful song that can bring tears to your eyes, but the studio recording lacks the intimacy of the version on Christine Lavin's compilation \\"Big Times in a Small Town.\\" However, this is nitpicking on an album that deserves far more airplay than it is getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very pleasant musical experience","review":"I find her voice very \\"kitten-ish,\\" and the overall treatment of the album has a kind of soft-rock CCM feel, with a little suggestion of Madonna's RAY OF LIGHT feeling.

No Sophomore jinx here.Tanner once again shows himself to be a fully developed and engaging hero. His loyalty to Soong is both laudable and believable and the pain he feels after one of the plot twist'a is palpable.The Wall of Night is a great read, but if you haven't read Blackwod's End of Enemies, I'd start there.

A page labelled 'Hairstreaks, Coppers, Blues and Giant Skippers' faces a page of black-and-white illustrations; the only hint as to what color any of these butterflies may actually be is next to the one named Ferris's Copper: \\"duller, more grayish than that of Ruddy Copper.\\" Ruddy Copper itself is indeed illustrated in color - 10 pages earlier. If I'm following some butterfly around, trying to identify it, it will certainly proceed to another yard before I can find a helpful color illustration of a similar butterfly or refer to the fuller descriptions in the front and back of the book.

I have seen all his movies, since I was a kid. Of course, there are the big ones, the masterpieces, but I find a great pleasure in some of his -for the mainstream- less known plays, such as Zelig.This not comedy, this is pure genius in the understanding of human nature. It is Allen's essay of the desperate need of people to fit into society, to be accepted, to belong. This is the kind of movie that separate Allen for the ordinary and make him of the greatest genius of cinema.Psychology in cinematic therms, I always consider Zelig as the ultimate dissection of the social distress: how an person needings to be part of something drive him to the point of eliminate his own individuality.The movie's approach as a fake documentary is also one of the biggest achievements of Allen, a brilliant portrait of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title and contents are two different things","review":"I purchased this book with high expectation but it failed completely and I willnot advice to purchase this book just by looking at the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy sarape (N'est pas?)","review":"A senior aged groupie reminisces about meeting her hearthrob idol in the Chiapas jungle.

The mechs are very good, with a 100 ton Jump Capable mech, the Kodiak. A small 40 ton mech that packs a punch of lots of missles, the Arctic Wolf. A 65 ton mech that can take a hell of a lot of damage, the Cauldron-Born. And, my personal favorite, the Masakari, an 85 ton assualt mech with massive firepower and suprising speed. The arena is okay, but can be diorienting. The SMRMs sure add firepower, and the Enhanced Optics make sniping much better. If you own Vengance, and you like it, I highly recommend that you go out and get this pak, and probably the Inner Sphere one too (I haven't played it yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patch in a box","review":"This game is exactly what the title is.

Just pulled apart -- the wire and the plastic insulation, everything. I tried for a minute or so to splice it back together, but to no avail, and it occurred to me that the time I would spend fixing these speakers would be worth more than the $8 I paid for them.One piece of advice if you buy these speakers: please recycle them when you realize they're garbage.

There is no handle, which of course a knew, but would really appreciate now that I've used this a few days. The circumference is too big for medium to small hands to grip, so to pour is a two handed job. It at least needs a grip like some large plastic juice bottles come with now.

The hole for low C is difficult to reach because the bulky lower joint gets in the way. The recorder sounds okay in the first octave (Though F is weak), but the second octave... I can barely get it past high G, and it is very shrill. It also is not particularly attractive. It's actually a rather ugly simplification: I like the ordinary baroque design better. In any case, if you are buying for a child, I have had good results with the YRS24B (a school level Soprano Recorder). For an adult, I would recomend starting with the 300 series: resonably priced and very high quality. Also consider an alto recorder rather than a soprano -- it's somewhat bigger for adult hands, and has a pretty sound. I really haven't had experience with the other brands, but a quick google search should help you there.

Though it was scary and interesting, the movie was confusing from the start and took almost half way through to figure it out. The filming was very well done, and so was the plot, but if only it had been more explanitory. And another thing was that some scenes were just plain stupid, and could have been done better. The only thing that keeps this movie from a one star, is its suspenseful scenes, and its story. Otherwise, you've got yourself a twisted movie with hard to hear dialogue, a confusing start off, and a ending that makes you say \\"What? That was it?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent Psychological Thriller","review":"this was one of the most intelligent films i saw last year. the camera-work and color scheme added a great deal to the tone of the movie. this is one of the first psychological based thrillers to emerge from hollywood that called upon the audience to use their brains as a key aspect in the horror of the film. i fail to see why so many people disliked the ending to this film. nowadays hollywood paints everything in front of our faces in order to keep the viewers from thinking for themselves. this film was truly horrifying because it let you create the terror in your own mind. and as we all know, we can do a far better job at creeping ourselves out than any film director can."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Devilish Thriller","review":"Definately worth seeing, because of the excellent cinematography, and the sheer thrills.

I don't want to ruin the ending, but it is possibly the biggest no-sell in film history. I am shocked John Hurt and Winona Ryder did this movie. Ben Chaplin I can understand, after all he did the dog movie with Uma.

Besides a few \\"look I made you jump\\" moments, the rest of the film will leave you scratching your head in confusion. And the ending is so pitiful you'll feel sorry for all the fools that actually paid money to see this thing in theaters.

Confusing, and boring. Wait until you get to the ending, I really can't believe the way the movie ended. The only star I gave for this DVD is for the outstanding sound quality (Both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS included). Get the Omen instead.

It tries to be artsy with droll colours, intrinsic camera angles and cinematic twists - however the outcome is a boring and depressing movie (and I personally never liked a film that tries to be DARK by using so-called creative lighting & lack of bright colours - a la BATMAN). It's such a sin since I've always enjoyed the acting of Wionna Ryder. But in this film you care nothing about her character or anyone else in the film.

I mean, this movie is signifcantly better than Stigmata, Bless the Child, and The Ninth Gate combined. It's well-acted, directed, and the script is passable enough to work. Most importantly, though, is the fact that I cared about Ben Chaplin's fate, and thus sympathized with him. Winona Ryder delivers an equally strong performance and though she's been getting a lot of criticism lately, I do believe she'll still remain one of Hollywood's top actresses. The Lost Souls is most definitely worth watching.

This movie most certainly wasn't scary at all, and it had some parts were it got a little boring. I also found the ending to be a let down in fact, it was kind of weak.

With this film, first impressions are definitely wrong. The plot is decent, and some of the individual actors/esses aren't bad, but the film barely hangs together. I love the films of this genre, but this one was a definite stinker and a no buy. Save your money and time...don't bother with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you saw the trailer, you saw the scariest scenes.","review":"This film, although it had its creepy moments, is a waste of time. Based on an over-used, apocolyptic premise, the film relies too heavily on visual effects rather than story-telling, resulting in a visually-stunning, yet disappointingly unclimactic finished product. Several times during the course of the film, I found myself wondering when something significant was going to occur, and more importantly, when is this movie going to end? And the surprise ending wasn't such a surprise.The only thing the film had going for it was Winona Ryder, who gives a typical haunting performance as an ex-possessee. (Is that a word?) When she meets a young man whom she believes will become the anti-Christ, they try to figure out a way to prevent it from happening.Don't waste your time on this one. The trailer makes it seem much more interesting than it actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"0.25 STARS: Very disappointing attempt at a horror movie.","review":"\\"Lost Souls\\" was a very disappointing attempt to make a horror movie...I thought the movie ended with a resounding THUD illustrating just how bad this movie was as a whole.

The parts that come with it are junk. The air hose has a threaded fitting on the end, which is OK for cars, but miserable for bikes, which is why I bought it. The fitting is hard to attach and remove, and most of the air you've just put in bleeds back out. It's a frustrating, repetitive process. If you want it for bikes with higher pressure tires, just accept that you'll be off to the local NAPA store for a hose and fitting that work, which will cost about the price of the compressor. Also, the bag is complete trash. Figure on tossing it, too, and getting something durable to carry the items."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Little Compressor","review":"The is the best little portable air compressor I could find for the money spent. Amazon had the best price also even over ebay... I like the 10ft power cord combined with the extra long 16 foot coiled air hose so yo can easily reach the rear tires. The pressure gauge is helpful to get in the ballpark psi but I recommend still using a good separate handheld gauge for accuracy. Comes with a very sturdy carry bag.

The air compressor was in use every 2 weeks to pump my car tires. I maintained it according to Owner's Manual. Yesterday, December 14, 2010, the compressor stopped to work properly. The motor works but air doesn't come out. This thing has US patent and it made in China. So, parts quality is weak. I'll never buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got some issues here","review":"The compressor sometimes stalls if you try and start it after connecting the airline to the tire first. Oh, and when it stalls it will also blow the fuse to the accessory outlet in your car. I also find that now after a couple months the quick connect on the air line to the compressor leaks a large amount of air unless I hold it and keep pressure on it - the included air line is a piece of junk.On the plus side the compressor is solidly built, runs very well off my battery charger, and is faster than the combo emergency light/compressor I intended to replace. But I can not count on it to run off the car due to the stalls and blown fuses, so it remains n the garage, where I would have been better of with a 120V unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this Compressor","review":"Sorry, but the one sent me was defective.

The disc collects four sessions from 1954-55 by trombonist Milt Bernhart, and his Octet and Brass Ensemble respectively. This is very inspired but fairly typical West Coast jazz featuring some of the best players of the day -- Shorty Rogers, Bud Shank, Bob Cooper, Jimmy Giuffre, Pete Candoli, Maynard Ferguson, John Graas, Pete Jolly, Curtis Counce, Red Mitchell, and more. Fans of the Shank/Cooper partnership will be right at home here.

It was $120 something, which is way too much to pay for it now. It's a simple mp3 player, no screen , just play, pause, stop, rewind, forward. I thought it'd be hard to use since you can't see which song you have playing, but it only holds about 30 songs so it's not that hard. It's like the ipod shuffle in a way. Well I've read all these terrible reviews about it and I just have to say that it isn't all terrible. I guess some are crappy, but my friend got one of the good ones.

Some music files cause playback to simply freeze, requiring a \\"reboot\\" (unplug the battery) to continue. Often the unit will simply stop playing \\"for no reason\\". The tiny amount of power available from the single battery is insufficient to produce any kind of volume, even on very efficient headphones. Operating at higher volume levels (more than 3/4 of the way up) results in the unit shutting down after a few minutes. Even the most efficient external speakers elicit the same result.

More often than not it bridges between two components, it never flows and makes a solid connection.I started by blaming my solder which I purchased at Radio Shack (64-090) but when I switched to the RadioShack rosin soldering fluix (64-022) then my connections went back to being professional quality again.I've tried this pen on different component types but it refuses to work.

Basically, this is a chronological listing of important Discoveries in Egyptology. This is a good book for the student and layman.

I wasn't upset, however, until I tried to uninstall the drivers (for the purpose of installing my higher end sound card), when I discovered that all uninstall efforts crashed my computer. I have tried to uninstall several different ways (with the help of 2 different Creative technical support folks and the Creative knowledge base), and the drivers are STILL installed!

A single misaligned door scraped a good chunk of the vinyl coating off the \\"wood\\" the first time I tried to close it, because the cabinet was unstable and was listing to the right.

For an author who claims to be a technology guru this is a mish mash of whimsical fantasy. It belongs in the realms of bad science fiction. Martin never really explains what this alien intelligence really is - we are left to assume this is some form of intelligent or sophisticated software. There is really no theme to this book but a random selection of Martins thoughts and bias. He gives no supporting data, facts but relies on quotes, unlikely scenarios and just plain fiction. Interestingly, this book is an unsophisticated attempt and update of Martins earlier work - \`The Wired Society\\" - both editions of this earlier book never mention the Internet.One last bad example can be found on the back cover - the CEO of Headstrong Inc, Mr. Patrick Litre gives a glowing review of the book - but readers do not know that Mr. Martin is a significant shareholder in Headstrong Inc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an infinite loop in a bug-ridden computer program","review":"It's a fascinating topic that I was very eager to learn about.

But this particular book of his, while trying to cross into the maintstream, Dr. Martin has failed to grab the serious readers' attention.He has said nothing new in this book that has not already been written in the popular press recently. What one was expecting from Dr. Martin when buying this book was the new UNKNOWN frontier of 'alien' intelligence, and what challenges for humanity lay ahead. Unfortunely, this time Dr. Martin has shown that he is clearly behind the times and not at the top of his game.The review from cindyb was most upsetting from those of us heartily aware of Dr. Martin's accomplishments in his field.

It is an easy read and is packed with useful information. I am starting law school in August and was especially interested in advice for 1L's. The advice and warnings that the author gives is very good, I just wish he included more specifics on some topics.For example, the author mentiones that the outlines should be started some time before Thanksgiving break, but when does he think exactly they should be started?The author also mentiones that those who often succeed during the first year are the ones who use commercial outlines to supplement their study. Are there any commercial outlines that the author would recommend?

It's long and boring. I read this book after reading \\"Law School Confidential\\" so I admit, maybe that was why I didn't enjoy it. \\"Law School Confidential\\" covered all the same things in an easy-to-read conversational tone. LS Confidential was written as though a big brother was giving advice. \\"Law School Insider: The comprehensive blah blah blah\\" was written like a text book. Instead of a friend giving me useful advice it seemed like Jeremy Horwitz was a lecturer who liked to use big words and didn't like so much to get to the point. I concede that the information in this book is valuable...if it is your only source, but if you are trying to decide which book to buy, go with \\"Law School Confidential.\\" LS Confidential offers excellent study tips, multiple anticdotal advice and will leave you feeling excited about law school instead of feeling sleepy."},{"rating":"2","title":"super fantastic","review":"a great and precise book.

She doesn't mid that the stairs keep falling off and the door pops off the hinge every third time it opens. She has plenty of dolls to use in the castle (none are included).As a parent and for the money I had much higher expectations for this toy.

However, it is cheaply made and does not appear thatit will last long. Also, the design is for it to be placed in themiddle of a room for access to all sides, but this takes up a largeamount of space and unless you have a huge room dedicated for the castleyou have to continually set it up at take it down. You cannot place itagainst a wall for use without closing up half of the set and making ituseless. This significantly cuts down on the usefulness of the castle.It would have been better designed with more sturdy supports anddetachable sections so that it could be used in different settings suchas in the middle of a room, or against a wall (where it could not onlyserve as a children's toy, but also as a room decoration when not inuse)."},{"rating":"1","title":"We returned it","review":"This item is so cheaply made that even my four year old, who loves Barbie and all things Dancing Princess, wasn't sorry to see it go back to the store. The plastic is flimsy and the accessories are very poorly constructed. We bought it because we liked the idea of two sides, giving both our daughters a side to play on, but the construction was so awkward that it didn't fold open all the way nor would it close properly. It just seemed so cheap, even by today's kid toy standards. Very disappointing, but at least now I know that the Playmobil prices are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it- but only for less than half the price","review":"I found this at an outlet store for 29.99. At that price I believe it is worth it.... but for this type of quality I would never pay 79.99. I agree with the other customers that yes, it is definitely cheaply made. I also think any princess castle or house is a burden to store unless it folds up nicely with enclosed space to store the extra parts inside. Most castles do- Cinderella, Princess & Pauper, Dora House, etc. The biggest drawback of the design is that it has to be reassembled every time you play and the parts seem like very random pieces to store. The material does feel very flimsy. It would also be nice to have just a little bit more of the song than 2 stanzas to keep hearing over and over again. For as incredible as the movie was, they definitely could've done a better job on the castle. All that aside though, My girls do love playing with it and I love it for the creativity. It is a very fun story to pretend play over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheesy","review":"I agree, not worth the money.

The castle is flimsy, all the plastic is very thin. Mattel should be ashamed of themselves to rip off parents with this level of quality for $80. I share the other reviewers feelings that this product isn't even worth $30 due to its cheap parts. Alternate recommendation, buy the \\"Barbie Totally Real House\\". That's the type of construction and quality I know Mattel can produce, and it costs less than half the price of this Castle."},{"rating":"1","title":"this castle stinks","review":"This was SOOOO not worth the money! The design is terrible. It is meant to be used from all sides and is just not practical unless you have A LOT of room in your playroom for such items. Also, it is CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP. The whole things wobbles, the support pieces fall off, and you can't move it once assembled without it practically falling to pieces. It is garbage.

I'm not sure whether it would have been true of all her non-traditional form poetry, but the poems chosen for this section were not nearly as strong as some of the others, and honestly seemed as though they'd been chosen to illustrate her political thinking rather than the body of her aesthetic work.Also, compliments to Shambhala Publications for the lucid translation and for the non-irritating introduction.

The Nevada chapters are wonderfully evocative of life and times in the Silver State before it became America's Adult Playground, and Laxalt's account of the fall of Ferdinand Marcos and its aftemath is gripping. Through it all, the author manages to remain self-effacing and affable: I found myself liking him even when I didn't like his conservative asides.

This could be attributed to sleepiness, or the fact that the movie has that affect on people. Despite the fact that you empathize with the characters, the plot twists keep plunging deeper and deeper into the bizarre and disturbing. The finale seems out of the blue, without a real lead-up, or genuine character basis, taking away from all notions of empathy we had for anyone onscreen.If you happen to like this kind of strange, surreal psychological mayhem, you might actually enjoy this movie, if it doesn't make you want to take a nap through most of it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy fights doom The Bodyguard","review":"The Bodyguard stars Sonny Chiba as . . .

It eventually comes out that she was the mistress of a mob boss that was gunned down at the start of the movie and she still has his last shipment of drugs and wants to sell them for a half million dollars.The Bodyguard is dull and confusing. How being someone's bodyguard is going to bring down the drug trade is never explained. The worst sin for a martial arts film is the fights were lousy.

In addition, the fight scenes are shot in dim, dark lighting, or at angles that obscure rather than reveal the fighting styles.I bought the Platinum DVD version of this film, which was not the best transfer quality, watched the movie twice, then swapped it in with a used dealer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Higonnet at his best","review":"Higonnet doesn't put out many books, rather he reads a many more than any of his contemporaries, and puts out a few selective gems of academic work.The above reviewer is right, it's not a good book for the traveler looking to get a grasp on Paris, but what on earth would make you think that a book published by a university press (in this case Harvard) by a Harvard professor would be writen for tourists?If you want to know Paris in a depth that was, until now, untold, then read Higonnets masterpiece. If, like the above reviewer, you want to know where French Fries were invented in Paris, please mail your passport to the nearest State Dept. agent and ask them to revoke it. Parisians already hate us enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you make Paris dull? Here's how...","review":"I was tricked into buying this book. It is being marketed as a general history of Paris for the traveler or Francophile. Unfortunately, it reads much more like someone's masters thesis. As such, it brings with it all the usual problems of academic writing. Here is a sample sentence:\\"In perfect anthithesis to this, phantasmagoria was an ideological mechanism of exclusion.\\"Sadly, there's lots more where that came from. This book was not written to entertain, inspire, or inform the reader; it was written to promote the author's erudition.If you're looking for a general history of Paris, I'm sure there are many other options that are more readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I regret purchasing this product.

I have read some about Japanese kitchen knives and this one, because of its heavy blade and sharp(after you sharpen it yourself)edge should be good for cleaning those fish.The steel, 1K6, is not the highest quality but is a decent knife steel and can be forged to a Hrc 58-59 which will hold an edge without chipping on the fish bones.I re modeled the edge down to a 20 degree edge. The other side is flat, so this allows you to get it very sharp.Overall, I think it's a good buy for a fish cleaning knife, specially with the size of my catches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, My wife loves it.","review":"If you like John Denver this is obviously a great choice for your collection.

She was very excited and thoroughly enjoyed learning letters: a, c, d and g. Next came the letter h. Almost, immediately her joy turned to frustration. Personally, I do not understand why the letter h was next. The progression from the earlier letters to h makes no sense. I downloaded some pages from Kidszone instead, and we are once again happily moving through cursive. I also feel that the lack of loops increases the difficulty in learning and slows down the flow of writing. We will continue to use the book for practice so as not to waste but will not follow the suggested method or style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor look, QA and service","review":"I received this item with 2 driver's side front pieces but no passenger's side front piece.

The version that we have is not the one pictured with the gold-colored reins, but the one in the customer-supplied picture with the pink reins. The horse's harness and reins do not stay on the horse no matter how hard one tries. If this flimsy contraption doesn't stay on, you can't pull the carriage with it. It's really a piece of junk and I was very surprised and disappointed, especially at this price point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I was surprised and disappointed by how cheaply made this toy is. The gold post-toppers stared falling off just taking it out of the box. The horse tips over constantly, and the reins don't stay on. The carriage part feels very flimsy, and it comes apart easily too. My 3-year-old rarely plays with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I bought this carriage for my two daughters (ages 3 and 4) for Christmas. In my opinion, the toy is poorly made and does not fit the manufacturer's recommended age of 36 months to 8 years at all.The horse does not stand due to close placement of the legs and a raised hoof. The gold tips placed atop various parts of the carriage have all broken off. Had I not known about the target age when I bought the item, I'd assume the carriage was made for a much older child who would either move it very slowly or keep it on display.Moreover, I would like to know how the manufacturer envisioned all the dolls fitting into the carriage in anything other than an unnaturally stiff, corpselike position. Barbies are not fully articulated and, thus, a ride to the ball looks like a reenactment of scene two from Monty Python's The Holy Grail (Bring out your dead!).Recommendation: Avoid this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"not a lot of problems","review":"This carriage was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be. There have been a few small pieces break off and with having a little one around, it's not too great. However, my four year old that plays with it, knows this and can pick them up. Also, one of the small princesses got her foot stuck in the little hole you put her in. I eventually got her out. Overall, my daughter loves it, and it's not terribly problematic, so I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made without children in mind","review":"I was fairly disapppointed in this product. Perhaps it was aggravation after taking 6 Barbies and a vanity out of the packaging... perhaps because this carriage is not very child friendly. My daughter received this as a gift and is 4 years old. She becomes very frustrated because the horse rarely stay upright and the carriage is difficult to convert without adult help. In addition, some of the \\"Dancing Princesses\\" don't have bendable legs, making it challenging to get them to all fit in correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing Princess Carriage","review":"I feel that this toy is good for the imagination of a little girl playing with Barbies, however I think it would be most enjoyed if the child has an adult to play with her and help her expand on her imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't even tell its on","review":"I purchased this sub thinking that I was getting a good deal but it turned out to be a waste of money.

However, it goes on and on, littered with what feel like pseudo-scientific statements. It would've been nice to see a few studies of real people, research citations, or even just opinions of somebody other than the author. It felt like he was rewriting the evolution of software over time from his own frame of reference, and then extrapolating about where he thought it was going.Still, there was at least one point I agreed with; interactivity (and, in general, providing value to the user) is more important than additional hanger-on features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too full of fluff","review":"If you're looking for a book with over-abstracted filler written by an author with ulterior agendas and a need to use his thesaurus and high school history books to prove his intellectual capacity, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book that can be more readily applied to interactive design, look elsewhere.Granted, a few of the chapters provide insight into smart design principles and distilling down what is essential to pleasing the end users, but books comprised of a few chapters don't sell very well in today's market of thicker-is-better tech books.

My tall 19-month-old son is wearing 2Ts in most brands and the 24-month size of this romper fit him until very recently. It would still fit if he weren't so long-waisted.
