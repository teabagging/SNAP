Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Improved","review":"The Mountain Goats used much better equipment to record this latest CD. I enjoyed this CD, but I felt that there was too much of a distinct variation stylistically. Songs like \\"No Children\\" are great and they have dark and morbid lyrics accompanied by an uplifting tune. \\"Tallahassee\\" is a soothing song, but I was not a big fan of \\"Oceanographer's Choice\\" and \\"See America Right\\" because they sound like really badly done acoustic screamo. If you were a Mountain Goats fan before this CD, you will love it. There's a very likely chance that you will like the Mountain Goats(at least their slower paced material) if you like bands like Iron & Wine. Their more upbeat songs that are nice are \\"First Few Desperate Hours\\" and \\"Southwood Plantation Road.\\" Overall, the CD is worth the money. I hope that the Mountain Goats continue to make CDs like this because they are a large overall improvement over most of their other CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"What if ...","review":"... you continued the early morning drinking of spring break days or your friend who wised up and left her junkie boyfriend fell down with him instead?The artist carries the listener down a path many have only briefly glimpsed and explores love in the midst of self destruction.

However, for any fan of Lana Wood, this DVD must reside in your collection. Lana Wood, of course, starred as Plenty O'Toole in the James Bond flick Diamonds Are Forever. You don't get to see much of her tantalizing beauty there, but not so for Satan's Mistress (aka Demon Rage). Lana Wood has a truly natural beauty of face and figure that makes her one of my all time favorite Bond girls, and this movie leaves little of that beauty up to the imagination.The plot involves a husband ignoring his lovely wife, and an evil prescence stepping in to take over. She resists at first in several nude scenes, but finally succumbs to his carnal ministrations. What happens? Well, watch this early eighties exploition movie and find out!Lana Wood has truly unappreciated beauty and talent. You will find no other movie to my knowledge that exposes more of her charms than Satan's Mistress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demon Seed","review":"All other reviews are correct about the \\"quality\\" of the DVD.

The music is too fast a tempo, and the instruments are too loud and numerous. John Denver's voice is drowned out by the instruments.

It's a lot like \\"Risk\\" where there is strategy involved, so it's a great thinking game, with some competition thrown in (of course someone wants to win!). I have enjoyed watching my children play this with each other. The game involves using crayons (which come with the game) to draw on the gameboard, so it does take time at the end to wipe the crayon marks off the board. However, they do come off easily.

Orginally, I bought the red \\"GATE CHECKED\\" version, but read reviews that it hadn't stood up while en route. I read all the reviews for this bag and finally decided to just bite the bullet. It's true that the Chicco Liteway is just slightly too tall for the bag; it only means that the sides are not perfectly flat. The bag is huge compared to the stroller in width, giving us plenty of room to stuff toys and extra diapers around it. We noticed that only one end of the bag is padded, and weren't concerned at all. The bag and stroller arrived at our destination and again back at home without any damage or problems. This was a great investment for our treasured stroller!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best quality of parts...","review":"Shoulder strap on my bag broke after using the bag on its 3rd round trip. The strap broke at the plastic adjustable slide after placing over shoulder. I have read other complaints about the strap attachment hooks breaking as well but mine has given out at a different stress point. It appears the quality of the plastic is a tad cheap.

I am glad, I really didn't want to have to go with a more expensive product (or one that was just a nylon bag). It feels sturdy and well-made, and I am confident that it will serve it's purpose beautifully.EDITED 11/13/2012: Since buying the product, I have flown (with my son, by myself) twice.

The stroller fits inside the padded travel bag nicely with some room left so you can store other items i.e. toys, rain shield etc. It's light, has a handle and fold neatly into square so you can store inside a bag pack until you have to pull out at the jet bridge for the stroller. The best part is the price, under $30 for something so well made.

Barbra's voice is still as good as it was on Guilty, while Barry's songs, while not up to his late 70's peak are still way above most of what is currently sold as pop music.Criticisms that Barbra is best singing 'classic' songs miss the point. There are plenty of Barbra albums with classic musical and movie songs, we don't need more versions of the same, we want new stuff as well. I couldn't believe the comments of a 'top 100 reviewer' who claimed a good knowledge of music in the 70's and yet couldn't think of a single classic song that Barry had written - Woman in Love, Islands in the Stream, Heartbreaker are all classics (and that's ignoring Bee Gees songs).

Each tune has emotion along with a vivid trip to a place only she can take us....like paradise.

The sounds will make you fall in love with them all over again, like we did 25 years ago with Guilty.Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The girl is amazing","review":"Having been on board with Barbra since before she even recorded, when she appeared at the Crystal Palace in Gaslight Square in St. Louis, I more than four decades ago came to expect the best from her. But even I didn't expect her new collaboration with Barry Gibb to be this exceptional. Just when you think you have the lady pinned down, she surprises you, bursts forth from her cocoon and flies away with beautiful new musical wings. This album is beautiful, is fun, is literate, is a bit goofy, in other words it's everything a discriminating listener could ask of an artist. And she sounds not like an icon but a young, fresh singer out exploring the musical landscape with enthusiasm, flair and commitment. Barbra has used her remarkable gifts wisely and well. That is her ultimate gift to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible that she sounds this good","review":"What a welcome surprise that after nearly five decades Streisand is still in amazing voice. She hasn't sounded so fresh and engaged on an album in years, and the magic of her voice has not lost anything, even at a somewhat lower timbre. A diverse and timely collection of songs which only gets better with each listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory...Life was beautiful then...","review":"Anyone who's loved Streisand will find enough to treasure about this album. Her vocal range remains impressive (the notes in some of these songs have more jumps and dips than Ali & Fraser in the ring). A gifted, gifted vocalist. The reunion with Barry Gibb is sweet. Some cuts are incredibly moving. Others are ok... not exceptional, but ok. The only thing that moves this to 4 stars from 3 is Streisand's voice. When this lady is on the mark, she brings tears to your eyes. What a talent, and what a gift she is to us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbra, What Were You Thinking?","review":"I am a big fan of Barbra. Have been since I was a kid and my mom and I would go on road trips and sing along with \\"Guilty,\\" \\"Evergreeen,\\" \\"People\\"... etc. I was really looking forward to some new music from Ms. Streisand. I was very disappointed in what I heard. Her normally very agile voice was subdued and lethargic. There was no joy in her song. And then there's Barry Gibb. Get a real voice! The lyrics to the songs are... in a word... bad. It's like a \\"word salad.\\" \\"I fight to the end for the night of my life, And nothing can stand in my way, And love has a colour and colours are many, Blue is for lonely and red is for danger.\\" Hunh?? I've seen a few interviews with Barbra and truthfully she seems depressed, terribly, terribly depressed. I don't think she wanted to do this album and it seems pretty evident. By the way when I bought this album, I also got her \\"Essential\\" two CD set. I'm loving that!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider the standard CD version","review":"I purchased the Dual-Disc version of this album which I like very much but had a problem with extracting the disc from my car's CD slot. If you plan to listen to it primarily in the car you might consider the standards CD version. I enjoy the DVD sidefor the interviews and videos but would prefer them on separate discs (like The Movie Album)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant but bland","review":"I've tried to like this CD, but I just can't. Even the pictures of them on the cover are bad.It's maybe pleasant as background music since nothing stands out or captures your attention.There's currently so many used copies for sale on Amazon Marketplace - the price is down to $0.87. I won't even bother selling mine. I'm going to just through it in the garbage - where it belongs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Reunion!","review":"After seeing all the previews on-line, there were still more than a few surprises.It compiles various styles of pop from sad and pensive to romantic and concerned ballads with a welcomed touch of disco. The variety is exciting and fluid definitely a mirror of the original Guilty; glad to see a BeeGees song included and All The Children has an unexpected introduction.Serious and playful it's worth listening to hear vocal performersenjoying sharing their songs and talent and including harmonics effects that work so well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a masterpiece","review":"I've been a Barbra fan for a long time, and I just have to say that this album among her absolute best. After a few weak and average albums, this one recaptured Babs at her best. \\"Come Tomorrow,\\" opens the album. Its a duet w/producer Barry Gibb, and hits a home-run. It's easily as creative as any of their duets on GUILTY. Other amazing songs on this album include, \\"It's Up to You,\\" with some great guitar work, \\"Hideaway,\\" \\"Stranger In A Strange Land,\\" and \\"(Our Love), Don't Throw it all Away.\\" It is simply a pop masterpiece. If you've ever been a fan of Barbra, especially of her '70s albums, don't hesitate to get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVELY","review":"Full of swirling arrangements, pop melodies that soar and vocals that are her best in years, this album is actually FUN. It's got a winking sense of joy about it. Best of all the cuts is a re-tread of Andy Gibb's (late bro of Barry) Don't Throw It All Away. Talk about sensational...Babs has claimed this one as her own. And the disco babble track, Night Of My Life, is a worthy successor to the 70s Babs who warbled Main Event and Enough Is Enough. This Cd is a treat for Babs fans young and old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally! A Streisand Album to Love","review":"On \\"Guilty Pleasures\\", Barbra Streisand sounds playful, relaxed and alive. For those of us who have supported Streisand with ever-waning enthusiasm for the last decade or so, it is finally time to celebrate. This is easily her most satisfying collection since Guilty. Barry Gibb tends to write songs that are lyrical baubles, and it works great for Streisand. She doesn't have to over-emote or work too hard, and it suits her best. Her voice sounds more lovely than it has in years, and especially better her last effort, the wholly disappointing and dreary \\"Movie Album\\". Bravo, Barbra, you're having fun again, and so are we!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exciting","review":"While listening, I became so excited that I had to pull off of the road. Luckily, I'm an RN and quickly took my pulse and realized I needed to calm down or rush myself to the ER. This album is really that amazing. I adore it. \\"Letting Go\\" is so lovely. Her voice just gets even better. I have anticipated this album greatly. I phoned Borders several time requesting to know the earliest it would arrive. They seemed a bit frightened when I requested to camp outside their doors the night before the release. I can't imagine why?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be a Negative One Star","review":"While Babs does have great voice every song sounds alike. We agree with some of the other comments about weak, dull and boring. Don't buy this. Maybe your local library will stock this and you could borrow it before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty Pleasures: Stoney End","review":"Yet another mediocre album in the \\"I'm in love and lazy and fat\\" period of Streisand's career. The blandness of this record is blinding; don't even ask about the videos [and that crimped hair]. The only song worth the time and trouble is \\"Letting Go,\\" a poignant track that reminds the listener of what BS can accomplish with a tune that actually has some substance. Unfortunately there must be no one in her camp to slap her in the butt and remind her that she is an artist first, not some yenta content to sit in a garden trimming the rose bushes while noshing on a brioche topped with diet Cool Whip.Let us hope that the lady is capable of recording one last great album before she goes off into the sunset [lit on her good side, of course]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and listen to her earlier albums.","review":"I did not enjoy this cd at all. Her voice is good-selection of songs \\"poor\\". It is a cd that you listen to once or twice and forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop","review":"This has to be one of the worst productions in the history of music.There comes a time when a person should really take a long, hard look to see if it is time to hang it up. For Babs, that time has come.The good thing is that I have the answer to her introspective undertaking - STOP SINGING NOW!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment.....","review":"I bought this CD because of Barry Gibb only. Although I loved the songs he did with Barbra Streisand previously, I am not a big fan of hers. I have been waiting for Barry Gibb to come out of his grieving time for brother Maurice and do what he does best...make music. However, the two songs that he sings with Ms. Streisand are not what I would consider his best work. His wonderful voice is barely heard over hers, and the songs are well....just BORING!I am a die hard Gibb fan, but this was not Barry Gibb's best work at all. He is capable of so much more!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbara's out for more money","review":"Don't waste your money on this item unless you really want to complete your collection. I suggest get out of being stuck in the past and explore newer realms of modern music where hard-work and dedication is actually involved!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh, Disney ruins another classic","review":"Fong Sai Yuk 2 is my favorite Jet Li movie bar none. I'd give it 6 stars out of 5. Why do I enjoy it so much? Because in addition to a lot of wonderful over the top martial arts you get a tremendous amount of hilarity and top shelf comedic acting from both Jet Li and Josephine Siao, who plays his mother. Sadly, the english dubbing of this version of the movie re-titled apparently at random by Disney as \\"The Legend 2\\" eliminates Li and Siao's priceless performances. What you get instead is 10th rate otherwise-unemployed American actors stumbling their way through a lot of generic, sanitized dialogue in the footage which remains after much of the comedy has been edited out. That's right, actual footage has been edited out of this version. Sheesh. Do yourself a huge favor and avoid this version of the movie. Look for the original language, subtitled, uncut version entitled \\"Fong Sai Yuk 2\\" which is available from various online sources."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the Original","review":"The Legend 2 is the Disney rerelease of Fong Sai Yuk 2. Fong Sai Yuk 2 is the greatest kung fu movie of all time, better even than Fong Sai Yuk 1, which is saying something. The Disney version of The Legend was decent visually, but they cut way too much out and absolutely ruined the dialog, which is quite important to this movie. As stated elsewhere here, DDDHouse has the originals in DVD format with subtitles--and they cost significantly less than the Disney versions and are even encoded for North America.Forget Disney. They pulled The Legend 2 because (I suspect) they plan to release it theatrically. I'll be there. But my DVD bucks are going to the original version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fong Sai Yuk - butchered by Buena Vista","review":"This is one of the best Jet Li films available - it is in the ranks of Fong Sai Yuk (The Legend), Tai Chi Master (Twin Warriors), Swordsman 2, and Fist of Legend. If you loved The Legend, you're sure to love this sequel. Buena Vista apparently cancelled this title without warning and without indicating that the release date would come later. They cut about 6 - 8 minutes out of this one anyway - like they did for the first one, so no big loss. It's a shame they didn't include the original language also. It should be a bargain title as barebones as it is. I'm quite happy with my copy of Fong Sai Yuk that I got at DDDHouse. If you want to stick it to Buena Vista and Disney, then buy Tai Seng versions of these films or else the HK versions like Mega Star, Universe, or Mei Ah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kung-Fu Comedy Classic!","review":"Not many Kung-Fu flims can combine comedy with good action, a gripping storyline, amazing action, and hilariously funny, The Legend 2 is fantastic.Although the story line is almost a typical Kung-Fu flim, it is very different, leaving you breathless, either because of the powerful action scenes or hilarious comedy scenes.I can't see why any body should dislkike this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Sitting in the Dentist Chair","review":"I've been a fan of Lescroats for a few years now. I really did enjoy reading works like The First Law and The Hearing. However,I just couldn't get excited about this work. The plot was a bit unrealistic while a great chunk of the novel was void of intense dialogue and a few action scenes for good measure. Lescroats disappointed me in this one. Fortunately, I bought this book at a used book sale for a buck thirty and do not feel too cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded Good","review":"I was anxious to hear this one as I am an avid John Lescroart listener. However, the CD's were bad and, in fact, disc #3 would not even play. I did not send a complaint in on this, so I would just recommend that anyone wanting to purchase this to verify that the CD's were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to Engage","review":"This book was released in Australia during the first half of 1999 and I'm not sure why its debut in the US was delayed.From my perspective the booked just failed to engage me and a couple of times I was tempted to give up on it and start something else. It was, however, redeemed by a little bit of pace and interest towards the end.I found the first two thirds of the novel slow, dull & unoriginal. The characters were generally unintersting and at times frustrating, especially the behaviour of Frannie around whom much of the story is constructed. Her character stretches credulity more than can be excused. Frankly, as a reader, I didn't care whether she was ever released from gaol.\\"Nothing But the Truth\\" is not a novel to keep one up at night turning pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ashley","review":"This book is about a 14 year old boy named Philip Malloy.He goes to Harrison high in new Hampshire.Philip is in the 9th grade whenhe starts to be disrespectful.He tells a lie and it turns in to a big mess.I like this book and I think if you read it,you willlike it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improbable","review":"One thing to be said for this book, some of characters' names are cool, like Dismas Hardy, criminal defense lawyer and husband of Frannie , who has her behind in a sling and in a jail cell for refusing to testify about a murder before a grand jury. Dis can only free her by proving who the real killer is.This is like Perry Mason, where the killers always came to watch some poor slob get convicted of a murder he or she did not commit, only to have Perry's tricks result in the real killer giving a full confession just before the commercial.Earle Stanley Gardner did it better and more convincingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book EVER!!!!!!(Holes)","review":"This story is about a boy that got accused for stealing a pair of shoes.Those shoes were some one famous. The boys name was Stanley and his last name is spelled backwards Yelants. Stanley's family was cursed with a spell.His familyhad to send stanley to this camp called Camp Green Lake but it was not a lake it was a dry dessert it use to be a lake untill it dryed up and every one sarted to move away. There was this person named uncle sam the onion man that makes medican for sick people but all his medican was made from onion. At camp green lake he meet this boy named Zero that did not know how to spell or to read. They had to dig holes all day in the hot dessert. Thats all l will tell you.

Dismas Hardy is a central character that you can admire, identify with and root for as he contends with (1) a wife who's sense of values is refreshing in these times which have caused her to be jailed for contempt(2) an ambitious prosecutor and a venal DA (3) a cllient who appears to hold at least one of the keys to his wife's jail cell (4) a judge who holds the other key and (5) his old friend, homicide detective Abe Glitzky as he tries to solve the problem of the murder of his client's wife. This author has mastered the art of making conversation come alive on the printed page and you keep turning the pages well into the night. I was happy to be on vacation so that I could enjoy it in large doses. I recommend it without qualification."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Lescroart","review":"John Lescroart is a gem of a story teller. I found \\"Plague of Secrets\\" in a little book store on a weekend trip to Carmel, (I forgot the charger to my Kindle) and I've been hooked ever since. As soon as I got home, I went to Amazon and ordered \\"Nothing but the Truth\\", also cataloged everything Lescroart has written to date and will read all of them. John's writing style absorbs you in the story within the first few pages and it continues to build till the end. His books are very difficult to put down. I'm on my third book, (second Kindle version) and I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold my interest","review":"I've read about 6 of his books, and this one was not good.

Maybe because when it comes to dragonflies, I am a beginner.The photos are generally of good quality and the key in the front of the book helps narrow down a specimen to the proper family without resorting to some of the quirky systems in some other field guides I have seen.It obviously doesn't show you everything you might see, but so far everything I have seen has been in this book.On advantage is it also contains damselflies. I would like to see Stokes come out with a full-blown field guide (or two, one for east and one for west) for dragonflies. Hopefully this is a first step in that direction.Botton line, if you have an interst in answering, \\"What is that?\\" when you see one of these beauties in the wild, this book is a good starting point and at very comfortable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inquiring minds wanted to know!","review":"When my two young granddaughters started asking questions about dragonflies that I could not answer--this was a must order!!!

I have tried it with jersey sheets, and flannel sheets...but it does move alot and get bunched up. So, I do end up having to strip the bed every now and then because the pad moved during the night.

It would fit a twin bed, but only covers about 2/3 the width of her full sized bed.

The real problem is that it retains odors after usage, despite washing and soaking in baking soda. The only way I can get the odor out is to spray the pad with an odor-eliminator spray.

However, I also like director George Marshall's Technicolor remake of this film with Audie Murphy, titled simply Destry. No, Audie Murphy was not as good an actor as Jimmy Stewart. But, given a good script and good direction, Audie Murphy was a far better actor than his many B movies would lead one to expect, and Destry was one of his best performances. The fact that director George Marshall chose to remake his black and white Jimmy Stewart hit, Destry Rides Again, in Technicolor with Audie Murphy as Destry clearly indicates that Marshall felt his original film could be equaled, and possibly even improved upon. In this reviewer's opinion, he was right. Both the original and the remake are very good westerns and both should be available on DVD for western fans to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Destry Rides Again","review":"Contagious western comedy features Stewart at his most appealing, and Dietrich's also in her element, singing the famous \\"The Boys In The Back Room\\".

It may have been shortsighted on my part, but when I read the description and saw the total price, including shipping, I assumed that it would have been the same as the lightsabers my son already had! But, this one is one of the cheap ones you can obtain in Toys R Us for 5.00! In total, including shipping, I paid approx 30 so am deeply disappointed! When I contact the seller, they advised that the cost of shipping was the bulk of it and if I wanted a refund I would have to pay the return shipping costs so in essence it wouldn't be worthwhile. I may as well have flushed the 30 down the toilet.As this was one of our son's Xmas presents, I am really sad that this product wasn't what I thought it would be. I will think twice before buying from here again!Please read the description 'very carefully' before buying!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It came in a damaged package","review":"I bought this for my nephew who turned 5.

However, too often they contain the standard suggestions that fill the pages of many magazines today (use energy efficient lightbulbs, turn your water heater down to 120 degrees, etc). However, this book teachers new and often easy to do steps, like using gray water for watering your lawn and what chemicals to avoid in your laundry detergent. I've really enjoyed owning this book. It's a great reference. Plus it has cute pictures. (I can't help it. The 4th grader in me needs pretty things to look at!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Chicago Blues Sampler","review":"This is an excellent CD----and check that price! There is no better music deal on this planet. I first purchased this in one of those cheap oldies various artists racks at a record sore. My only exposure to blues prior to this was that I was a real Clapton fan in early 70's and he always claimed that he was rooted in blues music. Now, I see how.This CD has 2 tracks from each of five artists. I started listening to a couple that I really liked from the get-go----Good Morning Little Schoolgirl and Take Five. I thought that some of the other songs were not that good---but the more I listened to them---well, every song is great!These blues songs are very earthy, real stuff, very similar to songs on the Clapton album \\"Back to the Cradle\\", but much---ouch---better. (It hurts me to say \\"better than Clapton\\", but it's true.) And now I understand where Clapton came from (the Cradle), but these songs are the originals.You won't make a mistake with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"When ever my mojo needs a tune-up....","review":"I've been living the Blues in and around Chicago for several decades now, and this collection always finds its way to the top of my \\"to play\\" stack.You have two tracks from Junior Wells (backed by Buddy Guy on guitar) from his Hoodoo Man Blues album. Then you have two tracks of the gospel inspired vocals of Jimmy Wells. Throw in two more tracks of the mature sound of legendary bluesman J.B. Hutto backed by Lee Jackson. Finally, you have four tracks of the Mississippi flavored sound of Big Joe Williams. This is the real deal; the real Chicago, south side, sound.Maybe there are better collections out there, but this one has been my personal favorite for a decade. It sounds more genuine than most of the stuff you hear in the clubs these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would be...","review":"I only read to the first 50 pages and couldn't go on. For the year 917 their speech was very modern. I also didn't feel a connection between the H/H. And yes, maybe I did quit too soon to discern the connection, but I found my mind wandering while reading. Finally I realized even if I did finish the book I really wouldn't remember what it was about because it couldn't hold my attention. In addition, there was more description than dialog. I prefer equal amounts.

This product simply does not get cold enough, and the little bit of chill it does reach, only lasts for 10 minutes at most. Same goes for the heating. As well, I recently put it in the microwave for 2 minutes to heat it up as directed, and on one of the creases, the gel/plastic somehow started to burn, pop and smoke. We also purchased the wrap around version for your leg, and it used a different type of polyester material (the neck one was cotton) to house the gel pack, and that material is completely snagged from the velcro strap and looks awful after only a few uses. If we could, we'd return them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as Shown in the illustration.","review":"The cervical collar I received is not the one shown on Amazon web site. It is a smaller model. It works pretty well but is not really long enough for my needs. The model shown is available from the elasto gel web site. The one (mistakenly ?) sent by Amazon is best for the upper shoulder area.

Its large size, considerable weight and thickness, together with the large velcro strap, make it easy to fasten securely around my neck with good contact on the upper back and neck. I use it over a thin summer shirt, or under a heavier winter shirt. I also use it at bedtime, lying on my back with the pad between me and the pillow. This has been a particularly marvelous remedy for tense muscles in my upper back and neck. As other reviewers have noted, it is a little tricky microwaving it to just the right temperature, and it doesn't stay warm an extremely long time -- but these are very minor points in comparison with the strengths of this excellent product. My experience says this one is worth the money, and I have no hesitation in recommending it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great heating collar","review":"I have used this ever since I injured my neck in a car accident.

The cast is excellent, but the pacing is slow and everyone involved seems to be too calm considering what's going on. The film suffers from being too long and a good 20 minutes trimmed off would have helped a great deal.

While some discrepancies between Reese and the evidence in the murders he committed nags at Hobbes, a riddle Reese asked him shortly before the execution turns up the suicide of a polieman thirty years ago and entangles Hobbes in the web that binds these two cases together with thousands of years of history and the supernatural.Yeah, it's a great premise. Too bad it's given such short shrift in here. Every aspect of this film was done better in Seven, despite the difference in their mechanations (the killer in Fallen really IS supernatural), and held up against its predecessor, Fallen leaves a whole lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Release of Movie","review":"I found this movie very poor and totally a waste of my time. It's plot needs to be rewritten and it does not contain a deeper meaning. The ending was very disapointing and without proper conclusion. Denzel Washington did a great job playing the detective and John Goodman is a very good actor yet the other charaters did not do thier job and was poorly acted.

I know the demon was narrating, so obviously the demon was going to win, but you don't think about that while watching it because you're rooting so hard for Denzel Washington. He was a great character. But if you're one of those people who thinks it's a huge waste to spend an entire movie getting to like a character, only to have them killed off, don't bother.Overall a pretty fatalistic viewpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky","review":"This Denzel Washington film left me paranoid as i talked to my friend on the phone.

It eventually gets him in trouble with his boss(Donald Sutherland) and kills his partner Jonesy(John Goodman) The final showdown leaves you breathless."},{"rating":"1","title":"A CAT HAS ONLY 9 LIVES","review":"A sincere attempt at a Stephen King type film quickly turns into an Alan King type production. Only the acting skills of Denzel Washington and Donald Sutherland prevent this supposed thriller from becoming a 3 Stooges affair. Warned not to get involved in a closed murder case, Officer Denzel does just the opposite and mayhem ensues. A demon is unearthed who writes in ancient Aramaic, yet prefers listening to the \\"Rolling Stones\\" in English. This supernatural creature can occupy only one human at a time,but can jump from one person to another in a split second.As dead bodies start piling up,Denzel decides to become the sacrificial lamb, poisoning himself after seemingly all targets of demon occupation have eliminated one another. Frustrated, the demon finally wins out, occupying a stray cat. The flick ends with a loud rendition of \\"Sympathy for the devil\\". \\"Nineteenth nervous brekdown\\" would hav been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"just saw it and loved it!","review":"I just rented this movie and watched it for the first time. Denzel has always been a very good actor. My favorite part was the beginning, because I've always liked Elias Koteas, who is one of the best actors too. I give this flick 5 stars because it's enteratining, trippy, and original."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite weekend rental.","review":"There is not too much about this movie that isn't good. It starts out fast, maybe too fast. It dragged for a little while in the middle but ended real fast. My only complaint is that ending was too perdicitable. I wouldn't say buy this one unless you really like Denzel Washington. If you are stuck inside for the weekend I would say this is a great rental. Really worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very intriguing movie and an excellent twisted plot!","review":"What I like the most about this movie isn't necessarily the plot, which is to die for, but it is the idea and the unexploited side of this movie. This was the first film I was that was talking about transfer of the Devil in human beings. THat showed us a shadow part of the bible I never had heard of.Denzel Washington is great and acts very serious and interested. Great acting.A must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging Suspense","review":"This is from the director of Seven, and it is really a director's film.The style of film-making is really about half of what the film has to offer. But, that is a lot. I think of this as the whodunnit film of the Occult .Denzel Washington is brilliant and the cast of supporting characters are fun and interesting. Fallen is a great film for the fan of suspense or Occult who can't stomach the usual fright fest. It is really as much a mystery as a thriller. If you are in the mood to be really entertained,but don't want to be up all night ,you'll enjoy what Fallen has to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"good actors, bad movie","review":"I am a fan of Denzel Washington, and I think John Goodman is a very good actor, but this movie did not live up to the expectations. The main reason is that the plot just unravels even before halfway, it simply is not believable in any sense. And the final was a letdown and a vain attempt to be even creepier than the movie. I don't particularly have a problem with supernatural thrillers, but this one just doesn't make the cut. No matter how good the actors are and the acting is, when the material you work with is bad, there is not much you can do."},{"rating":"1","title":"well..","review":"Well, the premise may be interesting but it doesnt hide the fact that the movie is just plain boring..it doesnt get off the ground and its really painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why God, Why?","review":"If it weren't for the fact that this movie had been released 10 years prior (Shocker) and ten times (more like 100) better, The Excorcist, this could have been a decent film.Instead we are treated to a bland narration and bland performances from some incredible actors. And don't get me started on the damn ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie worth watching!","review":"Definitely a good movie, Fallen, brings to the screen the story of a police officer who realizes that the serial killer that he has arrested and whose execution he has overseen was actually possessed by an ancient Mesopotamian spirit named Azazel. Things become more complicated when the demon begins taking over body after body in an effort to have him framed and ultimately destroyed...There are slight hints of Constantine, and strong/obvious elements from the X-Files.The film combines drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind.Needless to say, Denzel Washington, John Goodman, Donald Sutherland, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least! All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!The setting, the plot, the dialogues, and the music are all wonderful!In short, it is a movie worth watching! 4 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Double Duty Product: Best for Removing Long Last Lip Color","review":"I use these pads every day for effortless removal of long lasting lip color such as Cover Girl Outlast, Revlon Colorstay Overtime and Max Factor Lipfinity. The pads are very thin and are saturated with an oil-based liquid.They are also good for removing waterproof mascara, but they do leave oily residue around the eyes. For that reason, when I wear regular non-waterproof mascara, I prefer to take it off with the other formula of Almay eye makeup remover pads that are non-oily.Both of these Almay products are great for travel as they are lightweight, thin and you can put several pads in a zip-lok baggie without taking up much space at all. I've used both formulas for many years and am very happy with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too greasy.","review":"I would give these no stars if I could. This stuff is literally like slathering oil onto your eyelids. The oil goes into my eyes and its difficult to wash off. I guess this is fine if you have stubborn waterproof mascara that you need to scrub off, but other than that, go for the oil-free ones. Stay away from these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech! Slimy!","review":"These are way too slimy to use anywhere near my sensitive eyes. I ended up using them on my face instead. I won't be buying them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Too Oily","review":"I wish I read some reviews on this product before purchasing. I had previously purchased the oil free Almay makeup remover pads...MUCH BETTER. I thought these would be similar. I was wrong!While these pads do remove all my eye makeup, it's too oily for my taste. My eye makeup ends up being smeared all over my face as I'm using these pads to remove them. I always have to keep a tissue handy as I'm using these pads. I can't wait to finish these! I'm going back to the Oil Free one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wish-I-knew","review":"Yuk - I heard Almay's eye makeup removers were some of the best - But, Not this one! It was way too wet & greasy. I even had trouble getting that greasy feel off my hands. I had to throw them out and would never buy them again. (I tried to give no stars, but the review would not accept zero stars.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably poor.","review":"This course is nowhere near as valuable as the first course. Michel Thomas sounds very unenthusiastic and the material is difficult to follow. It seems as though the course was put together in a slipshod manner in order to placate those of us who have been requesting a good follow-up to the original 8 disc course. Don't waste your money, and if you want to go the next step, open up your pocketbook and drop a good buck on all three Pimsleur comprehensive courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended.","review":"Too easy for cat to get off.Have already lost it. This is the second one we have lost so won't recommend this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, Hot Poop","review":"This is one of the best pieces of music I have had the pleasure to listen to over and over over these past few years. It is multi-layered and mind altering. There is great playing, of course, and the mix is just exceptional.The first few times I listened, it all seemed so incongruous and disconnected--kind of like how an outsider (me) feels when driving around or through L.A.--but after a few listens I became familiar with the soundscape, and have been wandering through its many avenues and neighborhoods often. It is truely fantastic--and a little dangerous, especially with headphones!A good companion CD is Jon Hassell's _Fascinoma_ which Cooder plays on.A sidenote: both of these CDs remind me a lot of Gil Evans--_Out of the Cool_ and _The Individualism of_. Something about textures and mood...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lolly molds were good, but the Company was awful to deal with","review":"After sending me 2 incorrect chocolate molds, and them failing to provide a customer service contact number, I had to report them to my credit card company. I received this mold long after my child's 4th birthday party, so it was useless after the fact, but we made chocolate pops at another time. It was a disappointing and frustrating experience with this company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"John Lee Hooker provided some early memorable historic cuts but this album does not include any. The Healer was a milestone in his revival, Mr Lucky less so and this followup album loses even more of that impact. The album has guests: Robert Cray, Albert Collins, Charlie Musselwhite and John Hammond among others. The only tracks which approach being memorable are 'Same old blues' and 'Boogie at Russian hill'. This album is not often played from my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a CLASSIC!","review":"Although you may be dissapointed to learn that this movie doesn't actually have Jackie Chan in it, the fighting and comedy are worthy of the Chan name.I highly recommend this movie.Zakarius"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Quality","review":"This is my favorite Jackie Chan movie of all time, and unfortunately I was trying to save a few dollars by buying the cheaper one, big mistake! This thing will hardly play at all, very poor quality image. It is not worth the disk it's on. Now I have to get the remastered one anyway, sigh.

I figured the few people who had reported this were kooks, but they're not - this *is* a bootleg, and a terrible one at that. You can find better bootlegs on streetcorners in NY. The cover is obviously photocopied, and the disc itself is a DVD-R that comes conveniently pre-scratched. Worse than that, though, is the fact that this is *obviously* a rip of a VHS tape that was poorly transferred and completely uncropped. I'll be filing a complaint with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong movie in disc","review":"I'd just like to warn Amazon customers out there - I purchased this dvd of Snake in the Eagle's Shadow and when I played it, the disc contained \\"Original Salsa Kings 2\\". The imprint on the disc itself was that of Jackie Chan, though.The packaging and label of the DVD itself is dubious, akin to pirated dvds you buy from the sidewalks or alleys.

Excellent fight scenes. Great plot. I rate it 4 stars because I think it is over-priced for no apparent reason. I first copied it on VHS from the local video rental store. I loved it but thought the quality of the VHS original was horrible so I bought the DVD. The DVD's quality is great so I am not disappointed, I just feel that for a special interest movie like this, the price could be more in line with other similar offerings. This movie is a must for your action film/martial arts collection.

Double H got the nod and I'm pleased with the results. I wear the boots mostly for riding (10-15K miles a year), with a little casual wear on the side, and they're great for that. The fit's good, the boots are comfortable, and they're holding up well. The one thing that kept me from giving these boots 5 stars is the heel design. It's just too big and clunky - Frye got the lines right there. But this is a personal taste thing; otherwise, I have no problem with recommending these boots."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this book if you enjoy math","review":"Mattson has produced a horribly awkward text. The manner in which the book is written is far from engaging. The example problems are tediously uninteresting and explained without regard for the value of conceptual knowledge. Much of his terminology is obscure and he frequently makes vague references to previous parts of the text which can become impossible to follow. Very few of the problems have solutions; one is supposedly able to determine whether their answer is correct without any affirmation. The book redeems itself only by the many lists of real mathematics books which the author suggests as outside reading. Go read THESE books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"MESSAGE PERSONNEL","review":"Message personnel is a truly beautiful albumn. It captures all the hauntingly beautiful, romantic, agonising heartbreak, of those who are in love, spiralling, deeply, out of control... It is hauntingly, beautifully sad. The title track, Message Personnel, seems to be based on someone who is deeply in love with someone, yet cannot bring themselves to contact them. I think it was based around a film.Berceuse, a lullabye for lovers together. Many more tracks, one about a lovely garden, one track comes better than another, it simply blew me away.

Unfortunately, you'll only get a small sample of Mama's Family as this is the only season offered on DVD, and it's been that way since I purchased this in 2006. It's also quite frustrating that the DVD is edited and not the full episode as originally aired on TV.But, I hope one day an agreement will be made to release the remaining seasons (full version or not) and in the meantime, the first season on DVD and more episodes on YouTube will have to suffice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic TV","review":"A classic.

I taped several episodes when they initially aired as I am a huge Carol Burnett fan. Some of the best episodes featured Carol as Eunice interacting with Vicki as Mama. However, one standout episode I recall was a flash-back to Mama's 30th birthday. We saw Vint, Ellen and Eunice as children. The child actress chosen to play Eunice was outstanding. Same dress as Carol's, same hairstyle, it was Carol's \\"Mini-me.\\"There was another episode in syndication which featured another flashback and Eunice was around 17. Again, the actress chosen to play Eunice was great. Again, same dress, same hair.I'm looking forward to seeing these shows again.

That, along with the disappointing fact that there are no extras on this dvd is enough for me to keep my money in my pocket. I honestly don't understand why there are ratings here of anything higher than a 1 for this shabbily treated dvd set.

I hope WB releases all the seasons of Mama's Family on dvd!!As for all the complaints I see on here...Ok, the dvd's shows are edited. However let's keep in mind that edited shows are better than no shows at all. And everyone who has canceled their order has hurt the chances of seeing a dvd of the second season.

I just wish they would put the rest of the Mama's Family Seasons' on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic!","review":"Mama's Family is a classic in every sense of the word and in my opinion, can hold its own with I Love Lucy, The Honeymooners or I Married Joan. Vickie Lawrence is marvelous as Thelma Crowley and the co-starring cast are equally adept at bringing their respective characters to life and making them as real as a member of your own family. I've watched Season One so many times I've lost count, and I still laugh every time I watch them again; a mark of a true classic that retains its freshness and entertainment quotient many years down the road. I can only hope that Warner Home Video will release other seasons and am frankly surprised with the following the show has that this still hasn't happened. It's too bad that rather than the rampant trash reality shows that show people at their worst, programming like this still isn't on the airwaves.

I would love to order additional seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAMA'S FAMILY: SEASON 2 UPDATE (2011)","review":"I just talked to Warner Bros recently, and they stated that the reason there is such a delay in the Release of Season 2 is because they DO NOT own the rights to the UNEDITED versions, Just the EDITED ones!! I asked them what the odds are of Seasons 2-6 coming out, and they said that if fans would settle for the edited versions, which is all they can provide, that they would make them available. If NOT, then the Rest of the series will NEVER be available on DVD. Personally, I think Edited is better than Nothing at all. So, BUY your copy of Season 1 (That helps), Complain to Warner Bros, and keep sending them numerous requests to release Season 2, Accept the Edited Versions, and wait patiently."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT COMEDY","review":"The complete first season was wonderful.

I have had this dvd on pre-order since it's release was announced but upon learning of Warner's apparent disregard for fans of MAMA'S FAMILY have canceled the order!!! How can they claim on the box \\"The complete first season\\" when none of the episodes are COMPLETE ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISGRACE","review":"I was looking forward to this set first season set of a show I enjoyed during its original network run. However, upon discovering that these are the edited syndicated versions was a major disappointment. Boycott this set and tape it or TIVO it off TBS - who cares if a second season will be released if this is the shape they release them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with the season 1 DVD","review":"As much as I love \\"Mama's Family\\", I was very disappointed with the DVD of season 1. First of all, there are no extras on the dvd, no original opening, and most importantly no complete episodes. All of these episodes are exactly as they are shown on tv, with a few minutes cut out of each. I find it very deceiving, the front of the case says complete first season. How can they call it the complete first season if they are the episodes that have been cut down for syndication? I hope that if they do come out with a set of the second season, they will include full episodes and some bonus material, otherwise there is no way I would buy it. If I want to watch the exact same episodes that are shown everyday on tv, I will just watch them. To me, it served little purpose to buy the dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Show","review":"I was so excited to find this season of Mama's Family on DVD.

I rate 'em right up there with I Love Lucy, Golden Girls, Roseanne, and Everybody Loves Raymond. I laugh just as hard now as I did upon my original viewing 20 years ago, and can only hope that the rest of the Mama's Family seasons will be released on DVD. Way to go, Mama!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama's Family is awesome!","review":"Mama's Family was always one of my favorite shows growing up and I was really happy to find it on DVD. Sure, the collection isn't perfect, but I'm just happy that I can watch it again. Another great show that fans of Mama's Family might enjoy isDesigning Women: The Complete First Season. It was a really big show and seems to have been completely forgotten. It's also very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is still on TV people. Why do you buy?","review":"This show is GREAT but why these companies put these DVDs out while it is on Television is beyond me.

I'd stay up late just to watch it. I was so happily surprised to see this dvd and I preordered it months in advance. I collect classic television dvds and I have to say this is one of my favorites. Mama is so colorful with all her quips and her dysfunctional family. This show makes quick remarks that are hilarious. It can be so relatable to all families, even though it is exaggerated. I love this show and I can't wait for them to come out with Season 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"great show lousy dvd studio","review":"Warner brothers released season 1 of Mama in 2007,looks like we will never see the rest of the series on dvd or re runs on tv!!!

When you watch disc 1 then 2, you'll notice that Vint is not even married to Naomi yet in some of the disc 2 episodes when he just got married to her in disc 1! Pretty bush league if you ask me.Looking forward to future season purchases!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I cancelled my order","review":"Reluctantly I cancelled my order for the first season of Mama's Family. After years of waiting for it on DVD, it's so disheartening to hear that Warner is treating the show and its fans and customers so shabbily by offering edited versions of the episodes. Where is the quality control? It's unforgivable the way they're dumping it in this truncated form onto the market. I simply won't waste money on it, especially when I already have these versions on Tivo. As far as I know Warner hasn't responded to the many complaints, which shows how little they care about their own product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boycott only means no season 2","review":"Complaints should be made to Warner Home Video for using the 1986 EDITED syndication tapes, they run only 21 minutes & 30 seconds. Harvey Korman's original introductions to each episode have been edited out!BUT we should all remember that, to Warner Home Video, a boycott from buying this DVD will only mean a lack of interest in the show and no season 2 will be issued. Warner will only consider a season 2 if season 1 sells well. So a boycott could do more harm than good. Warner Home Video will not see a boycott as a dissatisfaction of their product from the fans, only complaints will do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"M\\" is for the many things she gave me....","review":"Oh my! I can't wait for this to hit DVD. I used to watch this wonderful show with my grandmother. She would let me stay up \\"late\\" in order to watch it. We bonded while watching Mama. For many years we would laugh until our sides hurt. Our favorite episode is where Bubba got drunk, and they did a flashback to when Eunice showed up drunk at the Mother's day show at the church. LOL!! Any show where Eunice was involved was sure to leave you rolling on the floor! HURRY!

I'm not happy as many here agree, that the laces don't allow for the girth of the arm and wrist area. Also, the company All American something orders from other companies because I've been dealing with the manufacturer directly. The manufacturer LoverSource will ONLY refund the buyer. They don't have the ability to credit an account for Me to hold for later purchase or credit My Amazon.com account. Now I'll need to see if this LoveSource even has a website to see if I can exchange these gloves. If I can't exchange, I'm stuck losing My gift, refunding the buyer who ordered the gloves from My Wishlist. There doesn't seem to be any guarantee for the Amazon member to keep credit when any product ordered from an Amazon wish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not match picture","review":"This is not the product in the picture.

Shoelaces might be better for these gloves. They do look good, if you get long enough laces though. They are shiny black, thin material, kinda cheap, but you get what you pay for. I used them for a halloween costume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than useless.","review":"This unit will pull about 5-10 feet. Then the strap on the drum jams against the frame. You now need to find a way to release the load so you can get the hoist out of the way. If you only have one lift point on the load you may be forced to cut the strap and let the load drop. The strap can be pulled tight with all of the strap off the drum. Doing this 5 times will give you the 25 feet.Do not use this unit in a critical rescue situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puller strap jams and capacity/flexibility are overstated by maker","review":"As the other reviewer pointed out, the strap jams in the ratchet housing if more than about 12' of strap is wound up. This happened to me on the first use. It was apparent what the problem was, but I called the technical service number printed on the handle. They informed me you must not wind more than 10' of strap onto the windup drum. I pointed out that this is not stated anywhere in the instructions supplied with the tool. The solution is to follow the release under load directions, but add your own weight to the strap to pull it loose, one ratchet notch at a time. Clearly, there could be situations where this is dangerous, impossible or both. The tool will work, but the capacity and flexibility are clearly much less than the manufacturer implies.This is clearly a design defect, which the manufacturer knows about, but has neither corrected nor informed the unsuspecting buyer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puller won't release","review":"Bought mine at Home Depot and it is going back. Pulls OK but won't release. I had to take it apart to release the strap. It came with no instructions. And apparently no web site.

After the war, it served on the frontier and was in the Cavalry Division organized in 1898 for the invasion of Cuba. This was the division which also included the Black 9th and 10th Cavalry, and the 1st US Cavalry. The 1st US Volunteer Cavalry was also there. This book gives an outline history of the regiment through the years with most emphasis on the Civil War. Because most of the books were destroyed in a fire, this has been one of the scarcest...unit histories until this much needed reprint by this private press. With a short introduction by John M. Carroll, the well known historian of the Indian Wars, this fills a gap in many collections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone with Scots-Irish ties!","review":"This is such a wonderful portrayal of the Scots-Irish journey to America. The music is magical and inspirational, the dancing is the best of our hertiage, the story spectacular. It's a wonderful journey of emotion from sadness to laughter. Well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On Eagle's Wing","review":"If you love music and dance mixed with history than this is for you. Filmed live with a huge cast of professional dances from several different styles, it is the story of the journey of the Scots-Irish from Scotland to Ireland and eventually to America. Even though it is about one nationality of people the message and story of the immigration of the Scots-Irish can be seen reflected in the stories of all people who immigrated to America.Featuring the powerful voice of Scots-Irish singer Peter Corry and the beautiful Scottish singer, Alyth, you learn of the hardships, difficulties and joys of a people who had such powerful impact on American history but have been largely unknown."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important and beautiful picture","review":"Your many reviewers have said it all quite well: the quintessential eco-drama of civilization, so-called, in typical conflict with cultures more attuned to nature. Touching and poignant; compare to Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan.

A lush and beautiful movie, I was eager to view it once more. However, I was in for an ugly shock. A good amount of this movie consists of the Amazon peoples speaking in their native language tongues. In the VHS version, there were clear subtitles. In the DVD version, which I purchased from one of Amazon's sellers, there were NO English subtitles. I don't where this DVD came from, but it was certainly a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emerald Forest Illustration for La Ciudad de las Bestias","review":"As a teacher of a University in High School course, I was amazed at the ability to use the Emerald Forest as illustration for the story La Ciudad de las Bestias, by Isabel Allende. The customs, living conditions and beliefs of indigenous people of the Amazon (the setting of her story), are helpful in understanding the culture alluded to in the novel. The only problem for use in certain venues might be that it is rated R. The natural magazine/channel display of lack of dress of the natives might make showing of the movie prohibitive in some circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the videotape","review":"I have owned the videotape of this excellent movie since the tape was released.

Don't waste your money on this horrible conversion, but DO buy the tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like an old silent movie","review":"I had seen this movie years & years ago when it first came out and loved it. I was so glad to have found it and ordered as a little surprise birthday present for my hubby who had loved the old one also. However, even though the DVD said it was in English, ours was not, it was in some sort of tribe language, I don't even know what language. So very disappointed that we couldn't understand 80% of the movie because there was no English or captioning. Had to apologize to hubby for getting him such a lame present. I wish I could find it in English but would be hesitate to order again because of this incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emerald Forest","review":"This is a very beautiful movie. The setting in the Amazonian jungle is lush and green and the people are very colorful and attractive.As always, Powers Booth gives a great performance, and the story is supposedly a true story. It's an exciting and tense story.Anyone who likes a good adventure, will like this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, so-so DVD","review":"Haven't seen this movie for at least 15 years, now it is out on DVD. It is a great movie, about an engineer (Powers Boothe) who was building a dam in Amazon rain forest. His son was kidnapped by lost tribe of the amazon. He searched endlessly for his missing son for 10 years. It is based on true story. The acting is very good and the location is beautiful. Too bad the DVD can't displayed it properly as the color is a bit pale and dark. The sound is Dolby 2.0 only and a bit let down, especially after the DVD opens with the high power MGM logo presented in Dolby 5.1 and when it plays the film, you can immediately feel the drop in the sound quality. But overall it is a very entertaining DVD that worth considering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really bad","review":"I am astonished at the good reviews this movie received.

And I love movies from the 80s and early 90s (Medicine Man, Point of no return, Labyrinth) I tend to like a lot of different movies that others don't. But after 45 minutes of watching this one, I had to turn it off. I was bored and thought that watching something else that I know I will like and have seen before would be a better idea. The acting was ridiculous. The cinemetography was mediocre. The main star of the film was the location - not the characters. That's the only enticing aspect of it. There's no legacy or classiness in this film where there should be as the story is compelling, yet its execution was poor. I would love to see this movie re-done, with better quality cast and a waaaaaaaaay better script (some of the actions of the indigenous peoples were completely confusing and not easily understood to their relevance to the story). I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"cult classic","review":"I purchased because of a review I heard on NPR radio.It is an exclent story based on a true story.If you like it you should see \\"Quest for fire\\" about prehistoric times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!!","review":"I am not usually one to watch a movie more than once or twice, but this one I watched probably 4 or 5 times.

It is disgusting to see a movie as beautiful as this one ruined by such sloppiness. Whoever put this rip-off of a DVD on the market should be sued."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Emerald Forest","review":"For anyone who is sick of all the hoopla about the vastly overrated AVATAR, here's a film that ever a tree-hugger could love. THE EMERALD FOREST is an undiscoved gem that I reccommend highly to anyone. The film came out in 1985, and I only rediscovered if based on my daughter's urging, who recently met its star, Powers Booth, at an L.A. event. The young boy in the film is the director's son....he is now a best-selling author who co-wrote LONG WAY ROUND and LONG WAY DOWN with Ewan McGregor. Perhaps it was this film that inspired his adventurous lifestyle. Whatever the reason, THE EMERALD FOREST is leap years ahead of most of the junk that comes across our movie screens nowadays. Please...don't be afraid to revisit some of these older films. I think you'll find the experience far more enriching than a thousand digital effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acquired Taste For the Bizarre","review":"Chester Brown is an eclectic, yet diverse innovator. Upon first glance his drawings & artwork look crude & unfamilar, but upon further inspection one becomes engrossed in his unusual storytelling.

This one has the illustrations, but no one took the time to format the book before printing, so a page of text is often split into two pages to fit a full page illustration in between. The captions for the illustrations are often at the top of the next page instead of under the picture. This book is available for free in the public domain. There is no excuse to charge $11 for a free book that isn't even formatted correctly. That explains why this printing lacks any copyright or publisher info.

It did not. It covered the ground covered by a dozen other books which are like it, and could not even cover its own statement very well in the end. I was really disappointed in this entry. It was too short, and left too much out where it really counted. It was written in plain english and seemed to try to make a statement for women and learning new types of sexual subjects, but it really fell short of delivering a clear message. I expected more from a book with this title, but it only goes to show that you cannot tell a book by its cover. The text seemed to bounce along at a quick pace even when you wanted to learn and read more on a specific subject. It wandered some, and did not present a clear definitive narrative on anything that it covered.

So don't think buying a different copy with different graphics will make a difference, it won't, it's still the same lousy print. Until a real reputable company (Criterion, Image, etc.) buys it and announces they will be putting this out, any future copies will be as bad as these. That being said, if the quality of your print matters little, then buy it and enjoy the film, it's a great one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Film Quality is Terrible","review":"The story line/plot was interesting but it looks like it was recorded with poor television reception and maybe bad tracking.

If you made a copy of a copy of a copy and did that at least 20 times, you would end up with a better copy than I got. And as unbelievable as it may seem, it actually says on the box and on the cassette label that it was recorded in EP instead of SP, which of course was never mentioned in the description. I will never buy from this company again, and in closing take note that Amazon has a no return policy on video purchases, so beware. Thanks a lot for the rip off, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP-OFF","review":"BUYER BEWARE! If the DVD I got wasn't a pirated copy, I'll eat it....I liked the movie back-when - so for $4+ how could I go wrong? VERY MUCH SO....It started with a still of Anthony Hopkins in gruesome facial expression (no relation to the movie!)...continued with no credits of any kind...the picture quality was the most atrocious I have ever seen on DVD...grainy, washed out....it was AWFUL! The manufacturer on the DVD case did not match the manufacturer on the DVD. I thought Amazon would be interested....so I let them know...but got the 'pass the buck' to the initial selling company. Well for $4+ I didn't want to be bothered, so just threw it away....so much for the scare-tactic warnings at the beginning of DVD's!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID PICTURE QUALITY","review":"Love this movie and was very excited to find it on DVD, i am aware that it is made for tv and that you get what you pay for, but the picture qulaity is fully unwatchable. basically the same as the copy floating around the internet for free burned to a disk. Horrible....do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS DVD!","review":"Avoid this DVD! As another reviewer said, it's remarkable bad. I wish I'd read his comments before I bought mine. I recommend buying instead a used VHS tape from a rental store. Its quality will be far better than this DVD.The DVD is a poor transcription of a second- or third-generation videotape. It has the tape's tracking problems. The colors are very weak. It is blurry to the degree that you want to say it has *no* resolution. The audio is terrible. Besides being blurry, we had to adjust our volume control to full volume to be able to hear much of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major technical disappointment.","review":"I suppose it's a good vehicle for Hopkins, but the DVD version suffers terribly from technical problems.

I wanted a copy for myself for future reference. Things are broken down into subject and are age appropriate. I like the question and answer sections in each chapter that helped me to see that my child was not the only one with this particular problem. It was helpful by giving you ideas that you may have never thought of. It covers just about every subject you could want (except foreign language). This is a wonderful book for parents of elementary and middle school students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced for information included","review":"Excellent video for the novice person skinning and cutting up a deer.

For the information included, it is over priced. karen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginners Guide","review":"This is a decent video for the beginner to get an idea of where and how to make cuts.

There is very little shown on cleaning the meat of veins, sinew, ect, but as expected from a quick and simple video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful but disappointing","review":"The instructions actually begin inside a freezer on a deer that is already gutted! No instuctions on how to gut the deer are included in this video. It would be more appropriately named \\"A Documentary on the skinning and meat processing of a gutted deer.\\"The narration by Tim & Mike is better than the average Youtube video. They have a fairly well defined idea of what they want to say and demonstrate with the video but leave much of the action and instructions up to the actual processor/butcher himself. The butcher offers many good tips and narrates his actions well. The actions do not always show up on the video as he narrates what he is doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Hong Kong Kang-fu film","review":"This is a bit similar to \\"The Killer Meteors\\", contains some complicated stories, unbelievable attacks(comedy!?) or so.

Absolutely love him! Sadly, this ISN'T a real \\"Jackie Chan type\\" movie. Filmed at the pre-beginning of his career, it's one of the movies Jackie made for Lo Wei. That should tell you something. There wasn't a single movie he made for Lo Wei that was even remotely good. Tell you the truth, people - I actually stopped it about 20 minutes in to the show and never finished it. Yuck comes to mind. But then Jackie would be the first to tell you that. Everything he made with Lo Wei was a bomb. If it says, Jackie Chan and Lo Wei together, anywhere on a DVD, run! Truely not worthy of Jackie's talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a good laugh","review":"Well...This movie was interesting. The Star Wars music at the end action scene was a diffrent idea.

Mcneils Latest Book","review":"Having had an interest in Taoist philosophy and longevity techniques for several years, I found this book to be ideal. Mcneil's understanding of the subject can be seen because whilst other books tend to make this subject overly complex and longwinded, leaving the layman with a lot of homework to do to get round the circumlative language, this book is 'esoteric jargon free'. Theories which I have spent years studying and trying to understand were explained and turned out to not be so complex after all. The sign of a true master of any discipline is in his/her capacity to explain the subject in a down to earth manner to the average person, this book achieve this aim.A few more techniques may have been useful in the book, however, this is the first Taoist book I have read that has managed to also remain human. I have never given five stars to a book before but this one manages it. Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound and practical","review":"Dobson's premise of tough love, which essentially means defining and maintaining the line of respect around yourself, seems sound and practical. Applying it avoids the drawn-out, torturous emotions that go with living in a decaying relationship. Dobson makes the seemingly radical recommendation that people facing infidelity or other marital crisis of similar proportions precipitate a crisis to bring the situation to a boil. Dobson's point is that that boil will very often restore the relationship. Precipitating the crisis shows your mettle, which commands respect and even admiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love must be Tough","review":"As a counselor, I find myself using this book a lot with marriages where I am working with one person who is holding on tightly to a spouse and does not see how they are hindering repair or growth within the marriage. Sometimes we must show tough love to our spouse and this book is a great resource to display why and how. We are not meant to remain in an abusive relationship whether physically, emotionally, sexually or a marriage where our partner is unfaithful. This books guides individuals on how to work on healing the relationship and force change in their partner with tough love before they give up and head toward divorce or settle on the idea they must stay in a \\"bad\\" marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid advice.","review":"This book is for the spouse who is trying hold the marriage together while the other one wants out. It focuses heavily on infidelity and dealing with that monster, but even if you are not in that boat, it has plenty of sound advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the desperate","review":"Whether or not you are in a relationship this is a great book. It shares some very important principals on how to maintain self-respect in a romantic relationship, while also maintaining Christ's loving attitude. This book is empowering...it empowers the reader to trust God, and to trust his/her own ability to be strong.A great book for men or women, singles, dating, or married couples!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Yet Great Advice","review":"I am so grateful that I read this book. It has sound advice and I wish that I had taken the advice months before. It is hard yet very reasonable suggestions on how to deal with a loved one who has chosen to leave. James Dobson has taken the time to explore all aspects of a broken relationship and what the victim can do to become a survivor and regain respect in a tragic life experience. I hope this wisdom is shared by the reader and the postive results mirror those found in the book. Thanks Mr. Dobson for your insight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a book","review":"I'll make this short and simple:I really like Dobson, so obviously I'm going to like this book. I am only 20--male--not married. I've always felt that in high school there should be a mandatory class that taught at least some of the basic facts about child raising and marriage.I feel this book should be read by those of any age could learn of this book and try to take aspects of it and funnel it into every day life. Even if you believe you aren't going to marry, this book is a wonderful lesson.Buy it and buy a highlighter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...I really needed this !!","review":"Wow !! I read this 4 years ago and still remember so clearly the details of this book because it helped me more than anything else I read. I am now divorced from a man with a sex and pornography addiction. This helped me break away from him and realize that he was choosing his behaviors and I could love him by not allowing him to continue these behaviors in our relationship. In the end, I filed for divorce because I could not allow me or my children to live with his behaviors. He chose to continue with his addictions, I received full legal and physical custody of my children, and he continues with his addicitons today while my children and I are happy and thriving. I did not plan this for our lives or his, but this book was very helpful.

The section referring to a spouse feeling trapped really hit home with me. I have been living apart from my husband for about a year and have read over 15 books . This book gets right to the point and gives great insight & examples on how to put yourself in the right position to solve your marraige problems and to stand up for yourself and your marriage. I started the book on Friday and read it all by Sunday...I've already put some of these examples to work and they are already making a difference.I would also suggest to find a counselor that supports solving your Marriage problems & not pushing you towards divorce.

My spouse separated from me. I wrote the \\"goodbye\\" letter like it suggested and it turns out all my spouse wanted was the opposite. My spouse wanted love and to know that I wanted to stay married.This may be the way to go in some situations, especially blatant adultery, but be careful.To be fair I have yet to find a good separation book. Maybe there are too many variables in that sort of relationship dynamic but it's not out there so far. I would try the five love languages, if he/she is still home or maybe love and respect for the woman who's man is on the way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Must Be Tough: New Hope for Marriages in Crisis","review":"This book was disappointing to me.

I have been to Tensegrity Workshops and listened to Carlos in person. I was hoping for more incite on what went on behind the scenes. No, I was not part of the \\"elite\\" group. What you get is someone's poor attempt to \\"cash\\" in on the Don Juan $$$$ wave. Watch the free clips at [...] and you will basically get the whole movie for free. Very disappointing and if you see a rating higher than 1 star (generous) it is because they somehow are profiting by you buying the video (I'll sell you my copy)."},{"rating":"1","title":"very bad","review":"the movie has nothing to do with Castaneda and his teaching. It is simply a sequence of very simple people expressing their oppinion about Castaneda, but those opinions again have nothing to do with Castaneda.....sounds more like gossiping.Ruta"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of intent?","review":"Having read all the bad reviews, my hopes were not exactly up regarding this documentary, but being someone who has been compelled to read all the books and everything else about Castaneda, I felt I needed to see this for myself. Probably due to the fact that my expectations were set so low, I actually did not mind seeing this. This DVD is a about a group of individuals who attended Castaneda's workshops/Sunday Sessions trying to make sense of his teachings after his passing. I found it interesting to hear their perspectives and yes I did hate the special effects. If you are a hard core Castaneda fan, you will enjoy hearing the famed man's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless amateur production","review":"Although there are a few minutes of interesting interviews, they are accompanied by pathetic nauseating graphics and weak embarrassing music. Most of the background graphics are actually generated by the iTunes default music visualizer. It is surprising that such a low quality product ever saw any distribution. It is an insult to the memory of a fascinating and compelling author and character. I rented it and will demand my money back. An annoying waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing of Significance","review":"Not too good. The poor production and distracting music and computer effects did not help. This thing went on and on, and more than once I wanted to turn it off. However having attended a good number of Carlos' classes I wanted to see if there was anything of significance (which there wasn't).Basically interviews with people who had some contact with Carlos giving their personal opinions. Only one, Amy Wallace, had something interesting to say and I would have liked to have heard more from her. The rest were people who attended, tensegrity classes, either at seminars or the small classes, as well as others who did not. One of the interviewees, a Victor Sanchez claimed in his book to have met Don Juan and learned from him. But curiously this wasn't mentioned at all.Only 2 photos of Carlos and 2 very short soundbites. Overall the movie was quite weak. Barely a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This movie is supposed to be about Carlos Castaneda.But it really is just an assortment of interviews with unknown disenchanted people who are trying to debunk Castaneda and his teachings based on heresay and rumor.Having studied Toltec teachings for many years I was shocked at the poor research done on this documentary.If you are a student of Castaneda this will leave a very bad taste in your mouth.The makers of this film showed total irresponsiblity in not verifying the information being presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Level Headed Viewers","review":"I'm not sure of its cinematic merits, but as a documet into Castaneda's theology, I'd have to say this documentary is insightful and merits a look from anyone seriously investigating Castaneda and trying to make sense of his legacy. As an author who seemed to offer little to the public, I don't see how anyone serious about these books could pass up the opportunity to learn more about this elusive man. There's so much B.S. out there about him being a cult leader, and while this documentary is critical of him at times, it's also very favorable. I appreciated the approach that didn't skew with hatred or blind faith. Sure, it left a whole lot unanswered, but it's not like Castaneda left a whole lot to go on. I really liked it and think it actually creates something larger than itself. More riddles to solve. More to learn and discover. I love the path with heart!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying DVD Trailer!","review":"Well, I have to say this DVD put a bad taste in my mouth right from the start. This stupid DVD makes you watch a 3 minute movie preview before the real movie even starts. You can't forward, rewind or skip it in any way, and I resent the utopian programmer who thought it was a good idea to force customers to watch a preview for another film. It certainly doesn't make me want to go out and buy their other movie. In fact, it makes me wish I never bought this one. Stupid idea guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap production.","review":"I enjoyed hearing Castaneda's own voice and listening to the interviews but the cheap druggy visuals in the background and \\"experimental\\" video techniques were distracting and bothersome. I became very tired of it early on. The makers of this work could have shown some interesting material of the places Carlos talked about in his books. (Or any of a number of more interesting visuals than what we get here.)

The key to the book is to not read it but to work through it. Take it at your own pace, my pace was a chapter a day to augment my time with God. The book is not a wordy scholarly read but more of a workbook where Henry Blackaby asks some tough personal questions that we often think about but rarely answer with honest hearts. The whole idea behind Experiencing God is to find out how to interact with God and how he interacts with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad that this was seen as so annointed by mature believers","review":"I personally resisted reading this because it was so well received by mainstream christians during its heyday , but finally after coming to Israel I read it when I had nothing else left . I should have went without. The book is geared to first or second year adult believers, beyond that one should already be beyond this. However the book is really into pushing building churches and the many testimonies about it from the author, personally I have little use for such things.The best part of the book is the glossary in the back which lists all the names and actions describing the L-RD , which is fun to look up each one, beyond that I would recommend not reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst Christian book ever","review":"This book is simple idolatry. Blackaby has invented a god who only wants a \\"love experience\\" with us. He has forgotten that the Biblical definition of love is different than the modern idea of a \\"mushy feeling.\\" Blackaby's God only emphasizes heart. Blackaby completely deemphasizes any need for knowledge or to learn more about God. Our God wants heart, MIND, soul, and strength, and all of it. God says, in Jer 17:9-10 \\"The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?\\" \\"I, the Lord, search the heart AND examine the mind to reward a man according to his conduct, according to what his deeds deserve.\\"*****Avoid this book.

I see it in this book.Food for thought:Check out the 5-star reviews and ask yourself this: Where are all the misspelled and words of so many usual reviewers? Where are the typos? This book is written for an audience with a low reading level, so why do so many of these reviews sound like they're coming from well-educated people? If these well-educated reviewers are really purchasers and readers of the book, and not promoting Blackaby's book for a kickback of some kind, why have so many of them missed the heresy Blackaby is spreading? Surely they have the reading skills to read and understand the Bible. Surely they see that his book is not Christian but occult with Christian dressing.

This is an exception.People who play pro sports don't practice new concepts. They work on old concepts. A baseball player throws the ball, just as he did when he played as a kid. He's just much better at it.This book does not say anything new, but it brings together those simple principles that we should never be distracted from. The book discusses the nature of God (few new books these days do) and how His nature should change us. It is a practical book. If you won't put it into practice, it won't be worth reading.This book is only a substitute for the work book. This material can be read alone, but it makes much better group study material. This book makes wonderful \\"Out-reach Bible Study\\" material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE CHEESY COVER SAYS IT ALL","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I had expected a deep and insightful book about EXPERIENCING GOD like the title promises and only found patronizing clichés and pseudo-Christian fluff. The book presumes that what the author is telling you is supposedly the biggest deepest insight imaginable, but is just turns out to be really basic common Christian teaching that you already know. I'm sorry to sound so negative, but I think that we need to have the integrity to not just accept fluff as being deep. I think there are definitely amazing life shaking insights to be learned about experiencing God in a relationship, but unfortunately not in this very overrated book. And could the cover be any more tasteless?

For a healthy contrasting view, read \\"Decision Making and the Will of God\\" by Robin Maxson. People like the view of God's will as described by Blackaby because it makes them feel an active part of God's plan. If you want to experience God in your life, read \\"Practicing His Presence\\" by Brother Lawrence, and put his advice into practice. I like the Gene Edwards edition, which includes writings by Frank Laubach."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful work about our relationship with God!","review":"Experiencing God was one of the best books I have read in a long time! Although written in an understandable and easy to read style, the authors did not sacrifice any Biblical principles.

But I love the way Lisa Mychols and the Wondermints breathe life into the Spector production style.It is very hard for modern musicians to make music like this without it slipping into parody or anemmic imadation. These artists succeed, and show you how fresh, and timeless this genre really is. This album invokes as much feeling as any Ronnettes or Chrystall's 45. The Wondermints understand the emotion behind the music, not just the style.They understand Spector so well, I just hope none of the Wondermints wind up shooting their wives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why wait?","review":"Even though this is a Christmas CD no reason to wait.

Four different dive destinations are visited, each with their own distinct personalities and diving styles. Travel from British Virgin Islands on the Cuan Law liveaboard to the Socorro Islands on the Solmar V. Next the crew visits Yap and dives with mantas and visits the cultural centers for topside enjoyment. Lastly, the group boards the Wind Dancer for another liveaboard vacation to Tobago. At each destination, Anat Grant, your host, gives detailed tours of the boats and underwater life. Sometimes humorous, sometimes serious, but always entertaining, the dialogs and dives are all spectacular.This is the first of a group of 3 videos done by ScubaCore. Issues 2 and 3 are much better than this one as one would expect, but this one is still a MUST HAVE for any scuba diver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality, value, scenery, etc","review":"Excellent quality, value, scenery, etcSimilar videos are quite short, the videos in this series are a couple of hours and done very well"},{"rating":"2","title":"I long for the '60s","review":"Would be complete if it included \\"Through European Windows\\" My album disappeared 30 years ago and I have yet to replace it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collection 1956 - 1994","review":"I feel truly fortunate to own this collection.

There was no mention of the internet whatsoever and the use of a computer was virtually non-existent as well. It would have been nice to know how to set up inventory and manage bookkeeping through Excel, for example. I agree with the first review also--there was no information on exactly what labor and products are needed to put together a gift basket (other than the obvious gifts and basket).

On stage,it's surely one of the best things I've ever seen. But it was with another actor as the main caracter. I love Lepage's visions, concepts and direction, but he is embarasing as an actor. The film is good for the text and ideas, but is a poor version of the real performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Stewart Western","review":"Good story, cast and scenery. Of the five Stewart westerns during his collaboration with director Mann, this is the most straight forward. Stewart's character is a man with a past, but not overwrought. Young Rock Hudson in supporting role was a hoot. Great color, no widescreen and have read varying reports as to whether it was shot in widescreen or not. If it is pan and scan, they did a good job of it. But enjoy it for it's own sake. No extras on DVD, but what you get is an entertaining story and for the price, it seems a reasonable deal to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Strong Jimmy Stewart Western Movie","review":"Although Jimmy Stewart is probably not as well known for the Westerns he starred in, but he is excellent in them. Bend of the River is a good example. He is not quite John Wayne, but he holds his own as the leading star in this 1950s Western tale. Rock Hudson is pretty good in this one as well. The plot is pretty simple - several other reviewers provide the details. Personally I found this Western very entertaining with great scenary, plenty of action, and a decent plot. There are some good bar fights, gun battles, and plenty of confrontation.If you like classic Westerns, then I recommend the Bend in the River. If you think that Jimmy Stewart makes a good cowboy then definitely get this movie.

Universal has done an incredibly shoddy job on this DVD. The film is a good one ... not as good as The Far Country, but a respectable and enjoyable Western by the reliable Anthony Mann. The picture quality is often poor, and why the movie had to be panned and scanned when it was not widescreen to begin with is beyond me.

I don't think there was anything homoerotic or 'gay' about that kiss. If you were dying too and your BEST friend was right there, one of the only things you can do is to show a form of affection for that person as they part this world knowing they were loved in any manner wether gay, straight, whatever.I think this film is very educational and well put together.It's also sad that Television has had so much more success as far as gay characters go than mainstream cinema today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above average movie","review":"This movie is about how homosexuals has been portrayed in movies over time.

A truly fantastic album that will surely stand the test of time. I needed more Beth Orton and bought Trailer Park. I really wanted to like this album but after every listen I still find it absolutely horrible. The lyrics are trite and shallow and the music is hollow completely lacking emotion. Take for example \\"She calls your name, three times a day\\". It gets a lot worse. Is this the same person who wrote brilliant, piercing, and insightful lyrics on CR? I am embarrassed for Beth and cannot listen to this album without thinking it was from the mind of someone not thinking. This cd deserves one star for demonstrating how far she has come over the past two years. Buy CR and hear the true potential of this woman at her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dull and boring...","review":"I purchased this cd in the hopes of finding more jems such as \\"Touch Me With Your Love\\" and \\"She Calls Your Name\\". Unfortunately, all I got was dreary folk music. If I had known that this was what the majority of the album consisted of, then I would have never bought it. And her voice? It left a lot to be desired. The plus side is that I got to exchange it for Luscious Jackson instead. Which is good because this is one of the few cd's that have actually put me to sleep: seven times (I wanted to give this album a try)! So trust me; if you're not into PURE folk music, you will HATE this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique voice and some great songs","review":"I got Trailer Park when it was first released in the late 90's and waited for it to take off. It never really did. Then her next album, Central Reservation was released and again I waited...and again not much response. While Beth has a large loyal following, it is nowhere near the following she deserves. She is a talented songwriter with a wonderfully distinct voice. I really like a number of the songs on the album, but I especially like \\"She Cries Your Name\\" and \\"I Wish I Never Saw The Sunshine\\". If you are deciding between this and Central Reservation as your introduction to Beth Orton, I actually like this album better. On the other album, the song \\"Central Reservation\\" is a great song and got some air play and some dance remixes got some play, but I think overall this album has stronger songs. (Don't let the Dance Remix comment throw you...Beth's music is mellow ballads and funky songs. She is not Madonna, she is much more Indigo Girls and The Story.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop listening to this CD!","review":"I got this CD completely on impulse. I actually decided on it because I heard a song from her more recent album, Central Reservation. Well, the store only had copies of Trailer Park, so I ended up buying that. I'm so glad I did. I'm partial to electronic music, so I particularly like \\"Tangent\\" (the way her voice echoes is beautiful), but the rest of the album is stunning as well. I love singing to \\"She Cries Your Name\\". In short, folk music gets its hands dirty here. Enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beth Orton is my favorite person born in the 20th century!","review":"Words cannot describe how much I love this, but I'll give it a try.

There is no way you can lose with album. Every song is amazing, with styles ranging from flat out techno (Tangent) to country (How Far), from orchestral (Don't Need a Reason) to atmospheric (Galaxy of Emptiness.)

Their first release, \\"Those Damn Bandits\\", had a cursory run of about 10,000 copies, one of which I am lucky enough to own. This was unabashed garage ska, and it was truly brilliant. To obtain a copy, try the used bin at a record store or possibly the drive-thru records home page. Their major relase, \\"Halfway Between Here and There\\", was a huge step for the band. Their sound matured immeasurably, going past their upbeat ska roots and moving into a style all their own, and doing it very well. \\"Progress\\" exhibits more of the same trend. This, unfortunately, means the phasing out of horn parts, but their horn section still plays a pivotal role.

It either barely discusses or doesn't even cover things that the quizzes ask you about. I am going to find another book to study from before I even think about taking the test. The labs were terrible also, some of them couldn't even be completed as set up by the book.

This book and the accompanying CD were the only tools I used to study. I read the book cover to cover, although I skipped the actual practices. (I would only recommend skipping the practices if you have a lot of real world experience with the product.) Then I moved on to the practice tests on CD, and had pretty mediocre passing scores on three practice tests in certification mode (45 questions, answers scored at end). Finally, I used the practice test in study mode, where you could review your answers as you went to drill down into areas that I needed more work on. Having the accompanying practice test (295 questions) makes this kit a great value. I felt as though I learned a lot during all of this and wasn't just \\"studying for the test\\". One word on the test format itself -- there were plenty of simulations to do -- everything was not multiple choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not applicable to the exam as of August '07","review":"I installed the evaluation edition of SQL Server that came with the book.

Many, many questions were not covered by the material in this book! I have a very good memory, and read the book while laid off so it only took me two weeks to get through it, so my memory is not the issue here. Microsoft produced a book and represents it's purpose as prep for the test, but it doesn't cover all the material the test does!Most of the questions were covered so it is possible to pass from this book, but I couldn't.One particularly galling question on the exam involved a port number that was not in the book, I checked.Needless to say, I am disappointed.

Wide eyes, blonde curls, etc. This is a wonderful movie for Dietrich fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING FANTASIA ON THE LIFE OF CATHERINE THE GREAT!","review":"This movie is justly famous for it's bizarre visual style; it's a fascinating excursion into the life of one of history's most notorious women. As a child, Catherine is played by Dietrich's own daughter, Maria Sieber; Dietrich is innocent and naive at the beginning and she slowly becomes a powerful and lusty ruler. Louise Dresser is strangely folksy as the illiterate Empress Elizabeth (who in real life could speak many languages, but her manners were atrocious). John Lodge, who later had a successful career in politics (Governor of Massachusetts) has a very commanding presence and he's astonishingly modern in his playing of Count Alexei. Sam Jaffe is brilliantly eccentric in his playing of Peter the Mad; his performance lingers in the memory. Opulent and beautifully lighted, THE SCARLETT EMPRESS wasn't exactly box-office in it's day (it was ahead of it's time); today it's a visual orgy, fascinating to observe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarlet","review":"Very disappointed. Grade c film. Would like to resell if possible. Plot was weak and setting were poor. I like Dietrich but this has to be one of her worst films."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blue Angel is a Red Devil","review":"This Josepf von Sternberg feature about Catherine the Great's early Russian years was a disappointment to me. He told the story from the point of view of what he thought would attract viewers, and while that is certainly a director's objective, it shouldn't be s distortion to historical fact to the degree this film is. Marlene Dietrich is, of course, Catherine from a girl of 14 until she takes over the throne of Russia after having he husband (the Tsar) murdered. Historically this is fact. But von Sternberg can't seem to decide if Peter (played by Sam Jaffe) is a fool or merely playing a fool who knows exactly what's going on. The photography is good for that era and von Sternberg does well with the technical aspects of his film. I think it just seems too dated for an audience today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it or isn't it?","review":"In a previous review I remarked on what a terrible print of the film was used for this DVD - GREAT FILM, terrible print.Anyone who disagrees, or feels this may now be the best quality print on offer should take a look at the Martin Scorsese/BFI series \\"A Personal Journey Through American Movies\\". There you'll find a some gorgeous clips of the Scarlet Empress with sharp audio and virtually perfect picture (no horrible \\"dupe print\\" grain or frame damage like this DVD). The film simply shimers. Presumably this was a BFI print, but it may have been from Paramount - either way, a far better print exists and therefore I'm sad to say that this is proof that Criterion have rather short-changed the buying public this time around.Still, it's better than not having it on DVD at all, isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER DISAPPOINTING DVD TRANSFER FROM CRITERION","review":"Long-awaited DVD release is another disappointment from CRITERION. What's going on with the CRITERION COLLECTION? They have found an okay print with barely acceptable audio - and claim that the entire thing is 'digitally remastered'.CRITERION - formerly, and deservedly, the benchmark of classic DVD releases, and a name one could count on for quality - clearly has become just one more quick-profit distributor misrepresenting its products. They should be seriously questioned and held responsible for their marketing.Sadly - don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This classic deserves better","review":"Von Sternberg's masterpiece is a visual feast, but this DVD seems to have been made from a grainy sixteen millimeter print. It is a disgraceful disk. I have seen archival prints of this film and I KNOW this is not even close to the best print they could have gotten. Sadly, this is the first of the seven Sternberg/Dietrich films to make it to DVD, and I hope this release doesn't set a bad precedent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Curious","review":"I purchased this one only out of curiosity, seeing how a film was made before the hayes office took over with film vetting,telling us what we should and should not watch. this film was made for dvd, it has copied quite well for it\`s age and is watchable, it i amazing how film making has changed over the years, how did they set some of these scenes up. watchable if you are a film buff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous movie","review":"Just saw this uncut on TV today. It was ridiculous beyond words. The sets with their bizarre wall decorations, troll/gargoyle chairs and statues, doors that required to two people to open them (which they did with difficulty), and the lighting which made it look more like The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari than a Russian historical film, and most ridiculous of all, the music, which varied from snippets of Ride of the Valkyries to the closing of the movie where they played the 1812 Overture!I would never consider buying this movie; I would never want to watch it again in any format, even free on TV. In spite of all the glowing reviews, I saw absolutely nothing about this movie to call it a classic, unless being old by itself makes a movie a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best New Age album ever made!","review":"Wonderful music for lovers...

As with the other titles in this series, this book's strength lies in the diversity of its authors. Each other writes a separate tale of futuristic military combat set in the main theme of human vs. khalian war. The list of names in this series is impressive, ranging for Larry Niven to Anne McCaffrey. All this makes for a truly interesting, and entertaining read. I would highly recommend any of The Fleet novels for any fan of science fiction. This book in particular maintains the style of the previous novels where Drake and Fawcett weave together the various stories (involving various levels of combat and violence) into a unified, directional plot. A great continuance of the series, with plenty of good surprises packed into the 10 or so short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get any better than this!","review":"Everytime I see one of Pedro Almodovar's movie, I ask myself \\"How can he top this?\\" This movie was no exception!A little more on the \\"commercial\\" side than his previous movies though.Just ordered \\"Habla con Ella\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sub-Almodovar is still good Almodovar","review":"Not as good as some other Almodovar films in my opinion but it has had wild success in N. America. It's certainly his most conventional film so far even though it is abound with the requisite transvestites and pregnant nuns. The obvious difference is that Almodovar pays tribute to women this time around whereas, in the past, he had fetishized them (which was something I, ever the sophisticate, didn't particularly mind). As per usual, Almodovar presents bizarre situations with bizarre characters and lets them play out in soap-opera-ish melodrama. It's kitschy and it's fun, as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mami Dearest","review":"I never watch film with subtitles for the obivous annoying reasons but something drew me to this film and I am thankful for the wonderful experience. This film was visually rich and stylish, complex and wonderfully acted. It was a character study about motherhood and womanhood and all the delicacies, heart aches and confusion inbetween. I'm not sure what Almodovar's obsession is with drag queens but he's sprinkled a few around to add to the mix yet it suffers in the film, making it feel to slapstick at times. But that's it's only fall. Otherwise its a gripping beautifully toned story about the love of our mothers and the pain of their journeys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Todo sobre mi madre","review":"todo sobre mi madre (the real title) by Pedro almodovar is spectacular. It is filmed in barcelona and madrid. Its about love of the arts and many other things. Including the love of family and breaking down stereotypes and dealing with grief. There are many surprises and great acting. only those who are bigoted will not like the film. many thanks to Pedro almodovar. winner at the oscars and cannes film festival. I only wished Amazon would list best foreign film winners their due honor. Yes its in spanish but the subtitles are excelent for those who don't know spanish. (only a 2nd language for me and I'm not fluent)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Foreign Film","review":"I have a love hate relationship with foreign films. I either love them or hate them. This is one pf the best movies I have seen in along time. Too many americans are afraid to try something they know nothing about.

America open your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too pleased with itself","review":"Barely passable, since most of the people in the film just seemed to be so self-satisfied and in love with themselves for accepting gender-bending and modern liberal sexual mores. It takes more than that to make a good movie. I just had the constant feeling that with all these actors flaunting their sexual liberation in my direction, I was supposed to fall to the ground and repeat \\"I'm not worthy\\" over and over. It made the typically gay pretension of mistaking \\"avant-garde\\" posturing for substance. Dumbly shallow. Almodovar's worst, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Joke!","review":"I think this is one of those films that people think they are supposed to like so they jump on the band wagon without their brains. I kept waiting for the message, the point, or just a good story. What is this diretor trying to say? This movie is just a sequence of events and characters that enter into the life of the protagonist. You can say that for many good movies but this one doesn't make any sense. It is as if the director had a dream and decided to make it into a movie.This movie proves that clever sets, colorful wardrobes, and good acting dont always equal remarkable movie. There is no alchemy here. In fact, there is no here here.This is like modern art that your supposed to like because critics say so, but it is really a joke. View this movie objectively detached from it's critical contex and accomplished director, and you will be scratching you head wondering \\"What was that all about?. Two hours of your life down the tubes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almodovar misses horribly with this one","review":"I really like Pedro Almodovar's films, \\"Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down\\" is a rauchy hilarious film, and All About My Mother is he most popular film. So I should like it? No way!This film is full of stupid things that Almodovar seems to think are funny, but really aren't. The characters include pregnant transexual nuns and things that don't have any characterisation of motivation. It is poorly shot, poorly written, and even the presence of stunner Penelope Cruz can't save it.I'm glad Almodovar is getting widespread praise, but this was an awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Believability factor.","review":"I tried - really I did! I tried to enjoy this film given the subject matter and some good reviews. It started out believable then quickly turned into a series of coincidences that I just couldn't swallow. The main character travels back to a life she led 20 years ago and meets a women who just happens to be in the middle of a situation that mirrors her's at that time and with the same man! In this film people enter each others lives out of nowhere and are immediately connected. A good director could have handled such plot turns more fluently.I certainly don't want to give any of the film away and if you want to escape into a film without giving credence to reality then you'll enjoy this film.I'm an actor/writer so I enjoyed the 'Streetcar' scenes.Interesting plot. Very poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about What??","review":"The actresses are good. The subject/hidden feeling as explored are also good.

Maybe I just don't get his movies..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A harsh realistic film in Spanish","review":"Only in modern times can we have a Greek tragedy like effect with most of the people still alive? HIV and a transvestite father combine with a drug abusing daughter of an actress to produce an effect of losseven when the baby doesn't have the disease.I thought the lead actress was very good in this and it appears that a supporting role was enough to get Penelope Cruz to Hollywood?I like it even with the harsh life it showed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to get one's head around this one","review":"At times, this was an emotionally exhausting film, containing so much grief & loss that it was difficult to watch, and by extension, difficult to review. It wanders amazingly far afield from what at first appears to be a movie about a mother/son relationship, but Almodovar manages to keep the movie from completely losing its coherence.This is probably one of those movies where the sometimes bizarre content can overwhelm a viewer. Repeated viewings no doubt would reveal some nuggets that were missed the first time through. One could certainly do worse than watching this a second or third time, that's for sure.If nothing else, watch the movie for the riveting performance of Cecelia Roth as Manuela. Prior to seeing this, I was unfamiliar with her work, but now hope to seek out some of her other movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Otra vez, de segunda lengua","review":"As much mainstream appeal as most foreign films about drag queens have, this probably won't reach the U.S. masses, and that's a real shame. This has all the makings of the really wacky blockbusters that do so well here, given that they've got big stars and don't go too far. This may just do that at times, and no one over here has heard of any of the fine actors in it. To stack the odds further, the film is smart, irreverent, and not the viewer-catering inspiration that we so prefer. In fact it's downright sad sometimes (i.e. getting killed by a taxi, aging, and dying of AIDS). Throughout it all, however, this emerges as an absolutely hilarious film. Buy it to scare some compassion into your closed-minded friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The overall plot was convoluted and controversia. However, overall, I liked the film.

I'm still learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Una obra de belleza y humanidad","review":"Pedro Almodovar's film \\"Todo Sobre Mi Madre\\" just blew me away when I first saw it in a seedy little Parisian movie theater.

When I finally did see it, I was pleasantly surprised, to say the least.In a country where films are the same lame story repeated over and over again with cast changes, I was happy to see that this film was appreciated and gained recognition through it's astounding performances and story.

To have a film dealing with a transvestite, a pregnant nun, a strange actress, and a grieving mother, it must have been very challenging to make it entertaing. It could of been allot worse from some directors but Pedro Almodovar pulled it off. Even if you have read the subtitles at the bottom of the screen to get it, it's worth it. This film is a real stand out from the rest of 1999's realeses 'cause of it's stellar preformances but above all the story.Overall, All About My Mother was very dramatic, at times, very funny, and very moving. Buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Almodóvar film.","review":"That is, a fascinating premise that, while well-acted, manages to fall nearly completely apart because nothing is connected in a way that's necessary to keep the film coherent. It's almost series of vignettes, each weirder than the other, and each making less sense in the \\"big\\" story. As a result, it may be somewhat artistic in spots, but spotty as a film. You have to work for it to hold your interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scattered and COnfusing","review":"This movie was a big disappointment. It opens to hospital shots that have very little to do with anything. Hard to suspend disbelief on the bazaar situations and characters. No depth. It just flys from one bad scenario to another.

But the contacts within the jack are inexpensive.Unless you enjoy fumbling with small parts, I'd spend a little more and buy a jack that's machined to a closer tolerance.

The acting is awful and it does not succed as either a comedy or a drama. Demi Moore shows that she is not afraid to take risks with her career, but she should of chosen a better script. Burt Reynolds is 'not that bad', but if you really want to see him shine I recommend 'Boogie Nights'. Nothing to recommend in this movie, except the nicely staged, and surprisingly never vulgar dance sequences, and even those are never sexy enough to make an impact. Rent it first. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see for all \\"die hard\\" Demi fans.....................","review":"Although the plot is the same, nice girl intimidated by the bad guys, the story line is a bit off the beaten path. There aren't alot of surprises, but the movie really takes off, so to speak, as it goes on. Set in a Florida dance club, the Eager Beaver no less, the supporting cast add a bit of much needed humor to the plot, and most of the supporting cast is very pleasing to the eye. Burt Reynolds is very beliveable as the idiot congressman, as is Vingh Rhames as the loveable club bouncer. As I said, not many surprises, but lots of fun. The true Demi Moore fans will want to pack a lunch for this one, because once won't be enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music. Sexy lady. Lousy Movie","review":"Demi Moore as a stripper. Burt Reynolds in a satirical role as a politician with a few screws loose. Smooth and rhythmic sounds from Annie Lennox. What more could you ask for? How about a film that doesn't insult the intelligence of the viewing public.

Unfortunately though that was about all there is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good! Not so sexy, but really funny.","review":"So a friend and I snagged this movie for a guy's night when the girls were out of town. We got it more as a joke than anything else. I was quite surprised by how much I liked it. Not because it was sexy but because it was funny. The main thing this flick has going for it is that it didn't take itself seriously. Ving Rhames, who I always love, did a superb job playing a no BS bodyguard. Burt Reynolds was hilarious. And Demi? Well, she got naked. That's about all I can say for her. The story was hugely predictable, and the acting was pretty bad, but this movie was really funny. There were some great one-liners. The best line of the movie was one of Ving's: \\"Nico: What are you, nuts?! Shad: Yeah, psycho. Delusions of invincibility combined with a strong homicidal urge. I have a kick-your-ass fetish.\\" Rent it with the guys, drink a few beers, have a few laughs. It's not as bad as you might think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most sensual i've seen demi moore yet!","review":"Although some of the casting in this movie is a bit cheesy, the story line isn't too bad. Some of my favorite actors are here, like demi moore for starters, the t T-1000(a.k.a. robert patrick)and even smokie and the bandits burt reynolds! The story revolves around a stripper who ends up in a custody battle over her daughter. If you've ever wanted to see demi moore as close to au natural as possible then this movie in my opinion comes as close as were probably gonna get! But i'll leave something to the imagination! Just watch the movie and judge it for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So what was all the fuss about?","review":"Just what the hell was Demi Moore trying to prove here?

There's the odd laugh here and there, Ving Rhames does his usual solid support and Burt Reynolds is enjoyably sleazy as a perverted congressman. What makes the movie is the beautiful and very sexy Moore, who may not be able to act very well, but boy is she hot. Seeing her strip is worth the price of the DVD alone, but beyond the gorgeous Demi there's an entertaining almost-satire to be had - but who needs that when you've got an (almost) naked Demi. It may be the cinematic equivalent of a night out at a strip joint, but what a night out...put this in your collection just to see one of the sexiest women alive show just why she's so goddamn hot.

It immerses the reader in the Napoleanic wars in a way that brings history to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Sharpe book","review":"I think this book is the 12th one in the Bernard Cornwell's Sharpe series. In this book, Captain Richard Sharpe and his company take part in the battle of Fuentes de Onoro in May 1811. Sharpe is given responsibility to help train the Real Compania Irlandesa in musketry and skirmishing. He shot two French prisoners and their commander, Brigadier Loup, has sworn that he will have his revenge. Sharpe and his men were attacked at the San Isidro Fort by the Loup's brigade. And the raid is reported as a proof of Captain Sharpe's irresponsibility. Sharpe finds himself used as a scapegoat in a political game. His only hope to save his honour and his career is to lead his men to glory on the blood-gutted battlefield of Fuentes de Onoro.This book, like other ones in the series, is excellent. However, I think that it is not at the author's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back from the future!","review":"Cornwell does a superb job, but for some reason I was not overwhelmed as I have been with the other books. Perhaps, because though Cornwell's dialogue and plot are fast-paced, I've perhaps read too many of them and his books have become too formulistic (off course most fans like the tried and true approach). I still very much enjoyed it and look forward to reading the last remaining book in the series that I haven't read yet - Sharpe's Rifles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible writing style and historic accuracy.","review":"Wow! What a story. This one book got me hooked, and I am currently gnawing away at the rest of the series. It is great!

The only part I didn't like was the small history of what realy did happen at the end. It was a jolt back to reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very boring TV series","review":"I don't know about the book, but Sharpe's Battle certainly didn't make good television viewing. I thought the first episode was bad and wouldn't have bothered with the second except that my husband wanted to give it another go. \\"Why am I wasting time watching this?\\" I asked myself and, since I'm not usually masochistic, I walked out of the room halfway through the episode. Apart from the fact that I found the series boring, I wondered if guns were really as accurate in Napoleon's time as they were portrayed. It seemed to me that every time someone fired a gun the bullet didn't just hit the targeted man but instantly killed him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs, bad mastering.","review":"Well, what can I say, but stay away form this cd. Sadly I've purchased this \\"oldie but goodie\\" and really enjoyed the selections. But on the end of every song(yes every song) you can hear the turntable it was playing on. There is a loud, humming noise of a turning phonograph player that really should of been faded out. I know others like Ace and Bear have master tapes but with no tape sources, they must rely on vinyl sources, but this is really a bad job of that. Do yourself a favor,stay clear and maybe buy the album,if your lucky, on e-bay."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for dremel without needed mandrel","review":"These discs are awesome. However, they do not fit the regular dremel mandrel. On these discs the center hole is too large for a standard Dremel mandrel and the recommended mandrel will be needed. Myself, I was able to get around this (NOT recommended) by using a very small washer under the set screw for my disc shaft and a very small cutoff wheel that does fit was centered and gorilla super-glued to the bottom of the new disc (again NOT recommended). If your looking for a plug and play disc for your standard Dremel mandrel then this is not the disc to buy, remember without also buying the proper mandrel it's a no-go w/this disc... And for those who find this review 'not useful' Really??..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Here's another 3rd season episode (see The Empath for another nearby example) that was refreshingly original. The story revolves around the Medusan Ambassador who is too ugly (or is it too beautiful?) for the eye. This episode has lots more of messages. Beauty and ugliness will be the last prejudice for humans to conquer. Like Spock said, the Greeks thought that everything beautiful was good and everything ugly was bad. Don't judge a book by its cover!Also, I liked it when Spock made a mind link with the Medusan. The ambassador offered some lovely insights into the human condition because his usual point of view is so different. This is the sort of thing that science fiction at its best ought to do. I just absolutely love this episode. Season Three is the second best season! Viva la Third Season!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb show","review":"This is a pretty pointless episode. The premise seems interesting, but the show itself is lame.Diana Muldaur's character is a big brat and tries to kill Spock, which of course is a crazy thing to try to do. It's almost impossible. It's not a bad show, just dumb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scottish \\"sheriff\\" takes care of business.","review":"You have to appreciate the quality this series offers and wish that our own TV networks generate programs as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"a wasted opportunity","review":"M.C. Beaton's 'Hamish Macbeth' murder mysteries could have made a good TV series, like 'Inspector Morse' or 'Midsomer Murders' . They have clever plots, interesting characters, stunning locations, and plenty of humorous touches. Unfortunately, for reasons best known to themselves, the BBC chose to dispense with the plots and most of the characters from the books, and instead serve us up a bland soap opera with a Scottish setting. Almost nothing is left of the books at all. If you enjoy programmes like 'Ballykissangel' and 'Monarch of the Glen' you will probably like this. If you were hoping for a good murder mystery series you will be very dissappointed. This series was a total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive Material","review":"I was offended by the episode, \\"A Perfectly Good Explanation\\", and have therefore pitched the entire DVD into the trash. Had I known such offensive material was on it, I would never have purchased it in the first place. I don't need to have my spiritual beliefs insulted by the overt insinuation that \\"Christians\\" is where the crazies are, and then have the crazies portrayed in a manner that makes it obvious the writers didn't even have a clue of what they were writing, or talking about. Although Series One of Hamish was great, because of this one I'll never buy another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Series - want more!","review":"I now own series one and two of this fabulous series. What a pleasure it is to watch really interesting and engaging stories suberbly acted by a cast that make it all so very believable - well almost. And what a delight the Scottish scenery is.Without going into the story lines I would simply say that these programes are well worth watching, and well worth spending a hard earned dollar on! Like Monarch of the Glen and Ballykissangel, you can't go wrong.Sadly, we now have to wait until the third series comes out. Perhaps Amazon could speed it up a little :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply enjoyable.","review":"Last year, I purchased Series 1 of Hamish Macbeth and loved it,and when Series II became avaiable decided to purchase it.

Yes,if you liked Northern Exposure, you may like Hamish MacBeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVDs -- Twice!","review":"The Hamish Macbeth series is fun, although the episodes don't follow M.C. Beaton's novels accurately. The Series 1 and Series 3 DVDs that I ordered seem fine, but the Series 2 DVD set was defective -- the first of the two DVDs wouldn't play on several players I tried. Amazon handled the returned item well, and sent a replacement, but that one had exactly the same defect -- the first DVD wouldn't play! So, I sent that one back too and requested (and received) a refund. I went to BBC America Shop and bought \\"Hamish Macbeth Series 2\\" and it worked just fine. So, I had to pay a higher price for the item from the alternate vendor but at least I finally got a DVD set that worked. As far as the stories, they are well-written and well-acted and I recommend them for fun and enjoyable viewing. The characterizations and plots are different than those in M.C.

Star looks awesome in it, and Christina looks cool too. Living Legend was really good, though, except for the TA colors thing. Red and black....uh, no. TA silks have been green and gold since the beginning of the TB series. Other than a couple things like that though, it was fun to read. I read it all the way through, and definitely couldn't put it down. Christina's gotten a lot nicer, I think, and not so conceited. I'm also glad she quit eventing finally, because even though I love eventing, it just wasn't right in the series. She's Ashleigh's daughter, of course she should race! But why does Ashleigh keep coming back to race? Either she should racr, or not. Anyways, I know I'm complaining a lot, I'm just incredibly picky when it comes to this series. I really do love this book, even if there are a few mistakes... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was Good ! @ cmavia@yahoo.com","review":"I thought this was a good book.

And I know what the whole series has been like because I have every single one! I have slowly watched this series evaporate into dull words on a page. It started somewhere in the teens of this chapter when they got a horses name mixed up! That is sooo not quality writing! You should at least care enough for your series to get everything straight!

But even without that connection, I would have loved this book. Written more than a century ago, it is untarnished by the political correctness of the last 100 years. The reader gets a true glimpse of what small-town life was like in the early 1900's. The author didn't have children of her own, but was a teacher for many years and truly captures the essence of childhood in this book. It is written phonetically, the way the characters would have spoken, but rather than being a distraction, this adds to its charm. While she uses the \\"N\\" word (in dialogue) quite a bit to refer to black people, those characters are portrayed in such a way that you fall in love with them as much as you do with the white children.

Read this book, and understand how differently our society once was structured (in law and in practice) from today.

He wants out of his hyped and glossed over career and tries hard to get the boot from his life of money, women, fast cars and cocaine. A self inflicted, self pitying, loathsome, melodramatic and hilariously funny tale of one man's road to re-invention.

A good laugh with critical undertones."},{"rating":"1","title":"great conversation topic","review":"If you believe that the purpose of advertising is to tell you the truth and that you really are free to be original in how you dress and what you eat, then this book will be revealing to you.If you are looking for good literature or to learn something about the advertising business and lifestyle, you will be dissappointed or confused at best. The story (and its storyetelling) is modelled after the same advertising the book talks about: It starts with a great promise, but it never delivers. This might be the secret message of the book.

Keeping track of all the Russian names and places was tedious, but would have been a non issue had there been a plot and story that was at least somewhat interesting. But it wasn't, it was just plain dull. I failed to see why this book is so highly thought of.

The only thing the same from Martin Cruz Smith's works are their high level of excitement, interesting characters and plot development. Gorky Park is Smith's BEST work to date. What he does best is gives the reader an insiders' view of a society totally different than what the audience is used to. And introduces his characters to his readers as if we had been their friends (or enemies) for years.Whether it be Los Alamos during the development of Man's deadliest weapon in Stallion Gate, Cuba in Havana Bay, Japan in December 4th: A Novel, or Moscow in Gorky Park, with his characters on the verge of an exciting adventure for the reader to be a part of.I enjoy Smith's books. Gorky Park is THE mystery novel I judge all other mysteries and mystery writers by. Some mysteries I consume like potato chips or pretzels. Very, VERY few do I savor each page as I did Gorky Park!John Row"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly patriotic Russian.","review":"I read 'Gorky Park' because I wanted to see how the author would handle the life of a Militia investigator of the Soviet Union. I figured it would a Detective novel with ranks locations & name Russified & was pleased to find that is was a detective novel but it felt Russian. The novel was beautifully written & filled with character that had entire personalities & motivations. Gorky park was an odd in the sense that throughout the novel I came to sympathise with some characters but never completely. The Soviet factor was too strong. I could smell the cheap tobacco & taste the Vodka but not hear the rumble of the Soviet Moskovich as it slowly made its way to Gorky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of Its Time","review":"Smith's first Renko book is awesome and marks the way in which other great crime novels followed. The fact that the chief homicide detective has to battle the KGB, FBI, and the NYC police is not uncommon to what Harry Bosch, Lucas Davenport, and others have to face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read","review":"A detailed, well-written murder mystery set in Russia less than a decade before the fall of the Soviet Union. Murder investigator Arkady Renko is called upon to solve the murder of three faceless victims found in Gorky Park, and along the way he battles people trying to stop the case from being solved, a wife looking for divorce, a bewitching Siberian girl, an American policeman looking for a murderer, and an American salesman somehow involved in the three deaths. Cruz Smith did a good job in describing the Russian people, and he depicts an interesting picture of the Soviet Union that is reminiscent of Orwell's \\"1984\\".Two small issues I had with the story was that I didn't fully understand the prosecutor's reasonings for the conspiracy that unraveled, and I thought the love relationship between Arkady and Irina was rather shallow. Still the story is enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorky Park","review":"I arrived at this novel indirectly, after having read 'Havana Bay' and 'Polar Star';#'s 4 & 2 respectively in the Arkady Renko series. There is also the 1983 film-noir, starring William Hurt as the protagonist Arkady. Semi surprisingly the author, Martin Cruz Smith, an american, reveals considerable knowledge of cold war Moscow. Research which took him eight years to complete this book. 'Polar Star' and 'Havana Bay' make better narrative sense if read in chronological order I found to my slightly humourous dismay. Fans of Major/then Colonel Pribluda will be pleased to know his character appears in both sequels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tale that is Fresh and Spellbinding!","review":"Martin Smith created a story with all the right essentials for a super suspense filled mystery. There is romance, companionship, death (brutal mine you; faces mutilated, fingerprints removed), corruption and violence, betrayal and it all takes place in Russia. Then you combine the story with an author that can write a tale that is fresh and spellbinding then you have super novel. In my opinion this is still one of the best mystery novels out on the market today."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Authentic you can Smell the Place","review":"I was once a Russian speaker and junior Kremlinologist, but the closest I got to Moscow was Belgrad. Yet when I read this book, I felt I was there. I felt I could smell the place. I asked an old Moscow hand if it were that authentic and she said yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well on several levels","review":"This very engrossing book is both an interesting detective story and an interesting insight into Soviet life in Moscow at a certain time in the near past. By setting what would otherwise be a traditional murder mystery (with some traditionally current grotesque elements) in Moscow, Martin Cruz Smith is able to introduce a host of fresh elements into a tired genre. The Russian hero has a whole different set of personal and professional concerns than would his New York counterpart, and the characters and situations encountered are likewise different, strange and interesting because new to this type of fiction. Finally, the basic plot - the nature of the murder and the crime's solving - are totally dependent on the Moscow setting.Great stuff. A real original and highly recommended for anyone wanting something different from the same old stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Riveting Novel of Soviet Intrigue","review":"Arkady Renko, a disillusioned homicide investigator, is called upon when three bodies appear frozen in the snow- thier faces and fingertips removed. The investigation that follows takes Renko in directions that put him at odds with the KGB, the FBI, and the NYPD. In addition to being a first rate thriller, 'Gorky Park' shows the reader the fear and paranoia that pervaded the air in Soviet Russia. A bit slow at times, 'Park' nevertheless will keep you wondering just who can be trusted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best detective novel of the 80's!!!","review":"I've read many detective novel and so far Gorky Park is the best I had ever read.

My only joy in it, was that I checked it out of the library. But I'll never get back the hours I wasted reading chapter after chapter of boring, gross, horridly written sex.Anita has turned into little more than a whore. She only hunts vampires to have sex with them. She uses abused young men for sex. She uses people she doesn't even know for sex.Plot. Was there one.I do remember reading about 10 lines about a vampire serial killer Anita can't catch. Probably just as well. She would have had sex with him.And I'm one of the worst spellers in the world. So when I catch a whole bunch of spelling errors, it's obvious Ms Hamiton declined to let an editor read this horrid book.

There is absolutely NO POINT to this story. The series has gotten so convoluted and meaningless. The Anita in this book is a weak parody of her former self. All you get is five thousand versions of the same sex scene. You would think Laurell Hamilton would have some qualms about abandoning her fans, but I guess she doesn't.

I mean, I was finally getting into the Anita Blake series but this book has got to be the worst. Where's the plot? This whole book was sex on top of sex. It's been about 2 weeks since I read it and now, I can't even remember if there was an actual crime that took place in the book and if it was ever solved. All I can remember is the sex. This has made me so disappointed.

After the last few books, I stopped buying them. I checked Incubus Dreams out from the library. I haven't even finished it and I'm ready to take it back. This book has even more sex and even less plot. Who knew that could be possible? This series used to be my favorite. The last few books I had to force myself to finish. This book I can't even force myself to finish. Please, kill Anita off already. Never thought I'd say that. But, this series has become a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes LESS is MORE","review":"I am a big fan of Laurell K. Hamilton. Her latest book will not change this fact either.If you've read any of the other posts here you will see a adamant love or hate for the all the sex and ardeur scenes in Hamilton's newest novel.What I loved about Hamilton as an author was her spicy, quick witted humor and the life she breathed into the tough as nails, kick your ass right now if she has to character, Anita Blake.The plot is weak and so is Anita. One sex scene turns into another and another and I found myself wondering when a plot would start to emerge.You won't find anything like Obsidian Butterfly or Bloody Bones here--two of my favorites.I look forward to her next book--where maybe she'll resume the occupation of respected author and use less sex/porn to bring back the Anita Blake we all know and LOVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devastating","review":"This book was so disappointing, I am not even sure where to start. The amount of typos was appalling, there was no story line, and hey, I can admit freely that I have no problem reading some sex in a book. SOME SEX. When Anita has seven different partners in one night and the sex scenes continue on for three or four CHAPTERS, there is a problem. I used to love the Anita Blake series. I would start reading one and not be able to put it down. With Incubus Dreams, I had to force myself to finish the book. What happened to the story line from Cerulean Sins? I was expecting Incubus Dreams to continue on with that. And there was no Asher, no Edward, and after the beginning of the book Damian just dropped off into nowhere. And when did she become so wordy?! The whole book could have been summed up in less than half the pages! It's like reading Anne Rice's later work! To anyone who is considering reading Indubus Dreams, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!! I am sure you can find something better to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Dreams","review":"If you are a longtime fan of this series, you will simply not recognize the Anita Blake of Incubus Dreams as the same Anita Blake of Guilty Pleasures. Of course there must be room for character growth. In fact, it is a must for any long-running series. But that growth must be believable. In Incubus Dreams, Ms. Hamilton asks the reader to believe that a woman who once could not kiss a man without an emotional committment can participate in group sex that would be the envy of Jenna Jamison without a second thought. Anita's transformation is the most dramatic since Mary Magdalene's and is just as realistic. Incubus Dreams is simply a pathetic attempt to prolong the series in an effort to maximize profits to the publisher and the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita does everyone","review":"I've read the series from start to finish and now I can safely say I'm finished with it.

She is (or was) a big fan of the series but this book finished it. All I heard was \\"This is just full of pointless sex!\\" or \\"All Hamilton has been doing is watching cheap porn videos!\\" or \\"Oh god not another deep throat scene!\\". According to the girlfriend there is little of the characters of old which she enjoyed but plenty of non-plot developing sex. I did the old test of picking up the book and opening it at random at four places. Each time someone was being thrusted hard into something else. Thats a record!Please stop! Or if the publishing contract requires another book, please write it with both hands on the keyboard rather than one under the table!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even I have given up....","review":"I'm on of those Anita Blake fans that just kept on going, even when others complained that the books had turned into nothing but porn.

I'm so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"A few months after reading a Jeanine Frost novel, I lost the book and forgot the author and title. Knowing it was an urban fantasy and it had something to do with a cop, I easily mistook my earlier read for a LKH book.Three chapters in and I was wondering why Mrs. Frost made her main character such a whore. Then I got stuck on some long discussion about nothing, and I just stopped reading it. There was no way I could finish the book. It was boring and I absolutely hate two things when it comes to a novel: 1. pointless, easy sex, and 2. when every character lavishes the main one with compliments and undying love.Would I recommend this read? Yes, to an editor who could whip it into shape with plot and character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning point in the AB series","review":"Incubus Dreams was the turning point in the Anita Blake series for me. It was when the series started going downhill, and Anita just became a Mary Sue. If there is any doubt about Anita Blake being a Mary Sue, just look at the book cover. The woman on the cover, whom I presume to be Anita very much resembles LKH herself, albeit a thinner and younger version of course.I also felt like a more appropriate title should have been \\"Succubus Dreams\\" since it was all about Anita feeding on sex, talking about sex, whining about sex. Sex, sex and more sex. Very tiresome. Second worst book in the series right after Danse Macabre (which is the worst book ever)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend to this series?","review":"Ugh. Well I finished this book because I really hate to abandon one but this one sure made it tough. It essentially was 30 pages or so of plot and another 700 of sex. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for some sex but 700 pages gets to be a bit much. And can there be a character introduced that Anita doesn't end up with some metaphysical connection with? Her characters are so magically incestuous. And now sexually intertwined and only one, Richard, shows any sort of jealousy over it? Yeah, that sounds likely. I know LKH said in her blog she doesn't read reviews, but I'm thinking it might be to her benefit to start doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"One More Nail in the Coffin","review":"All the die hard Anita fans know that her demise was after Cerulean Sins, so enough said on that. What makes this book incredibly bad is...that it is plain just not well written. There is no proofreading, and after a bit, a very little bit, the mistakes just keep nagging you and nagging you to the point where you look for them instead of paying attention to what there is of the story. The question here would be: how did the book get published with so many mistakes (grammar etc)? A greater mystery and perhaps more worth solving than the purported mystery in the story itself. Anyway if you want to insist and try to read this do it as a seven day mass event to honor the worthwhile, delicious first books in the series, and weep your heart out at what Ms Hamilton has turned our Anita into. There you go, I think I discovered a social use for this book, it is the perfect PMS read, so it deserves 1 star after all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I purchased a draft copy","review":"i was introduce to the series by a friend and immediately proceeded to obtain every issue. i purchased incubus dreams as soon as it was available from my local book merchant. after reading it, i loaned it to the owner of the book store who also happens to be a fan and asked her opinion. she returned my money and said that obiviously a mistake had been made and the publisher must have released an unedited draft. hopefully they'll release the copy that has more than 83 pages of relevant story."},{"rating":"1","title":"soo disappointed","review":"I have purchased all of the Anita Blake stories and sad to say, this will probably be my last. Never before has the author left a story unfinished, as in this one where the 'bad guys' have gotten away.

I got that Anita and maybe Richard have accepted much about themselves, and that Anita has to eat more often as she now carries Damian and Nathaniel in another triumvant, which has given everyone all more powers. That's it! No great plot/story line on this, or the serial killings. The major focus seemed to be chacter self improvment and feeding. I stopped collecting Anita books now! Here is hoping the Merry Gentry series dosen't go done in the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave up,","review":"I gave up on page 345 (of 722). The mystery hasn't been mentioned since page 24, and Anita has had sex with seven men so far. This from the character who wouldn't sleep with her fiance six or seven books ago. There is no plot, only poorly written, highly improbable, overly detailed sex scenes strung together with dull dialog and cliches. It's mind-numbing. The author has taken a great premise for a series and thrown it away. There are too many books in the world to give this series any more of my time -- I'm done with Anita Blake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Dreams","review":"I was very disappointed in this installment of the Anita Blake series, the author is getting off track.

When this series started it was great. Action/suspense/mystery/bit of sexual tension and now it is basically all sex. I have nothing against sex. If I had wanted an erotic novel though I would have bought one. Now this was not a sudden change, this occurred over time. This book starts right off with a crime and ends with the bad guy getting there's, but the whole middle is just sex. Half way through this series there was a nice balance of sex/action and mystery.

Not what I fantasize about! I have tossed the book into the trash. This is my first and last book by this author.Especially offensive is the quote on the cover that \\"what the De Vince Code did for the religious triller, the Anita Blake series has done for the vampire novel.\\" Not by ANY stretch of the imagination.

I thought it was just me, but after reading a few other reviews, I feel better that it's not just me. Laurell Hamilton is a great writer. But I get the feeling that after Obsidian Butterfly, the \\"thriller\\" part of the series vanished and we are left with little more than a book of erotic fiction with a sparse story line. I like seeing Anita's character evolve. I actually skipped two chapters last night. Two or three chapters devoted completely to a new sexual excursion may be a bit of overkill. Even the erotica of it all is getting redundant. I get it, I really do. But it's lost something. I hope Micah starts getting better because I feel committed to this series now. I want the dark humor and excitement back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful simly awful","review":"I'm sorry, this novel was just horrible. I ended up skipping PAGES because it was so boring, redundant, or just dumb...I definitely would never recommend this book. The writing is bland, confusing and all over the place. The characters seem to have no personality or chemistry. All Anita thinks about it sex, sex, sex. An all around waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Hot Hot","review":"The book was fabulous. This is a definate read. I could not put it down. It will have your heart racing (in a good way). I have read all the anita blake books and this is the hottest. I can't wait til the next one Laurell. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Read","review":"What makes a great book? To me, it is having the book so well written that the characters come alive within my mind. Laurell K. Hamilton's ability to draw her readers into her stories is remarkable. I won't rehash the story plot as it has been done numerous times here, but I will say that for me, the story once again drew me in and carried me away into another world for its entirety. Character interaction is terrific. The action, although not as prevalent as previous books, is as great as always. The ending did seem rushed and thrown together as an afterthought but it did not detract overall from the rest of the book. Laurell Hamilton's imagination is commendable and I thank her for once again allowing me the chance to see Anita and the gang and hang out with them for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushing the envelope","review":"It definitely is a step from the first Anita books and heavy on the sexual aspects (instead of the violence which more people seem to be comfortable with, inquiring mind has to wonder what that tells us), but nevertheless this entry brought progress to the series. Finally, finally after 12 books ( if I count correctly, pardon me if I did not) Anita, Richard and Jean-Claude have their moment together. This alone was worth the entry fee. And the rest was not so bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"One sexy book","review":"This is one sexy book. Frankly, I didn't know WHAT to expect. I'm usually one for some mainstream novel like Angels & Demons or The Bark of the Dogwood, so this was quite a switch for me. Still, for the genre it is, I enjoyed it. Not at all like some novel by Anne Rice, which I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I really enjoyed the latest chronicle of Anita's life. To see how this amazing woman adapts to all challenges thrown at her and still maintains her personal integrity. LKH has introduced more fascinating characters and developed already established characters with surprising outcomes. To read these twelve books back to back is to see a master storyteller at work. Can't wait for the next installment in the lives of Anita, JC, Asher, Nathaniel etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to the story?","review":"I love the Anita Blake series. But this book doesn't seem like one of them. Where's the action? Where's the crime? Where's the STORY? After reading 300+ pages I realized I was still in the first 24 hours of the story and in those 24 hours Anita had doing nothing more than have sex (real and metaphysical) with just about any male who has ever entered the story line and a few who haven't. If I wanted erotica, I would have bought erotica.Such a disappointment when a great series of books goes sour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome !!!!! Loved it !!!!!!!!!!","review":"I loved this book, can't wait to read it again!!!!!!! I think everyone needs to lighten up. I wish I was Anita. You go girl!!I can't wait for the next one to come out.Keep up the great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Writing","review":"I have long been a fan of the Anita Blake series and I continue to buy each installment though the writing gets steadily worse. I love the characters--plain and simple. I'm very glad to see Nathaniel and Damian have more time in Incubus Dreams, but that's the only kind thing I can write about Hamilton's newest novel. The writing is horrible--lines are repeated over and over again. The little plot that there is appears in the last 100 pages. Incubus Dreams reads as though it were written--and edited--in a hurry. I don't appreciate that kind of minimal effort in a hardback and won't be buying another anytime soon. I'm also sick to death of Anita arguing--though, honestly I don't read these books for Anita (I like Asher, Damian, and Nathaniel). I strongly recommend waiting for the paperback version--Incubus Dreams just isn't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad entry in what was once an entertaining series.","review":"Anita Blake used to be interesting. Now she's just a superhuman sex-machine that's laden with Catholic guilt and typoes. At one point I accidently skipped ahead 50 pages and didn't even notice. Nevertheless I will probably still read anything else that LKH comes out with because I'm a completist like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Short and sweet....I was so disappointed, and I'm glad to see other reviewers agree with me. There was about 20% story mixed in with 80% porn. And that's if you could find the story among the typo's and occasional grammatical errors. I've bought every book by this author and have noticed an unfortunate turn in the type of story that is being produced. I am drawn to the strong female character, the romance, and the action, all of which were lacking in this story. I would not recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ardeur or Arduous??????","review":"I discovered Anita Blake when she was on the second novel of the series. I have been an avid reader ever since. No more.Frankly, I do not understand LKH's attachment to the \\"ardeur.\\" This book was over 600 pages. I quit reading at 237. I was sooooooooo tired of Anita's endless self-searching and conscience-stricken monologues about whether she should have sex BEFORE she had sex again. There was only about 20 pages of real plot or conflict in 237 pages. That's less than ten percent. It started to feel like Anita was channelling Richard, a character who has always bored me to tears. The old Anita: morally certain, decisive and action-oriented was nowhere to be seen.If I didn't know that LKH had written this book, its bloated, overly focused sexual approach would have made me think I was reading Anne Rice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't know sex could be this boring!","review":"I agree with most of the reviewers of this book. I found myself skipping through all of the sex scenes desperately looking for some plot. I was very disappointed in this book, being a huge Anita fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book","review":"I am sorry, but this book would be better used in the movie 'Day After Tommorrow' as one of the books that were burned to keep warm. For the last several books the Anita Blake series has moved from an action/mystery genre to one sex scene after another. I loved the series and have been a loyal fan through out the series. However, this for me is the end of the Anita Blake Series. When 99% of a book is one sex after another one can only take so much. I mean the books are no longer realistic. (I mean come on, one can not have sex 4 times a day or more and still expect to get anything done.) Farwell Anita Blake the monster never got you, but excessive sex has. Again Rest in Peace. As a side note I only gave this book one star because Amazon requires at least one star. This book does not warrant even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Anita?","review":"LKH took a really cool, independent, take charge type of woman and turned her in to some sort of porn star. I have no problem with sex, but the relentless, often distasteful, gratuitous sex in this book is off putting. I'd like to get back to the \\"story\\" and less of the twisted sexual proclivities of of a wannabe porn star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Porn? This Book is for You!","review":"I started reading Hamilton's novels in middle school, and they progressed into porn faster than I could hit puberty and have any interest in them. What started out as a legitimate fiction novel (plot included) has turned into flat out porn. It seems that these novels are now an outlet for the authors own sexual fantasies, and every once and a while she remembers to add in a little plot. After these last few books I have lost all respect for Hamilton has a fiction writer and wouldn't recommend her novels to anyone who is lacking in sexual perversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Enough Plot","review":"I have purchased every Laurell K. Hamilton novel that has come out, and this is probably the worst. I love the Anita Blake character, but the author is spending more time talking about kinky sex than the plot of the story. Lets go back to a plot like Guilty Pleasures, the Laughing Corpse, etc where there is a little sex in between the action instead of a little action in between the sex scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"All sex - no plot","review":"Not up to snuff. The plot twists, red herrings, and constant energy were missing from this episode. Yes, you learn more about the characters but at what price.Let's hope Ms Hamilton has what ever this was out of her system and either kills Anita off or returns to what made her a crossover favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of the best.","review":"The Anita Blake Vampire Hunter series is the best series I've read. Incubus Dreams, in my opinion, is the worst in the series. The entire book was one sex scene after the next, and I usually enjoy the sex scenes. This just became monotonous. I was at the point of skipping pages and almost forgot the original story line. Maybe Laurall was having a bad year but she's definately done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time!","review":"After hearing rave reviews about this author I decided to listen to the (libraries copy) audio version while driving to and from work. You'd think for being a 30 hour disc set it could at least be a little entertaining. Too much unnecessary details in my opinion, cussing, and overall horrid violent sex described in the first disc alone. Oh, and there is a murder mystery tucked in there somewhere. Details about rape, rough sex, a lot of \\"F\\" words and other descriptions of a sexual nature discouraged me from moving on to disc two. I might look into her earlier books since so many expressed how bad the new ones have become. Don't waste your time with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Channeling Philip Roth...a lousy imitation!","review":"I am just so disgusted by this book..I had to force myself to finish it just to see how much damage Hamilton could do to her characters. What a disappointment...the incessant sex scenes stuck between the few instances of police work, are just overwhelmingly bad! None of this reads like it was written by the author who penned the earlier books in the series. She writes like she is trying to please some absurd 'male' fantasy version of what women \\"really\\" want...I don't believe I will buy the next book. Perhaps Ms. Hamilton won't miss my lousy eight bucks,..but I won't ever regain the time I put into reading this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Blake Vampire Hunter?","review":"I found myself forgetting that she actually had a job. I have read this series from the beginning. She used to be a prude. Now she's never having sex with less than 2 other people. The plot to this book was so buried under the sex scenes, that I forgot who the bad guys were. Not LKH's best work. This book would have done well with an NC-17 rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disappointing! How sad!","review":"I have to echo other reviews. I'm a big fan of the series, but have to say I'm struggling to get through this one. I love sex scenes as much as anyone, but this is ridiculous...the plot is a total afterthought! I hope there's some way that this feedback is getting back to Hamilton"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me get this straight.........","review":"Anita is an expert of deep throating, has wild, tumultuous sex several times in one day with several men, is a rainmaker *and* multi-orgasmic without the need of female-centered foreplay? Sounds like every man's pornographic dream come true to me! And that is just the problem. LKH wants to make Anita Blake sound like a such an amazing woman that she has lost track of what this series is supposed to be about. Ms. Hamilton, if you have issues about creating some sort of superwoman in the Nietzsche fashion, go seek therapy, but please bring back the no-nonsense, gun-happy, self-assured heroine that we once knew and loved."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot","review":"I have all of the Anita Blake books by Laurell K. Hamilton. I have loved almost all of them. However, her latest book is a huge disappointment. This book, which is over 600 pages long, has no discernible plot, except the theme of sex with vampires and other wereanimals. The reader is forced to speculate on Anita's sexual escapades--with whom and how many will she have sex with in the next few pages. I can't believe Ms. Hamilton has run out of ideas. I am hoping that this book is an aberration. I am still upset that I wasted money on the hardcover edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I have been awaiting the arrival of this book for some time.. I am a huge fan of laurell's Anita Blake series... I was extremly dissapointed with this book.... there were TONS of errors... I mean.. time to get a new type editor perhaps? She repated herself over and over in this book... yes we already know who Belle Morte' is thank you... this book was open for sooooo many things.. and all she put in it was a TON about the arduer... sex is interesting.. but come on now... we want more vampires and more were-animals... not more sex.. all in alll this book was a huge let down... hopefully her next one will make up for 685 pages of sex..."},{"rating":"1","title":"No longer an Anita Blake Fan","review":"I would really like to know what happened? I was a dedicated Anita Blake fan. WAS being the operative word. Previously LKH books had plot to them. This book is 98% sex with practically everyone walking dead or alive. 2% plot! I felt really cheated that I blew good money on the hardcover (that's never happening again). I could have gotten the 98% from a cheap penthouse paperback. Instead of expecting a fun book and a good read I was bitterly disappointed. Save your money. LKH should go back to formula!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"I haven't enjoyed reading the Anita Blake books since before Obsidian Butterfly. Each book used to have a plot and had more to it than sex and whining, and Anita Blake came across as strong and capable rather than as petulant and irritable. Erotic writing is one thing, but this book (and other recent ones) sounds as though LKH was being paid for each page on which her characters discuss or have sex. And it isn't particularly interesting sex. I used to look forward to different characters being introduced, but recently so many of them have been one-dimensional and seem to serve only as prospective partners for AB. If people want to read poorly-written porn, there's plenty for free on the internet.If LKH begins to focus more on the supernatural/mystery/adventure/horror/folklore of her earlier books, her books and readers will benefit."},{"rating":"1","title":"In mourning....","review":"I have about twenty pages to go in this book and I don't care if I finish it or not. I miss the flavor of the first books in the series...fun and a bit dangerous. Now it's just skimming till you get to a half-way decent part. I'm sick of vampire politics and pard rules. I'm hoping in the next book Edward comes back and does them all in!Incubus Dreams I have to admit is one star better than CS. I should check this review for typos, but since nobody checked Incunbus Dreams...why should I?Reader Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This series has gone downhill since Obsidian Butterfly.All Anita does in this book is have sex, with everyone and anyone. It's disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill Slide","review":"Really enjoyed the first 9 books. Will stop after Incubus Dreams. I enjoy reading and sex but when it takes the place of story line, you loose me. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"All sex, no plot. A waste of money...","review":"Sadly, Hamilton's books continue to go downhill, and this one is no exception. Too much talky sex, with a bit of plot thrown in as an after-thought. Hamilton used to research her books by studying police procedure, firearms handling, and mysticism. Now she \\"studies\\" a manual of sexual positions (really, she said so herself!). On her fan site, Hamilton reported that she was \\"studying\\" such a manual looking for a position she hadn't used in a book yet, although she bragged that she and her new husband already knew most of them. Well, whoo-hoo for her. Anita Blake has degenerated from a tough yet likeable character into a vehicle for Hamilton's lame sexual fantasies, and the mystery/suspense/horror that made the books so engaging has gone out the window. Save your money. If you want a good read, go pick up the old books from a second-hand store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Reader","review":"If she wants to write what someone on a forum I saw somewhere called Fangfrackers, that is fine.Don't dress them up as monster hunting books though, and call aspade a spade, and throw in the erotica word. Will that hurt sales thatbadly? If she put out a line of books purely focused on women shagging monsters, can't imagine she wouldn't do really well with it, as she seems to have some talent in that area.The plot here is of the thin crust variety, no doubt about it.Personally, in a ghost busting or monster hunting book, I want somestuff to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends on what you like","review":"The truth is, this book really wasn't on par with the preceeding books of the series plot wise, but in truth, this book is the true turning of Anita's morals. Before she was wondering if she was just one of the monsters and in this book, she begins to accept it, as well as accepting that some of her infamous rules are pointless. It is fascinating to see just how exactly someone's mind can go from so high on the moral podium to having nearly no lines anymore and this book accuratly shows the mental process of that degration.This book also back tracked a little by pointing out that vampires, while looking like humans and thinking like humans most of the time, are NOT, in fact, human.Sure there's lots and lots of sex (depends, really, on whether you like that kind of thing or not) but most of that really just helps show how Anita is beginning to accept herself and those around her as well as the situation in life she had been thrown."},{"rating":"2","title":"The series keeps getting better","review":"I'm not sure if the people reading this book have read the entire series or not. Anita has developed from a black and white no compromise person where there is only good or bad and no middle ground, into a real person that can see the grey areas and appreciate the fact that there is no absolute good or evil.This book gives more depth to all the characters and lets you know what is going on inside them and why they are doing what they do. I can hardly wait for \\"Micah\\" and \\"Danse Macabre\\" to see even more of what drives the characters.If you're looking for your typical vanilla vampires, were's, and other assorted monsters---human and otherwise, read something else. Anita Blake and company are hot and getting hotter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell, Anita Blake","review":"I was browsing through the reviews of this book, and it looks like many, many other readers are as disappointed as I am. It's not just the sex. It's that we feel like we've lost a character we really enjoyed. That should tell you that Laurell K. Hamilton is capable of extremely engaging writing, but she has alienated a loyal following with this one. See my orignal review below:I so enjoyed the earlier Anita Blake books and have shared them with family and friends. I was beginning to lose interest as the content became more and more about justification for sex and less about story.Well, this one finally reached the limit of what I'm interested in. About 90 pages of story and the rest is justification of why Anita can have sex with, well, about anyone around at the time.Just not interested anymore. Give me 300 - 400 pages of the story line and you'll win me back. Otherwise, it's farewell Anita."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened?","review":"First and foremost, I have loved the Anita Blake Series. However, Incubus Dreams has almost completely turned me off. It is very hard to like a character that requires and demands all the attention but complains the whole time. She has gotten very \\"all about her.\\" I didn't mind the sex, but c'mon 5 people in less than 24 hrs? Am I the only one who is bored by the various ties and metaphyical explanations that I skip it now? I want the cases and vampire hunter back. Was there even a case in this one? I was so irritated, i can't remember. Why have all the characters become unlikable? Where is Edward? I want the old Anita back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex, not enough monsters","review":"Just wanted to add some \\"me too's\\" to the review list. Not that I don't like well written sex scenes, but after the overdose in \\"Cerulean Dreams\\" I decided not to buy this book but got on the hold list at the local library. Glad I did. Instead of all the sex I would have rather read about Dolph's daughter-in-law-to-be and family dynamics, a fight with Moroven (Damien's maker-at least in this book), Barbara & Steve Brown's murdered son who Barbara is going to have animated come hell or high water, Stephen & Gregory's abusive father confronting his now-were boys, the vampire church's problems with no blood oaths, the problems Micah sorts out with the coalition or springing somebody (or everybody) from a lycanthrope safe house. And, of course, more interesting monsters, human and non-human. I hope LKH is not going to dole out these kind of story lines in miserly doses among pages and pages and pages of sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Convoluted - Very Disappointing","review":"After reading every book in every series LKH has written, I was looking forward to this. After reading happily along for the first 15 pages, the book then slid into a disappointing miasma of side plot lines and (never thought I'd say this), way too much strange sex. I don't think the \\"mystery\\" aspect of solving the serial killings even picked up until perhaps 3-400 pages later. I actually started skimming over the sex scenes, as they became rather rote and boring, to see if the story would pick up again. It did at the end of the book, but about 200 pages of superflous couplings could have been edited out. Am hoping LKH reads some of her fan's reviews, and fixes this in the next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Dreams or Some Like a Plot","review":"A plot, a plot, what happened to the plot? I used to love the Anita books but I am so tired of reading the same thing over and over again in these past few books that I could scream. I'm fine with all the sex LKH wants Anita to have, but is it possible to include a storyline as well? Jeez. I was under the impression that a book's publishing house editor was the individual who was supposed to speak frankly to an author when his or her writing got out of hand, but that is certainly not happening with the LKH books. I had so much hope for this book since the last Merry book was just dreadful. It was as if LKH just stopped writing knowing she had one more book in the series to finish. I'm not buying any more of either series. I'm going to go back to the first eight Anita books and re-read those. They are so far superior to the last five books LKH has written that it's as if a different person wrote them. The same thing happened with Patricia Cornwell's books. Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton's wish fulfillment?","review":"Hamilton seems to have come down with Anne Rice syndrome. Extremely popular and selling well, so she decides she doesn't need an editor.Wrong! I lost track of the typos - sometimes three separate spellings of the same word on the same page. Is this minor? Yes, but it shows that not much care was taken with the manuscript - even down to using a spellchecker. Other people have mentioned the gaping plot threads; again, a good editor with the power to make suggestions can help resolve this.Much of the omni-present sex seems pointless. Okay, succubus line of vampires blah blah blah, but when the (previously strait-laced) heroine is banging every guy around and they're all blessed with enormous schlongs, that dives into the realm of Mary Kay fanfic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampire Hunter to Sex Fiend","review":"I have always admired the kick-ass, hard nosed Anita Blake. From the beginning I was hooked by her wit, wicked tongue and no nonsense attitude. Now, she's using that wicked tongue in ways that I don't even want to think about, let alone read. A little romp here and there is fine and dandy, but, good grief, I can't even finish the book. She has had sex in the last 3 chapters that I have read, and I'm sick of it. Leave a little to the imagination, Laurell....Please! I think I'm done with Anita Blake and Laurell Hamilton! PS. I'd give this book less than 1 star, but they won't let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"More story, less sex please","review":"The actual story takes up about 5 pages of this book.

Time to move this series to the porn category and forget that there is supposed to be a story that goes along with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not what I expected","review":"I love LKH's Anita Blake Series but this one dissapointed me. In this book Anita instead of find out who or what commited the crime/murder and why? She focus more into who she will do and how? There is a lot of pages for a story which span is like 2 to 4 days and also how she wrap it all up on the last chapters is dissapointing. I think there is a lot of pages wasted on the sex issues, it is not that Im squeamish about the sex stuff is because for me, sometimes less is more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Careful what you wish for","review":"I had fantasies about doing it with Anita Blake, I read the Guilty Pleasures to Obsidian Butterfly novels and they were truly one of the best series of books I had ever read. And I love eros as much as the next person, when I got Incubus Dreams a 30 disk cd set, by disk 16 there were three descriptions of the Anita Blake I grew to love, the rest of it was Anita as sex object, I undertand the integral part her powers have in the novels, however I got it the first time, I didn't need to hear it over and over and over and over....get the drift???? When I want sexy, I get sexy, same for adult themes, I wanted Anita Blake Vampire Hunter, what I got was Anita Blake S**T, which if made into an adult movie and advertised as such I would purchase, Laurel Hamilton is still an excellent author, just package the novels honestly, and beleive me I am no prude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous, pathetic, and not even slightly exciting","review":"The Anita Blake series was recommended to me, and I've been plowing through the increasingly awful books. Blue Moon was OK, the rest are repetitive and overdependent on descriptions of her guns, knives, eye color, hair length, and clothing. But this one is the limit, a wannabe porn joke. I keep trying to figure out WHAT the author was thinking. Did she think this would be funny, watching the character add more and more partners, in sillier and sillier sex scenes? It really is just pathetic; The Executioner, a slave to her powers and her libido, screwing anything and everyone that moves, in any way possible, because if she doesn't her minions will die. Oh puhleaze. Not funny, not sexy, not thrilling, not interesting, not worth checking out of the library, much less paying actual money for this book.

I was thrilled when I found a store that put it out early when I was on vacation. Now I wish I had saved my money and bought it at my local used book store.On the front cover it clearly states that this is the next book in the Anita Blake VAMPIRE HUNTER series and that small text is the only way you would know it. It reads more like Anita Blake super skank. I have never had any problem with the sex scenes in any of the anita books before. They were mixed in at a nice rate making the book wonderful, but in Incubus Dreams all she does is have sex. Constantly. In 600+ pages there are only TWO scenes where she fights vampires. In such a large book you would think there would be room for something else.I am so disappointed that I spent so much money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disapointment","review":"I'm about 1/3 of the way through the book and I'm starting to skim.

REMEMBER TO USE YOUR PUBLIC LIBRARY!There are approximately a dozen books in this series (I no longer really care so I'm guess-timating instead of taking the time to look). The 1st 5 were good but it's been down hill from there.

About a fourth of the way through \\"Incubus Dreams\\" and I'm begining to wonder if there is going to be any type of story or if it is simply going to page after page of Hamilton's fantasies in vivid detail.I think I'll pass on future installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Instruction Guide to Porn","review":"I can honestly say it is now over with this writer for both series. This series started out with some interesting characters, alternate history, and good mystery / suspense. Now I feel most of her fans could write these current books and do a better job of it. I think the last 60 pages actually focuses on what we used to love about Anita. Now the only people that could actually choke down the first 600 pages have to be into porn. And it's not even good porn! Sorry Ms. Hamilton, you'll have to put your books in a different place in the store if you keep writing this way. In fact, I don't think this book should even be in horror."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hamilton Book, Ever","review":"I am extremely dissapointed in this book. I am 400 pages in and I am not sure what is going on except that Anita engages in carnal activity every 2 chapters. This book reads like a bad porno movie where the \\"plot\\" exists simply to get from one sex scene to another, except I am not exactly sure what the plot is about. I guess the warning signs have been there in the last couple of books, but sheesh, if I wanted to read trashy romance novels I would just subscribe to the Harlequin romance novel selections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost my interest in the series","review":"I thought the series was great up until Narcissus in Chains. It's all downhill from there folks. Incubus Dreams is the worst of all with 300 pages of pointless sex, no plot development, or any interesting characters with the exception of Nathaniel. I was reading a book a week until this one came out. I started it in December. After reading the threeway between Anita, Richard, and Jean-Claude, I put the book down and haven't picked it up since. Three months later it's still sitting unfinished on my nightstand serving a better purpose as a coaster. Way to kill a great series Laurell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do away with the ardeur!!","review":"I have read Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake books all the way from the beginning, but I simply could NOT finish this book. I tried twice, and finally gave up. I mean, the main character goes from being at times overly prudish to becoming a complete slut. The so-called ardeur takes over the entire plot until you forget what the plot actually is! It all just becomes another reason for Anita to have gratuitous sex with...whoever! Don't get me wrong. I LOVE the hot scenes in the books, but come on! And on a side note...the bestiality was a little much. Needless to say, I will be skipping this disaster and moving on to the next book, IF I decide to keep reading LKH at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Dreams","review":"I am glad that I read it using a library copy. I am not sure that I will pick it up when I see it as a paperback at a used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am really happy that I didn't pay for this book","review":"I don't understand where Mrs. Hamilton is going with the Anita Blake character but this book was horrible:o( When I read Guilty Pleasures I thought that Anita would be a strong capable heroine but she's turned into a contradictory, sex crazed, self righteous...I don't even feel like going on because that's what this book does. Goes on and on about nothingness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly better than Cerulean Sins","review":"If you're an Anita Blake fan, you'll probably read this book, if only to find out what happens in this series. I have to agree with the other reviews. There is less and less plot, and more and more sex. It seems to be an alarming trend since the incredible writing of Obisdian Butterfly. This book is slightly better than Cerulean Sins, but not much. Its definitely longer, but once again, more sex scenes, longer book.The only nice thing about this book, is seeing Richard become less of a pansy and Nathaniel becoming more 'real'. I would like to see more of what causes that development in Richard, but doubt we will see any reflection in the future. The main thing I hope is whoever is editing the series keeps Laurell on track, so we don't see Richard bouncing back and forth between being a pansy and coming to terms with himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I enjoyed reading the first 8 books and then they took a turn for the worst. By book 12 I was so disturbed because it turned into written pornography. It's as though Laurell ran out of ideas and all she could think of was sex. It was disappointing because I really came to like the male characters. I always finish a series once I start it. Not this one. I will never recommend it. I've never seen a book that takes 20 pages to tell about an intimate encounter. Gross!!! Sorry Laurell, but you lost a fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"If I wanted to read erotica then I would. All the later books in the series just slid down a very steep slope into a large pile of manure. I wouldn't recommend any book in the series past book 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it a month ago, forgot it already.","review":"Another Anita power is discovered, she has more sex. Richard's still whiny, she has more sex. Throw in more vampires, and she has sex with them too.Not even good sex. More like sterile porn.She's become a sociopathic nymphomaniac with god-like powers. And yet, her character could not be more boring.Was there even a point to this book??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Last one for me...","review":"I really enjoyed the first 10 books of this series. They got a little too gory for me at times, went a little overboard in the shock value from time to time, but I still enjoyed the characters and the story behind it all. I keep trying, thinking she'll get back on track, but this book officially ends my interest in Anita Blake. I don't mind some sex scenes here and there if they expand the plot and continue the story. The past few books have increased from being good stories to being hard core porn. Nothing is left to the imagination, every little detail is included and they are not subtle. I find myself skimming over half the book because all the sex just doesn't matter. Anita finds herself \\"needing\\" to bonk every male she comes in contact with because of this convenient beast she has in her now. She's not even her anymore. LKH should've just started a whole new series with a new character to carry this Ardeur BS and have sex every five minutes. I'm bored and I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disheartening","review":"When I first read this series, I loved the wit, humor & depth of the characters & their situations.Unfortunately, the quality of the series has taken a downward spiral. Obsidian Butterfly was the peak & all the following titles have been horrid. Incubus Dreams has been the WORST one yet. Flip to any page (ANY page) in this book & you'll find Anita in a gratuitous sex scene with random characters. It's too bad, this series had great promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book from Laurell","review":"Laurell K. Hamilton continues to amaze me. How does she come up with this stuff? I am also glad this is her longest book yet, a veritable treat of a tome. (Yes, tome. It's huge.) Some people object to the plot getting so sexed up, and I can see the point, although I like all of her writing. Don't give this to your kids if you don't want questionable material in their heads, as the book is just this side of X rated, in my opinion. However, I really enjoyed the thoughtful development of Anita's personal relationships, as they were logical and made sense. Her prose is lush, with lovely use of language. If you haven't read any of the other books in the series, you might want to pick it up from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"no plot","review":"I agree with the other reviewers about this book - sex, sex, sex. I enjoy a little sex in novels as well as the next person but to give up the story line - NO! I have been a fan of the Anita Blake series from the beginning and am sorry to see the down turn in the novels. Maybe she should return to the land of Nightseer for awhile. I hope the writing improves regarding plot, as for steaminess she already excels in that area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustration of the worst sort","review":"I won't repeat the detailed reports of other reviewers, but I can not hold back my frustration. LKH used to be one of my favorite authors. But the the number of continuity errors, spelling errors and just bad writing/editing have reached a point where they are infuriating. The repetative pet phrases and the complete lack of pacing are amateurish. The way the 'plot' is put on hold for the majority of the book for the sex scenes (or more to the point, the ad nauseum talking about the sex) is simply self-indulgent.If what you really love about the Anita Blake books is the endless romantic analysis, the beautiful men and their slavish devotion to Anita, and the hot, erotic sex scenes, you're obviously the audience for whom LKH is writing now, and you may like this book, because there is plenty of that. If you're looking for the mystery/intrigue/adventure that characterized LKH's earlier work, you will only be frustrated here."},{"rating":"1","title":"We will let this one slide!","review":"OK... granted this book meandered from plot to subplot to sidebar and sometimes back again, and yes it read more like a \\"Letter to Penthouse\\" than your typical LKH novel... but let's just chalk it up to... well I don't know what you can chalk it up to. Anyway, I will reserve judgment until the next installment to see where things go. After all, any \\"Anita\\" book can't be all bad and this one still has plenty of supernatural ruffhousing and metaphysical fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too long but competent","review":"Strange direction to the series this book takes. I understand how some might be put off by it. A lot of the criticisms levied here are accurate. However, I still was drawn into the book by the story and the character development. I can't wait until the next couple of books come out in 2006."},{"rating":"2","title":"Character developement!","review":"Anita Blake is still shoot before asking too many questions, but she is coming to terms with her varied sex life. Just because she isn't fighting every man in her life does not mean that she can still be cold hearted and kill when necessary.I went back and read the last few previous novels and this one is finally getting some of the issues straigtened out ( this is a long series of books). It is a relief that she has these men and can still do the job she was made for. I loved the sex, crime solving and the messy part of her private life. Way to go Laurell K. Hamilton. I could not put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't believe everything you read","review":"There is a lot of negative feedback on this book from what i have read. I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. There wasn't as much fighting...Anita is getting very very powerful and I am very curious to see where her powers are going. There is more character development of Anita and her love life than anything else. There is a lot more sex than usual and Micah's role was downplayed just a bit compared to the last book BUT Nathaniel rules the book and I have to say that he is one of my favorite characters. I was also getting mad at Richard in the past two books and he was able to redeem himself a bit in this one. I don't want to give any spoilers but finished the book with good feelings. I can't wait for number 13!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diehard Fan Dissapointed","review":"Ok, I've been a diehard LKH since Guilty Pleasures, I've read all her work I can get my hands on, but I'm sorry, this book sucked! What happened to the hangers in Cerulean Sins, what happening with the Mother or Darkness thing? Theres maybe 30-40 pages of grisly crime tops, page 74 on is all SEX! I mean, don't get me wrong , its nice, but not 700 pages worth of it!Some things here are dealt with I guess, with plp psycho-analyzing other people, and some metaphysical twists, but the whole book from page 100 on is just so....predictable, except maybe which stranger Anita's gonna screw next. What happened? Wheres the plots, the twists, the thrill I used to get reading about Anita's adventures? I paid $8.00 for a porn! Im sorry laurell, but I hope your books take a turn for the better, but of the reviews on Micah, im starting to lose hope. Cross your fingers in July for Danse Macrabe...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too drawn out","review":"Not only did the fact that Anita is now sleeping with 5 guys on a regular basis (not including \\"accidents\\") get old so very very fast but I'm not sure why the need to drag out descriptions well beyond their purpose was a theme in the book as well. Long after I could picture the whole scene in my head there would be 3 pages of how Anita thought this color was like this flower she saw once or how that carpet reminded her of oh I dunno some carpet burn she got one time. I was bored and as a vampire Hunter fan, very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Anita Blake book i'll ever pick up","review":"Unfortunately I have to agree with others who gave this book a negative review.This review may contain minor plot spoilers!Like so many of them i fell face first into the Anita Blake books. I even put up with the erotic field trips. This book, however, is just full of sex and very little else. Just when i think we might be getting somewhere with zombies and animating it turns into another sex fest. And it took until page 240 something to even mention anything other than Anita's crazy sex life. In fact she was clothed just long enough to argue with a client before needing to be \\"rescued from her condition\\".I also agree with another reader when they said if she wants to write erotic fiction she should label it as such. It seems the days of crime solving and life and death situation is gone from Anita's life. I found myself skipping through chapters just waiting for her to put her clothes on long enough to step outside.Very sad turn of events for the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is kick ass Anita?","review":"I loved the Anita Blake books up till now. It was nothing but porn that made me feel like throwing the book away. There is no substance to the plot I wasted my money. Bring back the Anita of old stop draging out the ardeur thing who cares anyway if it makes a character like Anita act like she's in heat bring back the story line bring back the series that I enjoyed and the tough, kick ass Anita Blake we have grown to enjoy. Lets hope she doesn't mess up the Merry books as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"losing focus","review":"well, I just finished reading this book for the second time, and I was very disappointed. When this series first started out they had a well defined plot, great side stories and every character was someone you could get to know. In this book, the story takes a back seat to all the sex. Although they are well writen, the sex scenes take up far too much of the book. The actually mystery that Anita is supposed to be solving is bearly mentioned. There were plenty of good parts too this book, but I just don't think that it comes anywere close to being as good as her earlier novels. I am re-reading burnt offerings today, and I am surprised at the difference in quality of the two books. If you are a big Anita fan read the book, but wait till it comes out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may be the last Anita Blake book I ever read...","review":"There was just too much filler (Anita having sex with everyone) and not enough of the case. In fact, I realized that I had actually forgotten what the case was. I didn't even finish the book before I returned it to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Next Time","review":"Laurell Hamilton is one of about 2 authors that I will cough up the bucks for the hard back. It's been interesting to see her writing style evolve. Her first couple of Anita Blake books involved a whole new kind of story line which I liked. Her next several books involved a whole new kind of story line with a very sensual element which I really liked. Now we've come full circle. Most of the book covers sex scenes, usually kinky. A lot of what's left over involves discussion with people in her life and with herself; lots of angst here. Obviously, this leaves very little room for anything resembling an actual plot.Laurell isn't the only game in town with this kind of supernatural story line any more. I hate to say it, but some of the other authors are doing it better. Even when she's poor, Laurell Hamilton is still worth reading, but I'll probably wait for the paperback on her next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of the Line","review":"Ms. Hamilton has truly lost track of what this story was about. I thought the sex \\"phase\\" would pass, but it's not going to. I didn't have a problem with one, two, or even three sex scenes, but this book was nothing but sex. I used to be excited when these books came out, but I've finally realized that the characters are not going to develop any further, which is sad because Anita used to be a Kick as Bitch with a purpose...I don't think I have to say what she is now."},{"rating":"1","title":"am I done yet?","review":"I am a die-hard LKH fan and when my husband saw me bring this book home he was prepared to run the house for a few days because I usually can't put her books down. Not this one mama. It took me so long to read because it just was NOT intersting. It really doesn't add much to the series so my advice is to just skip it. Maybe her next one will be better after she reads all these harsh reviews (fingers crossed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened??????","review":"I gave the book two stars just because I can't admit to myself that an Anita Blake novel could be awful.Not the book I was looking forward to. There have been many times in the past where I was tired of Ms. Blake's whinny, high moral double standards and wished she would 'go with the flow,' but this was a little too much. You can only read about someone having sex for so long... The end of the book was great. The beginning was about four hundred pages too long.To wait another year+ for the next book in the series may give most fans too much time to think about just how badly this book was written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Dreams","review":"While I thought that nothing could be worse than Dance Macbre, Hamilton proved me wrong with this installation of the Blake series. This book has lost the luster of the early books of the series. The grand battle that usually happens at the end of the books is sadly replased with disturbing sex scenes. The intreguing growth of Anita's powers has been replaced with the growth of her lust. Serriously, Hamilton, if you want to write a romance series, write one, but don't forsake one of my favorite characters for an outlet for your sexual frustration!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A valuable lesson","review":"A few months ago, I read an amazing book (BloodAngel, by Justine Musk, if you're interested). After finishing it, I moved on to another book, only to be disappointed. In fact, 95% of the books I've read since have left me feeling let down. Sure, they've got decent plots and interesting characters, but they lack the language, the prose that was so effective in BloodAngel. I had been angsting over this fact, and I would've continued to do so had I not read this sorry excuse for a book.I took decent plots and interesting characters for granted; I assumed that they were inherent to published writing, which (I so naively thought) went through SOME sort of screening process. I now know that, while amazing prose is always a nice touch, a plot and characters would be good enough.That pretty much sums it up - I read one book, and it made everything look awful in comparison; I read this book, and suddenly nothing else seemed quite so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Hard core porn","review":"I have read every Anita Blake novel along with my 26 year old son. He stopped at Cerrilian Sin, and I've stopped at Incubus Dreams. Where was the plot. I could have thrown out 150 pages of heavy breathing and hard core porn description and the bad guys got maybe 10 pages. Sorry but this book sucked big time. Hamilton needs to cut down her descriptions of foreplay and get to an understandable plot. I am not a prude and understand the need to describe her changes, but what a waste of my time...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd like a side of plot with the porn, please","review":"The first five or six books in this series were awesome, creative, fun, plot driven -- as genre novels should be, because let's not kid ourselves, LKH doesn't write literature. The series was great because it was an awesome mix of detective novels with a fantasy background and some romance thrown in. Now it's all about the sex and not even emotional or interesting sex. I suppose LKH thinks she's making it interesting with the multiple partners and with the descriptions of what it takes to give a good bj, but that's not what makes a good sex scene -- that barely makes good porn.I don't care about Anita anymore. I don't care if she lives or dies or who she ends up with, or about her job (which she doesn't seem to much care about anymore either.)Don't bother to read this, if you want some good and honest erotica with a fantasy edge read an Ellora's Cave book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Does St. Louis..............","review":".............that should have been the name of this fiasco of a book.

This book in my opinion was slightly better than CS but only because Richard wasn't such an (...).I don't mind a little sex in books, but I miss the intensity of her earlier stories, with action, monsters, and situations where I had no clue how Anita would escape unscathed.now it's just one sex scene after another, I never thought I'd have to say this but sometimes less is more.Anyway, don't buy this book, if possible check it out from the library. Unless you like reading soft porn, this is no longer really an Anita Blake story. The author has taken that wonderful character and replaced her with someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an unexpected disappointment, but it's still too bad.","review":"I learned my lesson from the last couple of books in the series and borrowed this one from the library. I didn't read much of it before it was obvious that once again, Anita-as-boring-[...] was in residence and I returned it. It may be that, as a reviewer or two point out, the author wishes to go in \\"new directions\\", but authors with hugely popular series who end up trashing their characters in these \\"new directions\\" (Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series is going down the tubes as well) should remember that the reason they became hugely popular authors in the first place was that the readers loved the characters as originally written.

I had few illusions about LKH's talents as an author post \\"Obsidian Butterfly.\\" I could go on and on about how BAD this book is and how it lacks any redeeming factors which make a novel worth purchasing. Others have done that job already.I think the most stinging review I can give this book is that I'm going back to the bookstore and demanding my money back. If people stop paying for feces on paper, maybe the author will finally get the point, put down her copy of Marquis de Sade's \\"Ettiquite in the Bedroom\\" (which at least was well written), and write a story with a plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is what I waited a year and a half for?!?!?!","review":"I am very dissapointed in this book. Anita Blake novels have been like a drug to me, and this one just didn't give me my fix. What happened to all the action? I want my bad-ass vampire hunter back!!! I love the characters, and I was glad that we got a little history on Damian, and some more insight on Jean-Claude, but overall it was a big let-down. Thw whole book, I was sitting there asking myself, where is the big bad that she always battles? Anita has been going down hill since Cerulean Sins, where she gained these new powers all of a sudden at the end of the book to defeat Belle. I just thought it was all starting to go a little overboard. I love Anita Blake, and I will continue to read the books, but I can't help but ask myself if it's time for Laurell to put an end to the series.P.S. I enjoy sex in the books, but not as the only thing. If I wanted to read porn I would pick up some of my mom's old romances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable","review":"Wow, LKH has really done it this time...I thought that since she made Anita out to be kind of a slut in Cerulean Sins that maybe she'd let Anita take a break for once. Apparently I was very wrong, I've been reading some of the reviews and there's not really much to say that hasn't been said. I'm still going to stay loyal to the series but please Laurell, I can't take anymore repitions of the words 'breast' and 'meat' anymore. And since when does Anita say something like \\"I want to see if I can deep throat you\\".

What happened to the plot, the mystery, the character development?This book is a tedious series of sexual situations thinly glued together with rare mentions of a group of serial killers that we never meet. So what if there are a couple dead strippers-there's a sex scene to get through!What happened to the tough, smart, resourceful woman who raised entire graveyards of zombies or slew ghouls?

I honestly don't think LKH is writing these novels anymore. The publisher has secretly replaced her with someone else.This series started so brilliantly only to be decimated into something unreconizable. The only way to fix this?- Anita wakes up and the last couple of novels were a dream. (A la that favorite 80's TV show based on a town in Texas)- Edward comes in and kills everyone.- LKH just starts from the ending of OB and tries again.I'm done. I've had it.

This is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing end to what WAS a grand series","review":"The strong, female, gun toting executioner that's drawn so many fans to this series is dead. She's been turned into a soft porn imitation.This latest entry in the series continues the downward spiral began in Narcissus in Chains and Cerulean Sins. The real mystery seemed to be where the plot went! It was lost amongst so much detailed, clinical... and suprisingly boring sex. Over three-fourths of the book is just gratuitous sex. One partner, two partner, beastiality.. our girl does it all. What she doesn't actually do in this volume is CATCH the bad guy.I can understand the purpose for character development, but by the end I was hoping that Edward would show up and provide a deadly intervention for all involved. Unfortunately, he didn't make an appearance. It's sad to say, but after three such 'transitional' books, I'm done with the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad.","review":"I picked up the book from the library and still felt cheated after I'd read it. There is only enough plot to keep the erotica progressing. This really should have been published as a Harlequin Romance, except it might even be too graphic for that.To add insult to injury, this book has not been proofread. I stopped counting incorrect spelling, bad grammar and the use of incorrect homophones about halfway through. Does Jove employ editors?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par, flawed book","review":"Laurell K Hamilton is so much better than this. The book spends far too much time fretting over Anita's X-rated personal life and never really gets into the crux of the murder mystery we were promised in the beginning. By the end of the book, we don't really know any more about the original plot than when we began, and we know far too much about Anita's bed hopping. This isn't a character \\"maturing\\", unless you rate maturity by the number of sexual partners a person has. This is a character degenerating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"While I have enjoyed the previous Anita Blake books, they are just getting boring. If you are out of puberty 400 pages of sex scenes are about 300 pages too much. I'm getting where I read them like I read a Tom Clancy novel.

Hamilton is living (ew) vicariously through Anita.As a reader, I'll find it hard to get past the fact that I was reading an author's disgusting sexual fantasies even if LKH ever does learn how to write again (unlikely).The author and her books have proved themselves to be one thing: Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read the entire Anita Blake series, and I enjoyed every one until Incubus Dreams. This book was nothing more than vivid soft porn. Every few pages Anita was involved with another partner or several partners. I understand the \\"ardeur\\" being a new complex issue that needs to be controlled, but it took over the story line. Normally I can not put one of these books down until I have finished.

I hope the next one has more story and less random sexual encounters."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed and disgusted","review":"If you can ignore the poor writing, editing errors,you will still find this book VERY Disappointing. Almost all sex, safe sex-NOT. Anita Blake has become VERY boring having to have sex every other minute,Anita no longer has time to fight the bad guys, develope a plot, or finish a story line.

But frankly, the only thing I saw growing was the amount of men in her \\"hisem\\" and the bits and pieces of said men.I'm not going to wait and see what happens next. I refuse to see if she pulls out of this slump or decides to put more effort into writng a good novel. I've already given this woman a buttload of my money and I don't intend to give her any more.And I just want to say that I'd really have loved to give it a negative score but they don't have that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"like a metaphysical penhouse forum -very disappointed","review":"I have always loved the Anita Blake Vampire Hunter books. I have read every single one published to date. But, this is ridiculous! It's just page after page of sex with vampires and wereanimals. Besides, there is something bizarre about the S&M fixation. A little sex adds spice to a good novel. But, the basis for the novel should be it's plot. This book had a poor plot line thrown in, so Ms. Hamilton could publish blatant pornography and call it a novel. Yeah, I read all of it, but I won't bother with the any future books in the series. I just can't express how much it saddens me that such a fun series should become have evolved into such complete trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who stole Anita and when will they give her back?","review":"The early Anita Blake stories were engrossing, something happening on every page. I read them in one sitting, regardless of how late I had to stay up. But the last few have been so focused on sex that any other plot is lost in the bedsheets. Frankly, I am getting turned off by Anita's nonstop sexual activities. She was an action heroine, a woman who knew she was good at what she did. Now, by the time you sort out who she's in bed with and why, you really don't care if you even finish the book. Go ahead, put it down--pick it up tomorrow. You haven't missed anything. This will certainly be the last hardback I buy by Ms. Hamilton."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment is the only word to describe this book.","review":"I LOVE LKH. My sister and I both buy her books in hardcover because we can't decide who will read it first. We finish these books in well under a week. Incubus Dreams, however, took me 3 weeks to finish. The great suspense that I love about LKH books was completely missing. The book starts with a murder mystery and then it is forgotten until the very end. The middle is Anita having sex with everyone. As if she wasn't already sleeping with enough men, new ones were brought in. The ardeur is getting old. Many of the core characters were completely ignored. Where was Asher? If Damian is now part of a new triumverant why didn't we see him very often?If you are a die hard fan, like me, then you have to read the book in order to move on in the series, but wait for it to come out in paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOORING!!!","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. This book contains barely 100 pages of any kind of relevant plot and 4 or 5 hundred pages of kinky sex. It's boring. Please, let's return to the first books in the series, where Anita is a woman with a purpose, who deals with supernatural messiness and solves crimes. If there is an absolute need for mentioning the \\"ardeur\\", include one sex act, maybe 2. That's it. If I want porn, I'll go buy XXX.I mean, what ever happened to interesting characters, like the 2 kid vampires from the previous book? What about the Mother of Darkness? Why is her waking going to be so disasterous? Give us some PLOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the plot???","review":"SEX....and then some more sex. The plot shows up at odd intervals...occasionally. Well, it's more like the plot is tacked on to a porn story. I used to like this series, before it became nothing more than Hamilton writing down her fantasy life for all to see...It used to have good characters, pace, plot, and that VIBE a good book gives you. But in this one, the author has abandoned any pretense that it is anything more than a porn story.I have no problem with erotica in my fiction. But this isn't erotica. It is poorly written, dull, and cliched sex. Period. I liked most of the previous books because Anita was a strong character. Well-grounded, but with quirks. She has now become nothing more than a cardboard cutout. All I can say is that if LKH isn't interested in developing her characters or their actual involvement in the Anita Blake world, why should we, as readers, be interested in them at all?I am sorry I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oversexed, but at least it had a plot","review":"This is an improvement over the past two books in the series, in that less than half the book is devoted to sex scenes and the other half actually deals with plot. I think that Ms. Hamilton was trying to work through the sexual material to try and get Anita back on track, so I HOPE that the next book will be back to mostly plot. Basically, the first third of the book is plot development, with minor sex scenes. The next third and a bit beyond is sex, sex, and more sex, to the point that a scene that should have been a pivotal resolution just bored me. (Hint to Ms. Hamilton: less is more; don't try to cram every last sex scenario into one book) The rest goes back to plot for the most part, with a strong hint that the next book will be about finishing up some missed details (not all the bad guys were caught). I'm hoping that means it will be more like Obsidian Butterfly (which I consider to be the high point of the series)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I started the Anita Blake series when book four had just come out and loved them. Paranormal mystery has always been my cup of tea. Unfortunately this latest version of Anita Blake is noticeably lacking in mystery. Rather it just seems to be page after page of sex. How convenient that Anita now has this \\"gift\\" that requires her to sleep with every male she happens across. This is nothing like the Anita I grew to love. If I wanted a book about sex I would get a harlequin novel. So, if you want a book full of gratuitous sex this is for you. If, like me, you began reading Anita Blake because of the mystery and casework, I advise you stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a fan's time","review":"I, like many of the others already posted, am a fan of LKH's books (especially since I live in St. Louis!) but this was a big letdown.

And please, please, please, find a good editor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I read most of the other reviews before I bought the book. I thought, \\"Well, maybe they don't know the series that well\\". If you haven't read most of the other books in the series, you won't understand where some of the angst comes from.I was extremely disappointed by this book. Okay, I admit, I was getting a little tired of Anita's whining anyway. I mean, c'mon, if you live in that world, you need the power, right? Just take it!! AAAARRRGGGHHH!!I was so fed up with the sex, I started flipping pages halfway through. There is no plot, period. I like paranormal mysteries/adventure stories. I like novels about kick-ass women. I'm all for a steamy vampire book. This was neither one. All I can say at this point is, Laurell, work out your issues in therapy, not print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only 8% good","review":"I fell in love with Anita Blake, vampire hunter and necromancer. Plain and simple, Anita's at her best when she's solving crimes and kicking ass. Incubus Dreams took that Anita Blake away from me and became the trash that turned me towards her in the first place. I finished the book, all 650+ pages of it, and the 50 or so pages dedicated to her sleuthing wasn't near enough to make up for the endless sexual descriptions found in the 600 other pages. With the previous books, the focus was the crimes that needed solving, the sex was anticipated, and the descriptions made you want to share the experience with her. This time around, the sex made me sick and completely turned off...not only from this book, but if this is the way the series is headed--I'm closing this chapter for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!","review":"This is by far the worst book of this series. I don't think anyone bothered to proof read it prior to printing it and in the 650 pages, LKH forgot to put in a plot. I started reading her books for the battles that Anita fought and won, this book was Anita having sex with everyone that crossed her path. Her AB books started going downhill with Narcissis in Chains, then Cerulean Sins, and now this. This was the last time I shell out $28 for a book from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"soft porn disappointment","review":"I loved the first few Anita Blake books. I love the character, and I enjoyed the sexual tension of the series. I enjoyed it as sex became more and more part of the stories. However, there are limits. This isn't a book with a plot, it is a series of soft-porn short stories with repeat characters. The author has even run out of ways to describe things, and repeats phrases several times over trying to describe the climactic moments. I am no longer buying her books new, and will only be looking for used copies, if at all. She has made it clear with the new six hour rule that the next book in the series will be entirely about Anita's sexcapades."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKER!!!","review":"This book was a total waste of my time and money. The Anita Blake series has become nothing more than soft core pornography. The fantasy elements exist now only to justify Anita having sex with someone and describing it in unnecessary detail. If I truly wanted soft core porn, I would have bought something else. The ardeur needs to go. The triumvirate with Nathaniel and Damien needs to go. Get back to the fantasy elements, with only one or two sex scenes thrown in to liven up the story with characters the reader will care about. Ms. Hamilton, there is alot of room to continue this series, if you will only concentrate on the story and the character and the supernatural world Anita inhabits.I used to really enjoy this series. Now it is just a disappointment. In fact, stop writing the series. Ms. Hamilton, if you don't care enough about the characters and story, come up with something else, something innovative and original.Disappointed in Texas"},{"rating":"1","title":"Open letter to Edward","review":"Dear EdwardYou've always claimed that you wanted to kill Anita, please do us all a favour, get your finger out and do it.Yours SincerelyEx fan.Any signs that Laurell K was going back to a plotted Anita Blake story have been shot down in flames and we have yet another bloated windy, whining porn fest. It's got more pages than that abysmal rip off Micah, but that doesn't make it any good.To be fare it may be worth more than one star, but Laurell K Hamilton is capable of five star work and her persistent fobbing off of her fans with this dross is making me mad, so one is all it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing!","review":"I agree with the other reviews....This book sucks! I have been a huge Anita Blake fan in the past, but this is the longest, most boring book I have ever read. There is VERY little action, and even the sex scenes get boring after 10 pages of leading up to it. I have now turned my attention and money to Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire series. They are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Sucked Too.","review":"I borrowed this book from a neighbor that just started reading this series. I tolds her not to buy anything after book 7, She didn't listen. I hadn't read anything since Narcissus, I am so glad I didn't spend money on this book. If I want porn I'll read Devine or Desseau. I was so disappointed. How could such a great author go so wrong. It is like Hamilton has no concept of her readers needs. I don't mind a little sex in my books, but 500 pages and 5 or six different sex partners is revolting. She started out great with the murder, I just knew that it was the old Anita, then it got gross. I will probably read her again to see if she sees the error of her ways. But it will not be on my dime. This book so sucked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Reader Lost","review":"I agree with another reader... why can't we rate lower than one star?In an effort to claim the sexually frustrated crowd's loyalty, Ms. Hamilton has alienated another reader. I didn't even bother to buy this book -- I read a few chapters at a local bookstore and put it back on the shelf in disgust. I wanted to give her a chance, considering that I once loved these books so much that I created a website devoted to Anita Blake.I'm just sad, I miss the old Anita Blake - the one that I could identify with, understand, and want to read about.I love erotica; a well-written sex scene is a truly beautiful thing. Unfortunately, these books are the equivalent of being slipped a rufie and being gang-banged. If she wanted to write nothing but sex scenes, she should have ended this series and started something new - I doubt as many readers would be as disappointed right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Dreams","review":"I truly wish Ms. Hamilton would go back to writing prose instead of sex. This book had no story. I don't mind reading about sex if there is a story, but this was the worst book I have ever read by Ms. Hamilton.

Well - she proved them right.This woman can't write a sex scene. Her blog brags on a regular basis what a great and powerful writer of erotica she is, but I think she needs to stop listening to those voices.There was no plot. There was no mystery. There was a pretense of a mystery, but it was just a cover for the poorly written sex. Favorite characters - not appearing. Dangling plot lines from the previous book - still dangling. Anita becoming more bossy, misogynist, and selfish - plenty of that.Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"LKH Forgot the Cardinal Sin of Writing","review":"\\"It is a cardinal sin to bore your readers.\\" - Larry Niven.LKH seems to have forgotten this. Screwing everything in sight does not a plot make. It can be part of the plot but seriously, it's not a plot to explore how many different ways tab A can be inserted into slot B. And I also think it would be physically impossible for a woman to be...serviced by...so many men in such a short period of time (I think ID covers a grand total of 36-48 hours all told, maybe 72) without at least getting slightly raw.The book could have been interesting if LKH hadn't subsituted merengue for meat. As it stands the book is empty and disappointing and no amount of gratuitous sex or angst can make up for it. I would prefer to wait longer between books and get an actual story worthy of the books prior to and including Obsidian Butterfly (by far the best, IMO) than to get the repetitive over-done erotica that's being released as \\"Anita Blake: Vampire Slayer\\" now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aging Like Wine","review":"If you've read my other reviews of the series you know I was getting bored. It felt predictible and was just turning into pointless porn with too much action.But this one won me back. Okay, there isn't a plot at all, there's mostly sex and subplots including Ronnie's relationship with Louie the were-rat as the only plot that has a conclusion... no wait a minute! that didn't either!Anita is charged with hunting down a pack of rogue serial killer vamps who hunt strippers. In the meantime she ignores Michah, finally does the deed with Nathaniel, almost ignores Jean Paul and does the nasty with Richard. That's the plot right there.Do they ever find the rogue vampires? No. Does Anita inexplicably gain more supernatural powers? Yes.But the writing style is lucid and imaginative and the details of the characters are so like the very first novels. The ending leaves you wanting more and if this book doesn't stimulate your creative juices you must be dead and not lovin' it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laurell K.

I am a long time fan and own all the books including Cerulean Sins. First the editing slowed my reading of this book. The excessive mistakes were annoying, was this book even edited? I had to stop and try to figure out what word was actually meant to be there. The gratuitous sex was sad. Anita is not even recognizable as herself. Major characters were no where to be found in this book. This book was about 400 pages too long.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK, GO TO THE LIBRARY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time for us positive reviewers to speak up!","review":"Perhaps it was due to all of the negative reviews I read before I bought the book so I had low expectations (although I really don't think so), but I thought the book was great! As one of the previous reviewers mentioned, wasn't it about time for Laurell to discuss the relationships between the characters? I really enjoyed Anita's discussions with Jean Claude about the growth of their relationship, learning more about Damian's and Nathaniel's background and who they are as characters as well as what Richard has been struggling with. The changes and growth in Anita's powers also add a new dimension to the ongoing stories. I thought the book was timely in the development of the characters and a nice change from the blood and guts of the murder mysteries of many of the earlier books. As for the threesomes, etc., we should all be so lucky! Write on, Laurell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, can we cut the [bad things] out!","review":"I've read all of the other boooks. Yes, I liked most of them. But this travesty of a book does little to develop the characters, little in story line and reads more like a soft core porn film. If you are truly a fan, you might find something in this book. Otherwise skip it. I just hope that Mrs. Hamilton will get her mind out of the gutter and write a STORY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita, get dressed already.","review":"A really weak book.Practically no plot and way too much sex.Believe me, I don't begrudge Anita her sex life with all the beautiful and supportive were-men. I was delighted when she overcame her prudery and hang-ups - how long can you whine about a cad that ditched you back in college, after all.This book, however, really overdoes it. First there are hundreds of pages of \\"we have to talk\\" scenes and endless discussion of everybody's sexual needs. Then there are hundreds of pages of sex. Towards the end there is (finally!!) a mention of bad guys and a brief visit to a crime scene that solves nothing.I really wish Anita would put on some clothes and go back to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Too much sex, not enough plot. I am a huge fan of the Anita Blake series; but this one was a huge disappointment. I had such a hard time getting through this book, I nearly quit reading it several times. It was a chore to get through. Not one of her best and, hopefully, the next one will be oh so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I believe that if one peruses the current collection of reviews, a consensus emerges on what has gone so horribly wrong in the most recent Anita Blake offering. No tension, pointless sex, egregious grammatical errors, etc. I would only like to add this comment made in the author's online blog during the writing process, 'PLOT CALLED ON ACCOUNT OF SEX SCENE, Incubus Dreams'.Truer words were never spoken."},{"rating":"1","title":"get real","review":"I believe the book could use a bit more editing. I love reading books with sex in them. The scenes did not even go with the storyline. I really hated the way she treated Nathaneil. The book started off OK, but why mention the the first scene in the book many chapters later. Oh well, this book was so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!","review":"Up until Incubus Dreams I was loving the Anita Blake series. This book is nothing but sex scene after sex scene with little regard to anything resembling a story. Quite frankly I'm sick of the 'ardeur' and Anita is looking more and more like an unpaid whore. Unfortunate, but I'm done with this series. I didn't take the other poor reviews seriously...I thought I would read this myself and make up my own mind. I wish I hadn't spent the money. I couldn't finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy, I hate to kick a book when it's down...","review":"But I tend to agree.

Let's have him turn up in the next book, see if it brings us back our girl......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft Porn Dreams","review":"This one was really bad. Out of 650+ pages you get 500 of them are focused on Anita's numerous sex partners and her need to have sex with anyone walking by at anytime. It's sad because the little that Ms. Hamilton gives you which dosen't deal with Anita's sex play is good and imaginative and should have been played up more. If that had happend this would have been a great book.Ms. Hamilton has strayed so far from her kick but heroin to this sex starved nympho, it makes you wonder if the author is wrighting what she thinks her fans wants. If she beleives that we want to read page after page of sex then she'll keep putting out this soft porn and pretty soon it won't be so soft.Those of you looking for an author who deals with werewolves, witches, fairies and other little creatures of the night and has this kick butt heroin again, you might want to purchase \\"Dead Witch Walking\\" by Kim Harrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if you like porn!","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. It seems in Ms Hamilton's books that you're either a nice girl or you'll \`do' anything. Why couldn't Anita be a strong sexual character without losing her personality? The spoilers in R. Clifton \\"sithean\\"'s review (below) pretty much sum it all up. I think this'll be the last book I purchase from this series. The actual story line was about 40 pages. The rest was sex. If that's what you're after - this book is for you. But if you want more storyline then your average b-grade porn movie then I think that it's time to find another author!."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish it.","review":"I liked the early books in the Anita Blake series. The early books were pleasantly gruesome, and had a quite intelligent idea on how a society where the occult does exist would function. Sex was always in the background; humans would be drawn to the vampires, and the vampires would be all to happy to oblige - at a price.Human relations were only at a business level, also something that would suit a fearless vampire hunter.Now, the characters spend most of their with jealous bickering and sex games. Every few pages there is a snippet of story, which is quite good, but too little of it.Ms Hamilton tries to make her characters three dimensional and realistic, but I fear she succeeds only in watering out the stories and writing second rate human relations dramas and sex manuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why did she write this book? It is such a step down from all of the other ones in the series. The rest of them are so good, but then this one reads more like a porno than what I have come to expect from her. It didn't advance the story hardly at all. She wrties so well, I expected and anticipated a book as good or better than the previous ones. I hope she gets it back together and the next one continues the excellent work I know she is capable of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita does America","review":"Should be better descriptive of this book. Is there anyone left for her to have sex with? There was so much of it in the story that I started skipping pages to try and avoid the repetitious bordom of it. I feel that Anita who was a courageous,smart and witty character is now just (...) weak and obviously nymphomaniac. I feel MS. Hamilton lost alot of her focus somewhere and about half way through remembered there is suppose to be a story so tried to save it by throwing in a plot, at this point why bother. In my opinion her demoralizing of her characters, herself and her readers is a complete let down. Good luck on the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened to the Stories I used to Love","review":"I like many of the other people who have posted am tired of the porn in favor of plot. The series used to be great with the vampire hunter trying to keep from falling into the monstrous world she was fighting. Every story had at least three plotlines that twisted into a wonderful climax that left me saying, \\"Wow!\\" However, since \\"Obsidian Butterfly\\" sex has overtaken both plot and relationships. Bring back the Anita I love or let her die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex","review":"Incubus Dreams was a book I was waiting for. I was sadly dissapointed that the plots changed to sex. I have read all the books of Anita Blake and found this one to be a little too much like pornography. The book has lots of twist and turns that are not very well explained. I was surprised to see that Richard had made a come-back into the scene. But even worst I was shocked to see how Ainta's harem had grown. It seemed to me that if Anita wasn't having sex with someone or something than she was agruing about it. I am glad that she appears to be more comfortable with herself but enough of the \\"drama\\". I thought that there was going to be a bit more about the case Anita was working on. Instead it was a sad glimpse into the previous Anita Blake books. What a let down. I hope that the next book will be better and and stick with the orginal plot lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love good sex scenes, BUT......","review":"I must echo what others have said here - there is no plot in the first 300 pages of this book, simply Anita going from one sexual encounter to another in one day. I admit that early in the series when she was a prude I was rather irritated with her as a character, but atleast there was a story then. So far, this book is much like the last Blake novel - lots of sex with multiple partners, but no actual plot. As with Meredith, I again tell the author that while some new 'blood' is always nice, we like to see heroines sleeping and talking to their old flames as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"PWP","review":"My daughter referred to this book as a \\"PWP\\" - \\"Plot? WHAT plot?\\" Yep. Plenty of sex - WAY too much, and woefully short on anything resembling a storyline. Absolutely atrocious - really nonexistent - editing. Deity was misspelled in every instance, as was triumvirate. How can something as crucial to the story be misspelled EACH and EVERY time? Grammatical errors, syntax problems, punctuation trouble...my guess is the editors at Penguin/Berkely gave this one to the rookie because they couldn't handle the misery themselves. Apart from the editing is the lack of anything reminiscent of the first few books in the series. Sorry, Laurell. Hope the next one's better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Non stop Sex-Fest!","review":"The character didn't have much time to solve any murders or save anyone from the bad guys because she spent most of her time on her back going at it with someone, anyone! No Edward, no Asher and no action that didn't include the removal of clothes. Over 600 pages and if Anita wasn't having sex she was talking about having sex. All sex scene required an analyst before and after and it just went on and on. There was a murder, there were bad guys but that didn't add up to 50 pages in a 600+ page book.I took the advise of another reviewer and borrowed this book from the library. I am thankful not to have contributed to what is truly a bad story. Laurelle K Hamilton's last two books in the \\"Anita Blake\\" series were heading just toward what you end up with in \\"Incubus Dreams\\". A non stop Sex Fest! I lost count after the eighth guy Anita has sex with. There may have been more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretend it's not part of the series","review":"Less sex, more plot and butt kicking. I loved the first books when Anita spent more time kicking butt and less time in the sack. If I want porn, I'll go get a porn book. I got hooked on this series because of the great characters and the non-stop action. What happened to that? Ms. Hamilton, leave your porn penmanship for the other series, let Anita get back to being Anita.I have been able to finish the last few books in a few hours just by skipping over the sex scenes. That tells you how much they lack in plot and action.What a shame. It was such a great series. I don't bother to buy the books in hardcover anymore. If I can't borrow one, I wait for paperback. Why waste the money. I no longer eagerly await each new book as it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damn...","review":"I'm a big fan fiction fan so I'm used to characters being out of character but damn it I'm not used to it from the original writer. [...] She's not Anita anymore, she's some Mary sue that took over and replaced my favorite heroine. The only thing I can compare it to is when Buffy went from super slayer girl to the slayer slut who slept with Spike every chance she got. But at least Buffy had an excuse, she died. Yes Anita has to feed the ardeur but the Anita I remember from the past books wouldn't feed off every thing in pants. It's just not her! If I wanted to read badly written Anita Blake smut I would have looked online for a badly written smutty fan fic. No, I spent my money hoping to get a wonderful supernatural murder mystery and I got cheated. I'm not even going to bother trying to sell this piece of trash, I'm dumping it off at Goodwill. Maybe someone there will like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh... Interesting","review":"I have to preface this by saying this is the first book by Ms. Hamilton I've ever read. Given my other purchases, amazon always recommends her so I picked this up on a whim. It's good to know that this book isn't typical based on other reviews, so I may go back and read the first book, because I like the author's style if not the content. But generally this book sucked, IMO. Anita has sex with anything that walks. Hamilton makes it somewhat palatable by giving her some angst over it but still, this is ridiculous. And the 'mystery', there is one murder at the beginning of the book, then some 300-400 pages later there is another murder and there's been no investigation, Anita just screws her way through a variety of men until the next murder happens and then gets some real clues as to who might be doing this. I do find the various vampire, lycanthrope and other occult story lines interesting, but it doesn't really make up for the weak plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography or Novel?","review":"Having previously read all of the Anita Blake series, I must say Incubus Dreams is indeed the worst book of the series as of yet. The writing is shallow, as is the plot - and the book is utterly focused on SEX. Rather than the casual, and not too tacky commonplace sex scenes of the series, Hamilton has gone way overboard. This book has been bombarded with scene after scene of raunchy sex. One can barely find the plot at all in this book - which happens to be more like a pornography magazine than anything close to a novel.Unless you are a die-hard fan, I strongly recommend that you do not purchase this book, but rather, if you must, borrow it from a library or a friend. Also if you are a parent, keep your son or daughter away from this book, lest they add some less than wholesome words to their repertoire. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"It can't be another bad review, can it?","review":"I have 2 words to sum up this book. It sucks! And I don't mean Anita and her parade of willies.The only thing this book is good for is to sit on in the driver's seat for a boost over the steering wheel.Save your money and buy Pay Per View porn, at least you know you're not supposed to get a plot and you're getting what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I rate this less than one star?","review":"I loved the first few books in the series but it was at this book that the series took a turn for the worse. I was so upset to see the heroine I had come to love turned into a horny moron. The writing seemed to get sloppy and lazy. For example, the phrase \\"sleeping/cuddling/laying around like a pile of puppies\\" appears now in all her books. It drives me nuts. If you want hard core porn held together by a flimsy badly written plot then by all means by this book. Otherwise I strongly suggest that you check out Charlaine Harris or the Dark Hunter series. They are much much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diluted pleasure","review":"I have read all of the Hamilton books so far, and have to say that this was by far the least interesting of the batch. I simply could not finish the book. I had to write a review.Seemingly gone are the raising the dead days for Anita Blake, and the agency days, which were so interesting - to be replaced with page after page of unnecessary and repetitive descriptions of the \\"pard\\" dudes. After ten chapters in this newest book, we still hadn't gotten beyond mundane descriptions, none of them any different from the over-lengthy descriptions of the guys in her Kiss of Shadows book. With no real story at chapter twelve, I gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money. Wait for the paperback.","review":"Incubus Dreams is easily the weakest offering in the Anita Blake series. There's a neat 350 page novel in a 680 page extended orgy. The murder mystery is merely paid lip service--kind of like the hit man who wants the zombie raised in Cerulean Sins. Yes, Anita sort of starts getting a handle on her personal life, but Hamilton adds so many other issues that it's just getting ridiculous. Add in Hamilton's overdone repetition, numerous editing/spelling flaws, and a plot that never works because the reader gets bombarded with scene after scene after scene after scene of ardeur-spawned hedonism, and you get a mess. Incubus Dreams bored me to tears. I have never said that about an Anita Blake book before. I'll never say it again. If the next book is as bad as this one, I'm done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton has ruined the Anita Blake series","review":"What a terrible book! 500 hundred pages of sex and only about 200 pages of a real story. Anita is more or less a nympho now -- she'll have sex with just about anyone. Maybe Dolph is next! I miss all the great story lines where she is actually hunting non-human killers. Jean-Claude has actually become close to uninteresting. Anita is almost to the point that she doesn't really need him or Richard. Also, I have never taken to Micah; his description is not very masculine & doesn't appeal to me like Jean-Claude or Richard did. If I wanted a book with little plot and a lot of sex, I'd read \\"Deep Throat\\". I will probably keep on reading the series but I will never buy a new copy again. It will be the used book store from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumping the shark","review":"When I saw the size of Incubus Dreams, I felt like I had been given a special gift. I wait impatiently for each of Laurell K. Hamilton's books to be published and this was just more to savor. It's sad to be wrong, especially on your birthday. Remember the good old days when Anita would kick butt to save the day? Now she just has sex. A lot.While I lament the loss of a great series, I am still grateful that the author has given me so much entertainment over the years. If you are a fan, please do yourself a favor and skip this book. I would have much rather seen Anita killed off than brought to this boring and drawn out low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Deserves Better...","review":"This series has gone steadily downhill for the last 3 books, in my opinion. LKH has taken a strong female character and turned her into a nymphomaniac. If there was a plot to help things along, I wouldn't mind so much, but Incubus Dreams has almost zero plot.Bring back Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Trash","review":"For those of us who recall Hamilton's first 3 or so Anita Blake novels, we can lay to rest any hope of novels like them appearing again. Every book I read of Hamilton's grows progressively worse.The entire Anita Blake series had degenerated into plotless pornographic filth. A useless waste of money. Unfortunately, I cannot rate this review lower than one star.Oh - I tried reading the first meredith gentry novel as well, which I RETURNED for my money back (after reading about 20 pages)with a complaint about adult material being carried without labels (lol, hopefully the bookstore will pull all of Hamilton's books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Debbie Did It","review":"I don't want to sound like everyone else, but, what a disappointment!!! This looks like a case of someone ran out of ideas, so they substituted sex. Please get it together or start on something FRESH."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know who I miss?","review":"I miss the Anita Blake who relied on her brain rather than her genitals to beat the bad guys. The one who had to be careful when dealing with the enemy -- human or not because she wasn't all powerful. I get the sense in both the Merry Gentry and Anita Blake series that I've purchased someone's sexual fantasy diary rather than sf/fantasy mysteries.I can deal with it in the Merry Gentry series because it was clear in the first book that sex/power were going to be intermingled. But I'm seriously tired of Anita fornicating her way into power and becoming pretty much leader of the pack over EVERYONE in St. Louis.If you're new to the series just stop with Obsidian Butterfly.To others who've loved the books until now, I plan to use the Library for the next book (if one should actually get published) and suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rating lower than one star","review":"Incubus Dreams is one of those books that makes you wonder if you were on some kind of nefariously administered drug when you read it. Could it really have been that bad? Maybe I was just overtired?So you page back a chapter or two and try to pick up where it lost your attention, only to find that it wasn't a bad trip, nothing actually happened for two chapters. Three chapters. Four chapters.Oh, unless you count the typos. Lots of typos happened. Lots of terrible editing (if there actually was any editing) Also lots of boring sex. Now, this isn't something my Momma taught me, but it seems to me that one thing sex shouldn't be is BORING.Something wrong with that.Anyhow, if you were a fan of the first few Anita Blake books, don't DON'T waste your money like I did. If you're a fan of Penthouse letters - don't get your hopes up, but it might be more your cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch...","review":"I finished this book, with all its glorified 600+ pages in less than 24 hours. How? I skipped over half of it. How could I not? If I wanted to read erotica, I would've bought something else. If I wanted to read erotica, I wouldn't have bought this book. \\"Anita doesn't do furry.\\" Oh no, Anita does anything now, with or without fur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another reader lost","review":"Incubus Dreams represents a turning point, at least in this readers mind. I'm done with the series! A once interesting series has devolved into a chaotic mess where the author doesn't even bother trying to write a coherent plot or storyline any more.What's touted as character growth reads more like character assignation. Anita Blake and the huge supporting cast of characters have been transformed into two-dimensional cardboard cutouts loosing all of their original uniqueness and appeal in the process.And lastly, if the author chooses to write nothing but erotica that's fine, but market it as such and quit hiding behind the mystery and suspense elements dangled as bait in the dusk jacket.This one time fan is done and moving on."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was awful","review":"I am truly saddened that my favorite author has written such a piece of garbage. This book was horrible. I had to get past half of the book, (which was mostly sex scenes), to actually find the plot of the story. This book could have been at least half the size and been much better. There was a love scene that lasted about 3 chapters.Since I love Anita I finished reading the book. However, you may be able to skip the book and not miss anything important from Anita series. My recommendation... Borrow the book from someone so that you don't feel so bad when you read it and realize that you wasted your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"More A Page Flipper Than A Page Turner","review":"I have been reading the Anita Blake books since the beginning of the series. The early books are wonderful and I highly recommend them. I stuck with the series through the \\"less than stellar navel gazing porn\\" novels thinking that the series would rebound. Not a chance.As the other reviewers have said, it's a meaningless, thinly rationalized, mostly boring porn film on paper. No sooner does a new character show up than you can count the seconds until Anita is \\"forced\\" to bed them for one pointless reason or another. As for plot - well, you could pull out all the pages actually related to the purported storyline, bind them together and maybe (if properly edited) have a short story of moderate interest.I'd say Incubus Dreams has driven a stake through the heart of this series - what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Crap.","review":"This book completes the destruction of the Anita Blake character. This series used to be one of my favorites, but now... I mean I could take it when she had two lovers, I could understand that. When they added in Micah I'm still like okay what the heck it's still a good series with great writing, so okay I'll go along with it. In Cerelean sins Anita got like two more boyfriends and I'm thinking well it was still a pretty good book so I might as well see the series through. Now with this book she seems to be screwing every guy she sees, so enough is enough I mean, Hell, I could take all this if the story was still good, but if I just wanted porn I would've spent the money on nice video instead of this crappy book. The Author has taken a strong character and turned her into lord knows what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be afraid of this book. It's good.","review":"I saw the reviews of this book, and it made me not want to read it. I too, am tired of all the sex. Mainly because it was more like rape, not by choice.This book is about Anita's personal life. There is alot of sex in this book. I do believe that Anita chose to have sex each time, and the scenes had points to them, and done well in the most part. There is one scene near the end of the book that made me uncomfortable, and felt like she was forced into it, closer to rape then I like. But it wasn't a long scene, and they haven't done anything like it in any of the rest of the books up to book 17.There are alot of interesting things that happen in this book. Don't let the sex scene stop you from read this one. But I agree, if I wanted to read porn I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss the original Anita Blake..","review":"Too much sex....

Anita needs to come back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaawwwnnnn","review":"I'm sorry about this bad review but I was so bored I couldnt wait to be done with this book. Too much sex ...(even though thats not bad it was excelent in the other books) with too little murder investigation maybe LKH will get on the right track with the next book...cant wait to read it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dream off ; Move on","review":"I'm expecting a sexier version of the vampire killer who does police work when I continue reading this series. If I want porn I can buy real porn, not a repetitive and boring misrepresented, disappointing waste of time. After Narcissus, I realized I had better save my money and I wisely turned to my library. At least I didn't waste my money on this one. After reading a bit and scanning through the same old arduer garbage, I read the other reviews and decided to move on. If I can't read about the vampire hunter who raises the dead here, I'll just find a different author. Too bad. I liked Anita and didn't mind her sexual morality changes. If only I could revisit the knives, Edward, and the shady customers at Animation Inc. I could get the read I am expecting when I pick up a part of this series. The author should have categorized the books after Obsidian including this one in a new series called Anita Blake Dreams on, Drools on."},{"rating":"1","title":"icky","review":"Stop typing. Put any idea of ordering this book out of your head. Walk away. I still have walking skirt nightmares. Completely not worth borrowing from a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"I'm a great Laurell K Hamilton, I have all her books. I abslolutely LOVED her first 9 books + the first Merry Gentry book. But after that ? Merry Gentry nr 2 and 3 were all just about the sex, and Anita was headded in the same direction, but at least there was still a story in there, somewhere, between all those gorgeous sexy, naked men...But this one ? I didn't even like it enough to finish it !!! I got until page 100 or so, and then I just gave up, I couldn't stand it anymore.That's the problem with a supernatural series where the big bad has to be bigger and badder with every book. Once she got to the top of that, Hamilton introduced sex in her books, and made that bigger, frequentlier and with a lot more men every book. Until that is all that you have... Maybe I'm just being nave, but I like to read books for the stories, not for the sex.Laurell K Hamilton can write good vampire murder mysteries, I'm sorry to see that she had abandoned it, so she can write about sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's finally happened LKH has run out of ideas!","review":"This is one of the most boring books I have ever read. It takes a really unique writer to make sex so dull and repetative, but LKH manages in this book and CS before it. The series started with such a promising idea and Anita was a fun character; funny, tormented and strong. Now? She's predictable and bitter. LKH has stretched out this idea past its limits. She has run out of ideas for Anita and now resorts to the amatuer writing styles of lots of hot sex. But wait...it's not so hot because every sex scene is the same thing over and over. Frankly this series has been reduced to a cheap copy of Penthouse letters w/ a skimpy plot. We deserve better and LKH needs so stop cranking out crap and start writing again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovers of the early books AVOID this at all costs !!!","review":"Well I just got done the copy I borrowed from a friend and I have to say I am glad I refused to but it until I did.Leaving aside the extreme number of editing and spelling problems aside the plot what little there was of it was good but it needed more fleshing out and less bare flesh and trashy and sex scenes that any fanfic writer could post.I know its harsh but this book blows chunks and the author has clearly let her writing style for the Merry Gentry series ruin this series.If I want a trash sex scene I would read her other series or better yet online free stories that actually are better staged then the author does hers.If you loved the first 7 - 8 books then avoid this book at ALL costs and do not waste your cash on this piece of toilet paper pretending to be one of the books for formely excellant series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Disapointment","review":"This book is one of two things, either a depressingling pathetic end to a great series, or a sagging disaster in the middle of one. After the foreshadowing in the last book, I had high hopes for this book, but it is nothing more than baddly written sex scenes. I can only hope that this book is a rushed attempt to keep the series going under publishing pressure, rather than something the author thought was a good continuation of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through","review":"I am lost on this book for the fact it has me so frustrated!!! I'm frustrated with the direction of the book and the lack of likeability of these characters! Everyone is whining about this and that, plus they all seem so needy and want to argue all the time. BLAH! I want to read a book that takes me out of the BS of life by having a good storyline and read one that does not annoy me. I'm not even half way through the book and I want to move on to the next. I find myself skipping whole sections of it just to get through it so I don't miss anything before I start the next book.OK now I'm whining. ;-) I like the author and know it's not easy to continue a series this long but I really miss her old style of writing. However.....I will finish this series one way or another!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alluding to plot during a sex scene does not equal actual plot","review":"I sometimes wonder when a series becomes popular if editors standards and the ability to tell an author, \\"No, I can't publish this because it is not an actual story.\\" disappears. I do not think I am alone when I say this series took a huge turn for the worse after \\"Obsidian Butterflies\\". Suddenly plot became an after thought and sex became a vehicle to add in a horde of characters I do not care about. I am happy that Anita has a crazy drama filled sex life but I do not want to read about that in lieu of a storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done with the series","review":"My biggest complaint is that Ainta has been turned into a total slut and I am just sick of it. As Jean-Claud puts it, she sure has a hell of a lot of accidental sex.I didnt even finish this book. I just dont respect her as a character. I had no problem with sex being added to the series, nor to her dating more than one man but now its ridiculous, enough is just enough. Anita is now nothing more than a whore who whines and complains that she just cant help herself.I actually read reviews on the books ahead before deciding to totally abandon the series, and from what I have read it doesnt get any better. There are too many people all vying for a spot in Anita's bed, and worse they are all getting it.There isnt much suspense and dective work and stuff like that left and I just cant stand Anita anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Sex But Still Good","review":"I'm surprised at all the negative comments on this book. Anyone who has been reading this series surely realizes that after The Killing Dance the sex content skyrocketed. This book was another wonderful novel in my opinion. Alot of relationship issues are addressed finally and Anita begins to accept her otherworldliness. This book is a whopping 678 pages, but I wish it had been longer. All of her books are cliffhangers to a certain extent but this one is the worst. The crime she is investigating is still unresolved at the close of the novel which was very frustrating for me. Other than that though I found nothing to be wrong with this book and I highly reccommend it for fans of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"*shrug* I definitely don't get the fuss.","review":"I psychotically LOVED this book. The Ardeur is truly its star, as it forces Anita to face some of her most pressing control issues. But more than anything else, as a reader since book 1, Incubus Dreams was well worth it for ONE particular tryst alone.*sigh* The most satisfying fictional sex I ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. I, too, loved the previous Anita Blake books, but found Incubus Dreams extemely boring and disappointing. The mystery part of the book was barely touched on but pages and pages of sex with almost anyone, in any circumstances, got boring very fast. I do hope that Laurel Hamilton gets back from her sexual fantasies and gets better plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the old Anita?","review":"I have to agree with my esteemed peers below. I especially agree with the idea of deepsixing Richard and sending Anita to training. This book would have been half as long (it is 658 pages) if the unnecessary sex was cut out. Ms. Hamilton seems to be searching for ways for Anita to have sex with new and different people. I still enjoyed the mystery and Anita's ascerbic wit, but the sex was excessive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Worse","review":"The stories in Laurell Hamilton's first Anita Blake books were incredibly interesting and captivated me with humor, intelligence, creativity and action. However, since creating the subject of \\"ardeur\\", the only action Ms. Hamilton seems to be able to come up with for her heroine, Anita Blake, happens between the sheets. Instead of chasing unusual monsters and saving people from fates worse than death, we are \\"treated\\" to intense sexual exploits every other page. Come on, Laurell, Anita used to be a lot more interesting when she was not constantly horizontal. I have read all of the Anita Blake books and sincerely wish I had not read this last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I've been a fan of Laurell K. Hamilton since I first picked up Guilty Pleasures over ten years ago. But with her newest novel I have to say she's lost me as a reader. Over the last few books Mrs. Hamilton has focused more on sex and less on plot. Her latest book Incubus Dreams is now 95% sex, and 5% plot. Anita is now sleeping with 6 people on a regular basis, and a couple more on a not so regular basis. I don't mind sex in the books that I read, but if I wanted to read a book that is all sex I'd of picked up a book out of the erotica section. This book is supposed to be about a vampire serial killer. That plot line is barely touched on in this book at all, and it's conclusion is not particularly satisfying. Suffice to say, If I decide to read her next book I'll take it out of the library first.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"WOW! I only recently got into the Anita books, say about two weeks. I bought all of the books in the series and blew threw them, even this one. From the beginning of the series Hamilton has built up to the sex scenes up to the point that sex was all this book was about; over 600 pages of sex. I'm not a prude in any sense of the word, but it was just a bit much. All the other books had a big bad that she struggled against throughout the entire book. This book was just one sex scene after the other, and if she wasn't doing it she was thinking about it or talking about it or about to do it. It's almost as if Hamilton is stuggling for a plot and she just couldn't do it in this book. Hopefully, Hamilton can pull herself out of the sated after sex haze before she looses readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want that twenty-five dollars back...","review":"I guess my feelings about \\"Incubus Dreams\\" can be summed up with one phrase: not bad, but not terribly good either. It's actually kind of sad, considering that the series used to be *so* good and has now become merely mainstream erotica. Anita has turned from a powerful, kick-ass character to one who is whiny, shrill, and eye-roll inducing. And, well, to be honest, I think every character got on my last nerve during reading this--Micah, especially. Does anyone think he and Anita have any actual chemistry? Because they kind of come off with all the combined sex appeal of curdled milk.The second trio was another low--ummm, what about the first one which was infinitely more interesting and actually relevant to the series? What this AB series needs, if it's going to continue with any readership at all is for Anita to get control of the ardeur (as, relegate it to the background), shed the misc. boyfriends and, once again, get a spine and a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd waited to buy it...","review":"Man, that was $16 down the drain. I really liked this series before, but this book, well, it was about NOTHING. Another reviewer has already posted the sexual body count, but LKH barely even addresses the actual dead bodies - you know, the murder victims? What happened to - Anita, champion of those helpless against supernatural evil? Now its all - Anita, product of sensitivity therapy and nymphomania.I just don't know if I will buy the next one. She might have killed it for me. Hopefully she won't mess up her Meredith Gentry series like she did this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Already!","review":"I have really enjoyed this series of books - up to this point. I am really dissappointed in Ms. Hamilton's repetitive use of ideas. I mean we went from a vampire slayer with high morals and intense romantic relationships to having sex with 5 or 6 different guys in one book! And she can't just have sex with one guy, it has to be two at the same time. And why is it everytime Anita shows up to a crime scene there is someone there that has some sort of beef with her being there. Ms. Hamilton also gets really wordy in this book. She uses analogies until they are dead, and all in the same chapter. There are some good storylines here hidden in all of this stuff. Anita developing new powers is pretty cool. The book should focus more on that than feeding the \\"ardeur\\". How many times do we read about the ardeur? It starts to get really old. And all of the sex she is continuously having with all of these people, pretty old too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but soft-core porn now","review":"I'm probably one of the few men who love*d* LKH and her books. I was punching through her books one every couple of days... they were that engrossing. But now, all her books are nothing but soft-core porn. Anita Blake has gone from a small, kickass girl to a nymph that screws anyone she can. Her stories have gone from mystery, suspense and adventure, to sex sex sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"My family loves to read books together. Whatever my parents read, I read. We started reading this series a while ago, but with this book...we have stopped.I may be young, but I can read a sex scene without getting giggly or uncomfortable.But this book? Was just TOO MUCH. Seriously. I thought at any moment that Anita would just drop anything and start having sex with random people - Oh, wait! She DID that!I can't believe LKH could publish this book and walk out into the light of day after doing so. If I wrote something this disgusting and, honestly, perverted, I'd lock myself in a dark closet somewhere out of shame.YUCK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita Blake is screwed!","review":"Does anyone else think that this ardeur is a stupid, contrived excuse to get AB to get laid with all those monsters? Of course you do, hence all of the negative reviews. It is poorly written and a cheap excuse to turn AB into a Wonderslut. Getting laid seems to be the forefront of the story; she even saves lives by having sex. Shyeah. Micah shares a painful part of his past? She's all shocked and sympathetic but really she just wants to get laid. There's a vampire killing strippers? She wants to find the vamp but not before she gets laid. She wants to straighten out her life and relationships with her men, but there are more pressing matters in life for her, like getting laid. This ardeur needs to be stopped. It's a good thing LKH is already a bestselling author 'cause she never would have gotten a book deal if she had started with this garbage. I think I'll pass on the other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plot!","review":"To me this was the worst book in the series. It was no plot and all porn. Sure I like the hot steamy sex that are in most of her books but this was way over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Anita?","review":"As can be seen by the majority of reviews- Too much sex and not enough Executioner. I'm no prude and have enjoyed the sex in the previous books, but they weren't the main thrust (pardon the pun) of the story, and didn't go on endlessly- the stories were mysteries and that is what I liked about them. If I wanted a pure sex romp I would read her Meredith Gentry novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Death of Anita Blake","review":"After reading a few of the reviews, I really don't have anything new to add. Just wanted to register my displeasure at the destruction of a great series. I agree with every negative thing said in the other reviews (and few of the positive ones).

I see no difference between them now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paging Laurell Hamilton","review":"What gives? I have been a devoted fan of yours since Guilty Pleasures came out, but lately I have been very disappointed. The last few books have been almost about nothing but sex. Yeah, sex is great, but not when it is written to the exclusion of all else. It is not only in the Anita series, but also in the Meredith series.What happened to the well-written, adventure packed books you used to write so well that no one could put them down? I miss those. My advice is not to buy these books until she begins to have a storyline again where characters actually talk to one another instead of just boinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T. BUY. THIS. BOOK!","review":"With its many pages of stupid, perverted sexual activity (prettied up by calling it \\"feeding the ardeur\\"), and the talking, talking, talking about the relationship(s), there wasn't any room for like ... an actual story. And would it have killed somebody to edit and proof the thing? Off-putting and boring as all get-out. As far as the series (and quite possibly anything else from LKH) I'm tapped. Borrow this from your library - I'm SERIOUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...hmmm","review":"Sex is a good thing, but honestly, there is too much sex in too much detail in this extremely long book. I vaguely remember the plotline, but kept losing track of it as I marvelled that the woman who does not have sex with someone \\"unless it MEANS something\\" was sleeping with yet another man/shifter/vampire. She did not shower much either. I was left with a sense of \\"yuck\\", and what happened to Damien's storyline, Gregory & Stephen's father, Louie/Ronnie. All they did was have crisis after crisis related to the ardeur and anita not \\"feeding\\" it enough so she had to sleep with someone else to avert disaster. AND the will she or won't she GO ALL THE WAY with Nathaniel storyline is ridiculous and took 50 million years to resolve...I read it and enjoyed the time in Anita's world, but that was it. It definitely was not her best effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"While I could never \\"hate\\" LKH's work, this was not my favorite. If you are looking for answers or continuity from previous books, you won't get it. It was high on prose and porn, low on plot or storyline regarding the serial killing advertised in the jacket of the book, or even a mention of what happened the last few chapters of the previous book.I was very frustrated with the lack of backround storyline, and missed Anita dealing with people in every day life ...meaning relationships and meeting new people without having sex.The 8 to 10 different partners, on multiple occassions within a 48hour time frame, without the luxury of a shower was too much for me.I'm far more interesed in the Merry series and the unveiling of the world of fae as well as the people we are meeting in those two courts than I currently am with the world of Anita.If you love Anita, buy this book, but don't expect it to be anything like the first few books.

Not for its own sake, but because I was a woman writing from a first-person woman's point of view. Had I been a man, they would have been okay with it. The erotic content has risen because they told me it shouldn't only because I am a woman writing about a woman. It's what my grandmother calls being contrary\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita - where'd you go?","review":"OK - only 220 pages into this and alreay hate it.

She does it (and does it and does it. . .) and won't shut up and I totally lost the story somewhere in all that.

There was no plot. So far Anita has had sex with 8 men/animals, mostly in groups...Uh,the murders and conversations with cops only took up maybe 2 chapters per murder but then Anita jumps into bed, or floor, or car, or whatever is handy, and that takes up about a hundred pages each escapade.The book is not worth buying, check it out from your local library instead but make sure to get it back on time because it is not even worth the late fees. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone who read the series knows why it only gets 2!","review":"Maybe I'm being harsh, but what the heck happened to the refreshing writing?

Hamilton needs to realize she had something amazing going and she's ruining it and watering it down with all the \\"F-me!\\" garbage. I can see where she was trying to go with it all, but honestly, she should just glaze over the sex scenes and move on with the plot, not spend 70% of the book on it. I'm near the end now and she's just now getting to the murder investigation! WTF happened to the story? I put good money into that book and I wanted a good book.

I'm a big fan of the earlier books in the Anita Blake Series, but this book isn't one I'd recommend to anyone. Incubus Dreams doesn't actually have a storyline. It's basically about Ms. Blake's need to screw everything in sight. I think it's time to end the series if the author isn't going to put any thought into writing it, because I miss the Anita Blake who walked into any situation with her guns blazing, not ready to make out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone wake up Mz.

Hamilton's novels to a friend -- I would definitely steer them towards her earlier work. I found this book to be too Anne Ricean (you know -- stream of consciousness writing, poor editing and a cast of thousands). The many gratuitous sex scenes are monotonous and uninteresting (they seem to be tacked on just to fill pages) and there appears to be little or no plot -- creating an unwieldy and excessively long novel.Hamilton used to be an innovative and amusing writer -- with good character development and plots that involved the reader. Her stories were filled with snappy dialogue, fun twists and turns and nice characterizations -- in short, they were cleverly written and never boring. Unfortunately, I can't say that about her books now -- she seems to have lost her way.

Luna's voice is pretty neat although I haven't compared it to the original. I guess I just want to say how much I like Tracey Moore's voice.

It can be a dense read at times, but anyone with a background in gender or queer theory should recognize some of her reference material.

The film visually looks as bleak as the frozen landscape. It only adds to the sense of doom and claustrophobia for the \\"Guy\\" and \\"Gal\\".

I think.There are a number of holes in the script and direction, and not even the good acting can overcome these problems.Strangely, given the lengths to which the production went to create the reality of the chilling winter in which our two protagonists are stranded in a road accident, the couple doesn't actually seem very cold. In the \\"making of\\" featurette, they seemed to be shivering and showing their breath, but these effects weren't very visible in the movie itself.Emily Blunt struggles gamely here, and even does one of the most credible American accents by a British actor that I've ever heard.But ultimately the film really doesn't hold together very well, and you will likely wind up scratching your head and saying, \\"huh?\\" at the end.Blunt deserves much better material, and I hope she finds more projects like \\"The Young Victoria,\\" in which she glows like a bright ember."},{"rating":"1","title":"This wind is neither chilling nor entertaining at all.

Blech. I usually can find something to like about almost any movie, and enjoy many \\"so bad it's good\\" kind of films. But Wind Chill stole two hours of my life and gave me less than nothing in return.

Folks, you've seen better on Sci-Fi channel original efforts. The actors are good enough - Ashton Holmes in particular seems a gifted actor trying to make the most of it. And Blunt is also fine, as an unsympathetic character, who you warm a bit to as things get chilly. But the real problem is the script, which goes no where, which is odd, given that snowstorm plus stranded car, with spectral things outside, is kind of hard to mess up for your average horror audience. Wrong. It's like the director went with an early draft of something that no one bothered to polish a bit, or even think much about.

It was creepy and well acted. The quality of the film was very good and the casting was excellent. I really liked the dialogue which many times in movies like this is silly. The dialogue was very realistic and well emoted.

They watched the old disney movie of Robin Hood and loved it. However, the picture in this is often very dark making it difficult to see the actors. Also the sound is very bad. Some of the plots are a little boring. But I think my kids would still be okay with watching them if it was better quality. I wanted something not so violent or fraught with sexual innuendo, which this isn't.

My husband bought me Flavors for my birthday, and it is unlike any other cookbook I have. The set-up is genius. If I'm in the mood for something spicy, I turn to the pepper section. If I have leftover ginger, I go the the ginger section. It makes sense. AND IT'S EASY. The recipes are extremely user-friendly. The pictures are gorgeous. Hay uses ingredients you might not normally see together, yet they work. If you like to cook, this book might even spark your culinary imagination. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT BOOK FOR ALL LEVELS OF COOKS","review":"Not suprisingly, Donna Hay has done it again.

There were interesting prestige classes, feats, skills, and other extras that i felt were a very good addition. The only real problem, and i think it's a big one, is the fact that after having initially bough the Faerun World book, and THEN the Magic of Faerun, there were many spells in the first book that were NOT in the Mag. of Faerun!! I felt like the writers should have placed all magic spells from the Faerun World book into the Magic of Faerun spell list. It only makes sense. Had i known this i might not have bought it. It pisses me off that much."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's a Fighter to do?","review":"As I have oft stated in my gaming reviews, I'm a fighter...

I have also often stated my dislike of the (in my opinion) derivative and generally boring Forgotten Realms campaign setting...Man... do I want to play a mage.It takes great skill as a writer to get THOSE words out of my mouth, and these authors, particularly Angel Leigh McCoy, have the skill.This book has it all, new feats, new spells and an AMAZINGLY in-depth examination of the history and inner workings of magic in the realms...If you are a Game Master (no matter whether your campaign is home grown or FR) this is a MUST for your d20 collection; If you are a caster in a FR campaign... run right out and buy it today.This book would have a flawless \\"5\\" rating were it not for the (once again) high price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bittersweet season","review":"As a diehard Monarch fan, I will gobble up as much of it as I can get! But I wouldn't claim season 5 as their best. As ever though, the scenery is astounding and the characters always intriguing.Not to give too much away, Duncan makes a quizzical (read: poor) dating choice, Molly gets swept up in a rollercoaster of love of her own, Paul makes another appearance with a difficult request, and Archie and Lexie face maybe the biggest, toughest decision of their relationship. Of course, some new faces make their entrances, and most importantly, a few dearly loved faces make their exits.So for those (like me) who love it all, this collection is a must-have. But for those who prefer to cherry-pick the series, I'd recommend seasons 1 and 3 as the best of all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monarch of the Air Waves","review":"We, my wife and I , first watched this series while we were living in New Zealand. We we captured from the first episode we watched. We finally found the DVD's of the series on line. This is without doubt the very best series ever produced. The actors are 'spot on' serving up characters that you want to know and have as friends and neighbors. The setting, Scottish Highlands,is superb, I know where the Creator goes for R&R. The stories are examples of what great writing should be. We have Seasons 1 through 5 and we'll be getting the remaining 3 seasons in the coming weeks. A must see. Hope that you grow to love Glenbogle as much as we do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster Installment","review":"While I'm a huge fan of the first two series of Monarch of the Glen, this series really just fails to live up to any kind of a standard. With Jullian Fellowes as Killwillie out of the picture and no more Hector, it seems this series just tries to aim for tackiness. I do recommend the first two series highly as they are intriguing and provide an interesting insight into Scottish Highland customs, but this installment is just at best overbearing. The plot lines are forced and the general message is cheapness. I really don't even think it is worth bothering with. Sorry to be negative, but I'm not sure what the BBC was thinking on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed by socialist agenda","review":"I liked the series, but the way they developed it over the years it clearly began to turn it into a tool for socialist propaganda.

The author of this book has taken that too far, though. The book is interesting in places and seems at least somewhat well researched, but the style is simply too cute, and distracts the reader with irrelevant (often autobiographical) side stories that seem to be written for people who would rather not be reading a book on this topic in the first place.

It also has many funny moments in it though it is a very intense and serious subject.I recommend it to everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated Film","review":"Never even heard of this movie and just happened across it. So glad I did! I loved the story of two war hardened (one disgraced) journalists who team up once again to hunt one of the Bosian war's most sadistic criminals. Based on the true story of five newsmen, I thought the script was clever, the story was satisfying and the chemistry between actors was equally as good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good adventure tale including a look back at a war most Americans remember little about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very sparce but emotionally rich story of a young boy.","review":"In this age of post-modern, ironic, dconstructionist storytelling, it's refreshing to see someone such as Canadian writer\\\\artist Chester Brown honestly recount his early life. 'I Never Liked You', graphic novel, is an excellent and enticing introduction to both Brown and the comics medium. The story and art mesh together effortlesly and all the sentimental cliches are carefully avoided. It's a quick read, which may dissapoint you at first, but, as you find yourself needing to reread it, you'll realize that it's a virtue. 'I Never Liked You' is poetic- flowing and graceful, yet meaty enough for you to dissect any line or image and learn more about what has shaped Chester Brown to make him the great artist he is today. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cartoon journal of real life.","review":"I Never Liked You is simply a recounting of various poignant moments in author Chester Brown's adolescence.

The author gets quite melodramatic with his story. (Of course, I may be slightly biased, as I had the grave misfortune to have worked indirectly for the author shortly after the book was published. I seem to remember the author not treating people nearly as well as he apparently treated his dog.) I found the book to be a lot of whining from a man who became unusually attached to a dog; probably one of the few living creatures he couldn't offend.

It was eloquent and touching; a beautiful tribute to the love between a dog and her human.

Canada has fine exports such as Bachman Turner Overdrive, Bryam Adams and the errie but sadly short lived series \\"Nigtmare Cafe\\" with Robert Englund (aka Freddy Kruger). This movie involves a traumatized young girl who becomes mute and is then looked after by her Doctor relative Catherine Mary Stewart. Rob Lowe also gives a solid performance as her violin playing neighbour. However things are not what they seem to be which is the first Rule of Sociology and good suspense/thriller movies. I give this movie 5 stars because Catherine's star continues to shine and she was very nice in sending me an autographed photo a few years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ask, just buy!","review":"I got hooked on the progression series from wearing out my copy of volume 1.

I am an experienced, fairly adventerous cook and I cook dinner every night. After a week of Donna Marie's recipes my family is begging me to quit. I made Black Bean Cassoulet soup (thin and watery), Moussaka, Morrocan Vegetable Hotpot (hot?), Drunken Roast chicken (falling apart, drunken), and No Fuss Chicken Stock. The last one is the only one I'll bother to repeat. The others were edible, but totally boring and overcooked by the time I got home, even though I followed the cooking recommendations (I even read the intro). I was hoping against hope that this book would allow me to come home to wonderful meals. One thing I can say is that the food I cooked was probably very healthy. It had that home-economist obviously-good-for-you taste. I haven't tried any desserts yet. The steamed puddings might be okay.

My husband thought it was too cheesy, which is odd since he loves cheese. I also made one of the chili dishes, which was fine, but not as good as your basic Better Homes and Gardens recipe.This book has 10 chili recipes, and 8 stew/pot roast recipes, which I don't really like.

What distinguishes this book from other crock pot books on my shelf are: 1)a few nice photographs of the dishes, 2)most of the dishes can cook for 7 to 9 hours on low if necessary and 3) there are directions for assembly or partial preparation of the night before. This makes it a godsend for those of us with hectic mornings and long hours at work or otherwise away from home. Most of the dishes are low in fat. She gives permission to use lowfat sour cream or evaporated milk when possible. I have had fun with her layered casserole creations such as vegetable pastitsio and Mexican brunch bake.

I honestly felt that I had died and that angels were singing in the middle of my living room when I first heard that hauntingly beautiful duet with full chorus. The CD has other wonders like the Bach aria \\"Wie freudig ist mein Herz,\\" Mozart's Exsultate, a few rarer Mozart sacred arias, and her Pie Jesu (Faure). What's absolutely incredible to think is that these pieces were mostly recorded in Germany in small churches and performance hall - no one who likes Germany and classical music could be disappointed. It's also a great buy for lovers of die deutsche Romantik. I can't believe it's for sale, because it's discontinued with many record stores, and it could easily go for 3 times the price - it's a rare import."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious sound!","review":"A beautiful voice: pure, very agile, never straining.

The movie is a trip into the exotic and unexplainable. Irvine Welsh wrote the screenplay, that he adapted from his book, and he did an excellent job.

With twisted humor, intriguing characters, and twisted plot lines, The Acid House delivers a good time for the whole dysfunctional family."},{"rating":"1","title":"better left in print","review":"This film was a very bizarre characterization of the Irvine Welsh collection of stories of the same name. While Trainspotting was a spot-on adaptation of a similar kind of book (random stories and characters) and excellent on-screen, The Acid House is better left for the printed page, although the unusual Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting's unforgettable \\"Spud\\") is a stand-out here."},{"rating":"2","title":"WELSH DELIVERS AGAIN","review":"Well, ladies and gents. If you are a fan of Scottish cinema or Irvine Welsh or just strange indie flicks you should take a flight on the Acid House airlines. 3 sorted stories to make your skin crawl. The Acid House delivers yet another one of Welsh's great books. Nice, romatic, sweet people should stay away from this flick. But anyone who likes their movies full flavored should stop and pick up this masterpiece. If you are a fan of Welsh than the accents and slang should be no problem but for anyone else it will take some getting used to.

No plot, terrible acting (even by Ms. Bullock, who is one of my favorite actors), and even bad lighting and camera angles on the one scene you're probably getting this movie to see. The two stars are simply because this is the first and probably only film in which Sandra is actually buck naked-- not that you can really see anything of substance, but it's a novelty when an A-lister like Sandra takes it all off.

Otherwise, just admire her beauty fully clothed in one of her good movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it is only 78 minutes long. I was inspired to rent it after the morning TV news reported it's release and how Sandra Bullock allegedly tried to block it because of a nude scene. Well, I would say she tried to block its release because it is so embarassingly awful. I have seen better student films. The dialog is so bad at times it makes you laugh. The male lead (a photo journalist) take so many pictures of everything it is comical right out of a Saturday Night Live skit. He even holds out his camera to take a picture of himself while he is being held in a choke hold with a knife to his throat. As for the nude scene, it is just a series of headshots and hair flips barely enough to justify an R rating (no T&A). The plot is so weak it makes you wonder how they are going to end it as you check your watch to see how much time is left. Don't waste your time with this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the other Bullock movies","review":"This movie was somewhat of a disappointment.

The plot was developed enough and the quality of the film was poor.I watched it mainly because of Sandra Bullock, I've loved all her films so far, but this one is nothing like any of her others. I wonder what made her do it. It is so unlike her and the movie surely didn't measure up to her usual standard.I definitely didn't think it was a worthy film and I didn't even get through most of it. It just wasn't gripping enough to keep me watching to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS SANDRA'S WORST MISTAKE EVER!","review":"I rented this movie becuase I thought it would be interesting just because Sandra Bullock was in it. I am so happy that I onlty spent 3 bucks on it becuase the movie is a waste of time. I fast forwarded throughout the whole thing and still didn't get to the end. It dragged on and on, the acting seemed poor (even sandra's) which really surprised me. The quality of the film was low and that wouldn't have made a difference if there was a good plot line. I was so dissapointed and coulnd't belive this was a Sandra Bullock movie. I also couldn't believe that she was nude in the film. After having the girl next door image for so long, I couldn't believe the sex scene. It showed her having sex from behind. Sandra! That's probably the only thing that may persuade you to buy it, but other than that this is the worst film i have seen in a long long time. I cannot emphasize that enough. I rented Frequency too, and that one is a good buy or rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Fans of Sandra","review":"I think that Fire on the Amazon is a very poor movie, but manages to mantain some interest in its plotline. It was produced in Peru amazonia by Roger Corman and directed by peruvian film maker Luis Llosa (in fact, cousin of writer Mario Vargas Llosa). For me, the main interest in the film is the presence of a very young Sandra Bullock, who performs her only one nude scene. It is a \\"must see\\" for every fan of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sandra Bullock movie","review":"I really like Sandra Bullock as an actress, but this is not one of her best. It is OK, but you might want to rent it once before you decide to buy it for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"This movie is a good start to a great movie Career. Dont buy this if you are looking to see the star..., just a pg-13 love seen. Over all a good movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Hours of my life I will never get back!","review":"This was probably the worst move I have ever seen in my entire life, and I am very open-minded with movies. It was about a woman (Sandra Bullock) who is obsessed with saving the rainforest, and this journalist who is taking pictures for a magazine meets her and they go through adventures in the rainforest together. I honestly can't stress enough just how horrible this movie was. Shame on whoever made it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ADULTS","review":"I FOUND THIS SHOCKING, AND HARD TO BELIEVE THAT SANDRA BULLOCK, WOULD EVENCONSIDER DOING SUCH A PICTURE. IT NEEDS TO BE BANNED AS ALL NUDITIY SCENESHOULD BE. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW PRODUCERS CAN ASKED STARS TO PROFORM SUCH ACTS, NOR CAN I UNDERSTAND THE MORALS OF PEOPLE THAT CONSIDER THEMSELVES STARS TO AGREE TO DO SUCH THINKS. PEOPLE IN THE MOVIE MAKINGBUSINESS HAVE NO MORALS. YOU USE TO SEE TWO PEOPLE WALK INTO A BEDROOM,CLOSE THE DOOR AND YOU WERE LEFT WITH YOUR OWN IMAGANATION."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dubious Debut","review":"In this painfully earnest, yet mildly cheesy film, we see glimpses of Sandra Bullock's strong personality to come. However, she is mostly overshadowed by the overacting of the others involved, as well as the film's simplistic, bludgeon-you-over-the head political messages (i.e., \\"Indians good; multinational logging corporations bad\\"). Ms. Bullock is pretty decent, but otherwise there's not much subtlety here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Forgetable Movie","review":"Once you see the movie it is readily apparent why is was never released until now. Very poor acting- plot line (if there is one) difficult to follow. It is obvious it was released to take advantage of Sandra Bullocks nude scene. As they say in New York - \\"Forgetaboutit\\" - a real dog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrated? Looks like I got scamed","review":"I purchased the unrated version of this movie, only to find an R rated disc inside the unrated case. The movie was 78 minutes, and from what I've heard rumored on IMDB the unrated ver. is supposed to be 84 min.I don't know what 6 minutes they cut out, but the movie is so poor, it's not worth searching after."},{"rating":"1","title":"CORMAN PLUS BULLOCK?","review":"It is a miracle Sandra Bullock got any work after this film at all. She was absolutely lousy with some of the worse lines imaginable. Craig Sheffer plays an obnoxious reporter who has his camera in everyone's face while Bullock is an activist attempting to save the rain forest. One of the protest leaders is killed and the story becomes a very bad who-dun-it. I kept hoping for Sheffer to die, but alas that was not the case. The sole attraction of this film is the love scene between Bullock and Sheffer where she shows more skin than usual, with strategic spots missing the camera so as to not technically classify it (in my book) as a nude scene per se. It is a bad ecology film, lousy drama, and worse murder mystery. Heck, it is not even good soft core. This is for die hard Bullock fans or Bullock stalkers. Avoid Avoid Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Movie that should NEVER have been made.","review":"From 1991 but clearly released only to exploit Sandra Bullock 's current popularity. A poorly written script, un-sympathetic characters, and run-of-the-mill plot. The much heralded sex scene is probably interesting if you don't get out much and was obviously included in a shameless attempt to gain viewers. Make no mistake, Bullock handles her role, such as it is, with absolute professionalism. No actor can save a bad script. The films one redeeming feature (in theory) is that it is only 78 minutes in length. However these are 78 very L_O_N_G minutes. On the upside though this movie can be successfully watched in fast-forward mode with no damage what so ever done to the plot. Honestly, avoid this one -you'll feel stung anyway. There are many very compelling films on this subject, and Bullock has made many excellent films. This one is bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"The depiction of the photojournalist in this movie is a complete joke. Characters and their motivations were poorly established and the cinematography and direction seemed cheap and amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I rented this movie last night after I read this reviews, to see if it was really that bad. And yes....it was terrible! The movie had a stupid plot that was not interesting at all, the acting was very unconvincing, and the movie was just boring. Not even the sex scene that everyone has been talking about was enough to keep viewers interested in the movie. This movie isn't even worth the $3 dollars I payed to rent it, and I should have listened to those people who said \\"don't waste your time and money.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're buying this for the plot, don't bother...","review":"This is an awful movie. No plot, terrible acting (even by Ms. Bullock, who is one of my favorite actors), and even bad lighting and camera angles on the one scene you're probably getting this movie to see. The two stars are simply because this is the first and probably only film in which Sandra is actually buck naked-- not that you can really see anything of substance, but it's a novelty when an A-lister like Sandra takes it all off. If owning her one and only skin flick is your goal, buy it. Otherwise, just admire her beauty fully clothed in one of her good movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste Of Your Time","review":"I bought the unrated version of this movie from amazon it was only 78 minutes and was the same as the R version. Don't buy this movie. If you want to see it go rent it from your Local Video Store. This movie was the biggest waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money","review":"First and foremost, let me state that Sandra Bullock is my absolute favorite and this review is not a reflection of her. This movie is below disappointment. There is almost no plot. The production is poor (i.e. non-continuous cuts, actual cut outs of audio effects, stereo effects reversed! (Unbelievable)) It is only seventy some minutes long but seems like hours. As for you voyeurs wanting an 'unrated' version, forget it. There is more 'unrated' in the first thirty seconds of most other movies than in this entire movie (which I am extremely pleased with, Sandra Bullock is above that kind of perversion). If you want a movie, get Air Force One. If you want a glimpse, get Eyes Wide Shut. I heard that the release of this movie was almost blocked by one of its members due to its poor plot/production. It is easy to see why. Do not waste your time or money on this one. Again, it is very important that you understand that this review reflects the movie and not Sandra Bullock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much here","review":"Aside from die hard Sandra Bullock fans, most people won't find much here of interest. A cheesy environmental type story set in the South American rain forest, it finds her as an activist caught in the middle of Native violence and shooting soft core porno with some journalist guy (Craig Sheffer). Sandra plays her role well....unfortunately it's just not a good role. Pass this one bye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Resource","review":"Hester's book is fortunately back in print. It was written for college students and is an excellent resource. It is not an exhaustive text - many times the author states the disclaimer that a topic is too involved to go into in detail, but this is not a serious drawback. Certainly the map quality is adequate but modern maps are a significant improvement. The coverage of the archaeology of the area is entertaining and rich in information. For the reader desiring to learn the history of the Hebrew people during this time period, this book is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware along the trail","review":"Grand Canyon Trail is the song Roy sings. Actually, the plot borrows heavily on Stan & Laurel's Way Out West. A hotel, a mine a mule... Even the sheriff might be James Finlayson himself! Film connoisseurs will also recognize in Roy and Jane Frazee's performance a hint of John Wayne and Ella Raines in Tall in the Saddle. It's too bad the video quality is so poor it looks like it's raining all the time. Although the box reads 67 minutes, the movie is really 57 minutes long, and you can tell when something is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"RE: Where is Jackie?","review":"Jackie Chan is the director of this movie. He is not in the movie himself. Please be aware of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Jackie?","review":"Recently I watched 36 Crazy Fists and Drunken Boxing Fist but the question is where is Jackie Chan in these movies? What a publicity stunt, they put his name and pictures on the movie but he isnt even these movies. Dont watch these movies it is a disappointment. Go watch Fist of Legend it is the best. Also I am looking for the Sequel to Drunken Master, where can I find that movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackie ???????","review":"Although he doesn't appear in the film, Chan did some fight and action choreography on this Taiwanese production. Unbeknowst to Jackie, the producers shot behind-the-scenes footage of Chan as he was working, which ended up being included in some of the released prints. Going on step further, a distributor cobbled together a \\"The Making of...\\" documentary using bootleg footage of Jackie. Knowing how mindful Chan is of being a role model for childern, he must have just loved seeing himself smoking a cigarette for the duration of his time on screen. (Review taken from The Essential Jackie Chan Sourcebook.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yen Shi-kwan barely makes this horrible movie worth watching","review":"The story is not worth going over. This is easily one of the most boring kung fu movies ever. One of the best kickers in cinema history Tony Leung Siu Hung stars as a young man who is trying to learn kung fu. The fights are pretty good, but there is not nearly enough of them. Fung Hak-on has a good cameo using a chain rope, and Lau Ga-yung from 'Dragon Claws' does some decent work. The best part about this movie is the final fight with Yen Shi-kwan. It goes on for well over 10 minutes but barely manages to save this horrible movie.1.5/5The version I have is from Groundzero and has watchable picture quality. It is under the title 'The Master and the Boxer'. Included on the disc are bonus clips from other Groundzero movies and some cool lost IFD trailers."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S A TRICK!

JACKIE MAY HAVE DIRECTED THIS TRASH AND HE EVEN WAS THE MARTIAL ARTS DIRECTOR, BUT HE'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THIS FILM, DESPITE THE FACT THAT HIS PICTURE IS ON THE COVER!

Well, ok, he did work on it, but only as the stunt coordinator. The producers put together a \\"making of\\" documentary, then later unscrupulously edited in behind-the-scenes footage of Jackie. Why? For money, of course. The original didn't do well; the re-edited version was marketed as a Jackie Chan movie.

This is not a Jackie Chan movie. You see him in a behind the scenes bit in the beginning, but that's it. As far as the movie itself, I've only seen it once and it wasn't good enough for me to not get so easily distracted from it. I can't really remember too much about it anymore. Not memorable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Tragic","review":"This slim book can easily be read in a few hours. The short stories are all vignettes out of the lives of the addicted and the desperate.What this book does, better than any other book I've read, is capture the beauty and tragedy of these lost lives. Johnson is great at imagery, whether the misty, sunlit dive bar on a rickety pier, or the deserted drive-in in the snow. He's also great at writing from the inside of these characters-- their tragic worldview makes sense through their eyes. The hallucinatory beauty of these \\"prose-poems\\" goes hand-in-hand with the altered perceptions of the characters-- these people live as if in a dream state.If you're ready to write off people on the fringes of society, then you probably won't appreciate this book. Like he did in \\"Angels,\\" Johnson takes these forgotten people, and makes them live and breathe on the page. Many times, his characters seem more truly alive than those who would write them off or forget about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"an american masterpiece","review":"It's what Huck Finn's life would have been like if he'd been in his early 20's in the 1970's.

Regardless the length is not a problem as the book manages to pack in so much into a small space"},{"rating":"2","title":"An amusing look into the worlds of drug addicts.","review":"Denis Johnson does a wonderful job of bringing the reader into the world of off-beat characters. Many are under the influence of drugs and alcohol and their actions are mostly irrational to the average person. It is humorous but at the same time scary! I would recommend this book to anyone with a strange sense of humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"It seems to me that the more ugly, grotesque, and hopeless your work is, the more people will praise you, call you a genius, and hand over their money to you. Denis Johnson is no exception here. Even though he can put a good line together once in a while, the praise surrounding his work is a lot of overblown hype and his stories lack any depth. I was attracted to this book because I'd read that Johnson was similiar to Thom Jones but is nowhere close to Jones's work. The \\"dark side\\" of life is only interesting for so long, and only if there's some meaning behind it, even though the privleged middle class seems to be obsessed with probing the depths of this from their secure suburban lifestyles. Isn't there enough disposable literature out there today?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i bought this after an excellent review on NPR. last time i'll do that. while there's nothing wrong with the prose, there's nothing especially inspiring about it either. my biggest complaint is not specific to Johnson. i'm sick of books about stupid characters. maybe there are so many such books because it's easier to get stupid people into trouble, but frankly, my dear, i'm BORED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in A Drug-like World","review":"This was seen on a recommended list by a somewhat famous author. I was sadly disappointed. The book had a number of short stories of which NONE inspired me. One of the stories mentions how one can't just sit on the bus as 'you've got to have a destination'. It's too bad the author of this book had no true destination. I was simply lost in nonsense. Don't give this your time--it's a waste of time. I felt the same way the author did on the last page of the book when he wrote 'Sometimes I heard voices muttering in my head, and a lot of the time the world seemed to smolder around its edges'. That's for sure...what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Hunter S Thompson","review":"The high ratings given this book by other reviewers is more a reflection of our adoration of addicts than of the quality of the writing.Huh? Consider how often Larry King guests a 'star' fresh from rehab. Frankly, we give losers too much attention and give far too little credit to those who make good life choices. Jesus' Son is a case in point. Or rather, lack of point.Let's get to Hunter S. Thompson. He will take you through a drug experience with a purpose---even in his least lucid moments he was most lucid.Skip this book, save the time and trouble. Read Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. And, if you really want quality introspection, read Camus' The Stranger."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is one of the most accessible and enjoyable collection of short stories I have ever read. He's got a great way of quickly getting to the main event that drives each story (usually something foolish, rediculous, and dangerous). This makes you feel that you don't have get through a learning curve with each new story. Having a main character thoughout all the stories helps too.The writing itself is stripped down and beautiful. You can tell his background is in poetry. He doesn't spend long paragraphs on physical descriptions, but he does a great job of getting into the head of his desperate, foolish, but decent main character."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant and beautiful","review":"I love this book. The ending lines about \\"I never knew -- never imagined even for a heartbeat -- that there was a place for people like us\\" deserves to stand alonside the closing lines of Gatsby as one of the great finishes in American literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Sure","review":"I tried to like this collection, and there were moments, some pretty dog-gone good ones, but there were other moments, lots of them, where I wanted to wing the book across the room and say, \\"You're kidding me! This is the stuff that has folks yakking for ten years now?\\" There's a lot of the stuff of the novice writer in here, pages and pages of it... In a literary sense, the book remeinds me of a kid who comes down a Sunday morning to the stale remnants of his parents' wild party and smokes a pretzel and sips flat ginger ale while dealing himself a hand. I mean, don't we have any adults writing?I don't think I have ever been as convinced that Am. Lit. is in need of a new voice, a new sensibility. I think the spareness that so many write about in praising Mr. Johnson comes from his gut instinct that he has nothing to add.By the way -- I read 'Tree of Smoke,' tried to read it, but found it not only unbearable, but false. 'Jesus' Son,' at least, is not false."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting more","review":"I don't think that Jesus' Son should be put with some of the top books of the 20th century, BUT it is an incredibly interesting read at times. Some of the ways he describes simple things are beautiful and had me rereading certain lines to really make that image concrete in my mind. I do wish it was a bit longer but at the same time, now I'll be able to reread it very quickly, and I will, without a doubt, reread it several times throughout my life. I definitely recommend Jesus' Son."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best collections of short stories ever","review":"so good i pick it up for inspiration. collection has unity to it. prose is jarringly poetic. great exploration of Placelessness. must read for adventurous, not easily disturbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus Son Stories","review":"Well written quirky selection of interconnected short stories.

Nothing to do with Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am still alive...","review":"Read on the reviews anywhere for \\"Jesus' Son\\" - stories by Denis Johnson and you'll see the same things: amazing, life changing, a masterpiece. So I finally took the plunge!\\"Jesus' Son\\" is eleven short tales about drug addicts, low lifes and other miscreants. I thought the stories were good, not great. The writing is unique and as one reviewer blurb on the book says, \\"its like reading ticker tape from the subconscious\\" and thats a dead on description.Somewhere along the way, I read that Chuck Palahniuk said that \\"Jesus' Son\\" is one of his favorite books and that he often refers back to it when writing his own novels.The stories I really enjoyed-Car Crash While HitchhikingOut on BailWorkEmergencySteady Hands at Seattle GeneralBeverly HomeNot your normal short stories by any means, but very good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance in a haze.","review":"Denis Johnson did not let me put this collection of stories down. I myself being far from a normal reader was enthralled by this book. After seeing the film I knew that I had to make this purchase, and I am far from let down.

I hope you didn't see into any of the foreshadowing about the good Drow goddess that's in FR 3.5 (Elliastrae sp?).It's just pretty bad. Everything seems rushed, characters aren't fleshed out at all. The only interesting part comes TOTALLY out of nowhere and has nothing to do with the previous 2 books.

I think back on some of his earlier work such as The Dark Elf Trilogy and the Demon Wars and then I read this one and I shake my head in disappointment. Salvatore's Drizzt books used to be so great and unpredictable but now it's all changed.This book was quite stale. You had Bruenor on his death bed but yet the entire thing was pointless because you KNEW that he was going to come back to life. The fight scenes were OK but even those were not as good as Salvatore back in the past. Whatever happened to good old one-on-one fight scenes that RAS excelled in?In order for Salvatore to spice up his Drizzt series, he needs to refresh it by letting some of his main characters die. It is far past due for a major death to take place.Overall, \\"The Hunters Blades\\" trilogy was a poor series and nowhere near Salvatore's earlier work."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing","review":"I was very much let down by the conclusion of this book. Nothing becomes resolved except long, drawn out reunion of the companions. I think that Salvatore has to either return Drizzt to his roots of the greatest warrior in the realms or just let him fade away. How long can readers follow his exploits when he is constantly brought down by orcs and goblins after hearing how he defeated demons and dragons? I cannot begin to explain my sorrow at having bought this book in hardcover when it is hardly worth the paperback price. I own every book Rob has ever written but this is the first I have ever felt betrayed afterwards. Please let him learn the error of his ways soon before I move on and find more interesting tales to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ole Same Ole...not much original thought here","review":"Mr. Salvatore seems to have run out of orignial ideas and new plots. This book is same ole...same ole...And since none of his main characters ever dies, there isn't much suspense in the battles. Plus just how many different ways can you continue to chop up an orc or a troll and make it interesting? When he first introduced us to Drizzit, each book was a brand new adventure with new and exciting characters and action. Now it seems that if you have read one you have read them all. I wish the author would get inspired and give us something new and exciting. And occasiontaly kill one of the characters. After all, evil does triumph now and then. Finally, why call this a triolgy? It certainly did not have an ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneventful: More of the same old.","review":"Once again Drizzt runs through impossible obstacles in invincibility mode. I've read many of Salvatores works and it's just more of the same. He keeps creating new stories for his bread and butter character which have grown so stale that were at one time creative nd suspenseful. Drizzt always comes out on top. Wulfgar is always torn between the same emotions that he only knows how to deal with in his barbarian rage. If this is your first venture into Salvatore's world you may enjoy it. But long time readers are likely to be bored with the same old same old. Read War of the spider queen book one instead. It's actually versatile, creative, and multidimensional; what a good fantasy book should be. Note: I am referring to the entire trilogy no just book 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"the series is grinding to a halt","review":"The Drizzt series has been a favorite of mine since i read the lone drow. I read all the others up to this point in about a year, and they were good reads. Now though, Salvatore just needs to get on with it and actually make something happen. This book, and the two before it, are incredibly slow and boring, as none of the villains have any depth and are basically there to annoy Drizzt and the gang. I also dislike the invincibility that all the main characters seem to possess. Just kill Bruenor or Catti-brie or someone please, it might accidentally spice things up a bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a gift","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my brother and he liked it. Based on that I give it a rating of 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated to have to do this to my favorite author.","review":"Nothing happened in these three books other than me spending money. Something needs to change here and I hope the new ones bring on the change. Orcs? We are talking about a group of people that beat demons and a city of drow and dragons, etc. But they are at a stalemate with orcs? Not good. And NOTHING comes to a conclusion other than a few minor storylines. Could Salvatore be out of ideas with these group of adventurers? I hope not but this trilogy has left me with much doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow Writing for Shallow Readers","review":"RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel. This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"With this series, Salvatore has become incredibly stale. His storylines have become incredibly predictable. In order for me to maintain interest in Salvatore's currently very bland work, he NEEDS to kill off one or a few of the main characters. The near-death teases are ridiculous because you already know that the character isn't going to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Two Swords' Review","review":"I own all books written by R. A. Salvatore concerning Drizzt. This book ended too soon. I couldn't put it down. But it does jump to the ending too soon. Plus, the main war is going on a little too long. But all in all, I was waiting since October 2003 to read this and I'll have to wait for October 2005 to read the next one. I pretty much devoured the book. I'm a big fan and anybody who wants to read/likes to read books of this nature I would definitely recommend in doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIE HARD FAN","review":"I have to agree with most every one....this was terribly lame.R.A. Salvatore is an excellent writer and this was just not on par.Its great to read about the gang from the spine of the world.I can hardley wait till the next book comes out. But after this one..... well i hope he takes a much needed break. mabey write about the guys from the Servant of tha shard again?Any how if another book comes out on Drizzt, heh ill buy it, but not with the anticipation I used to have.in this book, nothing realy happens...i dont the there is even a decent part involving one of the main charaters. the supporting secondary charaters stories are good though.well hope to see more from R.A. Salvatore just hope he gets the break he needs before it comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"R.A. JORDAN ????","review":"Remember - there is no great hero without a great villain! Gone are the days of Matron Baenre, Llolth, Zak, the Underdark, dragons, the shard, Entreri, etc... We need more than an Orc with great armor! That was awful! I mean - give me Ellifain's superElf brother or something!Salvatore is a great writer but has failed to come with a good idea to breathe new life into his stories about Drizzt and his company. Much like Jordan - the books seem to go nowhere. Whether it is writing a book a hundred years into the future, including Cadderly or maybe some other forgotten realms characters, or another trip to the underdark - he has to do something which will break the monotony of what we are becoming used to: one of the main characters thinks another is dead, he/she gets pissed and kills everyone, a reunion with the main characters...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic","review":"I don't write reviews that often, but this book compared to other RAS books was horrible at best. It took me over a year just to read it because I got bored so easily with it, and if it weren't for my overseas flights I probably would have never finished it. The fight scenes were a dull read, which typically are the most enthralling piece. I've read The Dark Elf Trilogy, Crystal Shard series, etc., so I have some ground to get a comparison off of his previous writings. It just seemed to me there was no excitement in this book that kept me from putting it down, instead I just wanted to read it, finish it, then drop it off at the used bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as it should have been","review":"Mr. Salvatore has done it again here. He's taken his characters and run them through the drama mill. It's a great book, but I feel like the ending to this series should have been a little more conclusive. I won't spoil the ending or anything. If you've read the other two in this series, then you have to read this one. I enjoyed it, I just feel that it could have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's getting old","review":"The plot of this book is basically the same as the previous six or seven books based on Drizzt and co, and while the first Drizzt books were great it's getting really old. Drizzt has angst, drizzt runs away, drizzt faces his enemy... sound familiar? I also cannot figure out the point of the trilogy, the situation at the end of the book is basically the same as the situation at the beginnng, nothing has been resolved. What was the point of all those hundreds of pages? I'm still guessing. Overall not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveiw for last book in Hunter's Blade Trilogy.","review":"As this is the last book the the Hunter's Blade Trilogy, and the story of Drizzt Do'Urden, this book lives up to what it's supposed to be: gripping, dramatic, and full of action. This book is all good because it ends how all good fantasy books should end: evil guy dies, and they all live happily ever after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"This book is well written, clear, and positively enlightening. The seller has delivered on the high quality and excellent condition of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic and uncomfortable","review":"I had one of these a couple of decades ago and I could not remember why I stopped using it. I remember now. The knee cushion is not comfortable for sitting any longer than about 10 minutes. The chair is clunky and hard to move on the floor without picking is up. I will say the handle bars on the side are a big improvement over my earlier version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but can be better","review":"The knee area does not have enough cushion and this results in your knee hurting a bit if you sit at a stretch for more than 30 minutes. So I get up every now and then for a minute. Other than that it works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay..","review":"This is an okay chair. I find that I cannot sit in it very long... but perhaps that's just me not agreeing with the design. One annoying aspect was the assembly. It took the help of another person to put it together."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more comfortable than a $10 folding chair","review":"Although a well made, sturdy piece of furniture, after having owned it less than a month, I am convinced that although it seems like a good idea, the chair isn't very comfortable, and though it might help with back-pain sufferers who have a tendency to slouch, the seat and \\"knee cushion\\" are uncomfortable after sitting for longer than a half-hour. My advice? Spend the 100 bucks on a decent \\"traditional\\" computer chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a textbook, at best reference material.","review":"I'm currently an undergraduate studying introductory simulation, and this book has not been effective in conveying the necessary information.This textbook (if it can even be called one) is at best reference material. Examples are not clearly explained or worked out, i.e. methods for simulating a process are not fully explained and the actual estimator is never written down.The material is just too dense and an entire semester detailing various simulation techniques was covered in the span on 20-30 pages. Needless to say, this book can only be used as reference material for lectures and cannot be relied on for learning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to read","review":"I bought this for a class on Canadian literature, and it was a fun read. At first it was a little tough because the Canadian accent is written into the story, but overall it was entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"magic","review":"This is a great fairy tale with a Buddhist view that is magnificently and copiously illustrated. The drawings alone tell the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the artwork alone","review":"I was about 8 years old when I received this book in 1980 or thereabouts (being a huge Monkey fan at the time from the TV adaptation), and I still refer back to it. I recognised it at the time as something special, and I worked out for myself how the scenery took on ominous shapes as the story turned. I wasn't even that excited by the story, but the artwork really captured my attention at such an early age.The whole of the book appears to be on archive.org if you want to try before you buy, but do get it on paper, the book has a wonderful feel of its own - a cross between a quality Chinese cultural publication of the 70's and a cheap mono xerox. And you do get to enjoy it even more not being on a screen, but to appreciate the art. You could cut any of the pages out and frame them on the wall and they would look very much in place - you don't quite get that from scans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never moves past the obvious","review":"For me, this movie was very disappointing. I too, am a fan of the actors in this film, and had looked forward to seeing it. Unfortunately, the filmmakers were so afraid that their subject matter was too complicated for the average movie goer that they felt it necessary to review the same obvious conclusion over and over. This is demonstrated by their refusal to even vary the language, lest we be confused about who the 'takers' are. Had this movie assumed the audience is capable of following rational thought, it could have provided some unique insight and commentary regarding issues of society and control in general. Instead, the movie never moves beyond conclusions reached in the first 30 minutes, which overall, makes it little more than a very average, very boring film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Philosophical Movie","review":"I would ignore the critics and judge this movie for yourself. The plot and the dialog can be weak at times, but that simply emphasizes things that are not said (such as \\"body language\\"). The topic is daring, and is put forth very \\"brutally\\". This is somewhat of a \\"Thriller\\" but not in the overblown Hollywood sense. The only things that bothered me was Cuba Goodings occasional \\"overacting\\". I congratulate Hollywood for taking a chance with this movie, it is one of the better movies I have seen this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Critics who jump to the tune of films like American Beauty","review":"_Instinct_ was an excellent movie for several reasons: Riviting performances: Hopkins is intense and unpredictable--but predictably good. Gooding is excellent in an entirely color & gender-blind role. It might as easily have been played by a woman, an Asian, a Caucasian--anyone. Those roles are rare in Hollywood, and their creation should be encouraged. The mystery and the message: a little predictable, but moving and credible. (The critic who thinks the climax unbelievable should read the newspaper from several years back when a similar event occurred in reality--unfortunately with a less satisfactory outcome.) I loved the film and intend to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thought-Provoking Film","review":"Instinct is a video for people who like to think about a movie long after it's over. The beginning credits to the video indicate that the story is based on Daniel Quinn's book, Ishmael. The movie is much more meaningful if you have read Ishmael and vice-versa. And, by the way, in addition to reading Ishmael, read Quinn's other books, The Story of B and My Ishmael. The books and video will change the way you forever look at the world! Instinct will help to make you a more sensitive and socially-conscious sentient being with a much better appreciation for life and all life forms!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the box","review":"A superb flick. I have recommended it to a number of friends. This is a movie the makes you look at life and ultimately yourself. In my experience, few like what is seen. For those that think outside the box, this is a good thing. You've the oppurtunity to act upon this new insight. In such cases, 'Instinct' becomes more than just another trip through Hollywood; shifting instead into a life altering event.If you have not seen it, then I suggest you do so; BUT(always a but), go in prepared to give some heavy thought to what the movie has to say. This is no 'Matrix' which stuns you with it's special affects. 'Instinct' is a movie of the mind. One can view it as such or (more than likely) be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the critics; Best Movie of the Year","review":"Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. team up for a fabulous film. Hopkins, from Silence of the Lambs, plays another fantastic role as a psycho. Cuba Gooding Jr is superb in his first starring role. There are many other great actors in riveting movie. The plot may not seem enticing, but don't judge this movie by its cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"More then excellent","review":"This movie moved me. It is incredible to see what humans can do to other species. In my opinion the character of Hopkins (who gave an incredible performance as always) is entitled to defend the Gorrila's. Why should a human life be worth more then the life of a Gorrila. There is only a couple of them left and millions and millions of us. We are the vermin of this earth. Poachers and the people who buy from them should be prospecuted to the highest possible level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"I'd heard some criticism of this movie, basically that it was the same thing they did with Hannibal Lecter, same actor, so why bother seeing it, yadda yadda. Not so! I was expecting a different type of movie, and was VERY pleasantly surprised by Instinct. I agree with some of criticism of \\"stereotypical\\" prison guards, \\"eccentric\\" inmates in the psych wing... yet it works. It's worth your while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful movie!","review":"As another reviewer said, one of the really good things this movie did was mention Daniel Quinn's book in the beginning.I have just finished reading Ishmael by Quinn (which I wouldn't have known of hadn't it been for this movie), and I must say that Instinct's scriptwriter has done an excellent job of creating a story *based* on the thoughts of the book but making it so much more interesting and dramatic. The movie has IMPACT. It caught my attention when I saw the trailer on TV, and I knew I had to watch it, and I *drank* it in like I had longed for it for ages.It's a beautiful, excellent movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Short...","review":"INSTINCT is a movie that has a lot to say about social dynamics, human nature, and our need for dominance. Unfortunately, it only has 2 hours to get these complex ideas across. Anthony Hopkins (THE ELEPHANT MAN, SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) is excellent as always, portraying the supposed \\"madman\\" who is actually something quite the opposite. Cuba Gooding, jr. is also good as the man who attempts to break through Hopkins' psychological barriers. If only this film were about 3-4 hours long! The story definitely needed to be fleshed out. Things happen too quickly, like a whirlwind, leaving much of the tale untold, or at least under-developed. I give the movie 4 stars because, in spite of its brevity, it actually made me think. Not many films do that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performances make dull film watchable!","review":"Both Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding turn in very good performances which unfortunatly do not elevate this movie above boredom levels. Possibly worth renting once, but I would not recommend purchaseing.The screen story is so predicable I found myself thinking 15 minutes ahead of what little involvement the movie offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Protect us from screenplays succh as Instinct's","review":"The acting was OK given the ludicrous screenplay. An untterly implausible plot coupled with stereotypical characters (the doubting youn doctor, the older doctor, the prison guard, the prison doctor, the warden) and the \\"in your face\\" direction made this a film to remember.When a man goes off to live in forest with gorillas and leaves his knife behind, and takes no food, he is a fruit-cake. He is also a selfish fruit-cake having abandoned his family. He is also a dim fruit-cake having killed one of the baddies and not taking his rifle.Plot and character are important.

I didn't expect it to arrive so quickly, or be so blatant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking Experience","review":"Based on Daniel Quinn's \\"Ishmael\\" the experience pits the illusions of freedom offered by civilization against natural order.

These are wonderful. We cosleep and one of these under her side of the bed lets me quickly change her area if it happens. It also makes mornings much nicer if it happens even after I change her in the middle of the night. It's a quick change and I don't have to worry about leaks on the tempurpedic! She also has reflux and can be prone on bad days to throwing up. This has held up very well to multiple washings and sanitizings. Which is why I came back for more. We also use these on the spare bed where we change her during the day and it is a great preventative. She tends to sleep hot and this doesn't seem to bother her at all. It's a good size too so I don't have to worry if she rolls closer to me to snuggle that she'll be off the pad. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the trick!","review":"My little girl has been having trouble with bed wetting lately and I just couldn't stand seeing her ruin her mattress. I bought 2 of these (one for a backup when the other may be in the wash) and they're doing exactly what they should be doing- keeping the bed dry! The \\"noise\\" wasn't a problem and after several washes, you can't hear the crinkles anymore when she gets on it. My daughter never complained about it sliding around on her, and we always found it just where it should be when we get her up in the morning even though she moves around a lot as she sleeps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops in my book","review":"These are so wonderful I had a smaller pad but it never seemed to be where it was needed. I bought 3 of these originally and was very pleased. I ended up buying a fourth last week and boy am I glad.

It's been washed lots and lots of times over the past three years and three kids. I use normal detergent along with half a cup of vinegar in the bleach tray to get the urine smell out. The pads are still white. They are in good shape. They are uniform in color. They still absorb all the wetness. They don't stink. The only trouble I've had -- if I wash two pads at once WITH a full load of clothes then sometimes I have to run the drain/spin cycle again to get the load dry enough for the dryer. (More likely that I overloaded the machine, though.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for children under the age of 12","review":"Label says not for use by children under the age of 12.

Unlike all the other pads we have tried, these have a much softer surface.

She spends a lot of time on how to approach writing. She gently points out that it is not initially a fine motor skill to be mastered but an avenue for the child to record his or her own stories and experiences. Her constant message is how to encourage rather than perfect the child's ability which is refreshing in a world of standardize testing. Through sharing of her own experiences she provides ideas on how to help further develop a child's natural inventiveness into lessons on reading, writing, science and math. This is not a hard line method to expose a child to everything available but rather an encouragement based approach to explore ideas with your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was a really good movie","review":"For being on lifetime this movie was really good.If you are a iris johansen reader like my self you will see stuff that was in the book and not the movie.i think some things were left outof the movie that should have been in it.Why because logan wasnt mentioned in the movie and if they continue doing iris johansen books they really needed him in there he plays an important role and plus eve didnt dream of bonnie what she thinks is dreams anyway.that was important to the story later on to. other then that it was a good movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"movie vs book","review":"i loved the movie but i agree with the other person they left out a couple of important things like logan and bonnie, also in the book eve had barely met sarah and i wnated to see what logan looks like and quinn is sexy, but i loved the movie also i hope they make more or even make a series on tv about it. all the actors were great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Read this review before purchasing","review":"WARNING: This product ONLY flies straight up and down.

This helicopter is way too big for indoor use - helicopter can go 30 feet in less than 2 seconds and does not fair too well with accidents( they will happen ) landing gear especially. Don't know how to make it fo forward, I believe minor modifications will be necessary. A 4 ( or more ) channel helicopter will give you actual control of the helicopter, they start around $ 400.

Since his hand is burned and useless, he is unable to continue his career as a silversmith. No one will hire him. Who would, his hand is burned. He looks day and night but he just can't find a job. He finally gets a job as a rider for the Boston Observer. He has never been on a horse before but his good friend Rab agrees to teach him. Johnny and Rab become closer friends as the book goes on. There are many wars in Johnny Tremain. Doctor Warren is able to fix Johnny's hand with a simple surgery.Review by Jamie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Tremain","review":"Johnny Tremain was one of the most exciting and adventurous books I have ever read. The story starts out slow, but then starts to progress. My favorite character in the book is Johnny Tremain because he reminds me a lot of myself. He is a boy about my age that I can relate to in many ways. The setting of the story is just before the Revolutionary War. Almost all of Johnny's actions and decisions are related to the setting. Johnny participates in the Boston Tea party which was a main factor in how the war started. I recommend this book for kids who are in sixth or seventh grade. The author's style was sometimes hard to understand, but you could still read the book. I give this book four stars and suggest that you go and buy it. I know you will love it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I think this book was the boringest, and dumbest book ever!But I have to say that the movie was pretty good and funny so you have to give that credit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST BOOK EVER!","review":"This is the worst book I have ever read. The characters are weak, the action is non-existant and the book is just flat-out bad! There is little to no action throughout most of the book, and when there is, it is extremely predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo Terrible","review":"Not only was this book totally boring, it seemed like everything terrible happened to Johnny. I had to read this horrific book in the fifth grade, when we were studying American history, and now I unquestionabley hate any book or movie that has to do with American history around the time of the American Revolution. I mean, I'm all for the American Revolution, I think it was amazing and I love the fact that we're not governed by an island all the way across the ocean that's like a millionth of the size of us. But this book was terrible representation of that time and didn't seem that realistic. And it put me to sleep many times. But if you're into that type of stuff, this might be a good book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fascinating Book","review":"In the beginning of Johnny Tremain's life, he burns his right hand silversmithing, so in most of the book he can't really use it anymore except to ride a horse. His friend, Rab, lets him use his horse, Goblin. Goblin is a very rough horse and Johnny learns how to ride him very quickly which is amazing because most excellent horse riders can't even ride him. So even thought he can't be a silversmith anymore, he still is very talented.In the book, you'll read about many famous people you have probably heard about, like Paul Revere, and other famous things that happened like The Boston Tea Party. You'll see who was a part of the Boston Tea Party and the group of boys that dressed up like Indians and used fake tomahawks to break open the boxes of tea.The book is very exciting because you get to see what the revolutionary war was like, even if you were just a young boy. I think you'll like this book very much.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Esther Forbes is wonderful!!","review":"Esther Forbes does an excelent job at mixing fun with education.It really helped me a lot because i was studying the Boston Massacre, and it talks about Paul Revere, Sam Adams, and John Hankock.Since we were learning about that in history it helped me historically and in my vocabulary. My favorite charactor is definitely Rab. He is a great person. He is also adn easily admirable person. He is kind and cares about what people think. He was kind to Johnny even though Johnny looked like a scoundrel only looking for trouble. Johnny's look was all wrong, he isn't really a careles scoundel. He is really a kind-hearted,sensitive person who doesn't give up easily. i would definitly recommend this book to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Note to Teachers and Parents","review":"I purchased this audio recording of Johnny Tremain for my classroom. It is the unabridged recording of the book and a great value for the price. The CDs track every three minutes, and Grace Conlin does a fine job narrating the story. My students have been able to follow along with the text while listening, and they can easily use the CDs on their own. Personally I much prefer George Guidall's narration (from Recorded [...]); I think that it is a more dynamic and enjoyable recording. However, if you are looking for a basic recording of Johnny Tremain and don't want to spend a fortune, these CDs certainly do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the young reader!

I really strongly discourage reading this book, so don't waste your time on it.Johnny Tremain was an apperentice silversmith when he burned his hand and had to leave his master.

After about 10 pages the plot is so \\"thick\\" that you completely lose interest and want to throw the book away. The book does not deserve any awards and should not be recommended for anything.

Young mith apprentice, Johnny Tremain, finds the war sparking around him. He has his duty to carry out as an apprentice, however. But when his hand is severely burnt, he is rendured useless.

I read this book for my seventh grade book report, and have never in my life, before that project, or now, after it, found a better book. Johnny Tremain deserves a sequel, because though it starts out wonderfully, and throughout is amazing, the end it quick, and cliffhung. Esther Forbes should continue with this topic.

Forbes' novel is slow-paced and un-realistic. Although it stated great moments in history, the characters are too involved. Johnny is a teenage apprentice, and then he is in war dealing with some of the top revolutionary leaders. Set in revolutionary time, the characters are living in a perfect world and doing ordinary things in the beginning of the book. Then, there is a large leap in the middle of the book and the character's are in war. The book would be much better if the author concentrated on making fictional parts seem more realistic. In that time, people were not as happy-go-lucky.

This is a great book for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down!","review":"The moment I began to read Johnny Tremain, I was hooked. The way the author describes the setting and characters makes you feel like you're really there. In fact, this book felt like a window to the past that I could climb through and experiance Boston during the American Revolution.Throughout the whole book, you love the main character, Johnny Tremain. Being a very bright, slightly arrogant, young silversmith, he is immediantly swept into the action of the Revolutionary War. He plays a large part in events such as the Boston Tea Party, the midnight ride of Paul Revere, and secreat meetings going on between the Sons of LIberty.The only part of the book that I found was dissapointing was the fact that the book is too short!

The end (or mostly the second half of this book) was dull, dumb, lifeless, boring, ambigous, and altogether a terrible read. I forced myself to finish it and found myself asleep with the book on the floor next to me quite often.

The Lytes are loyalists so they get into quite a bit of trouble. Rab dies in the end. I think this is a good book if you aren't forced to read it like I am.

There isn't really a plot line, so you never know where Esther Forbes is going next with the story. In other reviews, people have said that its really boring in the beginning, but gets better at the end. This is true in the beginning, but I'm past the middle of the book and this has not changed.

The crappy acting, poor timing, and superficial characters totally detract from any underlying political message. This movie's main character is a philandering idiot and nothing more. His wife is even less believable and likable. There is a gratuitously violent and totally outlandish scene in which the only good character in this film is defenestrated, but of course the idiot gets away. What happens to his mistress should have happened to the script, before this ever made it to production. I love independent films, I love David Thewlis' acting, but even after two years I still have a yucky taste in my mouth from this piece of poo called a movie. If you want more David Thewlis, see \\"Seven Years in Tibet\\" or \\"Life is Sweet\\", instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not disappoint","review":"Our family has been waiting for this DVD to be released ever since the show finished.

Anyhow, forget what most people buy. Don't use the question \\"is it popular?\\" to determine worth or otherwise you may never find the music that really matters! This is one example.

All their albums have great songs, but I like Automatic the best because most of the songs are great and it is the most rockin' Mary Chain album by far. The two throwaway songs are \\"gimme hell\\" and \\"sunray\\", but besides that, it is a strong album. \\"PsychoCandy\\" gets all the critics review but I can take only so much feeback; I need some real substance. \\"Darklands\\" was the first Mary Chain album that really caught me, and it's a good one with it's catchy melodic tunes.

End of story.There is no question that a reasonable album was cut in the studio and a bunch of remix jockeys massaged it into something that pandered to the lowest common denominator. Psychocandy had none of that and was a large commerical success - why the label decided that could not be replicated, I could not tell you.Muscially there are some very interesting elements in this work, but they have had all the rough edges sanded down. If you are looking for J&MC albums that are creative and push the edges of music, listen to Psychocandy and Munki.While I *do* enjoy listening to this album, keep in mind it is J&MC work in an \\"Elevator Music\\" warpper.Annoying and dissappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta kick it while it's on","review":"Bought nine records secondhand on Saturday and eight of them turned out to be the wrong trousers altogether--got so blame irritated with Flood by They Might Be Giants I snapped the bleddy thing in half and then, for good measure, in quarters.

The ninth album, this one, I actually own already but couldn't resist getting all over again. Love that U.V. Ray--reminds me of acting the maggot in Sunnyside in Queens for some reason.

Sadly, this product is substandard. How can you go wrong with an AC Adapter? Well, this one will not stay connected to any electrical outlet or extension cord. It is not wide enough so that when you plug it in you can't even do a minimal movement of the cord without it unfastening from whichever outlet is connected to. Additionally, it is not long enough; hence you end up inevitably pulling the laptop closer to you to use, and the cord follows. So you have to constantly plug it back in the outlet. Save your money. Don't even bother buying this, go for something else. It will save you plenty of aggravation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"A couple of months ago I ordered 24 QBQ!s for our bank. Our managers have sooooo enjoyed this book and have taken it back to their teams and are sharing it with them. The feedback I am receiving is incredible. I can tell you it made a huge difference for me and I passed my copy along to my husband who agrees. We have a daughter with special needs and it helped us to realize we can make a difference in her development if we will just ask The Question Behind the Question when it comes to working with her, the teachers, and her school. This book is making a difference in our home life and at the bank and we HAVE to keep the momentum going!!

The chapters consist of 'fortune cookie' sayings that are supposed to guide you into a more successful workplace. How about providing some substance so that readers can really delve into a topic, rather than just being presented with a headline. I 'read' this book in under an hour, and didn't come away with any real words of wisdom, other than to not recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more!","review":"I expected a lot out of this book. For me, the book seems to lack substance. While the topic is valid, and everyone needs to follow the intent of this book, the book itself is not a road map on how to get there. There are a couple of nice stories of people who go the extra mile, but if you are not one of those people already, this book is going to guide you to get there.The book came highly reccommended by Dave Ramsey, however, it did not live up to my expectations. Had the book been an article in a magazine, (it can easily be shortened to fit) it would have been worth the price of the magazine. The story was not ready for a stand alone publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"QBQ! does work!","review":"I am in the real estate/investment business and when I read QBQ! it changed completely for the better the way I think. I had been blaming my tenants/customers, property mgrs, the marketing dep't, etc. for my results and when I read QBQ! I sat down that night and asked \\"How can I be more effective?\\" and then set about writing out a new plan for my approach to my business. Since then things have improved greatly. The chapter on how I can only change myself has made me a better manager of my people, by far. The book took me an hour to read and then I went back through and re-read and highlighted. I take it wherever I go as it is such a practical message on personal accountability I can use it in all areas of my life. QBQ! deserves 5 stars ... maybe 6. I've read a ton of business books and QBQ! has made the difference for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wake-up call!","review":"I found John's book online when searching the term \\"execution\\" on Google. I was asked to read \\"Execution\\" the book to prepare for a presentation at work. As much as I tried, I just could not get through the book, even though I thoroughly agreed with the message. I decided to look for another book that offered a similar message. I read QBQ! twice in one evening! Not only did it help me create a fantastic presentation, if I must say so myself, it inspired me to contact John and ask him to present to my company. My group was \\"wow-ed\\"! The message is simple, yet people are so busy and challenged on the job and in their personal lives that pointing fingers and making excuses is easier than accepting the accountability of a situation. This book makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best business book I've read in 10 years","review":"QBQ! is a fun book and page after page gives practical advice and guidance for living accountably.

First off, this is a very thin, large font, tons of white space excuse for a book - there is very little to it and it isn't worth 5 bucks much less the list price of 20. The book is fluffy, trite and idealistic at best. The entire gist of the book is covered here in the Amazon description and all the value is there as well - no need to buy the book.

Maslow on Management is better for the types of ideas this author presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly trite","review":"Reading QBQ is not difficult. It can be done in less than two hours (time it takes to roll one's eyes included).The premise is that employees need to be responsible... for everything. If employees do not perform... it's their fault. The employer has no part in this. Employees need to stop making excuses, stop being lazy, stop procrastinating, stop pointing fingers, put up and shut up. Most important, employees need to stop asking questions. If they do ask questions, they need to answer it themselves by taking responsibility for their own impotence.This must be music to irresponsible managers ears that will be happy to hire the author to give two day courses. They have no part in it. It is the employees fault."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Prework for Any Organizational Change Effort!","review":"Any organization planning an organization-wide change effort needs to have every single one of their employees read this book. It's an amazing quick read, simple but powerful. It puts the responsibility and accountability into the hands of the individual. Once that shift is made, the change effort becomes easier and more effective. The book provides straightforward rationale and examples from the line level to the executive offices. No one should be exempt from practicing QBQ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Meat mixed with brevity and wit","review":"QBQ! really give some meaty solutions to the problems of blame, victim thinking, and procrastination. It's a quick read with short chapters which I just love. I am able to reread the book or just a few chapters and immediately go use the content on the job. It teaches how to ask questions that enable one to practice personal accountability and how to take ownership. It also makes me aware of what questions to not ask. So much that happens at work requires a response of accountability - not blame and finger pointing. Clearly we need our politicians to ready this book. Unlike many popular biz books that just provide parables and fictional story lines, QBQ! provides a tremendous \\"how to\\" so it can become part of my daily walk. The supporting stories are fun and real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"This was one of the best book purchases I have made in a long time. Easy reading, honest, and relatable. I would recomend this book to anyone looking to improve your personal accountability. It is funny after you read the book, you are able to pick the people out that have personal accountability and take ownership - with that said, you can also pick those people out who choose not to as well. Great investment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If it is to be, it's up to me!","review":"Personal accountability through the medium of questions is exquisitely executed in this timeless treasure. This is a book you will keep on your bookshelf for your children. This book earns 5 stars. Additionally, I strongly recommend Optimal Thinking: How To Be Your Best Self, another timeless, universal resource, which provides the questions necessary to be our best, maximize and situation, and bring out the best in others. By asking the best questions to invite the best answers, we can truly make the most of our careers and our lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"light reading for the airport","review":"The author is well intentioned, and apparently has a good training background behind him.But anyone who has been through any corporate training program knows that the trainers have a highlevel understanding of business operations, not a deep understanding of how to execute.There are no 'Wows' in this book only the meandering story tellings of someone with alot of miles under his belt...and a business to promote, QBQ.The book has simplisting examples and the writing style is pleasant, but void of any depth in business execution and analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst.","review":"This is one of the worst self help books I have ever read. It states that \\"QBQ works because it's based on the truth \\"I can only change me\\". This statement is a complete falsehood. While I am responsible for my actions, what I do can influence, and change, the behavior of others. In the new right-wing politically correct environment we are in this book might make people feel good, but it offers nothing in terms of new ways of thinking, tools one can use to improve oneself, or ways to figure out how to improve a process. It requires no effort and results in no paradigm shifts in thinking. It runs counter to most Lean Manufacturing ideas and methods if one is working in a production environment. Stick with \\"7 Habits of Highly Effective People\\" if you are really looking to do some soul searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"about 1 page of real material.","review":"i really don't know why people love this book so much. it has about 1 real page worth of advice, with the rest being stories and platitudes. it basically says that in all cases, even where other people clearly drop the ball, you should do your best. one other review that states \\"Basically this book tells how to blame yourself for what others fail to do\\" is exactly right. there's got to be a better way to approach the topic of accountability without being such a doormat."},{"rating":"1","title":"QBQ","review":"I found QBQ to be very elementary reading. I read the book in an hour and found a couple of tidbits worth remembering. I was very disappointed overall in the book. For a manager looking for ideas it was little more than trite, rah, rah material. Because of the ease of reading and time spent reading it, you may find it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice redirect from the blame game","review":"This book contains alot of common sense guidance on how to practice personal accountability. Like all books like this, your first instinct is to say \\"I need to give this book to my employees, spouse, brother, etc.\\" However, this book isn't about changing others, but about changing yourself, the one person whom you have any control over.I especially enjoyed the direction given on asking the right questions, often substituting \\"I\\" for \\"we\\", \\"you\\", \\"they\\", etc. This book gives good guidance on common sense leadership principles that I find especially useful which redirects you from the natural tendency to look for scapegoats rather than search for solutions, a common problem in many organizations.A very good little book that gives sound advice regardless who you are and what responsibilities you are faced with."},{"rating":"2","title":"QBQ! is a book you'll carry with you","review":"QBQ! is critical because in today's world there is too much finger pointing, and trying to shift the focus to someone else! This book is a fast read (about an hour max) and I keep it with me. I pick it up and refer to specific chapters to helps me with certain issues. QBQ! and its core content on Personal Accountability can, should and will help me solve 80% of the problems I face at work. It's a great, common-sense book, but we all know common sense is very uncommon. If we all took responsiblility for what we did, first thinking about how we would like to be treated in the same situation, we might be able to avoid other issues that crop up. I know I don't live it to my best potential every day, but with consistency, I try to do my best every day. When I make myself accountable for every thing I say and do, I get much better results in return."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about taking responsibility","review":"I did not like this book.

It isn't always easy with all the 'down on life' people that I come in contact with and all the horrible customer service that I encounter. Truthfully, I'd like to just carry around a box of QBQ books and hand them out every person that I come in contact with! I think that the whole world should read this book, if they did I think that we'd see some very positive changes around us and get rid of the blame and finger-pointing!

It had great real-life examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Reminder of Taking Action","review":"This book counters the prevailing mindset of blaming others in today's culture. Most people have witnessed when churches do poorly, whatever is judged to be poor, typically this is a decline in numbers or contribution, there is a mindset to look for the problem or person to blame. Often the mentality is to assign blame to someone or some group. Typically the elders will blame the minister, the minister will blame the elders, and around and around we go. This book deals with this issue of blame. Instead of asking who, we are to ask \\"what can I do to help the attendance, or \\"How can I be more evangelistic.\\" The book deals with taking responsibility for situations. The easy solution is to blame, the mature solution is to fix the problem yourself. This is a quick book to read, and the message is a great reminder to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"A great perspective on the world of personal accountability. We have purchased this for our teams to spread the message on accountability."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!!!","review":"This is a complete waste! Complete waste of time and money. This is for weak managers who are afraid to manage. The author wants managers to tell all of your subordinates, \\"Don't ask why\\". The message is do your job and don't worry when others (including managers) don't do their jobs! This is the type of training all worthless employees have been waiting for.If you follow this training, the next time you hear \\"Why\\" will be from your family member asking why did you company go out of business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive for what you get","review":"I read the entire book (super large print) in about an hour. It had some points of interest. (I bought this off Amazon based on the recommendations). But unless you're the type who'll go into a restaurant and put down $80 for a salad, move on. The whole book could be boiled down to one of those laminated placards leaving enough room left over for VCR programming instructions :). I'd say its worth $2 - $4. Sorry I can't recommend an alternative. On the more positive side, as I said it wasn't a COMPLETE waste of time but any 2 - 3 page article in a magazine would do as much. Not even, imho, a good Cliff notes type thing for those who just want to talk the talk.

It is written to the person reading it only which makes it very unique.I have the audio and it is just a bit over a hour long.The first time I read this book, I had the paper version. I sat down with a cup of coffee to read a few pages.The next thing I knew, i had finished the book in one setting and had made a knew pot of coffee.This book is designed for leaders, but it truly helps every single person who reads it. I also think it is a sanity protecter. It changes the out look on life.It is also one of those that when you loan it, it often does not come back:)I tend to order a few when i see a sale on them. I have given them to a friends with work problems or even going through a divorce then never ask if they read it. When time goes those people always tell me that book is a life changer.

I have to say it, they were awful! Yes the band is from Sweden and play horns... but so do a lot of bands before for them. They are unoriginal and not even good abstract art. The lead singer just stood there looking at the corner of the wall and attempting to sing - which sounded more like screaming. Everytime they paused between songs people said under their breath \\"thank God! please let that be the last one\\". Being very open to the arts and different things I decided to try their musical cd. Wow, not a difference in any sense. I would pass up on this band as this is going to be a one hit wonder if that. If you are looking for something similar I recommend Tilly and The Wall and Pony Up! from Canada.Blah to this band!! ugh.."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific.","review":"I have everything unlocked, tons of game play.

Generally speaking, I'm not a big fan of first/third person shooters.. that is unless the physics, controls, and gameplay are downright fun and then I give in. Syphon Filter ranks up there as one of the best games I have ever played. I know that's a tall statement.. but this is definitely one of the best PSP games on the market and the effort put into making this play so well on a portable unit is huge. Most easily said -- its fun. The control scheme lets you mimic dual-analog control by using buttons creatively while the menu and weapons interfaces are intuitive.

I knew the end less than halfway through so reading the whole thing was perfunctory. Luckily, it's fairly short. Instead of keeping me on the edge of my seat it had me sliding off as I struggled to not doze off. I know it's a classic, a trendsetter by a truly original and insanely successful author, but I'm sorry. I wasn't wowed. Perhaps I haven't made enough of an investment in her creation.

There are no flowery prose to be found in-between the covers of this mystery. It has been over 30 years since I read 'Murder on the Orient Express' while in high school and I still clearly remember the unusual outcome. But despite knowing the surprise ending, revisiting this classic and observing Ms. Christie's remarkable ability to place clues and red-herrings throughout made me appreciate her talents even more. As usual, another great, entertaining read by a master of the whodunit."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for a long train ride!","review":"I read this book on a long train ride and I enjoyed it. I find it very odd that this was the first book I ever figured out the ending to though. (the other odd part is that the second book I figured out was Murder of Rodger Ackroyd but the rest of the books I couldn't figure out) So my point is, I don't know if it's easy to figure out or if I just had a lucky guess, but either way it's worth the read. The setting and characters were interesting and for a lot of the book I was sitting there reading reasons that changed my suspects and then changed them back. This is defiantly one of better Christies books. Not my favorite but still very good. It really zips along."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Review","review":"This is a great book! If you have never read an Agatha Christie book before, read this and AND THEN THERE WERE NONE. It is very good and you have no clue who did it in the end.

From a Russian Princess to an English governess the train is filled with different classes, and nationalities. THe last thing he expects is a murder to take place. But when it dose, only he can find the killer. As Poirot shifts through the clues and interviews every member on the train he finds out the case is connected to a kidnapping mystery that took place in America year ago. Thus complicating things ever futhur. Can he solve the case? Or will the killer slip between his fingers.When I saw the book assigned to me on my summer Junior year British Literature reading list I was happy to actually get to read a decent book. And when I read it I was swept up in the mystery of things, trying to find the real killer myself. Poirot is an interesting and clever charecter.

I am a great fan of hers, but I have to say this book sort of dissapointed me. I found it boring. 18 chapters in total were all just Poirot interviewing the suspects. And I didn't find the end surprising at all. To me, there wasn't any climax, and all in all it was pretty boring. I really don't see why this book is so popular. Some of my favorites are Easy to Kill, And then there were none, and N or M."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder of Confusion","review":"Murder On the Orient Express was a story about a detective by the name of Hercule Poirot. While he was on a train going to London, a murder occurred, and he was asked to step in to try to solve it. With every person on the train a suspect, you'll never believe the twisted ending.My opinion of the book was that I didn't like it very much. The plot was simple, but it got confusing for me with all the different characters that were involved. It was difficult for me to understand, and keep everything straight. I most certainly didn't enjoy it. I would not recommend this book, unless you want to be bored to death."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite!","review":"Youll never find a book better than this.It is a masterpiece.The setting is awesome.The list of suspects is to die for.The suspects personalitys are also to die for.This is the best book of all books I have ever read.You wont want to miss this one.I could read it a thousand times and not get tired of it.The audio tape and movie are great too.Buy it and you will love this book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This was one of my favorites. The brilliant Hercule Poirot was at his best here, working to find the clever, ruthless killer.

The ending shocked me, and I'm sure you'll find it totally enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"bewildered","review":"amazing book. I love how poirot solves these challenging mysteries. He is able to find evidence that is out of the ordinary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Average Undertaking from the Master","review":"This particular mystery is actually a little slower and less engaging than other Christie novels. For one thing, the author gives Poirot an ascendant over the supposedly-expert medical examiner on board the train, making the doctor second guess himself a little too often (a nationality bias on Christie's part). Second, the victim is a hated man, making the murder less sensational, but the fact that the train is snowbound and that no one can escape the Express makes for a less-than-exciting notion that the killer is still on board (though everyone acts as if under sedation during their \\"enforced captivity\\"). As the mystery is unraveled, the entire truth appears on the instant, abruptly ending any suspense. This is my 2nd Christie mystery after \\"Death on the Nile,\\" a much more gripping book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder on the Orient Express: a great book","review":"The Murder on the Orient Express is a book that fascinates everyone who reads it. If you like suspicion and are curious, that book has a great story. On the trip in train Orient Express there are 14 people going to Paris and one person is killed and everyone becomes suspected. It is your job to go over the book and have a great time reading trying to find out who is the murderer. It is a very interesting book because after each chapter you will be changing your opinion about WHO DID IT? Hercule Poirot is a very good detective that was on the train. With his great strategies he reveals the real murderer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect place to start -","review":"This is the perfect place to start if you intend to read murder mystery books with any regularity. The story has been done in plays and movies and on TV for decades but it is only in reading it that you catch the early clues and nuances of the characters. Your knowledge is broadened to the allure of foreign languages and refined mannerisms of different nationalities.\\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is an easy read. The foreign expressions are brief and easily researched if one wishes to translate them. The descriptions of clothing, appearance, and behavior are easily visualized and not a hindrance to the flow and enjoyment of the narrative. Certainly I would recommend this book to eighth grade readers and up. Murder is a serious crime and in reading this story young readers become acquainted with the deductive and methodical system of reasoning. Education is advanced when \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" is required reading in class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a good read!","review":"After watching the different movie versions (repeatedly) of Murder On The Orient Express over the years, I finally got around to reading the book.

Hercule Poirot is suprised to see all the different nationalities on the orient express. A murder on the train was the last thing on his mind. But when it does happen he is the only one that can find out the real criminal. The only thing he can use is his brain and a couple of clues given to him by the passengers.

The cleverness with which Poirot solves this case at the request of M. Bouc is amazing. This was one of the first Christie's I'd read over 20 years ago, and it made me a fan for life.

But that does not matter. Hercule Poirot gets stuck on a train ride and then uses his exceptional cunning to find out just who did murder the man in the next room.The story is too far fetched, the reasoning so utterly incisive as to be unbelievable and yet its great because you turn the pages to find out what Poirot's thinking and not whether you were right.Great stuff, totally silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder on the orient express","review":"This is a must read!!!If you enjoy Agatha Christie and have not read Murder on the Orient Express you must buy it and give one for a gift.the story starts slow but the bilds up to be one of the best mysterys ever written.

I love Hercule Poiret, and Agatha Christie really had him jumping around in this book!

Breathes there a crime fiction fan with soul so dead that she isn't familiar with this story? Still, they call them \\"classics\\" for a reason, and Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express was one on publication in 1934. It was at that time an entirely new take on the locked room mystery, and the little gray cells of the Belgian detective with the magnificent moustaches are put seriously to the test.Must reading for any fan of the genre, and made into an iconic film in 1974 starring a host of instantly recognizable faces, including Albert Finney, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, and Ingrid Bergman, who won an Oscar for her performance.

The mirror and table top were damaged in the first unit, so I sent it back. Amazon.com was great about the return and replacement.The second unit had damage on the mirror frame and table top. Because the damage to the mirror frame was at the top, I kept the unit, and called the manufacturer for a replacement of just the table top. Just like the Cedar chest, it was crushed on one corner.I just received the replacement top, and it was damaged too. This company needs to review their packing department and procedures. I would never recommend them, even though their product is well made and lovely. Right now, the Console has a damaged Mirror frame and a damaged Table top, and I'm just so fed up I'm going to live with it.

Was admitedly expecting a somewhat lesser quality for the price (then $219), and was pleasantly surprised. I am a firm believer that you can tell the quality of an item just by how well it goes together during assembly, and this proved to be no exception; fit and finish were uniform and flawless; pieces fit together very well, with nice, tight tolerances. Instructions could have been better; the graphic images would have been better served if they were accompanied by some descriptive commentary, but we managed well enough.Arrived quickly, no damage to packaging or contents, no missing hardware (came with a few extra pieces, actually).

Definitely NOT worth $3 an issue!!! We expected sooooo much more from National Geographic.We gave it two stars because atleast there was some fun activities in the booklet.

Being a Blind Guardian fan as well, I think Hansi is great on track 9.On vocals? Well, Edu is becoming one of the best singers...it sounds very European on this cd... he is in on higher level.

Through all of the events that mark a lifetime, birth, marriage, family meals, coming of age, deaths, we see the quilt binding generation to generation.In simple black and white (and shades of gray!) illustrations which we have the feeling were actually photograhs, the quilt stands out again and again as the thing that gives each scene color.

I entered Dick Hyman and Scott Joplin in the Amazon search bar because I fell in love with the music of Scott Joplin because of the playing of Dick Hyman. Had I read closely enough I would have seen that this is not the Dick Hyman set I have on vinyl. Anyone else playing Joplin just sounds like a hack to my ears any more. The music is jumpy and bouncy, just like most other renditions of Joplin's work that I've heard. I hate to be critical, but my ears have been ruined for any other performer's work where Joplin is concerned. I listened to a bit of Mapel Leaf Rag just to be fair, but I know I'll never listen to the rest of this set.

I think the other reviews are far to critical of what I consider really good music, and really good recordings..And the price is too good to be true..Thank you Amazon and Richard Zimmerman."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for Pity","review":"My review in two statements: DON'T BUY IT. EVER.One star for pity - and for the effort of going to the trouble of learning Scott Joplin's complete works. I know it must have been quite a task getting the sheet music for these works and it must have been quite a task learning them, but I cannot honestly say that this is a good recording. Richard Zimmerman plays these works on a piano with bad quality sound, and he plays these works with his own embellishments and in his own style. If you're going to take liberties with a written score, you'd might as well not even try to play it at all. Either play it as written, or don't play it. Why can't people understand that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for pleasure","review":"You may want this just to have any recording at all of some of the otherwise unavailable pieces in this collection. But, this is the worst quality playing I've ever heard on a commercial recording. The marches actually aren't too bad, but anything syncopated is not played right. Zimmerman fat fingers notes in almost every piece (i.e. he hits adjacent notes). The dynamics and tempo are erratic. The attempts at ornamentation are forced. If you enjoy piano playing, you won't enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I have to agree with \\"A music fan\\" is his review of March 2003.The piano used is poor, and not even all that well in tune. The recorded sound quality is muffled and 'processed'-sounding.And the playing, I am afraid, is an insult to Joplin. What a pity to produce so full a set, and to do it so badly. A travesty.If you want a superb Joplin set, played \\"as wrote\\", on a good concert grand and played with verve and style, and well-recorded, it's got to be the new Guido Nielsen 4 CD set on the Basta label (Basta 30-91262).For a really fine single CD recorded on a top-notch piano and with playing that brings out all the elegance in Joplin's music (which it isn't wrong to do - Joplin put it in there), try the new Naxos CD played by Alexander Peskanov (Naxos 8.559114).The Zimmerman set, I am afraid, must be consigned to the dustbin. A pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"Unfortunately, I must agree with the negative assessments of this product. The artist playing the pieces does not do justice to Joplin's style or flair. Many pieces are way too slow, muddy, and even missing notes that are generally heard in a well-played rendition. I bought this second hand, and even at that lower price, I don't know that the money was worth it. I would suggest that you look elsewhere if you wish to find a good example of Joplin's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"what ??????","review":"what cd were you people listening to, this is one of the worst albums yet. i have been listening to them for many years. i love the melvins, but really when are they gonna put out a serious album again. like ozma or gluey. get one of those or bullhead or lysol."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One of my favorites by the Melvins\\"","review":"A must for all Melvin fans!

I liked watching him in a different role than he normally portrays. Keanu convinced me that he was truely a versatile actor in this movie. It shows that he can be more than just a hottie but, he can also be a little crazy. I am also a big fan of James Spader. He was most certainly impressive in the movie because he had to use his brain, and he was quick on his feet but, Keanu was just a little bit quicker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best of movies, but A for effort!","review":"I went into the theater expecting to see a total clunker. But I was pleasantly surprised. Not by the movie on a whole, but the individual performances were pretty damn good.My instant reactions to the commercials were: Keanu Reeves and James Spader in a movie? Keanu playing a bad guy? I am *so* there! And I'll tell you, although the movie is not fast moving, and not that action packed, it was quite enthralling.The commercials dressed the movie up as Keanu's character, Griffin, stalking his victims for awhile...maybe dating them, and then murdering them. But in the movie, it is not that way at all. Must less intimate you'll find, his real reason for killing is for the attention it brings him of Spader's F.B.I. agent, Campbell. His true obsession is not with murdering, but with the one trying to arrest him.Good performances from Reeves, and as always, with the consistently excellent Spader.

I found it to be garbage. Keanu played Keanu. Dull, dull, duller. And what a stinker way to end a film. Ever notice how serial killers in these types of movies want to get caught, try to get and at the end of the movie, get caught?? The director of this movie had this meticulous serial killer who planned everything out. Then, the killer becomes sloppy and any old girl would do. Garbage.

You know who the killer is (Reeves), and you know that he will be brought down by the \\"intelligent\\" officer (Spader), the real question is only that of how long is it going to take to catch him. This film is done in a way that makes it painfully dull to watch. We have seen all of these scenes of violence in other movies, but in the other movies they were done more tastefully. The real truth is that Reeves does not make a great villian. He may be torturing these women, but all you can help to think is that you saw him in Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. You do not want to see Bill, or was he Ted, strangling a woman. You do not want to see anyone doing that. We, the movie going public, have seen these formulaic acts of violence committed numerous times, by now they just lose any merit and originality. This film should have tried to be original.

For one thing, it's way to short! I can literaly read it in fifteen minutes, and all the best parts of the movie are left out. The writing is also undiscriptive, boring, and it doesn't show the character developement that was in the movie. Even when I first read this book at ten years old I thought it wasn't that good, but now truthfully the only interesting part is the pictures from the movie stuck in the middle. Younger kids eleven and under, for whom this book is intended for, might not mind this, and it is a good start for young readers who want to get into reading Star Wars, but older fans probably won't like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy - Dont Waste Your Money","review":"When I originally purchased this tape I was admittedly unaware of the range of fine line tapes out there. Once it arrived it worked OK the first time I used it, but immediately started to warp and fold around the reel it came on. This warping caused the edges to crinkle and essentially make the tape useless.After taking a trip to my local painters supply store I got a better look at the range of products out there. I learned that the leading edge of your fine line tape is everything when it comes to painting strait lines. Sadly this tape didn't even compare to \\"the real\\" line of 3M fine line tapes.Don't waste your money on this. Buy the dark blue or lime green 3M fine line tapes. The quantity is double and the quality doesn't even compare to this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scotchlite...","review":"For some reason when you search for \\"black scotchlite\\" whether by google or on Amazon you get taken to this item.

Well, apparently the company doesn't have very good quality control as my unit arrived (2 days late I might add) with the holes for the support screws out of alignment. I managed to still get the support beams attached but when I went to attach the console, the alignment was off by 1-2 inches making it impossible to complete assembly. If the unit had actually been assembled at the factory and tested (company said it was, but there is no way) they would have caught this. Also, the console is very cheaply made and I could see it cracking and the electronics wearing out in no time. I'd look elsewhere before buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value Rating 4+","review":"I recently bought this unit.

I find French Rap to be thousands of times better then American rap. The Rap flows and the ryhmes are smooth. Even if you don't like Rap in general, try French Rap, its far better. Another thing I really enjoy about French Rap is that many of the songs, if you understand the French (which you will if you listen to them enough), are actually coherent and meaningful narratives...Doc Gyeneco's album grooves, and is simply addictive. His voice is unique in the field of Rap. I LOVE IT. Write me for any questions about Doc Gyneco or French Rap...Some of my other favorite French Rap artists include...IAM, MC SOLAAR, NTM, Massilia Sound System, MANAU, also many compilation albums....please check them out!

There is NO communication between the two lead men, and all the conversations between Johan and his boyfriend are in a foreign language. (With no subtitles!)

The pacing is s-l-o-w; the film-to-video transfer is wretched; the dialogue (in multiple languages) is trite; even the nudity and simulated sex are boring.

It was dissappointing to see most beautiful men having sex, but without showing their erected pride. Maybe I was informed badly, but I also found that the video had a very, very slow story.

The book reaffirmed what I already knew, that we are to focus not on speaking in tongues but on expressing love and praise for Jesus. Speaking in tongues will come as an evidence of having received the fulness of the Spirit. As a former missionary to Ivory Coast, West Africa I can testify to the essentiality of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit in dealing with demonic forces, as well as an increase in power in bringing deliverance (Divine Healing) to the sick.Surely Father Bennett was used of God to bring a fresh renewal to our understanding of Charismatic gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Journey","review":"It seems at first that Dennis Bennett simply stumbled onto the experience of the Baptism in the Holy Spirit.

I show it every year to my high school freshmen just before the Scripps National Bee. They moan and groan at first. (It is, after all, a documentary.) But by the end they have particular favorites--and we are all on the edge of our seats watching the final competition. Good stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbound","review":"The crowd-pleasing quality of \\"Spellbound\\" comes from the likeability of the eight kids featured, and the laudable values of self-discipline and self-improvement reflected in the parents' encouragement and coaching of their gifted progeny. Part of the fun, too, is trying to guess which of these word wizards--a boy from rural Missouri, an African-American girl from Washington D.C., a precocious child of privilege from suburban Connecticut--will triumph, but visibly agonized, socially awkward Harry Altman, from New Jersey, is the film's de facto icon. \\"Spellbound\\" will jangle your nerves and charm your socks off."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating","review":"This movie follows eight children as they prepare for and compete in the 1999 National Spelling Bee. What is most interesting about the film is to see the differences in economic and academic resources, family support and pressure, and individual talent and motivation and what impact these have in each student's outcome.For anyone who has competed in spelling bees at any level, this shows what your competition would have been in the big leagues. It's is both humbling and inspiring.A fascinating insight into the lives of tremendously diverse and talented children and their parents.The DVD includes updates of where the children are now as well as profiles of three additional contestants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!!","review":"It is hard for me to express how much I loved this movie. I'm all for escapism, drama, or eye candy in movies. However, this film is a perfect example of how the experiences of real people can be just as compelling. The kids each have distinct personalities and differing reasons for participating in the National Spelling Bee. Watching them interact with their family, and discuss what the competition means to them is charming. Hearing the expectations of the parents is at times amusing, other times infuriating. Once you get to the actual competition in Washington, you feel for these kids so much that it ends up being nerve-wracking and intense even for the theater audience. If you see one movie this summer, don't make it another soulless special-effects behemoth. Spellbound is where the real drama is to be found."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST ENDEARING FILM AROUND!","review":"This documentary is the sweetest and funniest I have ever seen! If you're feeling a tad blue, or just in the mood to laugh - this is a MUST SEE! The filmmaker tracts the trials and tribulations of brilliant children and their families in search of the National Spelling Bee championship. You'll be amazed at the effort and dedication these children put forth as they make sacrifices to be the best speller they can be. If children in our country are truly this earnest and talented - our world is surely in very good hands!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Movie","review":"The other reviews have pointed out effectively that this is a wonderful movie. I'd just add that Amazon's \\"Better Together\\" idea/deal to get both this and also the movie \\"Mad Hot Ballroom\\" is a good idea. They're both great movies, and if you like one you'll probably like the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life Drama","review":"Watching a movie about 250 junior high students attempting to spell words most of us have never heard of sounds crazy, but Spellbound does just what a good documentary should do - it perfectly captures the drama, tension, and emotions of these contestants and their families.As a parent of a three-time contestant in the National Spelling Bee, I can assure you that this movie really does capture the intensity of the event. From competing in local, regional, and the National Bees, it shows it all. \\"I won the school bee last year. What if I goof and fail?\\" \\"I won the regional bee last year. Everyone expects me to repeat. What if I get a word I don't know?\\" \\"Now that I made it to Washington, will I do better than last year?\\" The trememdous pressure on the spellers, both internal and external, shows through in this film. You will find yourself cheering for each speller as the field is whittled down from 250 to only one winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisngly Intense!","review":"Unlike the overrated, puffed up Akeelah and the Bee, this simple documentary of kids competing for the national championship triumphs at capturing the desires, sentiment and drive of the children and even some of the parents. After being introduced to each child and becoming familiar with his background and homelife, I began waging bets within myself as to who would come out on top.As the particpants begin to falter, the film becomes quite intense. This is a terrific film to watch as a family. Some of these kids are great role models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film!","review":"Film is wonderfully done and is a great documentary.

This family I mean is not only the factory owners but all the workers and the public included. The family is slowly degenerating and the author is performing this topic in all ways of degenerating in the scene. The setting is the beginning of 20th century. As a summary; a grandfather who adores work and builds a factory from nothing, a father who doesn't care about anything, and his son trying to find a way to escape from work."},{"rating":"2","title":"MR SAKAMOTO ENCHANTES...","review":"This is a classical-music flavored CD from the talented \\"cool\\" Japanese musician Sakamoto known for the soundtrack he has written for \\"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\\".

Listen to the wonderful renditions of movie themes \\"Sheltering Sky\\" and \\"High Heels\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless perfection","review":"I will say it: Ryuichi Sakamoto is a genius! There. I said it. If you need proof of it, \\"1996\\" is it.Sakamoto's influence and influences are so vast, they are hard to fully grasp. Pulling in from Japanese as well as from Brazilian, from Jazz and Bossanova as well as from Classical music, he's scored numerous movies for directors of the stature of Bertolucci, Almodovar, Stone and De Palma and he's collaborated with the likes of Bowie, Sylvian, Caetano Veloso and Bill Laswell among others, along the way.\\"1996\\" compiles newly arranged pieces by the Japanese maestro that will blow you away with their serene beauty and timeless quality. If I had to pick a favorite track in here, it'd have to be \\"Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence\\" but the truth is all tracks are impeccable in terms of content and execution. Ten years after its original release, the album sounds as perfect as it did in 1996."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only reason to buy this is for the music!","review":"This is a very bad video. A weak plot about hospitals and machines trying to kill patients and a lack of sympathetic characters explains why this was not given a theatrical release and went straight to video. David McCallum turns in a good performance, but he is wasted on a weak script. The best thing about this is the music, by Shadows drummer Brian Bennett, which heightens suspense where applicable and keeps well into the background at other times. There is also a quiet, romantic theme. The score was re-worked as a Shadows track for album release, but the better version is on this video. one for collectors only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hoping for details about being a commercial pilot. What I got was like a memoir written for a few close friends. The author repeatedly mentions names of pilots with whom he flew and their personality quirks...as though that might be meaningful to everyone who picked up this book.Another irksome quality: the author thinks all of American's problems are traceable to right-wing Christian fanatics, and for some reason, he, out of nowhere, launches into a tirade against these folks. Along the way, we find out that he's all for polygamy and sleeping around since most societies in the world do it that way.Again, I was expecting a book devoted to flying. There is some of that in there...sadly, not enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackwell Companion to Social Work","review":"Davies has compiled a series of articles discussing the social work profession, its place in society, the frameworks or context of social work, the human life cycle, reasons for social work and theory and method.

Picture quality is amazing on HD-DVDs and the upconversion ability makes some standard DVD's look like they are HD. The load times are not near as bad as some claim. The wait is really a non issue, since I am in no immediate rush to start watching a movie. I think I can wait a few extra seconds. Toshiba has already come out with a few firmware upgrades and fixed many of the initial problem issues some had. If you want the best quality picture on your HD display. This is it.

If you can get one, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for value(Hd -DVD)","review":"Now the picture and sound is awesome, I mean that what is expected with a new generation of DVD correct. The best part is the value $499.99 for early adapters is awesome compared to the competition blue ray which is $999.99. The only difference is blue ray hold more data for an extra $500.00. If you own an Xbox 360 and can wait another 6 months there is an HD DVD add on that will cost about $150.00 - $200.00 so that good two. The disk holds about 30 gig 45 max so there will soon be the entire Star Wars trilogy on just one disk! Awesome! Now the HD DVD can do 1080i blue ray can do 1080p, which is like grapes, to grape juice there is no real difference at all. If you are used to looking at HD pictures you know what I mean. There is a lot of hype behind the two formats but I think HD DVD is the best way to go for cost and brand honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Blue Ray","review":"I also was going to sit on the fence but like another reviewer, I have a new 1080P TV and I was anxious to see how good a movie could look on it. I had no problems whatsoever with my Toshiba. It had 1.4 but the load time was no problem whatsover for me and the rented (Netflix) HD movies never paused, skipped or refused to play. Quite a value to be sure. I can still remember going to Best Buy and hearing a salesperson put down HD DVD in favor of Blue Ray. If you are one that believes what a person trying to sell something says without doing some type of homework, I pity you. Blue Ray tripped and fell at the starting gate.

Sony wanted it all and lost out, having to work it out with Toshiba and join their DVD parade.Now, years later, Sony wants it all again. They want control over the next generation high def DVD format, so we now have a format war.Toshiba's first HD-DVD player is great! It's up-conversion of standard DVD is the best I've seen and the actual HD-DVD image is fantastic. The best HD picture quality I've ever seen.I'm sure Blu-Ray will be great as well. It's just too bad that this format war is on. But I'll tell'ya, at half the price of the cheapest Blu-Ray player, buying HD-DVD is a no brainer.Would you want to spend $1000.00 on the Sony or Samsung Blu-ray player and get no movies, or the Toshiba HD-DVD player and get 25 HD-DVD movies for the same price?Blu-ray might have Sony's Columbia Pictures locked up but HD-DVD has Universal Picture's and Dreamworks saying they are going HD-DVD only.Yes, it's a war."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Defining Moment In Home Entertainment!!","review":"I have owned this player for 2 months now and it is a AMAZING piece of machinery.The player is slower than a standard dvd player but after you see the picture you will never care about load times again.Toshiba has been nothing short of top notch with costumer service, with already 3 firmware upgrades to date!If you have a HDTV starved for HD content you need this player! I could go on all day about how HD DVD is better than Blur-ray but most of us who have done our research know that Blu Ray is all about broken promises and greed.

It looked flawless, even better than how the store demo unit looked. By comparison to seeing blu-ray in action, HD DVD completely blows it away. Unfortunately, the player I bought had a glitch that caused the hdmi port to fail. Returned and exchanged it, and my second unit works flawlessly. I've had a couple of the lockup problems, although none ever during playback. Its just a matter of turning off, unplugging, then replugging and turning the unit on again. I guess thats the price to pay for such wonderful technology as an early adopter, but I wouldn't give this thing up at all. It works wonderfully as an upscaling dvd player. If you're considering an upscaling dvd player, just spend the extra few hundred and buy this. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cluncky","review":"The pause option doesn't work very well.

This new techonlogy is the last puzzle to get perfection in the home theater experience. First was the sound and now is the image what matters.HD DVD even comes with a new sound definition (Dolby Digital Plus )I do think that this player is very solid, it delivers what was offered by Toshiba and even if your HDTV is small you will still enjoy the picture you will get, but you might need to sit closer to the screen if the set is not too large.The bad thing about the unit is the Remote control, but I guess you will fix it by getting a universal one.Some folks will complaint to much about how slow is to start and load a movie.

I hope you enjoy yours either now or later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Adopting","review":"Don't get me wrong, staying on the cutting edge of technology affords bragging rights and gobs of ear and eye candy, however the exterior of this unit looks like it was manufactured in the 1980's.

I think I will return mine and wait for a true HD DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage","review":"This player is a complete piece of garbage. Not ready for prime-time, but it was still rushed to the market. While the picture quality is excellent (when it successfully plays DVDs) as you would expect with the HD-DVD format, it takes up to *2 minutes* to load up a DVD and start playing it. Just performing a power-up boot takes at least a minute. In addition it does not play DVD+R discs. In many cases it would not play any disc you insert into it and required several reboots to play it correctly. I returned mine immediately and instead got a Denon 1080p-upconverting player and am happy with the picture quality.Bottom line: Toshiba's HD DVD players are not yet ready for prime-time. Besides, with the annoying fact that there are 2 competing formats for hi-def DVD (VHS vs Betamax all over again) I am going to wait until HD-DVD or Blu-Ray is declared the winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy it, waste of money","review":"the other comments listed under 1 star are correct, it is a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"For early adopters only","review":"If you are dying to see HD movies on a disk (I was), it's a good price to get into the HD-DVD game. On the other hand, the remote is awful, and you have to wait 1-2 minutes after you hit the pwoer button before a disk is played. Also, if you want to use Dolby Digital 5.1 you are out of luck, as the AD-H1 only outputs DTS over its optical output. For most people, I would recommend waiting for other players before making the leap.For die-hard picture quality fans, the image IS fantastic, and if you can live with the other problems, you will be happy...although blacks and whites are clipped over HDMI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Breed","review":"In terms of current High Definition Players, The Toshiba HD-A1 is the best player for your money. The Picures are pristine and pop and the player does an excellent job of upconverting standard DVD's.The only gripes i have is the somewhat slow load time (appx 60 seconds)Rant:The HD DVD format is far superior to blu-ray at this current juncture due to many problems with sony's inability to produce their single layer media with any yield consistency. Also they are using a less than efficient compression format that produces images that are not up to HD DVD standards. Why spend double with blu ray when you can get a better image with HD-DVD. Until blu ray they can show that they have fixed all of their problems, HD-DVD is your best bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toshiba A1 HD-DVD upconverting DVD player","review":"In August I purchased the Toshiba HD-DVD player. Not only do HD-DVDs look great, but ALL DVDs look great. I would rank both HD and SD (standard definition) DVDs as superior in picture quality to HD-TV channels. This is because of the upconversion ability which converts 480i standard definition DVDs to 1080i. Even though HD-TV channels broadcast in either 720p or 1080i,their signal is still compressed and often \\"noisy\\". I recently viewed theremastered Blade Runner, an SD disc upconverted to 1080i by my player, and it looked fantastic---the best version of Blade Runner I've ever seen.

This is a boring movie, a boring...boring...BORING MOVIE!!!!!!Limited budget? Obviously. Not because of a lack of special efx, but because of lack of talented actors.That being said, the actors didn't have much to work with because the character development was sorely lacking as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man this film sucks","review":"There isn't much to say about this movie.

I was delighted to have found it on Amazon! It didn't disappoint - Wolfe, Archie, Fritz and Inspector Cramer were all there, in rare form, as usual. I read and reread my Nero Wolfe mysteries all the time. Rex Stout was a literary genius, using big words that I sometimes I have to look up, plot lines to keep anyone interested, and a large dose of humor. I would recomend this book, as well as any Nero Wolfe mystery by the incomperable Rex Stout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Surf music, like punk and ska, is a very limited genre and most will end up getting annoyed and thinking that the music sounds too much the same. These are the same people who inexplicably hate Creed because 'all the songs sound the same', not because its bad. But if you like old Sci-Fi movies and or Mystery Science Theater 3000 (which Man or Astroman wrote the theme music for) then you will at listen enjoy a listen or two of any of Man or Astroman's stuff. Almost every track opens with some music or phrase from an old sci-fi movie. It's good stuff but can, admittedly, get a bit old after too many repeated listenings."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive debut","review":"Working in the same B-movie, sci-fi vein as Devo, Man or Astro-Man? has married this junk-culture appetite to the surf instrumental genre with the help of samples from movies, commercials, and even (on \\"Invasion of the Dragonmen\\") an album of Spider-Man stories. Well-chosen samples and excellent surf compositions make this a must-own album."},{"rating":"1","title":"well, OK...","review":"Yet another carbon-copy Man Or Astroman album. This band is quite prolific, and this album, while certainly not a bad one, will suffice as the MoA album of your choice. The band can play with a lot of energy, and they've always been tight, but the pitfalls still exist: lack of variety in tempos and keys, the one-song-represents-the-whole stigma, and of course, the pretentious TV-spacemen schtick, which is getting pretty old at this point. I would suggest, as an alternative, Shadowy Men On A Shadowy Planet, a Canadian instrumental/surf band with far more variety, whose creativity is stronger on the musical side, rather than the image. Not a bad record, this one, albeit generic, been done before, and been done better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"Angelique Kidjo is a great artist--I love her music.

This textbook is like a conglomeration of hundreds of research publications, instead of an introductory textbook. It would explain one topic after another without giving the reader a larger view of what all of this means in context to answering big biology and psychology questions. The paragraphs and sections were needlessly long and wordy. Instead of presenting easily accessible information, the author surrounded every fact with long-winded explanations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized!

My son is only 9 years old and he doesn't need to read things like that.

This leads to serious consequences, but who cares? Catastrophe scenarios sell well and the misinformation disseminated to an unsuspecting public is not something the author will be accountable for. When writers without scientific training or comprehension take on complex issues such as global warming, the result tends to be a calamity as exemplified by this volume. It should be listed under 'fiction'.There are several excellent new books available on the topic, such as 'Global Warming in a Politically Correct Climate' and 'Geological Perspectives on Global Climate Change', both of which provide a scientifically correct view - even if it may not be politically correct. Science, thankfully, provides the truth of the matter irrespective of what is politically acceptable.It differentiates between objective reason and pure advocacy based on little knowledge an no scientific insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and Politically Motivated","review":"With a PhD in atmospheric optics and 25+ years developing atmospheric models, I know something about the subject.

Our world is going to dramatically change, no matter what we do. We can affect the degree of change, if we choose to act. Gelbspan discusses why the issue of climate change (global warming) has gotten the media spin that it has and what the consequences of that has been on awareness of the issue. Thanks to people like him, we \\"regular folks\\" can have input into how to handle the crisis, because we know that we must act now. Otherwise the people in the \\"smoke filled back rooms\\" of politics will decide to tell us what \\"we have to do\\" in a climate-derived emergency.

These radios did not exceed 1 mile. When in range the voices are clear. I have an older pair of Motorola 2 mile radios with multiple sub channels. The Motorola's have a true 2 mile range.

The first problem is that the 10 mile range is an absolute lie. I get about 1/2 mile with them, that's it. How in the world they get away with advertising 10 miles I'll never know since I can't even get 1 mile with them. The second problem is that it eats batteries like crazy. One day out with moderate talking and you'll need to replace the batteries (3 AAA each, which ain't cheap).

Being an animal lover, I appreciated the care with which the author described the horses, and how much personality they had; they were an actual part of the story, rather than just beasts of burden (this is true to one extent or another of all her writing). I also appreciated the fact that while she included a romance, sex wasn't particularly present. I get tired of some fantasy authors who seem to think that if they throw enough sex in, it compensates for lacks such as plot, character development, or action; also authors that just plain write it in all the time. Finally, she had a somewhat original and creative idea; others have written about animals becoming people or vice versa, but none that I've ever read had as much realism in that description, or as much consideration of what that would actually mean for the individual involved (especially if it is an animal becoming human). All in all, I loved this book and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELENT story line, writting needs work.","review":"I ABSOLUTY loved the story, very engaging and powerful.

The special effects of this movie are spectacular. Amazing.The special edition DVD is almost as good as seeing it in the theatre. The added features of the DVD are great too. A new ending is included on the bonus disk, I won't ruin it for you, but it is great. The behind the scenes stuff is good too.One thing I would have never believed though is that Will Smith is almost beleivable as a hot-shot pilot, and Bill Pullman, yes the guy from Spaceballs, pulls off being the President.

Like when they give the aliens' computer a virus? Imagine the aliens running the same operating system as us! Or after they shoot the first ship down, wouldn't the aliens figure it out and prevent it? The list goes on and on.

I would recommend it for entertainment walue, but if you are looking for a demo picture material, look elsewhere. get some other movies with equal mayhem and destruction. like 2012. which looks extremely crisp"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Independence Day is by far the best Sci-fi movie that they have come out with in a long time. I can watch it repeatedly without getting board. The director did an excellent job of keeping your interest and moving the movie along at a good pace. The movie just flys by for me. It's also not a highly gross or graphically intense movie. It's not a scary movie at all. I would recommend this movie to all fans of movies in general, not just the sci fi crowd. This is a must see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiences watched because everyone was watching it","review":"Independence day relies on special effects to get by it has no story line of what so ever. I really don't about anyone else but I love to watch a film that makes sense and you just watch a story not one of these rediculous special effects movies where you are there so you can get you eyes flashed and become hearing impaired. Everyone once again copies everybody who saw this movie the only reason why it made so much money is because your next door neighbor was watching it so you felt like you had to see it to. People were forced into theatres by there friends and family probably because they wanted to be cool and say that they viewed this movie. I saw this flop and I think it stinks when I watched it I got bored and got irritated with the actors in the movie. Will Smith thinks he is the coolest thing in the movie and he just laughing to the bank for his paycheck and so are the other characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proud to be human...?","review":"This must be one of the worst movies ever. Maybe it's because I hate Will Smith, maybe it's because I don't want to watch anything that makes me proud to be human! I just don't have words for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD, VERY BAD","review":"This movie was not made for artistic purposes thats for sure. It is just really bad. The effects are tiresome, the dialogue is uninspired, there is too much humour and why does AMERICA have to win all the time? No offence. It's just a little up setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Independence Day - Blu-Ray","review":"I am replacing my Laser Disk version.

I play with Samsung BDP-1400."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Cheese--In the best possible way","review":"This is without a doubt one of the cheesiest Sci-Fi movies I have ever seen+that is precisely what makes it so enjoyable. There are holes in the plot big enough to drive a starship thru,yet the film somehow allows you to ignore them+still have fun. Aliens travel millions of light years to destroy Earth+Jeff Goldblum brings them down w/a virus from his laptop--dont these people have Norton? The performances are excellent given the material--one of the reasons this film works is that the actors do not take themselves or the film that seriously. Bill Pullmans grand Independence Day speech is so hammy it should come w/a slice of pineapple. My advice is very simple:Turn your brain off+enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've got a cold!","review":"Fun visuals. One star. Fun sound. One star. I can barely get a Mac to talk to a PC. We beat the aliens by using a computer virus? Uh huh. Why not give them a human virus? It would work as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound quality is horrible","review":"I loved ID4 in the theater, and have been anxiously awaiting the DVD release. My poor rating is not for th film itself, but for the production of the DVD. The sound is mixed oddly. When something blows up, or jets fly, the sound is QUIETER than when people are talking. These effects should be louder. If you turn up your system to hear the effects the way you would like to, the next scene in which people are just talking ends up being way too loud. I guess the movie was mixed this way to prevent TV speakers from popping, but I have a mid-to-high-end system, and this just really bites. I was so disgusted with the sound that I turned off the movie, and will be returning the DVD to Best Buy for a refund (hopefully). I observed this same effect on the movie Event Horizon"},{"rating":"1","title":"War of the Worlds this isn't.","review":"Here is another example of a movie that can be mildly diverting despite its single-minded desire to pluck the brain right out of its audience's collective head. Big, loud, and VERY dumb, Independence Day does have some pretty cool aliens and some decent spfx scenes. However, it has so many lame one-liners that we are left to ponder whether we are watching a sci-fi flick or Amateur Night At the Apollo. Good actors are wasted in roles that are sketchy and cliched at best. The score is pretty bad as well; all noise and no emotion. Its sad to see so much money wasted on something so lousy. Perhaps films like this exist solely to entertain. Maybe the critics should just lighten up, shut off their brains and enjoy. But, then again, maybe we, as an audience, should stop pouring our time and cash into movies that are slapped together without a trace of thought or creativity. This is definitely one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Great movie with good effects but one of my favorite scenes is the one with Vivica Foxx showing that nice backside of hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A classic piece of c#&%","review":"I really don't know why this stupid movie is often referenced as great. It is so bad and unbelievable- even if you did believe in aliens- that it should only be remembered as embarrassingly bad. I suppose that it pushes the right stupid buttons that gets the fools going. I'll be better off with never hearing of this movie for the rest of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOA!","review":"THIS IS REALLY AWESOME SCIENCE FICTION FILM I EVER SEEN. I LIKE THE PART WHEN ALIENS TRY TO DESTROY THE EARTH AND THE AIR FORCES BATTLE THEM FOR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE DAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"An updated \\"War of the Worlds\\".","review":"After viewing Independence Day, I was amazed by how many similarities it shares with The War of the Worlds. Both are about a devastating attack launched against The Earth by other world beings. Both show mans vulnerability when his most powerfulweapons, even nuclear bombs are useless. Additionally the invaders from both movies even use a force field to protect their fighting craft. There are other likenesses, but I'll not reveal them all.The casting director did a grand job of picking the players. Iespecially enjoyed Randy Quade as an alcoholic crop duster andRobert Loggia as a gruff army general. All in all performances were quite good.I felt that what really gave the movie a crucial boost were the dazzling special effects portraying the distruction of major cities. This was complemented by David Arnolds stirring music.They don't make 'em like this anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Special Effects and Great Special Effects and er, um..","review":"This supercharged War of the Worlds ripoff is worth seeing just for the special effects. It's the only reason to watch it. The acting is cartoonish at best, the plot twists and turns are absolutely ludicrous, the science is so way off it's comical. But, the really spooky thing about this 1996 movie, is the Empire State building being blown up, and people running through the streets away from the explosion. It presages (unintentionally of course) 9-11 and the Twin Towers.Watch that scene, and remember the news videos about the Twin Towers. It's unsettling, that a piece of directorial drek like Independence Day, can bring about strong emotional reactions, not because of its inept screenplay, but because it accidentally showed us a vision of a terrible future incident that would Really take place five years in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbest movie ever made?","review":"A movie by and for mental midgets. Stupid, illogical, and without a bit of concern for suspension of disbelief. I seriously wonder if a six year old didn't write the script. This movie's not just retarded, but also plain obnoxious, with all the oh-so-cool one-liners and oh-so-hip witticisms demanded by snotty teen-agers and truck-loving rednecks. One of the worst sci-fi movies ever made. If memory serves, the person responsible for this ultra-stupid stinkbomb has also assaulted us with 'Stargate' and 'Godzilla'- two other mind-bogglingly stupid movies. If Ed Wood were alive today, these are the sort of movies he would make. The creators of 'ID4' need to be hunted down and punished in some way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray Review","review":"Boycott Blu-Rays that do not come with Speacial Features like the Standard DVDs do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was thrilled to finally be able to watch this movie with the best sound available.But to my dismay, the info was incorrect. There is no DTS audio track on this version. It's the same old version we've seen available a half dozen dips before. Fox needs to release this this with a DTS track and Amazon needs to keep their info correct and up to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of the Blu-ray - NOT the movie.","review":"The film is probably the ultimate \\"B\\" Sci-Fi movie of all time. Growing up in the 60s I watched its predecessors from the 50s with endless enthusiasm (and still appreciate them). So, despite its \\"flaws\\" I love the movie.The Blu-ray edition of the movie is a different story. The promise of the Blu-ray medium is betrayed in this release since it includes only the regular theatrical release and NOT the extended version that is available on DVD or any other goodies. Why on earth NOT have both versions on the 50GB BR disc?Worse still is that finding this out - for me at least - was at the cost of buying the Blu-ray version.The film does look great on Blu-ray but since I have to keep my 2 disc DVD edition to have both versions I won't be able to streamline my collection and I'm not happy about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lenticular Rip off Do not get OUT FOXED","review":"This is a disgrace Lenticular means a different box cover. this is the first version of the movie.

With a 1080 122\\" screen, it's painfully evident: you can pause the movie and watch the entire picture bob up and down two or three pixels by scanning forward frame-by-frame. The shot where the shadow crosses the World Trade Center is a big offender, but you can even see it during the closing credits. It's almost as if the projector that was used to do the transfer couldn't hold the picture steady from one frame to the next. I have another 20th Century Fox movie that does this during the opening Fox fanfare (Ice Age), but the movie itself is perfectly fine since each frame there is computer animated. Movies from other distributors seem to be fine, but watching this one on a large home theater screen can quickly get annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie without chemistry","review":"What do Will smith,jeff goldblum,judd hersh and bill pullman all have in common?Absolutely nothing,so why are they all cast in this movie together,who knows?Sure it has some spectacular special effects moments,but that doesnt save this dryed out plot and a cast who has seemed to be picked out of no where.All fine actor's in there own way,but this is just downright goofy at times.Also there is no reason what so ever that Randy Quaid should even be in this movie,sure he's funny but is that what the movie is really about,umm no.If you want real sci-fi go for alien's,even the comical moments in it are all better than the serious parts in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure dissapointment.","review":"One of the most dissapointing movies I've ever seen. I waited over 6 hours in line to see the sneak preview of this film. While initially excitited by the dope special effects, the movie quickly turns into mindless drool. I recommend the 1st 20minutes, but nothing after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's the nineties and this is the best we can do?","review":"All right the first time I saw ID4 the effects had me awstruck... as they did to all of us. Beyond that? I found the movie a no-brainer and have to wonder what HG Welles thinks of the obvious rip off from \\"War of the Worlds\\". More than likely he's saying, \\"what the hell am I doing in a coffin?!\\" My fellow educated sci-fi lovers will recall a virus killed the martians in that book but this round it's a computer virus instead of a biological virus. Welles should get royalties!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"This was a cheesy film. It was composed of 90% gratuitous, jingoistic \\"patriotic\\" BS.I mean, if you're going to make a movie on a theme, (aliens invade the earth), that has been done so many hundred times before, you need to have *something* original to work with, and this film has nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first of the big budget \\"aliens invade\\" movies!","review":"Short but sweet: I remember WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY back in '95/'96 when I saw the ads for this movie and how it was the first of its kind in that it had a big budget and (for then) high tech special effects. I saw it in theaters the night before it was officially released, and it blew my mind!Look, by today's standards the effects are (somewhat) dated, this was the 90's, and CGI was starting to be used more and more (unlike today where it's practically the standard). The movie has everything that a movie of this type should have: action, humor, good acting, a decent plot, and -POPCORN!As I've stated for \\"Battleship\\": this is NOT \\"2001...\\" -there are plot holes and goofy things you'll find wrong with it, but if you watch it for what it is; an \\"aliens invade us\\" movie and not worry about being too serious, you might just enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised--EDITED version (2003 vice 1996 per DVD label)","review":"Love the movie, but I don't like being taken for a ride.Ordered on 7 July 2012 and received today. Already own a copy but purchased this because it was *supposed* to be the original 1996 version. The set I rec'd today (14 August 2012) the cover shows 1996, but the media is marked 2003. Disappointed that it was slow to arrive AND it's the sanitized version. \\"Welcome to Earth...\\" and a few other scenes are either shortened or overdubbed.Still on the hunt, but I won't be purchasing it from Amazon due to inaccurate information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie still","review":"I loved it when it came out.

Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum are always good as were most of the well selected crew. This film featured a good story, great cast, and fine special effects. The creature design for the aliens was imaginative and very credible.I understand that the Air Force could not give this film its full support because of the UFO reference made to Area 51. They desired to, however, and were very happy with the patriotic plot and the positive light it placed the US Air Force in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"Love this movie.

And why should it. ID4 is not about any of those things. It is quite simply pure entertainment. The special effects are amazing and very well conceived. The cast does a fine job with the dialogue that they were given. Of course even they knew that the real stars of this film were the visuals. On DVD the film looks great. Although this is a pure theater picture the small screen is still a worth while place for ID4. The DVD is loaded with extras that really make the purchase worth it. And the film absolutely looks better on DVD than the VHS version, even though it is THX. For fans of science fiction, or just films that rock with visual and sound effects don't miss it. For those looking for character and plot you need to try elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"ID4 still rocks!","review":"The time me and my dad went to go see Independence Day at the theaters in 1996, it completely blew me away! Now it's on DVD and it's almost as good as it was in the theaters. Even though it is a little cheesy and stupid in parts, the scenes where the White House and the Empire State Building gets blown to bits is just awesome! Bill Pullman and Will Smith put on a reasonably good performance and the special effects were probably ground-braking.

Besides violence, this movie scif-fi destruction and there also language in this mvoie, that some how did the MPAA missed? The movie stars Will Smith and Bill Pullman as President Thomas J. Whitmore. Harvey Fierstein from Mrs. Doubtfire, whom I regonized by his voice in the film. The movie also has a few famous buldings/landmarks. And the three are the White House, The World Trade Center and the Stuate of Liberty. This might make a good film to watch if you love violent movies, or you love the country of USA.

Good sound, generally good picture, but the film 'artifacts' (that is, the picture becomes jumbled, broken up, and stops completely) during high-action sequences, like the massive dogfight against the evil invading aliens.While this is not a problem with newer players, owners of older machines will find this film almost unwatchable.Do yourself a favor, and buy the widescreen VHS instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails to meet expectations","review":"I was really psyched to see this movie, and came out very dissappointed.

Besides the normal screaming and running, it contains some great realistic portraits of humankind. Compared to a so called 'intelligent'movie like signs, i thought this could actaully happen. In Signs, they think logical behaviour is locking yourself in the basement and be so lucky that aliens don't know how to open doors. In Independence day, people are plundering eachothers houses, starting fights, getting all in the same traffic jam... Of course, there are always those superheroes, one of the strong type and the more intelligent type, but Jeff Goldblum is always terrific to watch. On the whole, this is a pretty intelligent movie with some realistic aspects and also just great special effects, can't wait to see The day after tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what were they after?","review":"One can only guess at what the producers of this were after: comedy? Not that funny. Drama? Not particularly interesting. Homage or spoof of 50s sci-fi? Maybe - although the contrived script and plot loopholes read as if they were trying to imitate rather than parody cheesey 50s flying saucer movies. The first part of the film holds up well with lots of suspense and tension, but after the aliens start to pound earth the whole thing just comes apart. Entertaining only if you're willing to put your brain on hold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype about the Limited Edition!","review":"1. The so-called \\"free movie-money coupon good for admission to The Day After Tomorrow\\" in only good for $1. Whoopdie doo!2. The so-called \\"Exclusive sneak peek at the making of The Day After Tomorrow\\" is only 2-minutes long, and most of that is from the trailer you can download from 100 websites. In fact, the trailer shows a lot more!If you want to buy the DVD for the movie, fine - I love ID4! But if you buy it for the Day After Tomorrow ca-rap you'll be RIPPED OFF!!!Shame, shame, shame, 20th Century Fox. Shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame, shame..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Refuse","review":"I can suspend disbelief. I can put pretension and artistic concerns aside and simply enjoy a movie for sheer entertainment value. I cannot condone or recommend this humongous pile of dung that millions of tastless morons have actually claimed to enjoy. Acting: horrible. Plot: embarrasing Effects: whoopee, the White House just exploded, big deal. If I want to see two hours of explosions I'll set off M-80's in my backyard. Oh my god look Randy Quaid is a crop duster turned state of the art multimillion dollar jet fighter pilot and just saved the world! Wow! Will Smith somehow knows how to pilot an alien spacecraft! And his stripper girlfriend still has to go to work even though the \\"mother ship\\" is floating over L.A. Give the girl a break geez! Give ME a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassed to say I paid good money to see this","review":"The fact that a film like this could make so much money at the box office truly shows how unintelligent human beings really are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, I must have not gotten \\"it\\"","review":"This has been one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I know some people find hidden references to great movies, or find some of the lines in this movie funny. To me it's a movie directed at audiences with an average IQ of around 70, no one to exceed 90. Science fiction is supposed to be somewat feasible, or at least give some explanation of why things are happening. This movie drops stuff on us like a virus downloading into an alien system and destroying their computers (War of the Worlds?). And the moment when I was about to leave the theater is when they tell an aussie that the americans are counterattacking and he says \\"Twas about time!\\". Who on earth thinks those lines and who are they directing them to? If you value two hours of your time, don't waste them on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it a \\"1,\\" but then what would I give Stargate?","review":"When I think of awful science fiction movies, three come to mind. Plan 9 From Outer Space, Stargate, and this \\"gem.\\" Written to the lowest common denominator, and unintentionally hilarious, this is as bad a science fiction movie as you can make with a hundred million dollar budget--except, perhaps, for Stargate.Want to learn how not to write a screenplay? What bad dialogue sounds like on screen? How to insult the viewer's intelligence? It's all here.Will Smith can add this to his \\"bad\\" movies column, right next to Wild, Wild West (ugh). Rent this just for a laugh if you're a glutton for punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effects ... PAINFULLY bad story.","review":"Ready for a no-brainer? This is the movie for you!Put it in, crank up the speakers, and try to suppress your gag reflex.Effects? Yup...real good.Casting? Poor. You will lose your respect for most if not all of this cast after seeing this. What a waste (and miscast) of Jeff Goldblum. I can't watch Bill Pullman anymore because of this movie. And Brent (Spiner), you're so much better than this...Acting? They do the best with what they were given.Script? YIKES! Pure Hollywood trash. One silly (and yet painfully predictable) turn after another. I actually like a lot of big-budget Hollywood movies, but this movie deserves the bad rap that blockbusters often get.So if you unwisely decide to invest in this movie, prepare to suspend your disbelief like you never have before..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real Dumb and Dummer!!!!!!!!!!","review":"It is simply one of the most unimaginable things I have ever seen. It amazes me how people loved this movie.I don't want to waste my time going into detail what I hated about this movie because the film is only indicative of a larger problem.If you don't know what this problem is then perhaps this is the film for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrifically bad movie","review":"This movie suffers from poor acting by all involved, worse scripting, and even worse concept. This movie lends new meaning to the term \\"implausible,\\" and it is so utterly bad that it is impossible for the viewer to engage in the temporary suspension of disbelief. Boo.Too bad, because I like Will Smith on the sit-coms that he has starred in, but I don't believe that motion pictures is the next logical step for his career. I think he should stick to TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly Film, Nice Package.","review":"I suppose Americans needed a 'feel-good' movie about themselves. Unfortunately this created an isolation for viewers not in the U.S.If you can get past the really silly notions of a stripper saving the First Lady, a Macintosh saving the world, and sheesh, Judd Hirsh, it is a fairly descent no-brainer action film.A good time waster, but nothing more. The DVD seems fantastic for fans of this film though. My rating is on the sillyness of the film, not the DVD because it's a pretty nice package and deserves a five for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Independence Day, the ansome DVD in all-times","review":"Independence Day, I still have a single disc editon, with the widescreen format, Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround, and Dolby Surround, and Digtially Mastered with THX for Sounds and Picture Quality. This movie is cool, because the visual effects, sound effects, sfx on the smash hit film on the summer on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"only 1 problem.","review":"This movie is a really great movie. I think it would be an easy classic, if not for one problem: Will Smith. If he would not have been in this moive, with all his not-funny jokes and cockiness, thise could have easily been the greatest scifi movie of the 90s. I really love this movie, and might be one of my favorites, if there had been a more serious actor in playing that part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Just another tediously boring \\"America saves the planet while the rest of the world stands around doing nothing\\" film. Yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humanity ought to be destroyed for a movie like this!","review":"If aliens with intelligence greater tha Roland Emmerich (which we can safely assume would be the case...) ever visited the Earth and encountered movies like Independence Day, they would fire their fusion reactors and get the hell outta here. I only hope this will never happen because humanity deserves to be destroyed for making films like that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"If u haven't seen it. Watch it. It's a great movie. Who does not love Will Smith?? Watch it all the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-Ray botch-up","review":"After watching the first twenty minutes of this film I had to eject the disc. Having watched the DVD countless times, there is a natural progression of the plot. The Blu-Ray version seems to have thrown all cohesion out the window in favor of god knows what, by deleting multiple scenes. These scenes assist in character development.It just amazes me that here we have 30+GB of space on Blu-Ray, plenty THEY SAY to have all sorts of extra content, but not the whole movie?I gave it two stars because I just can't force myself to give one of my favorite movies a single star.I suppose a few years from now a \\"Limited\\" edition Blu-Ray will pop up with those missing eight minutes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Modern Sci-Fi","review":"Do not let bad reviews stop you from seeing this movie on DVD. It is the best sci-fi since Alien. War Of The Worlds with a new twist. I do not understand what causes the overpaid reviewers to condemn so many of the sci-fi films of today and praise so many of the so called \\"movies with a message\\". If entertainment is what you are looking for this is a great two hours of intense sci-fi action. Once again i have discovered what the reviews say is bad, i seem to enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge disapointment","review":"The movie has great special effects. I guess this is where all the money went while making the film. I say this because its pretty obvious that no money was spent on hiring competent writers. The subplots in the movie are pretty stupid, the characters look confused on screen, and the movie borrows from so many other science fiction stories that one wonders why the producers weren't sued. Oh yeah, Randy Quaid's character was pretty useless, except until the end. Even then, it was kinda obvious what was going to happen. Come on people, when you attack a ship that is several miles across, don't you think convential weapons may not be able to bring it down. How stupid do they think their audience is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate roller coaster ride","review":"Good kicks evil's butt, planet gets saved and the good guys get the girls. I liked this one in the theaters, I liked it on VHS, and I still like it now that it's on DVD. Formulaic, maybe, but it's a formula that's worked since Moses let the Exodus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film, problems with DVD version","review":"Regardless of the implausibilities and poor acting in this film, I have strangely found it thoroughly enthralling since the first time I saw it. I own the VHS and the DVD now, and the DVD was very sloppily put together. The ends of some scenes are almost cut off, and there is a point when they have a shot of Air Force One and the thing just pauses for a second -- unacceptable!Nevertheless, with a DD receiver and 5.1 channels w/ a decent TV, the city destruction sequence is...well, a semi-religious experience. Don't miss out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Fun Movie","review":"First i'd like to say that the user complaining about how it seems that the rest of the world in the movie isn't affected failed to remember the scene where EVERY MAJOR NATION IN THE WORLD COORDINATED A GLOBAL AERIAL ASSAULT ON THE ALIENS WITH THE USA VIA MORSE CODE.But to review this movie, its one of my all time favorites, you can't go wrong with it and this will be an extremely worthy addition to your growing Blu-Ray collection. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Science Fiction Film","review":"This is one forgetable and spectacular Hollywood product more. \\"Independence Day\\" would seem be made for showing up Will Smith and company only. Producers's main purpose was to dazzle audience with ethnocentral and pseudopatriotic content in this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but not as good as the older similar movies","review":"I personally liked the older movies, to which this one was compared, much much more. It was full of special effects, but aimed toward the lower age groups, I believe. Entertaining is about all I can say for it, but if you miss it, you'll live! If you are looking for something to fill time, this one is probably a good bet."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad science fiction","review":"Independence Day has got to be one of the dumbest sci-fi films to ever be released. All the characters are one-dimensional. We hate Bill Pullman's portrayal of the president so bad, we wished he'd died in the White House. Will Smith provides almost no comic relief, although he is the movie's one likable character. I find it rather stupid that the world was saved by a Macintosh computer. The filmakers of Independence Day obviously didn't learn their lesson as they later made the even worse, very corny, Godzilla. The only thing that prevented me from giving Independence Day one star were the visual effects. They were quite astonishing, especially on a 75 million dollar budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are special effects all we have today?","review":"I remember going to the movies to see this. I was excited to see it, but once the film got going I felt like asking for my money back!Special effects are great now, but the stories and characters seem to get lost with mindless explosions and effects that just can't stand on their own.Ever watch the old Twilght Zones? The Day the Earth Stood Still? Laugh if you will at the effects, but the stories behind them still hold up today.I like alot of the actors in this film, but whoever gave the greenlight for this movie should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disengage brain before operating","review":"You're going to love this movie if:1) You like explosions2) Head-butting an alien is your idea of humor3) You know absolutely nothing about computers or dataYou'll also probably like it if you're able to completely suspend your thinking processes during viewing.The acting's not bad, and the effects are top-notch. Too bad the story is so inane.It would be pretty stirring if the solutions to the plot complications weren't so ridiculous. Everything was fine for the first hour. The closure to the film was just slack-jaw goofy.I find it hard to believe that there are many people who haven't seen this very hyped film, but if they exist, I recommend you leave this one one the shelf. If you want to see an action movie with humor that is worth suspending your brain for, rent \\"Big Trouble in Little China\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Ray Independence Day","review":"I had bought a new Blu Ray dvd player and this was my first Blu Ray movie and it is great. The sale and the receiving of the product was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Flick","review":"Independence Day is a comic book movie and is best enjoyed watching it with that mind set.The Blu-Ray version of this movie is amazing although I was disappointed to see a black dot artifact hanging around on the upper left portion of the screen during the opening and for the first several minutes of the movie.But overall, it is a good transfer and the sound is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the run time","review":"While there are many things to like about this blu ray disk, buyers should understand that the DVD version contains an additional 8 minutes of movie content. As such, I cannot give this blu ray more than one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN YOU REALLY, REALLY DON'T WANT TO DO THE DISHES","review":"The effects are great, the acting is about what you'd expect, the story's a zero. If you have something that has to be done and you've already used up all the good excuses, uncork a jug of (cheap)wine, get out the chips and dip and ask wifey if she'd like to take a break from her hard labour.If you remember what a disappointment Erwin Allen movies always were and how you somehow sat thru them anyway, you know what you're in for.Like Irwin Allen, there was enough money to make this turkey pleasent to watch, there is some good acting, but whenever logic gets in the way of plot, forget the logic.(...Other than getting to spend some time goofin' off with the wife, maybe doing the dishes would be better)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated movies of the past 10 years!!","review":"This movie, first off is way too long and could have easily been trimmed into an hour and a half. Don't waste your time. Second, I understand that it is a fictional story with the aliens and all, but many of the \\"realistic\\" scenes in the movie were far from realistic. For instance, when the President escapes from the White House, it appears that he is going through fire, which, obviously no plane would survive through a fire. Bottom line- don't waste your money. There are far better space related movies out there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISC2 of Indepandence day can not be played","review":"This DVD has 2 discs. But Disc2 can not be played my DVD player which is a SONY DVP-S560D. Soon after disc2 is inserted, power of the DVD player becomes off every time. So, I tried one more disc2 again and again but I have the same result. After all, I have not ever seen the contents of disc2. Therefore, I can not recommend this DVD because of this disc2 malfunction. Only disc1 is available even if this DVD has 2discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen","review":"I have always been a bit of a sci-fi geek but this movie just plain stinks. The script is BAD, acting is BAD (Will Smith, Jeff Goldbum -- both terrible actors IMO -- walking all cocky like George Bush Jr., arms drawn at their sides like wild west cowboys that just smoked the evil-doer aliens). What a total bunch of American Hollywood garbage at it's ABSOLUTE WORST!! It's not even entertaining in a 50's sci-fi kind of kitchy way, it's just a sad waste of time that will leave you wishing you hadn't wasted your Sunday afternoon watching such garbage, mowing the lawn would be more interesting. I wonder how in %^$# they ever get the funding to make &*^$ like this when so many decent films can't even get made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much IS too much","review":"I didn't like this film at all.Too much fuss for nothing!Too many heroes,extraordinary unreal characters and behaviours...I like S.F. films however this one is way out of proportions.Armageddon, Deep Impact and Space Cowboys were FAAAR better films, more believable I would say.Take my word for it!P.S. You ought to watch it if you want to laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please shoot me before they make a sequel","review":"Will Smith is quickly establishing himself as the king of commercial (movies). (Wicky) Wild Wild West and his heavily sampled music albums are just a couple of examples of his \\"full sale\\" entertainment career. Independence Day is at the top of the (junk)heap. All they needed was a schmaltzy Aerosmith title track to make this movie the perfect steaming pile. This is American movie making at it's worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment--a very bad movie!","review":"I'm sorry, but this movie was ridiculous! A drunken pilot saves the world from an alien invation!?! It takes one person two minutes to figure out how to operate an alien spacecraft??! President goes to fight in a war against unknown beings??! Let's get real here! If it weren't for the special effects this movie would be pure garbage! None of it makes any sense and it is totally unrealistic. It was a terrible disappointment to see good actors in such a lousy movie - in my opinion it diminished their 'image' somewhat. That movie taught me to think twice before ever looking at another Roland Emmerich movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever get the feeling you've been cheated?","review":"The plot holds as much water as a sieve, and the charcters are as well-defined and developed as a drawerful of sock puppets, but the explosions are mighty gratifying. In hindsight, it wasn't worth the $7.50 for big screen hoo-ha at the local multiplex, and it's even a questionable rental, if you're having to pay more than $1.Can't wait to see this one on MST3K."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure uninspired trash","review":"This is probably the worst science fiction film ever shown at a theater. I rented it when it first came out on video to give it a second chance. It was even worse the second time. The only good thing about Independence Day is the always reliable Jeff Goldblum."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a little anxious to get up there and whoop E.T....","review":"This movie as off the charts with the special effects. Not to mention some of the best lines in any movie of the decade in which it was made.Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, Adam Baldwin, Judd Hirsh, Bill Pullman, Mary McDonnell, Vivica A. Fox, Harry Connick Jr., Brent Spiner and an ensemble cast too numerous to name have come together to create an \\"end of the world\\" story that triumphs in the spirit of the American Revolution. (And on July 4th nonetheless).I'll never forget these words from the president's young daughter...\\"Is mommy sleeping now?\\"Yes, Mommy's sleeping.if that exchange did not make you cry, you have no heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for Money Only","review":"This has to be the biggest money maker to have nothing to it. It has no story, no plot, no acting, and no script. The special effects are average at best, it looks really fake on TV. The aliens use Macintosh software to run their spaceship no wonder they lost. This movie released in 1996 made 306 million dollars and was the first in many to just base a movie on special effects. Please don't buy this because they will just keep making more movies like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like, this wuz kewl and stuff","review":"Do you see the title of this review? That should give some clue as to the type of people this film is directed at. This may just be the worst movie ever made. It has one quality that may be deemed beneficial for some people: it will insult your intelligence like no other.

Will Smith once agains proves he has no talent. the movie is aimed at pre-adolescents and anyone else who has the brain of one. most Americans will love this since it formulated for their mental capabilities: gum-chomping, mall-inhabiting morons. if this description fits you, well, sit back and enjoy! if not, don't waste a minute of your time with this waste of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"What a yawnfest! I'm not surprised Americans would get worked up about the White House being blown up but talk about projection! The US is the most aggressive nation ever. So, small wonder it would be the ultimate threat if an alien army attacked the US.In other words, it is perfectly ok for the US to attack any country but heaven forbid if anyone, human or alien, attacks the US.Dull plot, dull everything, no amount of special effects can make up for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Independence Day","review":"Movie is entertaining but Blue Ray transfer dissapoints! Not very much difference from the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Ol' Partiotic Madness","review":"Despite it's general outrageousness, Independence Day IS a good movie. Bit of trivia for you: the French think it's ridiculous....because it's sooo \\"american\\".Quite so. But that doesn't stop it from being fun (there are good lines)...the actors' preformances are on the whole good... Roland Emerich delivers good material as usual (\\"I Robot\\" and \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\")... Fine the story is a bit \\"cockamany,\\" but so what? We all need a bit of escapism in our lives, and Independence Day devilers on that.Not to mention it's patriotic undertones... Doesn't the President's speech just galavnize you? Makes me wish the White House would employ screenwriters to write the President's speches...especially now.Oh, by the way...my family and I have watched this film EVERY 4th of July for the past 7 years. Sounds corney, I know, but it beats \\"Born on the 4th of July\\" And we get some fun out of it...since we don't have a stars and stripes to wave out the window."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theater release -- not director's cut","review":"Independence Day is pretty much a perfect example of a \\"Summer Blockbuster\\" done exceedingly well. Sit back and enjoy very well done entertainment. The one caveat on this particular BluRay release is that it's the Theatrical Release and _not_ the Director's Cut. That's a big disappointment because the Director's Cut was significantly better in terms of providing lots of little vignettes which deepened that standard Summer Blockbuster story line. Hopefully they'll eventually release the Director's Cut on BluRay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"This DVD is a must have for home theatre enthusists. The sound is great. The move is much the same as it ever was. Weak story but good special efects. Its just a fun move that just about anyone can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Transfer","review":"I'm not a huge fan of this movie, but the pristine DVD transfer and the extraordinary Dolby 5.1 mix made the experience a little more enjoyable. The extra features may seem like a lot, but the only things of interest to me were the 35-minute special effects feature & the commentary by the director & producer. The alien mockumentary and the standard behind-the-scenes features were quite boring and didn't show anything new.On the whole, if you like this movie (even a little), buy this DVD NOW! ID4 has never looked and sounded better at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why?","review":"Its a good movie. But why is it that in most alien movies the aliens are more intelligent than us?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be taken seriously","review":"If you take this film seriously, you'll be seriously disappointed.

Overly flag waving, IMHO, but still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's odd.....","review":"Well, the DVD plays just fine on my RCA DVD/DIVX player...maybe the DVD just doesn't work with Toshiba players, but it does on the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall its a good movie","review":"I enjoyed the movie but again it is way to much flag waving. but have you ever noticed that in most movies that have anything to do with some sort of doom that will end the existence of this entire planet, that it is always america that pulls through and saves everyone on the planet?

Frankly, It's difficult to find a film that would be as stupid and pretentious as Independence Day.

Oi! This movie hurts my head.Oh yea, the president can fly an f-18 why not.I kept routing for the aliens thru the whole movie.

However, I do have one problem with it. There was absolutely no love between the older sister and the younger brother. It didn't seem to me like she loved him at all, whereas in \\"Mrs. Doubtfire,\\" she deeply cared about her siblings. But that was sorely missing in this movie. Scenes showing her care and concern for her brother should have been filmed. Also, more scenes showing Dylan with his mom (Vannessa Williams, excellent as usual) were needed. Same thing with the President's daughter and his wife. Good action, but more sentimentality was needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIPPED-OFF","review":"I purchased the Blu Ray \\"Independence Day\\" Thru Amazon from one of the companies listed with them by the name of \\"BestValueusa\\".

When I tried to contact the company for an exchange of the same movie, but one that would play in the good ol usa, they informed me that in thier listing it stated that it wasw for region 2 or B abd that I was out of luck. This company should be pulled from Amazon. When I go back to look at the listing, all of a sudden in Big Red letters it now stated that it MAY NOT play in your player becuase it is a region 2 or B DVD. You can't trust anyone anymore.

The first time I saw it, I thought it was great, but..... that was also the last time I saw the whole movie.Now I can only bare the first 50 minutes. Great suspense when the UFOs arrive, a great soundtrack, great acting and very good SFX, but after 50 minutes, after the alien-attack and the destroying of the major cities, this movie changes to a computergame-like childish one-of-many alienmovie in which only ridiculous laserbeam-shooting scenes are presented; no story at all anymore, just shooting, and of course a hero-saves-the-day-predictable-hollywood-happy ending. So when I've got an itch to see this movie, this itch has been scratched after seeing the first 50 minutes, then I turn it off. So, maybe when you are a short-movie-kind-a-person you could like it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great entertainment","review":"Loved it. Love it every time I watch it. It never gets old. The performances by the outstanding cast and the special effects make this one of my favorite sci-fi flicks. If you haven't seen this one yet you need to - it's a classic. Keep in mind that it was not intended to be a deadly serious film. It is highly interspersed with comic relief efforts by several fine actors, and with the exception of perhaps one scene in a stripper bar (no-she does not take all her clothes off), the film is also highly viewable by young adults. Very young children may not be ready for the violent content or the concept of real-looking aliens, but on the other hand the language is basically kid-friendly. A highly entertaining film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffling nonsense","review":"People pretend they understand ths movie, But there lying because there is NOTHING comprehensable about the so-called \\"plot\\".

Your just pretending to understand it, but you don't.....Because there is nothig to understand. I watched it 12 times and never even began to make sense of what was going on> But people like to say it was a great movie to make themselves look smart.

I think this is one of the best movies ever made if you are able to ignore the stereotype characters, the bad acting, the terrible directing, the predictable ending, the xenophobic U.S. patriotism and above all the unrealistic plot.

If your going to make a serious a movie, then make a serious movie, if your going to make a comedy, make a comedy, don't mix them. You can do that with some films, but not the one because it does not cleary draw the line at where the seriousness begins and the comedy ends. What makes me even more mad is that I saw a critic on T.V. who said that it was THIS generations STAR WARS, this scum should never even look the way of STAR WARS. The special effects are the only thing that sold this poor excuse for a science fiction film, and to tell you the truth they weren't anything that SPECIAL.

That's the best way to describe this train wreck of a movie. There are two scenes in this movie worth seeing: the White House being destroyed, and Will Smith punching out the alien, saying \\"Welcome to Earth\\". Aside from those, it's two hours of bad acting, inane dialog, gaping plot holes, and pathetic stereotypes. Watch it for the pretty special effects, enjoy throwing popcorn at the screen, and go home wondering why Randy Quaid still has a career after mouthing \\"Here I am Mr. President\\". Wonder why Judd Hirsch accepted the insulting role of \\"the wise jew\\". Wonder why Robert Loggia couldn't find anything better to do with his time. But please, don't pay to see this disaster. Wait for cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"More stupid sci-fi.","review":"The only film approaching the stupidity of Godzilla, Dir. Emmerich delivers a film with good special effects and an embarrassingly vapid story. True this film had great commercial success and mass (herd) appeal, but it is best viewed in a theatre on opening day (thankfully come and gone). Its jingoist Only-America-Can-Save-Us theme is aptly served by its narrow, linear plot peopled with equally narrow characters played by an under utilized/over paid castID4 is a popcorn movie worth viewing once, not worth purchasing until it hits the bargain bins. Rent it instead. For better alien encounter sci-fi see Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Abyss, or X-Files. For special effects see The Matrix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome action, great writing.","review":"I loved this movie in the theater and I loved it last month on DVD at home. My wife had never seen it and enjoyed it immensely. The effects still hold up. Will Smith is perfect as always, funny, tough, real. Vivica Fox holds her own, and this is a perfect vehicle for Jeff Goldblum to play himself again. About the only thing that hung this up for me was some goofy editing here and there, oh and Bill Pullman. Just not convincing as an ex-fighter-jock, a husband, a father, or the President. He looked like he was trying too hard, and thinking about his role too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE THE MOVIE, HATE THE PRICE","review":"I'm one of Amazon's biggest fans.

I feel - well - accomplished, fulfilled. Whole.Seriously, the last 6 months have been a blast. I now consider myself a Sudokruiser - one who can solve a grid in minutes.

Definitely a different mindset when you have to think in terms of letters instead of numbers. Probably good for the grey matter, though. A quick note on the review by J. Stoner. You actually don't have to unscramble anything with regard to the wordoku puzzles. Simply list the letters in order by rows, top to bottom, not in order of each 3x3 grid. Then all you have to do is figure out the word breaks. One warning, before buying this book, make sure you have plenty of spare time!

It is just a really good book! Anyone who wants to know more about Elvis and Nixon should read this book. Although I am not much of a non-fiction reader, I found this book to be informative, enlightening, and a little bit amusing. The reason I say \\"amusing\\" is because picturing either of these so-call \\"distiguished\\" men doing the things described in this book is enough to give anyone a good chuckle. This book is a quick read, has great information, and is very well put together. The whole experiance of reading this book is fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"I love that there is a new wave of surf music like the Ziggens, Del Noah & the Mt.

Great stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but the parts I know about were false.","review":"I wanted to like this book, but so much reads in a nasty tone. First he hates vinyl and I love it so that's bad to start for me. Second he hates Jerry Lee but I also love him. The guy dropped The Killer from two labels! So much for knowing talent. Also I happen to know a few people he writes about in this book. They hold no malace, but they literly cracked up when I told them his versions of the story's. Read it if you want some gossip but as for me it's very mediocre. To be fair his own singing career is delt with quite well and the only part that read without venom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"So much of these accounts of relationships and interactions with members of the music industry ring both false and bloated. I tried hard to like this book but the basic format is so tired and cliched. Just a litany of who he straightened out and set on the right path, and how he was so far ahead of his time. Includes all of the \\"self\\" cautions: self-important, self-righteous, self-centered, self-congratulatory. And also includes one of the most wrong-headed descriptions of the limitations of vinyl as a record format. To be married to this guy, trapped on an island in Hawaii, would just be daunting. Unexamined vanity has never prospered so openly. His riches clearly stayed financial."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning debut","review":"Some of these stories might be described as vignettes.

It is entertaining and amazing to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Adventure","review":"I was so happy to find this book. I learned about it while researching solo voyages across the Pacific. Kenichi's experience is well translated and feels very authentic in the English form. I had such fun reading about the different aspects of trip; the exciting, mundane, terrifying, and uplifting moments. The dream of just wanting to sail from Japan to the US west coast for no reason makes perfect sense to me. How Kenichi overcame the pessimistic and disapproving people opposed to him fulfilling his dream is as vital to the story as the actual logistics and skill he used to accomplish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I bought this book along with Davies' \\"Dynamic Reti\\", and after trying the \\"Easy Guide\\" out in some games I proceeded to play, I was quite dismayed at the lack of guidance I was given by the different chapters in the book. Either I already knew what he was telling me or I couldn't understand why he was suggesting what he was because some moves didn't make sense to me. The other problem I had was trying to keep up with the progression of his games in between his notes and bold print. My suggestion is to skip this book and get Nigel Davies \\"Dynamic Reti\\". There is much more unique information and insight offered there in greater clarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album changed my life.","review":"This is it! The best! The most riotous, catchy, snotty lo-fi punk rock 'n' roll music ever recorded. They take the skeleton of the Ramones and spice it up with some \\"Back From the Grave\\"-style snot and and top it off with sheer incompetence. Each song has the same 4/4 beat, you can't hear the bass, the vocals are distorted and largely unintelligible to the casual listener, the guitar sounds like a garbage can lids with strings and a pickup on it. In other words, the coolest sounding record ever! This is the kind of thing where you either love it or hate it, there really isn't much of a middle ground. Those few Donnas fans who like their first album better than the new stuff should check this stuff out, it rules over the Donnas. I played it nonstop for weeks after I got it, and regularly for years after that. The best.

When you turn 1 all 4 turn. You have to set the first number and hold it with your finger and then set the second and hold it too until you have set all 4. 2) Being in the weather (dust and rain) these locks got very difficult to operate. Some would not close, others became difficult to pull open while others had tumblers that became very difficult to read and turn. 3) I have learned of an easy way to open this lock.This particular master lock I would not purchase again.

It is not as complete as Ray Jardine's Beyond Backpacking. Not as well researched as Colin Fletchers Complete Walker. I thought Kestenbaum didn't have much to add and his opinions were just that, his opinions. Chris Townsend's book, The Advanced Backpacker, (oddly by the same publisher)is much better and seems to come from someone who benefited much more from his experiences. There were some nice pictures and descriptions of gear, but then I can find that in my REI catalog!I also liked the picture on the cover.

This book is a good intro, with a chapter devoted ot each of the major gear items (packs, tents, sleeping bags, etc). But, it's pretty short on completeness. I was disappointed not to find info of use to me beyond the very basics, except of a quick little chapter on long-distance hiking, but nothing on cross-country hiking needs or recommendations. Kind of an expensive book for just an intro.

Most of the info in this book is stated on the internet in better wording and a more practical manner. Much of this book is just his opinion of how things might work because he never enven tried the products. From my understanding he doesn't even have any serious experience under his belt. He has hiked several hundred miles but never completed any long distance trails. His biggest achievement is that he attempted the PCT.

There's also a nice jam called \\"Es Paradis\\", and a Radio Edit of \\"Everybody Loves a Carnival\\", as well as another nice tune called \\"Where You're At\\".The main reasons to get this CD are 1) Everybody Loves a Filter, and 2)Es Paradis.If you love \\"Everybody Loves a Carnival\\" and/or the original 303 mix, then get Part One.

Instructions are even written by someone who first language was obliviously English. I was initially looking at the Dial Indicator from the Girr..... Company. The Grr.. unit was about 10 dollars cheaper, but many reviews here indicated flimsy construction. This is definitely not the case for the unit from Peachtree.

When you get to the second level a female character is introduced. The introduction to this character is very inappropriate. Daxter slides down a pipe and at that point the game switches from game play to video. When Daxter comes out at the bottom of the pipe there are a large pair of breasts in his face. The video scene is probably about thirty seconds long and it concentrates on displaying this female character's physical aspects. She wears a tight halter top, which fully displays her breasts and mid-drift, and low riding pants which allow the string from her underwear to be fully visible over her hips. The images of this character are completely inappropriate for a ten year old.

Machen is a good writer and had a keen mind. This is a book, not of theology, but of doctrines explained from a fundamentalist perspective. Machen believed that Christianity was a set of infallible \\"truths\\" based on \\"facts\\" that are gleaned from an inerrant Bible. One must accept these \\"truths\\" and that's how you get \\"saved.\\" Modernists are lost, of course, since they only want to to destroy Christianity. Machen is wrong on this point, and his arguments are convincing only to those already convinced because they, too, share his ideological worldview.

I am continually amazed at how history repeats itself - particularly in the Christian realm. It seems as though the same issues in Church history keep coming up and this book illustrates the same phenomena.Machen's \\"Christianity and Liberalism\\" is as valid today as it was when it was written in the early twenties. Machen addresses the creeping in of liberalism into the Church and how on the surface, the differences don't seem so striking, but underneath liberalism makes itself out to be a completely different religion. Machen stresses the importance of doctrine for preserving the orthodox Christian faith while urging for unity without compromising the fundamentals.I highly recommend this book to anyone for the means of promoting awareness and discernment in these \\"liberal\\" times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same problems - 80 years on","review":"Very readable and rather amazing that it wasn't written in the past 5 - 10 years. Obviously liberalism and Christianity have been at loggerheads for decades. I think the insight that I appreciate the most is the emphasis on honestly defining ones theological framework and terms. If you are redefining Christian theology, don't call yourself \\"Christian\\"; rather demonstrate enough integrity to call yourself something else. Just because you disagree with the major tenants of Christian doctrine doesn't mean you're any brighter or more insightful, necessarily, but it does mean you should call yourself something other than Christian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as relevant today as in the '20s","review":"Thorough reviews have already been written so I'll be brief but it is amazing how relevant the topics covered by Machen still are today. The heart of 1920's liberalism is still alive and well today and more entrenched in everyday thinking. From a historical standpoint I really enjoyed seeing the issues of the day in the 1920s. Interesting how the more things change the more they stay the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong treatise against theological liberalism","review":"J. Gresham Machen lays out in plain terms his defense of historic creedal Christianity against the liberalism he saw in the 1920s. This book is often harsh, and does not deal lightly with what the author sees as heresy. This book is certainly no nonsense and forces a person to make a decision either for or against theological liberalism in many places. Machen forces the liberal to admit their divergence from historic Christianity, from a historical Jesus, and from nearly all that the Church claims to hold dear. This book unlike most railings against one viewpoint or another covers its bases well, and any reader regardless of theological position will learn much about how to make arguments using scripture and history.This truly is a great work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!","review":"It is so worthwhile having a Spanish language dictionary (instead of an English-Spanish translation dictionary), and this one is very good. Simple but thorough, with lots of usage examples. I haven't checked out all the grammar info in the back yet, but just having this handy as I read has already given my vocabulary a huge booster shot. I love this dictionary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Good To Last","review":"Barbara and Peter Jenkins seemed such a well-suited couple as they traversed America, and later as they settled down to raise their three kids. Their simple faith seemed to be a great addition to their tales of people they met and things they experienced as they traveled and spoke and ministered through their books. Too bad their marriage didn't last, as a tome about lasting marriage partnerships written twenty or thirty years later would probably have been well-received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting, Inspirational, and Absolutely Fascinating!!","review":"Their walk across America book was a sensational item and was on the best seller's lists for a long time. This book delves even deeper into the hearts and minds of the Jenkins. They are candid, refreshingly honest about God, life, faith, and other mysteries, and they explore their feelings in ways most people never experience. A beautiful book that should be read by anyone interested in the \\"life unseen.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read Peter's \\"A walk across America\\", which was actually a walk to the Gulf. It was a very good book and for the most part inspirational. Those kinds of trips are tough because you are out in the elements and need the help of others. Peter connects this help with God, which is a little bit goofy but it is not overplayed. In this book Barbara is by far the better writer; however, there is way too much religion in this book. If you are not a Christian you will be turned off with the bent this book gives on every event. At the end of each chapter there is an excerpt from the Bible. There is no doubt many wonderful generous Americans in the United States but to think God is in play there is a bit neurotic."},{"rating":"2","title":"bugman lives","review":"Here lies the Bugman.

Yes, I'm stupid!! I actually didn't see the shipping charge before it was ordered. I ordered another shovel from a different vendor, and the shipping was only $9.60.

Now that I've used it once I'm not happy with it. On the shovel I received the blade is not straight, it's actually bowed a bit so the middle hits the ground while the edges curl up slightly not touching the ground, so I'm only getting about 1/2 the usefulness out of the wide blade. First time I bought a snow shovel sight unseen and probably the last. When I buy it at the store I can check to see it's level by setting it on the ground. Shoveling snow isn't the funnest chore, doing it with a defective shovel that covers half the ground it should makes it way worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wears out quickly","review":"I use this shovel on a rough finish concrete circular driveway.

It is made of particle board with laminate that came with tons of chips and dings in it. Several more resulted from assembly because it is so cheaply made. The locking clasps for assembly are so cheap they were defective. We had to use pliers to stretch them out so that they would lock properly. The backing is very cheap and looks cheap, with gaps and was hard to properly align. The inserts are flimsy plastic, so only very light shoes can be stored. The edges of the insert don't touch around the frame. I placed the cubby in a closet so it isn't really seen and it functions fine. I would maybe pay 50-70 dollars for it but definitely not worth the $240 that the company charges!!

Clearly influenced by grunge but close to his australian roots, John mixes reggae, funk, folk with a strong voice. This is an artist with attitude beyound his message and music, like few ones fighting to make a better world and far from the commercial music industry.For those who had never heard this man, once in a lifetime at least you should.

The treadmill has many features like incline, various speeds, programs, cup holder and a fan.Delivery took some time as it didn't come with UPS or FedEx. It came with Eagle Express since the box was bulky and heavy. They missed a couple of delivery appointments, but we finally received it.Assembly was as expected, not too bad. The only problem I had was that one of the screws didn't line up correctly and therefore went in on a slant. I couldn't get it in all the way, so it's only half way in.Great treadmill and great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying Purchase","review":"I researched treadmill ratings on Consumer Reports prior to purchasing to give me an idea of which brands were the best.

This compilation takes tracks from the time that he recorded for island records. Waits has created some really strange and avantgarde music. It is not really blues, or rock and I to be honest I can not put my finger on it. Yet, it works and he is a quite accomplished lyricist and writes very escoteric yet functional lyrics. The cover for this compilation is very well done and the photo is very nice and the book-let is well done with easy to read font. His vocals are very unusual but for this kind of music (call it what you want), it works and Tom Waits is truly an eccentric genius that creates great music and writes some odd but effective lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will not buy these again","review":"I received this item today, and I will not buy these fertilizer tablets again.

Tetes Raides' more recent CD \\"Fragile\\" is also an excellent CD, though it's difficult for me to pick a favorite from their discography.

Teppic is a great guy who grows up as we read. The very name of Teppic's country, Djelibeybi, made me giggle, and the final exam in the Assassins' School had me at the edge of my chair until Teppic -- whew! -- makes the right decision. It's fun to look for the sources of Pratchett's plots (and satires). Did anyone else notice the similarities between this one and the first two of the Gormenghast trilogy? Not just Daddy's becoming a bird, but the dark ambience, Teppic's strange rivals and relatives, and the liberating finale. This book isn't my absolute favorite of Pratchett's (those accolades are reserved for the Watch novels and REAPER MAN), but it's a far cut above the Rincewind tales -- and better than the Gormenghast novels, since it examines all problems, including the hilarious ones, that trouble the inheritor of vast inbred territories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Diskworld book","review":"I really enjoy Terry Pratchett's writing and he did not disappoint with this one.

This is undoubtedly the wittiest and most original part, unfortunately it is also the briefest. Pratchett is unable, or unwilling, to continue in this vein and instead tacks a great wad of stodge on to this promising introduction. Whilst this manages to pad it out to a reasonable length to be published, it also makes it profoundly wearisome. Obviously however it is this tripe, more concerned with its own twisted logic than with being amusing, which Pratchett considers to be the most important part. This is evident from the reworking he gives most of these ideas in \\"Small Gods\\", and by inflating the size of this book he manages to make the same old themes more turgid than ever before.

Whoever is playing bass on the first 5 or 6 songs is completely out of key, and doesn't appear to know the changes. The sound quality of the recording is very poor too. Muddy Waters does have some GREAT live albums but this is not one of them.

This song just hits the spot right on with Sarah's amazing vocals, the slinky and VERY funky bass lines & programming. Definitely one of her best solo songs, and rates up there with her SINNER MAN classic. I remember when this single came out in 1984 , and all 3 ex-Labelle members were busier than ever as solo artists. Now they're back together after all these years. Pick this one up. It is a classic that rocks the world! Came in a 12 inch format with 2 beautiful photos of Sarah on the cover. I guess there was to be a full album, but only this song & LUCKY TONIGHT were recorded, as Patrick Cowley passed away ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good plate","review":"I ordered these to be used at wedding shower that was taking place at our house.

For example, some dances at the governor's mansion can get real confusing. I suggest that when you divide the plunder at the end of your voyage, you revert down levels as soon as you can, or you will suffer terrible difficulty conquering or sneaking in or out of cities. Other than that, this game is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arrrrr!!!","review":"If ye' be wantin' adventurous fun, this be it, lads.

I was very surprised that Sid Meier would attach his name to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Sid Meier creativity!","review":"Pirates! is an upgrade of the classic PC game. Like with many of Meier's other games, it is open ended and there is more than one way to win. Also, like Civilization, it contains a Wikipedia-like Pirate-o-Pedia, whereupon players can learn about some real-life pirates such as Blackbeard and Stede Bonnet. Meier does not hide the fact that his game is colored by myth and that facts are mixed up; not an attempt to recreate history. Still, should be a fun way to pretend to have your own Jolly Roger and attack merchant shipping! HINT: Be sure to play on September 19th! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun For All Ages","review":"This game is a great strategy/action game. It is fun for everyone from 8 to 80.

Pirates! is a game that offers so much promise, but it never really quite gets there.Yes, the game did provide me with several hours of enjoyment. The basic premise of the game is a blast. However, each goal in the game is accompanined by a mini-game. At first, the mini-games are nice Easter eggs, but they get very boring very fast.Overall, the game needs a lot of improvement. With a little tweaking, I believe Pirates! had the ability to become one of those games that define a genre. As it is, the game seems incomplete. The main quest never stops being enjoyable. The mini-games that must be accomplished in order to complete the main quest get unbearably tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"very fast game","review":"great game.graphics,interplay is great.we have the Primus strategy guide which has helped a lot.the only drawback we saw is you can't adjust the speed.it plays fast.so save at least a couple of times thru the game in case you want to go back and try a different strategy,use this especially in the higher difficulty levels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pirates Dissapointing","review":"I purchased Pirates after reading a few reviews and expected it to be an entertaining game. While the concept of the game is solid I found it to be very disappointing as a whole.First of all, there is little possible customization within the game, as you can only choose from a set of ships and buy generic upgrades.The character interaction is frustrating and quite boring as the voices can only say \\"blah\\" and \\"meh\\".The controls are very hard without a number pad and I could not find any way to change them. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU SO NOT HAVE A NUMPAD. Dueling is nearly impossible on my laptop without a numpad.I like the civilization series, but was disappointed byt Pirates. I would recommend saving your money to buy CIV 4 if you don't have it, and don't waste it on Pirates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!","review":"I got this game and CIV V for the family.

But it contains all the pirate activities I could wish for, enough to keep you busy but not to many to get frustrated. After you get the hang of it It's very fun with very easy controls.Soon all the fair maidens will faint at the sound of your name and sailors will tremble, your home country will stand proud when they hear you sunk another ship.Capturing towns, wooing fair maidens, finding buried treasure, defeating pirates, and transporting imigrants are only some of the things you do. In all it deserves 100 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Game for the whole Family","review":"Dad, mom, and three kids all enjoy this game. It can be played on many levels and does not contain the sort of graphic images that would preclude the children in our household. The kids enjoy the adventurous nature of the game, while the adults like the strategic aspects. Plenty of fun, easy to learn, and the difficulty level accomodates a range of players. A game everyone can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for awhile","review":"Sid Meier's Pirates is inventive and original. It has some aspects of the game that I haven't seen in other games. I like the idea of trying to build up my treasure within a certain time frame (your pirate ages and you can only be a pirate for so long before your health can't take it anymore). Trying to win the love of the daughters of the Govenors in the different cities is also fun. The only problem is after awhile the game starts to feel repetitive. If you are trying to sail against the wind for a long journey, it can take forever to get there (it would be nice if there was a way to speed up the sailing). Overall it is a fun game, but I have to take long breaks away from it for it to keep being fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old But Fun","review":"I love this game. The graphics are old, the action is stilted but I still love it. If you are of the age when pirates and cowboys filled the TV screen rather than robots and laser guns, this is a trip back to your childhood. There is strategy and timing but hand and eye coordination, while helpful, is not the most important aspect of the game. You travel around the world as it was during the high pirate years fighting, dancing, discovering treasure and most of all, looking for your kidnapped family members. I have played many times but haven't been able to win. (have come very close though)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total letdown","review":"When Sid Meier's Pirates! came out in 1987, it immediately became a classic, it was the game of the year. The game had such a success that they did a powerful sequel in the early 90's called Pirates Gold buy unfortunately, it had performance issues with graphics, etc and had lots of bugs. Now Imagine, a dedicated community of fans of the game waiting 10 years for a sequel of this masterpiece, and when it comes out, it looks like preteen game. The game is addictive and truly follows the spirit and nature of the original Pirates!, however, the cartoonish approach of the game obliterates any serious attempt to deliver a true pirate strategy adventure game. If you expect a serious pirate game, you should not play this game because you will find the exact opposite because of its cartoonish and childish approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting way more","review":"When my friend let me borrow this game about a week after he purchased it I should have known that there was a problem. The first few minutes of playing were exciting but after about an hour of so you've already seen EVERYTHING that there is to be seen. All of the battles are extremely formulaic, the game play is very predictable and 90% of your time will be just sailing around without an end in sight. Every once in a while a threatening boat will appear and try to raid yours but after the first challenger you're ready for anything.I don't play many video games. In fact I wouldn't even call myself a casual gamer due to how little I play at all which makes it even more apparent how bad this game is when even I can beat it in a short time.I've played through this game a few times, each time hoping that maybe I was just missing something, but each time I was greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking","review":"The reviews i read about this game where good, so i had high hopes getting ready to play, and this game got really old fast. the coolest part of the game is the ship battles everything else is horrible. Everything you do when your actually on land didnt make any sense, and there was no creativity put into it. This game might have been good 15 years ago but today one of the worst games i have played. Dont even waist the $9.00 for this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got ripped off!","review":"I think this is a clear case of false advertising. The photos on the page for this item show it coming with a map and a game book and all kinds of stuff. All I got was a cheap looking DVD in a plain case. I think this might even be a pirated copy. Maybe I'll call my buddy at the FBI."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo Addictive!!!!!!!","review":"I love this game, I love it so much whenever I had lost a copy I'd simply buy another. This is my third copy. Everyone that I know that has played this game loves it too, it's easy to learn and once you have the controls down you are ready to play. It has a lot of mini quests that make up the whole game. Beware: If you have to be at work, school or anything that you can't blow off do not turn this game on to pass the time. You will get sucked in and before you know it it's three hours later. It happens to me all the time! Read the booklet, if you can, before you play, it will give you the best understanding of what you are about to get in to. Happy Gaming!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want to be a Pirate?

You also can engage yourself with quests: searching for treasure, hunting down a certain ship, among other adventures. You can recruit a crew and divide the plunder when they get restless for their treasure after months at sea. While playing, you could romance the Govener's Daughter or fence with the enemy captain.

I was really glad when this game came out because it touted itself as an updated Pirates! And boy is it! This game is so simple and that makes it so much fun. You basically go around on a ship and find treasure, attack cities, trade, woo women, sword fight, get into ship battles, and rescue your family! All the while you have to deal with the weather, repairs, food, and mutiny. There are also plenty of missions to go on. The game is really endearing too. It's just plain fun.The only downside I can possibly think of is how every town pretty much looks the same. They may have certain unique features like what they sell or something, but for the most part, they are all the same. I didn't really mind this since the focus of the game aren't the ports. It's about going out on the open sea and being a pirate. In that respect, this game blows everyone else out of the water. Buy this if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"After moving, I could no longer find this game in my collection. Then I bought a DVD version from another group and it wasn't the same. They substituted their own videos instead of using 2K's and it crashed the software several times.

Brand new, in the box, sealed from 2005. I imported my saved games from several years ago and it was as if I never lost the game.

I was wrong, as Tipler's explinations were so well done that I found the math to be easy. Although its true that most of my physics learning came from my high school teacher, the only thing he lectured on where things that came almost directly from Tipler.

I would recommend Mr. Holladay's(sorry for the speller) textbook on introduction to physics. For godsake, Mr. Tipler, if you would please reconsider the reason for you to write a textbook...so please...next time don't put all the important material in the study guide, rather present them in the textbook.

I also appreciate the space provided on the inside of the case for business cards. The only real downside is that you have to remove your machine from the case to sync or charge. I consider this an acceptable tradeoff for the protection that is offered. Additionally, if you are partial to belt cases, Rhinoskin makes a belt case for the Sliders.

Ms. Dunnett is an excellent author. Yes, the history is good, but don't get into this series just for that. It's entirely too complicated and the continuous plot is a brain stretcher. I found that I actually started to like Nicholas in this book, and I really haven't before. He is a brilliant manipulator, and his long term planning is incredible, but he is human after all.

The game locked up on her a couple of times which wasn't the end of the world but was a major annoyance if she hadn't saved recently. Then one morning, after a storm, all of her feed bins dissapeared. They didn't reapear.

The game will suddenly stop, and you can't do anything but turn the power off, so your game is not saved, and you have to start out where you last saved! It is so annoying! Plus, another glitch is that if you have anough wood and gold to expand your house, the wood chopper dude still says you don't have enough! Plus caring for your animals with the stylus gets really annoying after a while, and really messes up your screen from all the rubbing. Do not buy this game! I would suggest Harvest Moon Magical Melody."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game will make you Cry if it glitches!","review":"This game is great.

He couldn't do anything to save his cat either :(. When it froze on him he just tossed it in the trash.

After those few headaches, it was ok... the new animals are fun and all, but having to manually pet them EVERY DAY is annoying. THe game is good for first-play thrills... but the long term gaming is BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- This game willl stop working unexpectedly","review":"There appears to be a serious glitch in this game. At some point in the game (looking at various sources online) you may no longer be able to access your save game file. A quick Google search will show that this is an extremely widespread problem, and many walkthroughs even mention this fact. Now, if this happens at the beginning, no big deal, just start over again. But after playing very close to the end of the game, my girlfriend can no longer load her saved game. From what I can tell, there is no way to recover once this happens, and you will have to start over again. I've never had to return a game before, but I am certainly making an exception for this one. In my opinion, with respect to video games, there is nothing more frustrating (and less fun) than investing many hours into a game, only to have your save file destroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ours keeps crashing","review":"Like many others, we have been unable to enjoy much of this game.

The one problem was the load file glitch. I played through over half the game and saved in BOTH files and when I went to reload, the screen went blank. Apparently this is a MAJOR glitch to where you cannot get your saved files back and you must restart the whole game over again. I took the game back to the seller and they gave me another. I played the second game to near the end and it had the same load file glitch. I called Nintendo and they told me to contact Natsume and have them fix it. Nintendo also told me that I can call them back if the game does not get fixed, so there is some hope to getting it fixed, but I cannot get my progress back. It is too much hassle really. I guess it all depends on how much a person is willing to go through and how far they will go to get it fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"DS or DS Cute?","review":"If you're a girl, you may want to purchase Harvest Moon DS Cute.

Much of it was unrealistic, for example: customers laughing at Greta's poor attitude as a waitress. In reality she would have been told off or fired the first day.Originally I thought this would be a fun movie to watch with teens but by the end, with all the rudeness and talk of suicide, I can't imagine sharing it with teens. It's not cute to be rude to parents, relatives and/or friends... What is the real message of this movie? I didn't see a big turn around in attitude in the end. She does change a little, but it just didn't seem authentic which is why I feel perhaps it was too rushed. -There are just too many great films out there to recommend above this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this movie","review":"This entirely predictable movie simply strings together one tired cliche after another.

What I did not expect was her portrayal of a troubled young girl who eventually finds that she's got a lot to live for once she looks past her own tribulations. Ms. Duff's performance in this film shows acting skills that she hadn't shown in the past. While this movie is by no means a great film it is worth watching and has a good message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinly-vealed anagram for Great","review":"Greta, the character, suffers from a lot of sarcasm and a cynical world-view. Hillary Duff gives life and motivation to 17-year-old Greta, who maintains two lists: one, the various ways to commit suicide; and the other, everything she wants to do before she dies. It's the second that redeems a story of selfish detachment. Julien, a coworker ex-con juvie, gives more heart to the story. He wants to help, but knows he can't reform Greta without her effort. He is true to his character throughout the film. There are nods to Harold and Maud, including a remix of Cat Steven's song \\"Trouble,\\" under his Islam name now.You know the general direction the story is leading, but it gets there on its own terms. The film has a heart and soul that makes it worthwhile.My review title comes from the film, and is not a commentary on the film. I just liked the line, because it was revealing of Greta's view of herself and the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Slightly Entertaining","review":"I hate Greta. Yeah, yeah, I know I'm not supposed to really like her until she turns herself around. I didn't buy THAT and I still don't like her. It's not amusing to see a teenager, any teenager, disrespect others. It's simply hurtful, unnecessary and appalling. The movie tries really hard to get you to be sympathetic towards her, but it never worked for me. Everyone has had crap in their life they have to deal with. Most people grow up and beyond their childhood. I know what the people who made this movie wanted me to feel...they just failed. Epic fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of movie","review":"Based on just Hillary Duff, I would probably just give this movie just one star, but \\"Grams\\" and Julie keep the movie from being a total waste of time.Too chick flick for me, and while it might be entertaining for tweens, I think that it would be too awful for most people over the age of 16.I did not find Hillary Duff to be convincing in her role, overall I just felt like I was watching a bad episode of her show on the Disney Channel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilary Duff at her finest","review":"I think this movie shows Hilary Duff's best performance. There is no one else I can picture perfectly executing the character of Greta like Duff did. The movie is somewhat fresh, it is a bit similar to \\"Georgia Rule\\" - the fact that the teen bratty girl gets sent to her grandparents to deal with.

She is mean and disrespectful. Both agreed they would nt pay to see the film.From the Sixteen Year Old - It's hard to watch such a manipulative girl be so disrespectful to everyone she meets. It reminded her of terrible girls at school she avoids at all costs, so why go to a movie about them? She also said it was boring and she would not recommend.So, it seems like a resounding thumbs down from the target market."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Worst Amazon Order Ever","review":"This is the worst item I've ever order off of Amazon.

A Story line about as deep as a porno film. I was expecting some serious acting by good actors; instead, the whole movie centered around the Globalist agenda of race mixing (which is part of their crazy idea of a world government; the other part being the creation of a global financial crises which seems to be working.) See this for what it is \\"MANIPULATION\\"! If you were dumb enough to fall for Club Obama (sending 20,000 more troops into Afghanistan or sucking up to Wall street) or McCain, then you would probably like this film, I tossed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty, but not for everyday use","review":"These are great guest towels, but not something I would use everything.

After a few more spins, however, I began to realize the complexities in the mood changes, the musicianship, etc., and fell in love with it. It is one of the best CD's I have heard in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follows a scary Dream Theater trend","review":"The trend of turning down the bass in DT (and now LTE) recordings has reached an annoying point for me. There is a point in 'Acid Rain' where John's guitar drops out and you are SUPPOSED to be able to hear Tony grooving on the Chapman Stick. Unfortunately, the Stick was turned down so low in the mix that you could hardly even HEAR it, much like John Myung's bass notes in a live setting. If a prog supergroup is created, I want to hear individual instruments, not instruments turned down to satisfy the egos of other members in the band (and before anyone flames me for this, consider how conspicuously absent were ANY of Jon Myung's songs from the last few DT albums)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious listeners only need apply","review":"LTE 1, written in about a week, was an interesting work, with several curious musical concepts and a couple of pieces that actually managed to come together as songs. LTE 2, however, is MUCH more deeply satisfying listen than LTE 1 for several reasons. (1) The richness of musical ideas is much deeper - with much more variation. (2) There is much more emphasis on jazz and prog rock themes. Call it King Crimson meets Al DiMeola. (3) If anything, it is more experimental and improvisational, and less song-oriented than LTE 1 and far moreso than anything Dream Theater has done. If you think Live at the Marquee is DT's best work, you'll love this CD. If you are looking for great, well structured five-minute songs, buy a DT album; if you are looking for one of the best improvisional and experimental jazz-prog fusion albums ever recorded, despite its occasional lapses into Heraclitean musical trances of self-awe, buy LTE 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are great!","review":"If you liked the first one, you will probably like the second. The composition, and lyrical voice present in this cd is great. Everytime I listen to it I find something new to like. To me that is the sign of true craftmanship, and these guys have it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Fantastic","review":"This supergroup feauturing Dream Theater members and bass pro Tony Levin are a breath of fresh fusion and prog. All instrumental and wondeful from start to finish. In short, if you like prog and a bit of fusion, this will blow your mind. All it takes is to put on track one and you will be hooked. Word of warning for musicians, this cd may be very costly to you. Why, because after you listen, you may throw your guitar or bass against the wall!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These Guys Really Know How to Blast!","review":"This CD is awesome! I've had it for quite a while and I still enjoy listening to it! I'm a drummer, so I got the CD because Mike Portnoy is an extrordinary drummer. I later found out how impressive everyone else is! Tony Levin blasts out heavy destorted bass methods while playing along with John Petrucci, whose fingers must be faster than a jackhammer in his riffs! Jordan Rudess synthesizes in the back ground, while Mike Portnoy keeps a really solid beat while throwing in amazing fills! GET THIS CD! IT IS AMAZING, ESPECIALLY IF YOUR A MUSICIAN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When the water breaks...","review":"Giving birth includes pleasure, pain and a whole lot of pushing. If the first LTE release was the energy and power of conception, LTE 2 is the actual birth experience. The musicians are four of the best currently working in the industry and their respective skills are in full evidence with LTE 2. The 1970's progressive rock influences, from Deep Purple to King Crimson, are woven throughout. But birth brings with it some structure as opposed to wild abandon, and there are passages that feel forced (can I say over-labored?) as opposed to letting the music find it's own path. Still, LTE remains the best of the Portnoy side projects and this album has enough juicy parts to make it a must. Maybe it's not a coincidence the John Petrucci's wife gave birth during the recording sessions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loses a Star Because It Has Some Filler.","review":"Like Liquid Tension Experiment 1, some of the work on this album amounts to just hitting the record button and jamming without much thought. As far as what I have heard, at the point at which this album was created, though Dream Theater could be considered masters of metal, they were not masters of jazz. In fact, when improvising in their live music, it sounds like they still have a lot to learn. That said, really this album is an impromptu jam, with some more structured songs mixed in. As is typical of Dream Theater, the more structured songs sound orders of magnitude better than the impromptu jams. At this time, one of the better jam bands out there, Liquid Tension Experiment was not. Yet, there are some masterpieces on this album, and it deserves everyone one of its 4 stars for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this band","review":"I grew up on Yes, Pink Floyd, Rush, ELP and Jethro Tull, among others. I was fortunate to cut my teeth on bands with REAL musicians who didn't rely on studio tricks to sell their product. Liquid Tension Experiment is a recent and very lucky \\"find\\" on my part. Thanks to You Tube I stumbled across this band and immediately came to Amazon to buy everything they had produced. They're lumped into metal, but they are so far above what you generally think of with that label, that there should be another category. Incredible talent on every instrument. I haven't taken the CD out of my player since I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although not as good as LTE 1, this album still is good","review":"I don't know if the novelty is wearing off for me, but this album didn't do anything the first didn't.

If you own LTE-1, save you're money. LTE-2 is all energy but no melody. The first five tracks on LTE-1 are progressive masterpeices.

I picked up an earlier version in a cut-out bin for only five euros, but now I wouldn't trade it for all the tea in China.What makes this recording so great is not only Hank Jones's masterful playing, but the wonderful arrangements for string quartet by the brilliant Dominican Republic-born arranger and conductor, the late Manny Albam.This is beautiful music from the first track to the last, and I dare say you will never have heard anything like it.Now that's high praise, indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What I Ordered","review":"The picture appears to have a pulse oximetry with it; which it did not.

I ordered a large, as I am a large in every other brand including other Columbia product lines, but this shirt was so big I could fully loaded ruck sack underneath it!!Seriously, it is at least one size larger than labeled but I would venture to say it might even be 2 sizes too large.

What they call XL everyone else calls 2XL or even 3XL. I could have fit two of me in there. So, order a size smaller than what you wear! Sent XL back and received the L and it fits wonderfully!

I admire this brotha, cuz he kept it real, because you really get a sense that this CD came from HIM. Most of today's music is okay, but to me, true beauty lies in originality.

It's insulting. When you add a mini-sub docking to a larger one without so much of a ping heard in the target sub, even the base premise for the book falls through.Of course, it's the only way for Mercurio to bugle his hero like John Wayne in a bad western.

I'm looking for a shorter term to name this genre so that perhaps I will be given official credit. The Pleasure of My Company falls into this category, yet also rises above it in spite of its brevity.

As others have mentioned, it's a quick and easy read and worth the short investment of time required.Steve Martin develops an interesting character, and the story twists a number of unexpected ways.If you enjoyed this you must read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon -- a similar but far superior book (and that's not a knock on The Pleasure of My Company)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sympathetic character","review":"I love a book where there is so much care given the careful choice of words, the construction of a sentence, the irony of a situation, and the love of the characters.Daniel Cambridge is the unusual subject and teller of his own story, that of an obsessive-compulsive man looking for a meaningful relationship and life from a base in his Santa Monica apartment.Daniel lives much of his life vicariously, but eventually ventures out of his fantasies and into the world. Steve Martin has written a well crafted tale with wit and great observation of what it is to be human."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Having been a huge fan of Steve Martin since his first appearance on Saturday Night Live, I was bowled over by this book. His keen observations and hilarious descriptions of events and people had me in tears at several points and at others I wanted to weep in sympathy for the hero of the book. I have since read Shopgirl and found it to be nearly as entertaining but in a different way. I hope Steve Martin continues to write and hope he will one day write a full-length novel to prolong the fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding how the mind works","review":"Knowing and loving someone with OCD I found this book like looking into a mirror of my life. I think anyone that has had a relationship with a person who's life is challenged by this disorder will find that Steve Martin's story helps in understanding how the mind of your loved one works, and how strangth can be found in the smallest things to fight the biggest battles (like curbs). I thank Mr. Martin for writting this book and giveing others a look at what life is like for many living in a world controlled by obsessive thoughts and the peopel that love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exageration of everyones inner-dialogue","review":"This book was fantastic. Some have said that the lead character isn't likeable...likeable or not, Martin has created a character that simply magnifies all that lives in each of us. Anyone that feels they occasionally live inside their own head a little too much will fall over laughing while also starting to wonder if they are truly neurotic, not normal, while reading this book. The ending is fantastic...Martin is great with words, incredibly humorous, but also has something to say. I was very surprised with how deeply this little book touched me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure","review":"I wasn't too sure what to expect. However, I started reading this book and thought, \\"what a messed up guy\\". I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful snippet of a book...","review":"Having just finished a very heavy novel, I wanted something light to read. This book fit perfectly. You can't help but cheer and feel sorry for neurotic Daniel Pecan Cambridge at the same time. His life, though mostly confined to his apartment, is full of unexpected challenges. I found myself rooting for his success throughout his quest to break free."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superbly crafted character study","review":"Steve Martin's, 'The Please of My Own Company,\\" reads like an exquisitely crafted character study that a top-notch actor would create while prepping for a role. Readers are treated with colorfully fleshed out character portrayal, smidges of interesting backstory and a skeleton of a story that manages to keep things just interesting enough without bogging down the light, effervescent flow of Martin's prose. Martin also proves that he's quite adept at culling the inner-voice of his characters as he meticulously brings to life everey bit of minutiae involved in the thought process of an OCD riddled character attempting to overcome obstacle after obstacle (in this case figuring out how to cross the street, the right amount of light bulb wattage to keep lit, etc.). The end of the tale might come across as a bit too Hollywood in its payoff but nonetheless it satisfied and made for a great read on a 2 1/2 hour flight across 4 states."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadfully disappointing after \\"Shopgirl\\"","review":"I couldn't get past the first 20 pages or so of this book. I really enjoyed Steve Martin's first novella, \\"Shopgirl,\\" and expected the same or better from his second effort. Unfortunately, Martin doesn't deliver here. When an author can't grab you within the first 10% of a book, there isn't much point in wasting any more time. If you haven't read \\"Shopgirl,\\" *DO*, but don't bother with \\"The Pleasure of My Company.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"All Gloss","review":"If people could actually read this objectively without being enthralled by the idea of reading someone who is a known \\"celebrity\\" (largest dust jacket photo I've seen in a while), no one outside of the staff of Musso & Frank's would read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get on the court in life!","review":"While I haven't read Steve Martin's first book, this book was horrible! I'm not interested in the thoughts and delusions of this character who's obsessions and psychoses rule his boring, mundane life. I'd rather read about someone who gets on the court and plays the game of life, not someone who lets life pass them by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasurable Reading","review":"This is a fun and witty novella from the perspective of a man living with OCD. I enjoyed the story and laughed out loud several times. I wasn't overwhelmingly impressed with the ending, but maybe only because I didn't think this was a love story and wasn't expecting it? In the end, its a worthy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Hilarious and Profoundly Moving","review":"The Pleasure of My Company really caught me off guard. Having read Martin's other books, Shopgirl and An Object of Beauty (both which I really loved, by the way) I decided to read this little novella. I'm so glad I did, because Daniel Pecan Cambridge, the main character, is the type of character that stays with you. He is highly flawed and has many OCD-like tendencies- the sort of person that society normally casts aside and labels as \\"freak\\". But Martin really gets into Daniel's head- and ultimately ours as he leads Daniel down a path where he fights to lead a life that is not dictated by quirky fears. There were many moments in this book where I literally laughed out loud- it is so humorous and heart warming and at the end I found myself welling with emotion- the proverbial lump in my throat that only occurs with the most prosaic of prose. 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sweetest book I've read in ages.","review":"I read this on audio and found it thoroughly charming. The main character is so odd and quirky and his little obsessions and thoughts about the women around him had me smiling all the way home (and that's a rarity as my drive is a nightmare!).Daniel, the narrator, has these odd little neurosis. He can't walk off a curb like most people (at least without a whole lot of anxiety), he has his house set up so that the bulb wattage equals a certain number at all times (this causes a major glitch when he attempts to have a little liaison with a lady who wants the lights dimmed) and he suffers a few other oddities that make his life quite difficult but also quite funny to those reading his tale. When he makes an attempt at running and soon after suffers the consequences it's hard not to laugh at his folly.This book was so very sweet and a pure pleasure to read. I'll have to look up more of Steve Martin's fiction"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel like a traitor...","review":"I tried to read this, but it didn't grab me. But since Steve MArtin is one of my favorite actors/comedians, I thought that maybe listening to the audio book, read by the author would do the trick. I listened to 3 our of 4 CDs, which is more than I'd read. Try as I might, I just found Daniel's neuroses and compulsive behaviors more disturbing than funny. Forgive me, Steve MArtin. May I be a fan of your theatre, and not your books?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pecan Delight","review":"The main character's name is Daniel Pecan Cambridge, who suffers from a case of OCD-on-steroids, is a victim of a Mensa administrative screw up and has a penchant for opposing driveways as well as Kinko's copiers. It just can't get any better!This story is a welcome break from reality into Daniel's reality. It's a light, fun as well as funny read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant characterization","review":"A friend had this book sent to me from Amazon. I wasn't sure I wanted to read it because he said it was funny and since I prefer to read literary works I was dubious about the writing. What a pleasant surprise it was to find it was a very well written portrayal of a transformation. The evolution of the protagonist from a frightened person who lives a limited life, ensnared by his neurosis, to someone whose life gradually blossoms to one of possibilities is finely crafted in this story.One does this book a disservice by referring to it as simply a comedy.Kudos to Steve Martin"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty boring","review":"I found the book rather timid and boring, with trite situations and surface psychology that didn't really delve into anything profound. The main character is basically Forest Gump, but with an uneventful life and no discerning characteristics to make him interesting. I thought the title and cover art were interesting, and those were the reasons I checked it out. It was a mistake. I still think Steve Martin is a great comedian, but this book has made me wish that he would stick to his strengths."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good read","review":"Love this man as a comedian, an actor, anything \\"live\\", not so much as an author. Is this the same guy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the most likeable main character","review":"As with other reviewers, I was seduced by Steve Martin as author as well as the joy I found reading Shopgirl. Alas, there is no joy in Daniel Pecan Cambridge's world for him or for me. I didn't find the prose that humorous at all, and the main character was rather pathetic. And not in a sad, I feel sorry for him, way. Mostly I found him annoying. I felt like slapping him and saying, you dolt, it's just a curb, step over it and get on with your life. Moments were amusing, but with the central character being quite unlikeable, I found the reading a chore and I just didnt care what happened to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a bad version of \\"The Jerk\\"","review":"This literary version of \\"The Jerk\\" never gets going for me. It starts off as a monologue and since I know Steve Martin wrote it the image I got in my head is of Steve on stage telling me this story. Once a few characters are introduced they have no depth or real life. As the books goes on the story never progresses. The main character has no conflicts to change is character. He has a few obsessive compulsive issues to deal with but they mysterously dissolve by the end of the book. I found the ending to be particularly bad. The main character's problems are solved and he finds true love in a terrible final 10 pages. This was a story about a wierd guy who has some mildly humurous episodes and then gets better. Who cares?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful.","review":"First of all, this book is laugh out loud funny. But it is also wonderfully touching, something that I didn't entirely expect. I found myself crying at the finale, I was so moved by the characters and how it wraps up. Steve Martin weaves a simple, captivating tale here that is just the right length. It neither overstays its welcome, nor does it leave the reader upset for more. I loved it, and expect that others will feel the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"Quirky is the word for this novella. The title character is definitely not your average person. Through clever writing, the reader becomes emotionally involved and roots for him.

Our conundrums in using and understanding electronic media are laid out in suprising parallels to those faced by Plato, Isocrates and other Classical Greeks when they made the mind-boggling shift from a culture of memory and oratory to texts written on paper in the Fifth Century, BCE. Recognizing movie, TV and computer screens as anything but neutral technologies, Welch formulates the Next Rhetoric, Electric Rhetoric, as what is coming (or already here) after Post-Modernism. She makes visionary recommendations for managing these media in modern life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electric Rhetoric Review","review":"This book was the most difficult book I have ever read. The author clearly was writing this book for someone who has extensive background knowledge on classic rhetoric and Isocrates. She uses words that don't appear in any normal dictionary and confuse even the most advanced polyglot. Don't kid yourself, this is a tough book to read, my advice is to find a different way to get your information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Become a drumaholic.","review":"This was the first Buddy Rich album I ever bought, in fact it was one of the first albums I ever bought, period. As a young percussionist (not drummer) I was searching for some purpose for the music I was playing. Some definition of what it was to be a musician from a percussion standpoint. That definition was certainly not going to be found in mainstream music or even in classical music.My search lead me to Buddy Rich and, by complete luck, I stumbled onto this album. It was exactly what I needed, what I wanted, what I was searching for. It showcased Buddy's enormous talent without leaving the rest of the band, and music, far behind. Too often is the case that so much emphasis is placed on Buddy that it is hard for a young percussionist to relate to Buddy and his place in the scope of the band and music. This album is very balanced, yet allows the listener to easily hear the talent of the world's greatest percussionist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this !","review":"This is so horrible that it's laughable.The pressure to change style in 70's and become the new Buddy Rich to target the new generation comes across as a make it up as we go along Jazzrock Funky Blues sound which makes a jazz fan want to puke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive influenced showing","review":"When listening to this CD, you will undoubtedly hear the influence of Dream Theater, Fates Warning, and even a bit of U2 thrown in there. Does Dali's Dilemma develop their own sound on this CD? I think after a few listenings, you will come to realize that they're starting to form the core of what they'll become.In the meantime, if you appreciate the influences listed above, you will enjoy this CD. I find myself listening to it more often, and enjoying it more each time. It is strong lyrically, musically, and conceptually. With all the right influences, they take what they've learned and keep it fresh. You won't feel like you're listening to a rip-off of another band. You'll feel like this group knows what it likes, and knows how to make their music around that framework."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Tripe................","review":"I thought 'progressive' meant 'to progress'; not imitate Dream Theater.

But in my view there is much more important stuff on this planet: Arcturus, Opeth, Nevermore, Mekong Delta, Therion,... Dream Theater themselves for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood works it's \\"magic\\"","review":"This is a prime example of Hollywood taking a successful cult film and making a sequel that doesn't have any of the attributes that made the original so good. It's also a prime example of Hollywood throwing a lot of money at a project without earmarking some of it for a decent script. Did the filmmakers get greedy or lazy? It's hard to tell. Probably both. Even if you conveniently forget this is a sequel and try to look at it as a standalone movie, it's still missing a lot. Like a plot.

It centers around 4 \\"fans\\" of the first Blair Witch film who spend the night in the woods to see if the Blair Witch story is true.

When I saw the first Blair Witch in the theater I wanted to know what really happened right after they got stuck in that creepy house at the end of the movie.

The movie will constantly have you guessing, which isn't always good. You may find yourself lost due to the constant jumping, which really kills some great angles they were working.

I am so glad I did not go to the theatre to see this sequel (how can this actually be called a sequel?). I rented it and I also saw why this movie did not create such buzz as the first movie. I thought this movie seemed to mainstream and aimed towards teens like your average teen horror. I felt like it took away from the power of the first blair witch. It just seemed so out of place and not as believable as the first one. If you loved the first blair with project, chances are you might now like this one, or if you are a serious die-hard fan, you may like it. If you didn't like the first blair witch project, you may think this one is either better or much more worse. I liked the first one and thought this one was a whole lot worse.

There were a couple good scenes in the first movie however I found myself feeling betrayed by all the hype and not really scared at all. The strongest feeling I recall from #1 was wanting to punch that whiney girl in the face while she was crying in the camera. This movie however I found a few chilly scenes a nice camp fire bloodbath and true to any demonic/devil worship/witch craft....the infomous playing of the tape backwards scene....I prefer this over the first one any day as the only enjoyment I got out of number one was hanging stick men in the woods and then tricking friends to come out there with me...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sequel","review":"This movie got some bad reviews.. and the only reason i can think why is because people were dissapointed that it wasnt the same format as the first movie... well wake up people, they couldnt do that again.. it would be pointless. so they attempted to make a 'real' movie this time, but based on real life events that followed when the first movie was released. this is really a great movie and it really makes you think at the end. just what is the truth?"},{"rating":"1","title":"There is to many things wrong with this to even begin","review":"This is your typical horror sequel. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can not even begin to describe it.

From there we are overwhelmed with random scenes of violence, nudity, gore, and stupidity. THere are around 8 killings which ranks up to a typical 80's slasher film.I don't even know who stars in thsi piece of trash. Obviously peopl who can't act because it is that bad.The movie stole effect ideas primarily from Event Horizon, House on Haunted Hill, and Blair Witch 1 and it is easily obviouse that they stole effects ideas from other movies as well.To wrap things up simply avoid this movie, it is not worth the time or effort to sit through and watch.

Was this a comedy? Was this a statement against violence in movies? It sure wasn't a worthy sequel to the original BWP. It didn't capture any of the same mood, wasn't consistent at all with any of the atmosphere in the first movie, and sure as heCK didn't capture any of the pure terror that was so evident in the first movie. So what does this film do? It might keep you guessing as to when there's a scare, but there aren't any scares. It might try and make you care about the characters, but none of them are worth the viewer's time. It might attempt to get you sucked into a plot that is never explained and completely shot to heCK by the terrible ending. The beginning of the film is however an excellent piece of filmmaking, the rest though is just crap. Stick with Metallica Some Kind of Monster for a good Joe Berlinger movie.

I thought this because; this isn't low-budget like the first one. Also because it says this one is completely fictional. As I progressed through this film, I found it non-scary and just pointless. However after I watched the ending to this film I was amazed. I thought to myself \\"How could the ending have so much creativity, but the rest of the film dosen't at all?\\" I enjoyed only one portion of this film and that was the ending.

The film does have some visual value, but not even close enough to save the movie. The acting is not top class, the film is horribly directed and the scripting is awful. It's really difficult to come up with a worse way to sequelize such a fantastic film. This movie does not have the eerie feeling or the after-viewing effect as The Blair Witch Project did, and with movies like that, both of those have to be there, or you'll end up with a lifeless, useless, sod of a film.

The only part I enjoyed would have to be the opening 10 minutes where the film shows the hype of the original, however from there it quickly becomes b-grade trash. How many times does a character really need to say \\"That's impossible!!\\"??The actors are annoying, the violence is too obligitory to be disturbing or creepy, and the plot is just too confusing to even bother trying to figure out.

Instead of a \\"horrormentary,\\" this is a straightforward psychological thriller which jars the narrative with hallucinogenic red herrings and fantasies that may or may not be clues to what is going on.There is also some wit in the film's conceit, which centers on a young man who makes money off the BLAIR WITCH phenomenon by selling merchandise and giving tours of the woods.Unfortunately, the characters are so hokey and two-dimensional there is little suspense for them. One simply waits to see how the film will play out. Also, the sequel is taking what plays like a conscious slap at critics of the first film who protested the stereotyping of witches, by feasting up an even bigger stereotype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been..","review":"I truly don't know what to say about this movie!

You waste most of the time trying to focus on what is happening because from the first ten minutes you keep seeing flashes from parts of the movie that took place prior and after where you at! And you fail to get the picture until the end.2. The suspense of the movie is ONLY in the first half hour (while in the woods) but afterwards; both suspense and thrill are lost.3. There is no scary OST in the film that can drive the thrill up.4. The actors fear and reaction was not convincing (except at the police station / at the end of the movie).5.

There's way too much overacting from them. There's also way too many pointless scenes like the ghost girl. The movie also never explains about the some plotholes like the ghost girl,scenes fo people getting killed,how the goth girl can see into the future and most of all,The Book of Shadows.

It feels sturdy enough (lightweight aluminum). My only complaint is how the trigger part is underneath the neck, which gets in the way with some chords (E7 or F#m) but not a tremendous burden. Also, the padding that goes against the back of the neck seems a bit hard for a relatively new capo.

It was out of print for years. I envy the readers who can now buy this newly printed copy. I had to make due with a decades old moldy copy that fell apart as I read it. Not that I'm complaining--I loved the book! Le Carre knows his spy stuff. This is not some techno-filled, action-packed, lets-throw-in-a-plot-twist-for-the-h@ll-of-it book. This is a tightly-packed page turner that will lead you by the hand in the beginning and then drop a piano on you at the end. Le Carre's heroes are not Bond, they are overworked, overweight, underpaid, highly intelligent characters who love their country. This book was one of Le Carre's first books, and I feel his very best. The \\"winners\\" and \\"losers\\" are blurred in the spy game, and this book clearly illustrates that point.

The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a heartbreaking story, full of lonely people sadly making their way through a cold world - the Cold War was never more chilly than it is here. It's a sad and depressing book, but a smashingly good one, too. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic. Of course.","review":"If you read spy fiction your really should read at least of few of le Carre's books. There's a quiet brooding style he has that really puts him in the literature class, as opposed to the Bond stuff. Also, le Carre really knows his stuff. Excellent novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly edited Walker Hardcover","review":"Great novel, lousy edition. I counted six typos on the first ten pages alone (\\"boot\\" instead of \\"booth,\\" \\"the\\" instead of \\"they,\\" etc.). Stay away from Walker & Company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather stay in the warm","review":"I brought this novel having not read a spy novel before. But the le Carre books have always caught my eye with their mystique and the acclaim that its garnished from reviewers. I was pretty dissapointed. le Carre is certainly a gifted writer and the style of his writing leads to a shrouded, gritty urban atmosphere that lends well to a spy novel. However, the plot was pretty mundane and by halfway through the book it was becoming a real labour to finish and I was well past the point of caring about the outcome. For anyone who is a keen reader of espionage fiction this is probably the book for them. For myself, a novice in the world of spy fiction, I found it mundane and ultimately forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best","review":"This is a \\"must-read\\" for spy novel enthusiasts. It is at the top of his novels that I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Writing & Gripping Story!","review":"This was my first book to read in the top 10 bestsellers of the year I was born, 1964. Wow, what a compelling read! I didn't know what I was in store for. At first, I thought it started slow, but it increased from there and built till the climactic ending! If you haven't read this book, you should! It is a fantastic spy story. I saw the movie shortly after reading this with Robert Mitchum, who played a wonderful lead in the story. This should be a must for everyone above the age of 15, even if it is just for education purposes but is is exciting as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must","review":"It's a very interesting book an you can't stop reading it. The central figure is Leamas, a secret agent. After he lost all his agents in East Germany he got a new job to do- he became a defector. The reader too can't trust all the persons and till the end you don't know on which side the agents are. When you read a spy story for the first time, it's a bit complicated. I can really recommend this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic...fascinating","review":"Those who like their spy aristocratic, romantic, brimming with boyish charm, and with ever a clever remark or sexual pun up his Armani sleeve should run--fast--from this book. For le Carre is a realist spy novelist with little interest in how many willing damsels his hero can bag, and less interest in crafting a spy that would be capable of such seduction anyway. But he has written the best novel ever about spies who would not be spies, everyday people except with guns and fancy cars, who are burned out with all of the killing but are tragically too good at it to escape the game. Possibly, it is just the best novel about spies ever, period. Alec Leamas is James Bond without charm, good looks, unflappable bravado, and humor: in short, he is an ordinary man.But The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is no ordinary spy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I could write like John le Carre","review":"I found myself rereading pages just amazed at his spare and direct prose.The story is frustrating and sad. It shows how the use of double agents compromises everyone. It reveals the spy trade deployed to protect us as devious and amoral capable of destroying honest, passionate and well meaning citizens in its effort to protect its agents.The cold war is long over and the Berlin wall is gone. For those of us who came of age in those years, especially those with relatives behind the Iron Curtain the book feels like an icy hand around your heart.A brilliant and chilling book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very strong story with the complexity and atmosphere that satisfies","review":"A classic story of the grey world of spies brought to a stunning climax. I think one of le Carre's better books before he went off the deep end of world conspiracies and evil capitalist plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Le Carré's best work...","review":"Quite frankly, I don't understand why this book is lauded as Le Carré's greatest novel. It seems that the only purpose of this novel is to show us how immoral espionage is and to show how know in the Cold War was \\"right\\". However, it does this by long and boring dialogues throughout the protagonist's many interrogations. By the time the book starts to pick up, it seems Le Carré decides he has said enough and rather abruptly ends it. If you want a better example of Le Carré's work stick to Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and the other books in that series"},{"rating":"1","title":"The spy who came in from the cold","review":"worst condition book I have ever seen. Pages fell out as I readwas lucky to finish. Book is in trashwould never buy from him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel cold","review":"The cold in the title is spot on, this story left my cold (purposefully, I'm sure). The characters were either too cynical or had motivations I was unable to sympathize with, like the girl, who was a member of the communist party but in truth just wanted to get a husband. The book was very clear on that, she was as ordinary as it gets. Communists just recited typical communist propaganda, with a touch of nazism once in a while, and were hardly fascinating as the opponents. The ending was unsurprising, because it was obvious that one of two alternatives was true, and it wasn't even possible to admire the cold cleverness of the story. I don't know how it would puzzle anyone, even though the reviews say otherwise. If it had been a true story, at least I would know how espionage was really like. As a work of fiction I couldn't find anything in it to love, the characters or the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful!","review":"This has to be one of the most overrated books of all tme.

It focusses only on people's expressions and feelings rather than a proper plot line. Waste of time to read :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic","review":"To treat his classic novel purely as a spy novel is to miss the point. It is classic book in the true sense of the word. A book that will endure for a very long time indeed.The work may be rooted in the Cold War and reflective of Le Carre's own experiences but it does not due justice to read the work at such a superficial level. As Leamas states, 'I do not deal in black and whites'. This theme gives the book greater depth than any spurious comparison to James Bond.I thoroughly recommend this book. Read it as a thriller if you must - better to appreciate it as the idea that at some time all of us need at some time to 'come in from the cold'. Even if it is to ask for redemption on our deathbeds. If you find it a little confusing bear with it and I recommend that your next read should be CS Lewis's The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Book,","review":"I rate this as a good book, not a great book only because it could have ended better for me. Would like to see a re-make of the movie. It had some twist and turn for sure, but if you read it passionately you can sort of see what is coming, a good read, not great, but worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Quintessential Cold War Novel","review":"John le Carre gives us a serious and gritty cold war era spy novel with \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\". The main character is an agent in Berlin who is recalled to London after his last contact is killed at the Berlin Wall. What follows is a spy plot that follows the main character through the depths of humanity and intrigue. This novel is so well written that you feel the emotions, paranoia, depression and anxiety of cold war Europe in the 1960s. This is no James Bond novel: no sexy heroine, no fancy casinos and hotels, no witty phrases, no implied sex on a sunny beach. This novel is a hard core look at the spy business that pulls no punches and spares none of the innocent. This truely is the best spy novel ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"a memorable read","review":"Although published many years ago, this book still holds up well in its depiction of the murky, treacherous world of espionage. LeCarre is still the best at the spy thriller game."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book that Made Le Carre Famous","review":"This is the one that made LeCarre's name. It is a dark look at the horrible machinations of the KGB and MI6 at the height of the cold war, and the price that a number of foot soldiers in that war paid. This book sets the form that LeCarre will work to perfection until the collapse of the Soviet Union - damaged British agents versus evil communists with a fair amount of innocents on both sides getting taken down in the whole mess. It's a great read, you should check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"John le Carre's Spy novel","review":"John Lecarré describes a world that seems altogther different from our own, but yet it feels very real. His world is one without mercy or forgiveness. The book is chilling at times, but the films based on his books are not nearly as terrifying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Cold war Spy Story","review":"The book that really launched le Carre's career as a writer is a classic of the 'spy genre', but also demonstrates why that genre produces so many excellent writers - le Carre, Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, Alan Furst, and Robert Littel to name a few. Human desires, principles, compromises, morality, amorality, and sexuality are all on display.The Spy Who Came in From the Cold set the standard for the multi-layered spy novel. As the story unfolds, the reader must attempt to decide what is really going on. Is Alec Leamas really a defector or on a covert deception mission? Does he really know fully what he is doing? Is East German counter-intelligence master, the despicable Mundt, the target of the deception or is he really an English spy? Is it a double-game? A triple-play? Is Leamas really in love?Highest recommendation for fans of the spy genre or fine writing anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Complex Web","review":"Le Carre's masterpiece is so layered and so complex that it almost takes two readings to understand. This is the best espionage thriller of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful critique of espionage","review":"The spy games portrayed in this book are not like James Bond. There are no card games or cocktail parties, and no novel weapons and fancy gadgets. Instead, there are intelligent people playing mind games with each other, each only knowing a part of the whole story.The common theme throughout this book is that in the world of espionage, the ends justify the means. That ideals are an unnecessary burden that must be discarded in order to succeed. This message has just as much relevance today as it did when it was written; it's an interesting exercise to imagine this taking place with modern day terrorists rather than East Germans.Overall, if you are looking for pulse-pounding action, look elsewhere. If you are looking for a fast, gripping read that makes you think, this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"So it was an amazing television for my bedroom at first; although, I agree the sound design and the speaker system was not top quality.

What's the point of having the TV if you can't hear it while you are on an exercise machine or my son is playing on the floor.Now, the picture turns off for no reason. The screen just goes black like you have turned it off. Not gray, black. Sometimes, it returns to normal after you switch the TV off and on about five times. The sound still stays on though. It drives my 3-year old son crazy especially if he is watching his favorite show.Whatever you do, spend your money on something else. This TV is not worth the headache.

One person pointed out that you can hook it up to an external sound system.Not actually. This TV lacks the standard Audio Out jacks. There is no RCA audio outjack. Not even a headset jack.This TV does have a digital audio out jack - so you could use it with a modern surround sound system. Unfortunately, that's not what we have. People who want to hook up a simple headphone, or a wireless headphones, or regular stereo speakers are out of luck.We have called Sharp product support and verified that this is true. They provide no workaround or explanation for this omission.This is a show-stopper for us. My wife likes to watch TV over her wireless headphones while I fall asleep. A TV without audio jacks is out of the question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound - Stay Away!!!","review":"Great picture, wish I could actually hear the program. The sound is so low even at maximum output that I couldn't even use it. If you're hooking it up to a stereo so you don't need the tv speakers you still need to be careful. The only audio output is digital so you better have a digital input. You could run the sound from your cable box to your external speakers but the problem there is you won't be able to use that set-up when watching a DVD which you probably want to do since you bought a TV with a built in DVD player.Since the product can't be returned (thanks Amazon!) I now need to spend money on a cable box and external speakers and forget about ever using the internal DVD player which is going to run me about $300 bucks plus the monthly lease fee on the cable box. My good deal just became not so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost not useable","review":"yes the picture is very good. Yes, it looks very nice. The audio output is so poor it renders it nearly useless. And because it has no conventional audio out plugs I can't do anything about it.

It's fine for DVD's but when watching my cable channels the audio is so low I have to turn it all the way up to maximum to hear normal audio.

So, I pulled the back cover off the set and installed a female 1/8 inch stereo phone jack (Radio Shack part number; 274-0246). I wired it directly to the TV's speakers using bell-wire (from an old telephone cord). Then simply plugged in a PC sound system I had laying around. It works wonderfully and it was easy to do. Just use the wire diagram on the phone jack package and connect to the marked terminals on each speaker of the set.

Papa unapologetically presents characters who do bad things. Some people have cited the racial slurs and the crimes the characters commit as problematic, but Hemingway displays these things without condoning them. He isn't writing what is good and bad. He is writing what happens. These things happen. People hate. people kill. People become desperate. Hemingway is at heart a reporter and he has crafted a tremendous story and a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MANY AT SLOPPY JOE'S?","review":"This is nowhere as good as Islands in the Stream. The story is in the first 123 pages. Racist labelings apart, the prose is quite gripping up to that point. Then the protagonist Cap'n Harry Morgan gets forgotten and some drunk and not very interesting characters squabble in the bar and in the bedroom, who really have very little to do with the plot, except to justify the title (these are the Have's). Harry Morgan is basically a good, hard-livin' guy who likes to drink and fish (like Hemingway), but it's as though the author ran out of steam with him. A deeper plot, with less time gaps and jumping about between characters might have made this a much better novel, but you'll find trademark H. understatement and great descriptions of the sea, especially of a marlin jumping out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"The book is an action-packed thriller that has bootlegging, aiding illegal immigrants, and assisting foreign revolutionaries in a bank robbery. Harry Morgan, a middle age owner and a captain of a boat, living in peace time Florida, is faster moving than either Robert Jordan of \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" or Frederick Henry of \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", both young military commanders in a war zone. Being less of a positive hero, Harry can be more colorful. The supporting cast is no less vibrant, and even the patchwork of new characters introduced at the end of the novel feels of a piece, if a bit schematic.The novel is a quick read. The combination of simple language sporting an occasional twist, rapidly unfolding plot and memorable characters makes it an easily enjoyable reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"no matter how you cut it an amazing read.","review":"in between the maserpoieces of for whom the bell tolls and the sun also rises there is the middele ground and in that middle ground lies the rest of his great novels. and in this many one of them is to have and have not. if you are looking to read hemmingway at his grittiest and definetly enjoyning the grand gift of story telling dont miss this. it is missed by many people so make an effort to read this. it will deefinettly have you thinking afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of his better novels","review":"This is definitely not one of Hemingway's better novels.

Don't look for happy endings but you'll certainly enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable reading","review":"This book, which you can't help but feel is closely modeled on a period of Hemingway's own life, is most revealing in the portrayal of the lifestyles of the rich and unemcumbered of the mid-20th century. Based in France and Spain it follows a group of friends travelling to bull fights and idyllic fishing spots and explores the friendships and jealousies between the group.In my opinion, not as good as 'For Whom The Bell Tolls', but also a far different story and different type of novel.An easy, enjoyable read, but not Hemingway's greatest work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting a Flawed Classic","review":"Interesting to revisit this book after many years passing since I first read it. It's particularly interesting to read Hemingway's view of the Cuban revolution in the making, as well as getting a view of the violence in the background of those times when Cuba was a \\"playground\\" for some pretty unsavory types. Though it probably is one of Hemingway's worst, it still has its moments--thin characters and all. This is one of the few books where I'd say the movie was better. Bogart did it justice. Still...it's a damn good book by most anyone's standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deep Account of Real Life","review":"Hemingway is known for his simple, easy-to-read writing style, but everything he writes goes much deeper than the oceans he writes about. This book, as is common with his other books, tells about the struggles of trying to make it through life, and how one has to play with the hand he's given. Everyone has to put up with hardships in life, some more than others, but everyone has to learn how to deal with them because there's not much they can do to change their lives. \\"To Have and Have Not\\" is a very realistic account of life. It will leave you contemplating about life in general, and make you realize many new things that you may not have thought about before. Though it wasn't given very good reviews by critics, and is not considered one of Hemingway's major novels, it is a book for the person out there who loves to find the significance in seemingly insignificant things put in there by an ingenius author."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Have and Have Not: It just doesn't have it","review":"Harry Morgan is a poorly developed charcter. It is difficult to really sympethize with him. He has financial problems but doesn't just turn to smuggling, but murder. Reading a book without being able to sympethize with any character can be tedious. Hemingway may have been trying to show what happens to a man when society pushes him into poverty. The problem is that Morgan has no virtue at any point. Probably Hemingway's worst character."},{"rating":"1","title":"To have and have not","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever read. He must have been drunk when he wrote it. I find it very choppy and inane. The characters and plots are started and never developed. Incidents begin in the middle of an event and end abruptly.

All the great ones have done that, this is simply one that reaches out for something new. This DVD has great video, great sound, here is the but, all this faux piano and bass give the music a synthesized sound. The free jazz movement has no continuity, no form. If you enjoy that, this is for you. However, the last two concerts are a save. The 91 concert brings the accoustical back. the second has Herbie Hancock playing some guitar like electronic thingy that sounds electronic. Again, if this is your bag, great!. The last two tracks from 92 bring Ron Carter on bass, Tony Williams on drums, and a great trumpeter, (no name on box), with Herbie on, a real piano. These last two are great for those of us that like that straight ahead sound, but still avant garde. Not a terrible DVD, just not one that I will reach for very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been waiting for this for decades.","review":"I saw Wayne Shorter's fusion group in 1987 when he opened for Chick Corea's Elektric Band.

Content-wise it told me all about Jerry to the nth degree. In a trite, trivial voice! Oh, it could have been a contender. It could have been wonderful because the follow-a-manager-for-a-year angle is cool. But the problem is Ms. Baker doesn't know how to tell an exciting story, a story with moments and dialogue and emotion. Instead, she transcribes facts! The pacing is turtle-slow, and the writer tries far too hard to be clever by saying things with icky cliches and similies. I wanted to take a pen and edit. I'm sorry to sound harsh that's not my intention because I really think it's not all the author's fault. The editors were asleep. Needs more white space and more pronouns instead of \\"Jerry this\\" and \\"Jerry that.\\" Nothing fresh, not even a bit twisted. Sigh.

This book has all the elements for a truly fun read but as previous reviewers have stated is simply lacking in the execution. As a market watcher for 15 years I assumed that following a fund manager around during one of the most fascinating years in market history would translate well. But the book gives virtually no information about how industry professionals viewed these events, or even a nugget or two of new information or perception. Instead we hear streams of one-sided phone conversations and crib notes of market banter that are unintelligible even if you fully understand the jargon. If you are looking for an entertaining book about the stock market, look elsewhere. If you are considering a career in money management and want to understand the day to day drudgery, this may be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical banausic tripe","review":"...I have to admit that I was quite disappointed.

If yourbackground is not in finance or if you have no clue as to what Portfolio Managers do, you will find this book somewhat interesting, but if you are like me, and you know a little bit about the stock market, you'll be truly disappointed. The story doesn't have a high, it doesn't get to a climax whatsoever. The story goes on to describe the daily life of an unknown Portfolio Manager. And it does just that. Each chapter starts with \\"It's monday.....\\". As for style is concerned, I'm just coming off reading \\"The Tortilla Curtain\\" from Tom Boyle and let me tell you, Molly Baker is no match. The words are uninspired, boring just like the story. It seems that Molly Baker has a technical writing background and it shows in the book.

Make sure the apples are cooked all the way through. Hard apples will not process.I bought the additional attachments, primarily for salsa. It processes tomatoes well, just run them through twice to get the best yield. Three times and the skins start getting pushed through the screen.The suction cup device did not work for me. I use the clamp but this limits where you can use it.It is easy to setup and cleaning is not difficult. A bottle brush helps to clean the screens.Overall, the device was worth the purchase and I am happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to happy, returned","review":"This machine I think would work great for juices, however for even tomato sauce or salsa FORGET it. Even with the Salsa screen it only lets out juices with seeds. Even scraping off the screen with my finger, the amount of pulp that it lets through is not even enough for the tomato sauce I like. It also wastes a fair amount of your tomato's. My neighbor has one and tried to drill out a screen to 5/16\\" holes, but then it lets peeling's through."},{"rating":"2","title":"roma wonder mill","review":"Worked awesome. For the price cannot be beat. Grew up using food mill with mom. Was not a roma but did not want to pay the price of the one she has and this worked great. I can see the shaft seal needs to be lubricated often so does not get damaged. As per instructions I used vegetable oil but i think next time I will use plumbing grade silicon. Is safe for drinking water faucet gaskets so would work perfect for this application. Overall great product. I would recommended purchasing the kit with all strainers and augurs if you plan on using it for anything other than apple sauce or tomato sauce. Much cheaper that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke first try!","review":"I took all the parts out put it together and everything was just as pictured. Then I proceeded to put strawberries through so I could make seedless jam. It worked for about 10 mins then stopped turning.

Very disappointed in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does as says","review":"This product works well but I find that it is difficult to keep in place when using. Even with the clamp fastened, I found that the strainer would move around on me. I tried putting a towel down and even a rubber mat underneath the strainer and clamp but it still managed to loosen and move. It's a little tricky to hold the unit, turn the handle and also push the items through at the top. Might be better if you have someone to help. Also, when working with fresh quartered tomatoes, it's a little bit difficult to crank through the first time. I found that if you drop the tomatoes into boiling water for a few seconds, it will help to soften them which helps them pass through the strainer a little easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"ill-fitting, puny appliance","review":"Disappointed with this rather frail machine. It can't handle apples unless they are cooked to mush. The teflon washer bearing keeps getting entrained with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for canning","review":"I canned 250# of Roma tomatoes last fall with this and it powered through it great. For such big batches, I'd maybe think about using a stand mixer, but this works so well I'll just take the workout.I pretty much ran the discarded pulp through twice. There's some waste there it's probably worth the effort.It attaches to the counter well. The hopper is pretty good sized. It doesn't leak, which is a major concern for me. Just don't force things with the masher tool thing.There are a lot of parts and cleanup is a bit of a pain, so I wouldn't use this unless doing some major processing. Likely it will sit in storage until tomato time. The strainers I think are stainless so, they can go in the dishwasher fine. Not sure the actual body can. It looks like chrome metal.FWIW, the canned tomatoes make great pasta sauce, salsa, and chili. I doubt we'll go back to store can tomatoes again."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked great","review":"Used this for the first time today. Usually takes forever to make sauce between boiling, deseeding, cooking etc. All we did with this was wash the tomatoes (large cherry/small roma size) and drop them in! Awesome, cut a half day project into about 30 min. We also got the accessory pack. Made some salsa, but would recommend de-seeding first. Salsa attachment would be good for kind of a diced tomato sauce for things like chili. I'm going to get one of these for my stepmom for christmas it worked so great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for something better","review":"Instructions and hints and tips should be included.

We used the Roma Food/Vegatable Strainer to juice all those lovely red ripe fruits and canned jars and jars of sauce, ketchup, and tomato juice for the winter ahead. The Roma worked very well and made quick work of skinning and straining the tomatoes. It was easy to use, stayed where I put it with the suction on the counter, and the skins and juice separated nicely. The design makes it easy to place a large bowl to collect the juice and pulp and the skins and seeds dropped over the edge of the sink into the conpost bucket. I would recommend this for anyone who wants to preserve the harvest. We are looking forward to next spring and starting early with berries for jelly and using it all year long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I wasn't sure about the cost of this item, but wow has it paid for itself many times over! My suction cup doesn't hold very well either, however mine also came with a vice attachment that I use along with the suction cup. I found it works better on my dining table than on my counter top. I use this to make FAST and easy applesauce, pear sauce, really simple strawberry jelly (family hates the seeds in strawberry jam so this does the trick!), and everything that needs tomato sauce. It takes me no time to put together spaghetti sauce or enchilada sauce when canning season hits. And anything to make canning easier is great in my book! I can't say enough good about it. I've never had a problem with clean up. And my kids really enjoy getting to use this tool in our canning process. The only thing it lacks is a little better suction to hold to the counter or table, but with the vice attachment it isn't a problem. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robbie Williams is Uber cool","review":"This is a great DVD, perfect for those who want to show others who Robbie is.

We bought a replacement for about half the price, and it features 8 gigabit ports instead of just 2 that came with the Linksys. To be fair, the Linksys had a couple of port connections that the new switch does not have, but we didn't use them anyway.Generally, we've had decent luck with Linksys stuff in the past, and I would buy Linksys products again.

If you add your own pillow then your head is too high compared to the rest of the body. You'll wake up with neck pain.The second thing is that the rest of this air mattress is made of canals or straight \\"tubes\\". Remember that the mattress will be inflated until it's firm.

Yes, it is an introductory text, but an introductory text should, I think, explains concepts in a way that is easy for others to read and understand. It should not confuse the naive physics majors but to help them make the basic ideas more clear and familiar.

Having glanced over some explanations, i feel tipler does explain the concepts well with very good pictures that illustrate the ideas. My favorite are the worked out problems in the sections, because i found they helped me familiarize myself with the type of math involved and generally just what to do. Also, in the back of the book, for the answers to problems, they also show which \\"sample problems\\" they refer to, which is really hepful. Only flaw I could find is that there should be more explanations of the steps rather than just showing the steps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good condition, but not as advertised","review":"I ordered this watch because it was advertised as a package deal - it was supposed to come with a metal watchband and a leather band that could be changed out. But it did not arrive with the leather band, and when I called to complain they said that it was not supposed to come with both bands. I argued that it was written in the product description and even the picture on the site showed both bands. After being on hold for a while they ended up offering me 25.00 to \\"keep the watch anyway.\\" It was irritating. Everything else was fine, though (good condition, arrived on time, works well.) I think they have since updated the product information to avoid future problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for aspiring poets","review":"There's no question about it: creating a poem is not a simple task. It requires patience and dedication in order to develop poetry that everyone would love to read. That is why this book is an essential item for anyone who wants to significantly improve their creative writing skills. Whether your dream is to be published or you simply desire to improve your writing talent, this book becomes a necessity. Not only does this resource take away some of the fear of sending out a poem to a magazine, but it answers your most frequently asked questions on what makes a poem work."},{"rating":"2","title":"lots of important info all in one book","review":"I have no idea where I would have gotten all the information supplied by this book. I don't think I would have ever even heard of a poetry slam or a poetry workshop. The book covers various aspects of publishing and performing. I don't think one can get that information anywhere else. Other books tell you how to how to perform or how to publish. This one tells you how to perform, publish and even edit one's poetry. A how-to on what to do after the poem is written. It is EVEN written for various experiences of poets. That is really amazing. Bugeja provides a project for each level at the end of each chapter to have you put the new information into practice."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHILIPS FW-C777","review":"This system ROCKS ITS BASS is so Good.

The characters were cliche and one-dimesional, the storyline (in its weak existence) was cliche and it took nearly 200 pages to get the story moving.

The events are silly. The reactions of the main characters are silly. The book is silly.I haven't read anything with this much unnecessary name dropping in a long time.

I am a well read, highly educated attorney, and I have NEVER read such a one-dimensional book in my life - and I have been an avid reader since I can remember. The storyline has potential, but the authors seem hell-bent on portraying these young, African-American \\"professional women\\" as shallow, materialistic, status-worshipping, and just plain \\"silly.\\" The actions of these women seem completely out of character for the intelligent people the authors would have you believe they are. What a shame. Save your money.

Borrow it from a friend or check it out at the library if you can because you're going to want to give it back. Both the climax and the resolution occured in the last few chapters. Throughout the story the writers focused too much on the designer clothing of the characters instead of telling the story. I didn't know if I was reading a fashion book or a love story.

He is just learning to pull up and stand on his own so we were excited to get a walker as a gift. I have not compared this to other ones, but it's not very stable. It can easily be tipped, especially when he runs into a door or something. If he pushes hard enough he topples over the front of it. He has also lost his balance and fallen backwards. I just expected it to be a little more sturdy like some of his other toys. I understand it can't be perfect and expect some falls, but it seems cheap to me. The little doors (mail slots) ALWAYS come off. Again, just seems cheap. He loves this toy, however! He pushes it everywhere!One good thing is that the wheels can adjust so that it goes slow or fast depending on the floor or the skill of the child. That is really a good thing and has worked for us.Other than that, though, I've been a little dissatisfied with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for your pre-walking toddler","review":"This toy appears to be pretty neat, but alas it is not. My daughter was always trying to play with it from the front and would pull up on it to put the envelopes in the mailbox and when she leaned on it, the doors fell off, and she fell face first into it. One time she fell into it she got a huge knot on her forehead w/a nasty purple bruise. This toy went in the trash after 2 weeks.

It is cute for the price, but I wish I had bought just a regular old fashioned walker like my children used thirty years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Activity Walker","review":"There are much cuter activity walkers out there on the market, but, they also cost more money, so you have to decide what is important for you in a walker. Personally, my son only used the walker through his cruising to walking phase. As soon as he became a confident walker the toy lost all interest. I put it away in the \\"baby\\" things and was satisfied with the job it did helping him gain confidence in walking. That being said, if you want a toy to leave out and have your child play wiht after he learns to walk, this is not the toy. The mail slots come off way too easily and are boring. The mail pieces always wind up lost in the sea of toys and parts in the house. The accessory toys (bug themed) on the walker are way too hard to manipulate, plus never made much sense to me since the theme is a mailbox, what are the bugs doing on it?! You have to choose for yourself what you want in a walker and then go out and buy for those needs/wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this for your baby","review":"This toy falls over every time my nine month old tries to brace himself to stand up and push it.

Unfortunately, this toy did not instill any confidence in our son. Everytime he tried to pull up using the toy it would roll away from him causing him to fall. When he was already standing and tried to walk holding on to it, it would scoot away from him- again causing him to fall. The doors do break off easily. This toy has gone in the garbage as I do not feel it is safe enough for any child to play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOY WILL SCRATCH YOUR HARDWOOD FLOORS!!","review":"When I bought this walker I did not realize that the rear wheels are not on an axle and therefore do not spin easily (they are secured with screws). The wheel control is on the front wheels, so you would think that the rear wheels would spin easily. They do not, and will seriously scratch your hardwood floors. We had our floors refinished two years ago and now, due to this toy, they will need to be refinished again. This is a very poor design. And, as others have mentioned, the doors come off very easily. My son likes playing with the doors, but gets frustrated when they keep coming off. The other toys on the walker do not interest him at all. I will say that the walker is sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i never built it","review":"My son received this for his first bithday and has yet to get any good use out of it. It has no balance capability, so your child is always at risk of falling back. Also the door flaps are poorly made and always falling off. Basicly I don't recomend any one to buy this toy. I would have been really upset had I purchased it my self."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is going back!","review":"I bought this walker, and after putting it together I immediately had misgivings about it. It didn't seem very stable, and I was right. When my 9 month old son tried to use it to pull up it flipped over backwards. Luckily, since I had my suspicions about it doing just that, I was standing right behind him and able to catch him.In addition to tipping over, withing 1/2 hour he had the two \\"mailbox\\" panels pulled off the front of the activity area.I've already disassembled the walker and put it back in the box; it's going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doors fall off","review":"I got this as a gift for our daughter when she was around 10 months old. All the other reviews are right - the doors break off WAY TOO EASILY! But our daughter really liked it, and for that one month, she used it as a walker to help her walk.Now she uses it with her playhouse, and sticks all kinds of things into it. She is now a year and a half and though it sits along the wall, she still uses it with her other toys. When her friends come over, they always want to play with it for 2-3 minutes, and then they move on. The other noise-makers on the walker keep little 1 year olds interested for a little while as well.I think it was a great gift, but I would not have bought it. 2 stars for durability (due to the doors - they are still somewhere around the house)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous","review":"My mother bought this for my 11 month old son who is a late walker. The doors were constantly falling off and there is not much else to do if there are no doors. Also, every time he would try pulling himself up the whole thing would tip over. If we would lift him so that he could walk with it he would either fall backwards with the whole thing falling ontop of him. Or the front wheels would go flying forward and he would fall forward.

I was very disappointed. After spending 20 minutes assembling all the parts with screws and a screwdriver--my daughter pulled off the doors on the front-in about 1 minute. Next-she tried to stand up to walk and it fell right one top of her. I had to hold it still while she stood up-but it still was too light weight and tipped to easily. Also the smooth plastic wheels slid right across the rug so the speed adjustment feature was mute. The toy was so boring that within 5 minutes she was off doing something else. Needless to say I was disappointed and will be returning it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I bought this for my son because he is walking along furniture and I thought it might help learn to walk. I loved that it said it had adjustable speed, but on our carpet the wheels don't turn at all it just glides over the floor just as fast. We have also had the mail door problem. The worst thing about this toy is that my son was playing with the mail slot while I was putting his laundry away and I heard this awful screaming. He got his little finger stuck in the side and had his other hand pushing the mail door shut with all his body weight, by the time I got to him and released his finger it was white, and then bruised shortly after. I removed the doors and put them away so he can't get them, but he hasn't touched this toy since. This has been a total waste of money for our family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got as a gift, would not buy","review":"I was disappointed in the design. Little Tikes usually makes such great things. My son started playing with this at 9-10 months and even then he could pull the doors right off. It was not very good if they were intended to be used as mail slots to learn how to put things in and take them back out.I agree with the other poster that he was not at all interested in any of the other toys on it like the caterpiller or little bugs.

This was purchased in an effort to help my son walk, and because he was sure footed and cruising already, he had no problems taking to it at 9 months (and 23 pounds). The doors on the front do come off super easy, but that isn't a concern of mine. If my son gets to the point to where he takes it off to use as a stair to get on furniture, I will simply super-glue the doors on there so that he can't.I do believe it is sturdy, though. I think that is proven by my son's age, weight, and use of the toy.There are probably \\"better\\" choices out there, but I think the price is right and so is the product.

I'm not happy at all with the durability. She is constantly pulling the mailbox slots off (they come off VERY easily) and has squished her fingers in them on more than one occasion. Once she pulls them off, she likes to stand in the opening thing which looks really cute but it's really dangerous as I can just see her tumbling backwards. She isn't interested in the toy things - the catepillar is too hard to move back and forth. Overall, I wish I would have bought one of the Fisher Price walkers - they seem much sturdier and don't have parts that come off so easily.I would recommend you shop around before purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better products out there","review":"We received this as a gift for my third child. The older two used a wonderful one that gave out after the second one and unfortunately, they're not made anymore. This one only has two advantages over the old one: (1) it has a wheel control (like those on roller skates) to tighten the wheel so it won't go too fast for the baby learning to walk and (2) it's much easier to make it go flat or sit it back up right - I broke a lot of fingernails trying to make the old one change positions.The two doors, like the other reviewers said, come off way too easily. Once they're off -- there is little left on the toy except the boring sliders (in comparison to other baby toys). The three \\"letters\\" just float around the junk pile and are a waste.At least, the walker has two handles - one on top for standing, and one on the back for walking on knees, which my baby likes to do.

But as soon as she opened the mail box and started to climb up. The the flap popped off and she fell on the front of the walker busting her lip.

In addition to that, the toy is so lightweight that pulling up is impossible because the baby will end up falling backwards (in my case, always falling on her head instead of landing on her butt).As far as the doors go, my baby thinks that it is the greatest game in the world to take them off and have mom replace it!

At first he loved walking with it but he soon became distracted by removing the front two doors . He then only became interested in trying to sit and stand inside the area the doors were removed from. I think the doors coming off so easily is a dangerous feature. My son leaned on one of them and it snapped off and he fell into the walker and scratched his face. I personally think it should be recalled. The bugs in the front are very hard for a small child to manuever. I am going to look for a better walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOOK FOR ANOTHER TOY","review":"MY SON GOT THIS AS A CHRISTMAS GIFT WHEN HE WAS 7 MONTHS OLD.

NOW THAT HE IS, THIS TOY IS STILL USELESS. THE WHEELS HAVE A LOCKING FEATURE, BUT WHETHER IT'S ON OR OFF, THE WHEELS DON'T SEEM TO MOVE WELL, THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO GO AROUND.

She absolutely loves walking around the house with this and gets the biggest smile on her face! For that alone, it's worth the $20. It is bright and cheerful looking. When my husband put it together I had him readjust the toys on the front (the moving bee and caterpillar) so they would be looser and easier for her to move back and forth. Yes, as everyone else said, the mailbox covers come off way too easily, but that isn't too important to us. My 2 year old is the one who pulls them off. I will try the suggestion from a previous reviewer of putting the top slot on the bottom. My 2 year old has had fun with this toy, too. She likes the novelty of pushing it around the house and then watching as her baby sister does it. I would definitely buy this again. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold up!","review":"I bought this walker for my ten month old and 2 mins after we put it together, the doors are pulled off.

She was able to stand by herself, and sometimes would make a step or two. So we thought it would help her to learn walking, however this toy did not help at all. The tires are plastic, so they slide very easily, which means a child has to run very fast in order not to fold down, because as soon as a child presses on the handle, the walker starts sliding forward like it's on ice.The leters and other \\"fun\\" features of the toy are ok, and my daughter played with them a little, but she was not really excited about the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe","review":"I just watched my 10 month old daughter topple over with this contraption on top of her. From the moment we put this thing together my wife and I were concerned about it. If you have hardwood floors be prepared to chase your child around as the walker simply slides uncontrollably across the floor. My biggest criticism is that the weight distribution is totally screwed up. Presumably, this walker is being used by children who are learning to walk. When our daughter pulls herself up on the handle, there is not enough weight in the front to prevent the walker from tipping over. I'm no engineer, but something about the design is all wrong. Ours is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disapointed","review":"I was really disapointed in this toy. I have had NUMEROUS little tykes products over the years (my oldest 22, youngest 8 mths.)and I expected the same quality.. but was let down with this toy. When my son trys to pull up to this toy, so he can walk with it, it flips over backwards with him, and he falls hurting himself.

It took me nearly an hour to put together simply because she was crawling over me the entire time trying to \\"help\\" with the slide toys.

My son (10 months) rec'd it as a Christmas gift and it stands there empty all of the time. The doors fall off. The sticker inside says \\"removable door for easy acess\\". What a joke. I bet that sticker was an after thought when they realized how bad of a product it really was. I am sick of putting this thing together 10 times a day. When my teenagers were young, I trusted the name \\"little tikes\\" because their toys were usually better than the others because they seemed to be more rugged and used heavier plastics.

The bright colors are attractive though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"It was easy to put together. I just wish it would stay together.

It is flimsy and when my son falls backwards it winds up falling on top of him and frightens him, sometimes even hitting his face.

Instead of assisting my baby with walking, it hurts him."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for learning to walk","review":"We got this for our son just before he was 11 months. I wanted something with speed control because he just kept falling on the others he had tried. I love the speed control. He was not falling forward like he was on the others.

I wish we'd gotten her a different walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ethan's Mom","review":"My son loves this toy. He got this toy as a gift when he was 10 months old. Yes the doors fall off but my son could care less. He uses this toy to walk all over the house. It is also light enough that we take it to the park, shopping, etc. so he can walk on his own when we go out. He has fallen down a few times as other people mentioned - but I assume this is the case with most early walkers. Now that he has the hang of using it he pulls himself up with the bar and has few problems walking around with it. I would say this is one of his favorite toys we own so I think it is quite a deal for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"this is a terrible toy!

I think he used the walker feature 2 or 3 times. I returned it after a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEP ON LOOKING~DON'T BUY IT!","review":"I bought this for my 10 month old son. It is pretty sturdy, however, the doors as well as the envelopes that come with it are lost somewhere in the house! The doors do come off with little or no effort and thus making it possible for my son to climb onto it and stand, which makes me very leary to turn around for a moment, because it looks like he will tip over. He played with it for approximately 30 minutes and his 4 year old brother like to use it to try to run over him and the dog with it!

Keep on looking unless you are prepared to keep putting on the doors and not let them climb on it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design -- not fun","review":"Not worth the money. There are better walkers out there. I agree with some other posts that the little doors or whatever you call them come of way to easy. I am sick of picking them up off the floor. I got this because my son loved the walker a friend of mine had for their baby, so I figured they were all alike and bought this one. I was wrong.

My 11 month old son enjoyed this toy for approximately 1/2 hour and my four year old loved to try to run over his brother and the dog with it!

My daughter is almost 9 months old, and is ready to take off \\"cruising\\"; but we just don't have much for her to cruise around, so I thought that if this walker was slow enough for her, it would be a great beginner walking toy for her. I got it home, put it together, and she loved it instantly. Especially the spinning flower. BUT, when she tries to hold onto the handlebar and go, it falls on top of her! The legs are set way too close to the body of the toy, so it gives absolutely no balance whatsoever.

So when grandma brought it home, we were thrilled and tried it out right away! When it is folded down on the ground, she loves it! All though the little doors just snap right off, she'll just play with the door, too. But she's learning to walk and thats the part I liked best, until she actually started walking with it. She lost her balance and fell backwards and the toy went backwards with her and smacked her in the face!!! This happened everytime she tried to pull up on it as well. So I have put it away in the closet for now. So be careful not to let your little one use this toy on hard surfaces!!! They might crack their head and smack their face at the same time!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tips way too easily","review":"Not a very good toy for a young child. It is too lightweight and it tipped over backwards everytime my daughter tried to walk behind it. This caused her to bang her head on the floor many times.

He can stand if he pulls up on a couch or similar.Unfortunately, this product is so light and flimsy that it topples with the smallest amout of pressure. There's no way my baby can pull himself up on this toy unless I hold it, and then what's the point.In addition, I agree with several of the other parents' comments about the flaps being EASY to come off and then a hazard. My son loved (in the 1 day we owned it) to pull off the flap with the spinning disk and then promptly got his hand caught and pinched in it as he tried to lean on it.He did love biting the plastic envelopes, oh boy.I returned this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby injury","review":"We just purchased this toy a few days ago.

They keep falling off even with the smallest amount of pressure...so we just now leave them off because frankly, they're useless at this point. The workmanship is poor.

I can't believe how poorly-made those doors are! An infant can pull them off?! I agree with one of the reviewers stating that that alone should be reason for a recall.

It's not terrible and my daughter, when she was stable and could walk with a walker, used this and did fine.But the doors on the front are a PAIN. They have fallen off at least 100 times and for this reason alone, I would say get another walker. It's just not worth the minor irritation of having to constantly put them back on when there are many other walkers that don't have this issue. We moms have enough little battles to fight every day than to have to \\"put back\\" pieces that should not be falling off every single time the little one gets his/her hands on it.

Or better yet, rather than prepare for your child's misbehavior with supposedly \\"witty\\" cards, reprimand your child when it behaves badly and clean up the mess it makes rather than make other people responsible for the consequences of your child's tantrum.We all understand that kids will act up now and then, it's passive \\"parenting\\" that antagonizes people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call it what it is: A bribe as a substitute for forethought and courtesy","review":"Yes, in theory it could be a humorous attempt to diffuse an awkward, unanticipated situation.

From C.S. Lewis to Tolkien and L'Engle, I have enjoyed them all. When I started Redwall, I planned on an excellent read. To my dissapointment, I found it redunant, filled with superlatives, and amazingly uninteresting...there is a common sympathy for Matthias, which I found admirable, but I found it hard to turn the next page, and the next..there are authors out there with a much more distinctive style, like L'Engle or Yolen, or authors who go with the mainstream, yet shape their books with a unique point of view, like newcomer J.K. Rowling. what is surprising is the fact that there are so many books in the Redwall series. Jacques is a good author, but there is something lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"If'n ye wanta fie'outten wyz I don' liken thez book...","review":"The whole Redwall series is written with over-done cultural dialects! The story could have been greatly improved if some editor had put his/her foot down and said, \\"You're teaching everyone to write junk books! We need more good books in this world! I'm rewriting it in English!\\"If that had happened, I would have given Redwall a much better review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, no more...","review":"Terrible. The plot is just one long cliche. The peaceful \\"good guys\\" are attacked by the evil \\"bad guys\\" and rise up to defeat them. Big surprise. The characters are entirely one-dimensional. The \\"good guys\\" do no harm to anyone, and the \\"bad guys\\" are completely bloodthirsty. Jaques could at least have had a tirant for the leader of the \\"good guys\\" to add some diversity to the storyline. The only plus side to this book was the rich descriptions and myriad adjectives. Still... my dog could have done better than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the mark","review":"Like a previous reviewer noted, there are a few problems of scale that occasionally hurt the suspension of disbelief. Also, I have trouble reconciling the death and violence with the kiddy wordings that appear here and there (such as the second paragraph in the book: \\"Bump!\\"). I mean, it's not like the violence is incredibly graphic or disturbing, it's just out of place if this is to be considered a children's book (which I think it is).Mainly, though, my gripe is simply that it's not a compelling book. I managed to get all the way through it, but it wasn't exactly a page-turner, and I don't plan to read any more in the series.Instead, I recommend the Harry Potter series by J. K. Rowling, the Xanth series by Piers Anthony, and any of Robert A. Heinlein's juvenile science fiction books (such as Tunnel in the Sky). These are suitable for kids, yet are not \\"kiddy.\\" They read just as well for adults as for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook Review Only!","review":"The book itself gets four stars, but in the audiocasseteversion I bought, Brian Jaques speaks way too fast.

When the awful rat Cluny the Scourge and his horde come to try and conquer Redwall, Matthias embarks on a desperate quest to recover the sword of Martin the Warrior,the founder of Redwall Abbey who lived a long time ago.

As a college student, all my friends read these as kids and loved them. Then around mid-high school we all went back and read them for another familiar happy re-read and realized they are really terrible - cliche, terrible writing, fake drama. But kids LOVE them. So it's not good for read aloud as adults will lose their minds. But so meaningful and fun for kids. You do need to be a good reader/book lover for them as many of the characters have accents or dialects that are phonetically spelled with lots of apostrophes and such. This tripped up my brother at a young age.

Even after or the sequels and prequels, it is still the most amazing one.

Brian reads it himself and he has every character voice down pat because they were all stuck in his head for so many years. His history in the BBC also makes his voice in mesmerizing and enchanting so much that you will have a hard time turning it off. You need to buy the Redwall series because the story plays out over a few chronicles so do not just buy the first in the series get the first three. It is a great pick for those who would like more adventure with less magic. It takes place with woodland creatures and could also be considered a coming of age story.RICH CHICKS reviews specializes in media that is purchased by women.

The characters being rodents is a little wierd but creates an interesting picture for your imagination.

At the beginning its a little boring, but believe me, if you stick with it, you'll be hooked. Brian Jaques describes his characters so well. And all the animals have different ways of talking. He makes them come alive in the writing. Once I start reading one of the books in this series, I get sucked into a different world. I wish that everyone could have a chance to read this book. It's fantastic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Good, well-plotted tale...\\"","review":"In the first Redwall book in the series, Brian Jacques quickly captures the reader's interest by mutualy describing the different personalities of all the characters in the book. There is not a single human mentioned in the book, and it makes you imagine what a whole world without people could be like. This gripping novel about creatures with a lifestlyle very diffrent from ours is sometimes the sort of book that makes you wish you lived in the animals' world, and and had the courage and bravery to deal with the hardships they deal with. This story of fantasy and dreaming, yet realistic and beleivable occurences makes the reader think that just about anything is possible. Bravo to Brian Jacques!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"A girl in my class read Mattimeo last year and I thought it looked like the dumbest book ever. I was soooo wrong.

Matthias believes the only way to win is if he gets the sword of the great warrior Martin. Matthias unsolves riddles, puts his and other lives in danger, and fights his way to getting it! After sparrow tells Matthias where the sword can be found he goes through Mossflower wood to find the quarell of Asmodeusss. This book all in all is a great read.

If I could give it a highter rating I would give it a 100. It is great, full of mystery, humor, tragedy, good food and evil villians.

This is a book I would recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true classic that will be around for centuries","review":"This is the best single book that I have ever read. THE BEST. Read it.I picked Redwall up in my local library because it was thick. After reading the cover, I thought that it looked interesting, so I checked it out. For the rest of the day, I was engrossed in the book, living through an experience that I doubt I will ever go through again.Redwall has the goodguys winning through, and unlike many books out today, the mice in the abbey are not semi-good. Their \\"goodness\\" is not questioned.Cluny is a perfect warlord. His horde feels like an army that is going out to conquer the countryside.The descriptions in this book are amazing. Page after page is filled with them (Jacques wrote this book for the children of a blind hospital, and he wanted to be able to describe everything). The whole book has the feel of a classic.Although this book is only $6 or so, it is a priceless gem. Buy it, keep it, love it, and hope Brian Jacques keeps writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book ever!!!!!","review":"I recommend this book for anyone who likes adventure. With cool characters,(like Matthias, Basil Stag Hare, and Log-a-log, who do battle with the one eyed rat, Cluny) the story is fast paced and full of action and adventure. It is the best book I have ever read. I received the anniversary edition for Christmas and I really like the illustrations, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book is as good as Harry Potter, and in some ways better. It's about a young mouse named Matthias, the Luke Skywalker of the book, who is the only hope of a peaceful Abbey in the face of an invading rat army led by the cycloptic and ruthless Cluny the Scourge. Matthias must first find the sword of a legendary Redwall warrior, who died many years before. Although there are plenty of great characters, my favorite is Asmodeus, the evil pit viper who is the guardian of the sword.This book has plenty of action, mild language, a little romance, and lots of suspense. The only bad thing about this book is the ridiculous way in which Cluny is defeated in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FANTASTIC BOOK!","review":"I first saw this book on a web site that linked to Amazon.com. I clicked on the book, and came... well.. here! I read the reviews and almost everyone said it was a great book, so I bought it! Once I started it, I could not put it down! It's about a mouse on a quest to find the legendery sword of his heroic idle, while helping to deffend his land from evil rats.At first I was skeptical about getting it because a lot of people said it was like the Hobbit, which I didn't enjoy. But I really loved it and thought it was a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Raves for Redwall","review":"I, as many people, have gotten introduced to the fantasy reading world through Harry Potter. I was anxious for more reading and was so lucky to have put my hands on Redwall. I throughly enjoyed every page. This book is wonderfully well written. The scenes flow along smoothly.

I know all will enjoy this book, especially us young mothers looking for a stress releiver after a long day."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books to read","review":"This book Red wall by Brian Jacques was a book about a mouse named Mathias.

The woodland creatures fight a army of rats to defend their homes while Mathias tries to find the lost sword of Martin the warrior. It is truly a great book to read. Once you start reading you almost don't want to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redwall","review":"Redwall is a great action adventure story at a somewhat higher reading level. Redwall is about young mouse Matthias on a quest to get the sword of legendary Marting the Warrior to banish the bedreaded Cluny the Scorge and his horde from Redwall Abbbey. The creatures of the Abbey are peaceful, but were forced to fight to save their home. As you progress further into the book, the action and suspension grows. It finally reaches the peak near the end, different from other books, when Matthias finally completes his quest, or so it seesms. At that same point, though, The creatures are at what seems the end of their wonderful Abbey, and the beginning of Cluny's rein with an iron fist. The story is well detailed, and it is divided so it is easy to understand. This book is definitly for someone who loves adventure and battle. I have just one thing to say about Redwall, EXCELLENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"red wall","review":"The Redwall books are now without a doubt my favorites, my teacher recommended them to me and I fell in love with them. When I'm reading, I can actually feel what's happening, like I'm there watching it happen. I will read for hours, not wanting the book to end. ...When I'm reading, I feel like I'm living in two worlds; the first is wonderful Mossflower, or the Abbey, or Salamandastron, and second is the vague feeling of the real world around me. You may be surprised that a fifth grader can feel this emotion, but it happens to me all the time. I truly love these books, and I encourage everyone to read them, because even though the perfectly woven tale will end, the only way it can end is for you to start at the beginning. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"This is a great book. I couldn't put it down after I started reading it. The main character is a young ambitious mouse named Matthias. His hero is a mouse named Martin the Warrior, even though Martin is dead. Matthias finds a riddle that explains where the hero's sword is. Matthias goes on a quest to find the sword, his friends defend Redwall Abbey from Cluny the Scourge and his army of rats, ferrets, weasels, and stoats. Matthias makes a lot of good friends while searching for the hero's sword, and saves Redwall from Cluny and his horde. This book has a lot gore in it, and a four-letter explative or two, so it is better suited for the older reader who loves animals and wants more adventure than Wind in the Willows."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loves this series","review":"My 3rd grade boy wanted to read this book, but I thought it would be too difficult for him, but he started it anyway. He has been loving it. He is usually rushing home from school to do more reading. I plan to get him additional books in the series for his birthday. I have also read the book and think it is a delightful adventure that boys and girls will love. It has a clear meaning of good and evil with virtues that you want to instill in your children. This would also make a great read-aloud book for parents to read with their children. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robert On Redwall","review":"This Book was great. Any body who like fairy tales should read this. It is a little long but once you get into it you can't stop. Matthias is a great character with a lot of spunk.

I reconmend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"GB's #1","review":"The ultimate children's (or adults!) action adventure story, and all the rest of the series is even better. J.K.Rowling takes second place. No other book I have ever read induces such inspiration, fun, humour, great battles, quests, riddles and tear jerking happiness. No magic wands, but plenty of heart.

But I recomend this book to redwall fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redwall","review":"The book Redwall will be a good book if you enjoy tall tales and folklore. If you are a romance or a nonfiction type person, than Redwall would not be the book for you. This tall tale is about a little peaceful town called Redwall, or so I thought. Redwall was no longer the peaceful little town when Cluny arrived. Cluny the Scourge was someone that everyone in Redwall despises. Cluny is determined to take over Redwall and destroy it. But the Abbot and his crew are not about to let that happen. No one is going to destroy Redwall as long as Matthias is around.

Some books are classified as children's or young adults' (e.g. His Dark Materials; The EarthSea series;) which are really for adults. Some other series for children can also be enjoyed by adults, eg Wrinkle in Time. But this book is really only good for children. Most adults won't even enjoy it, unless they like reading children's books to get them in a nostalgic mood. The concepts are presented in a simple fashion, the language is also very plain, characterization is at a minimum and the plot isn't too complicated. This reminded me of Watership Down, but at a much simpler level. A good read for a young child (around 9 yrs old or less), maybe; but I didn't like it much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute critters, graphic violence","review":"This book occupies an odd place on the \\"children's book\\" shelf: it attracts young readers with mice and other forest cutesies but delivers action that is often graphically cruel--way beyond kid-book level, in my opinion. And yet the characters seem too cutesy to attract older readers. After seeing too many times the tears and the shock on my 8-year-old's face, I felt the need to gloss over some of the graphically violent stuff,despite my aversion to censorship of any kind. I wouldn't recommend this one for anyone under 11 or 12, and only then if readers/listeners don't mind fuzzy little forest creatures getting graphically impaled, drowned, and/or crushed alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids fiction ala assembly line","review":"Considering the accolades given this book by Harry Potter fans desperate to tide themselves over between books, I am quite surprised at how mechanically this book reads - characters are shallow, everything is a move between plot points, and the villans who start off sounding so evil seem to be thier own worst enemy.Most frustrating of all is the fact that good ideas and great characters like Silent Sam and Asmodeoussss (very creepy) are squandered. One of my biggest complaints has to do with the way conflicts with the villans are resolved. In the interest of not giving away anthing to those who will enjoy this book, I will only say that my reaction to these resolutions was \\"What? That's it?\\".Ultimitely, this is geared for 13 year old boys who want \\"action, action, action\\". Jerry Bruckheimer if you wanted to make a kids film, this is your source material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome!!!!","review":"I have to say 'Redwall' is one of the worst books I've ever tried to read. Jacques tries over and over to get you attatched to the characters(with scanty success) just to kill them off in disgusting ways. The plot is centered around a rather uncreative point - a rat attacking some (talking!)mice. The book seemed to be five million pages long -I could barely force myself to wade through it. In my opinion, the violence and bad language make it inapropriate for children. Don't waste your time on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just For Kids!","review":"I just wanted to let adults know that this is a great book! If you like The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, than you should give this series a try. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This book was suggested to me as a fantasy book without the (...) that comes with Harry Potter. It really is great, but not really for bedtime reading for children, I wouldn't think. It's just because it's about war, and some of the imagery is not the kind of thing your kids ought to sleep on.The first that I read is \\"Mossflower\\" that I got at the library. AFter that I went to the bookstore to find it. Had I seen the paperback version first, I would never have read it. They market it like a sword and sorcery book. It's got lots of sword, but none of the witchie-poo nonsense. Great stuff!

The book has loads of excitement and adventure. It is a must read for any who likes fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks can be Decieving","review":"Last year my friend started reading a book called Redwall, and she told me it was the best book she had ever read. I didn't care much for the cover, besides being a very dog-eared old library book it showed a mouse standing on a wall and holding a sword, with a crowd of big ugly rats down below. I was also very disappointed in the book itself. How can you write a four-hundred page book on a group of talking mice and their peaceful but boring lives? I was amazed that they could find so many compliments to put on the back cover. But this year, when I found it on a cart in the library I tried reading it again and I finally got hooked, when I read about Cluny the Scourge's plans for capturing Redwall Abbey, the kingdom of the sparrows, the riddle of Martin the Warrior, and the dreaded snake, Asmodeuss. Now I am looking for the second Redwall book, and I hope it will be as good as the first. I recommend this book to anybody who likes animals and fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A colorful novel. This is Jacques at his best!","review":"Being a Stephen King fan, I am always open to new things in the books I read. I actually found this book at a sale for 99 cents, but now that I've read it (twice) I know it's absolutly priceless, and even inspired myself to begin writing fantasy. This book is action packed, which I didn't expect when I first picked it up. It was the story of a mouse, and because of that, I expected it to be a children's story. Now that I've read it I see you do have to be mature but also young at heart. Matthias is the sort of cute little character you fall in love with at the begining of a story. Once you finish, though, you've realized how he's grown through the book. It's magical, it's colorful, and (believe it or not) it's action packed. I loved it and I think it would be a great addition to any treasured collection. -A reader and write"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest book ever written by Brian Jacques!","review":"This book is about about a rat named Cluny who attacks the abbey Redwall. Mattias the Warrior leads the abbey in a war. Miraculous wars broke out. To see who wins you will have to read the best book writeen by Brian Jacques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"Jacques world of mice, foxes, shrews, rats and other woodland creatures is both a delightful and scary place to visit. I was surprised by the twists he worked into the plot. The action is so vividly described I could almost see it happen before me.If you buy this book be warned: it may be a very hard book to put down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"It's an aboslutely lovely story! If you just want to take a break from the more somber fiction, I highly suggest Redwall, or any Brian Jaques book. There hasn't been one yet that hasn't made me laugh, and cry. He's a brilliant author with a special knack for poetry. Only a few authors can pull off throwing songs and poems into their works, and Jaques does it brilliantly. I tip my hat to him. His characters are wonderfully written and well rounded. I've read books where characters do things that completely go against their personalities. This is never the case in any of the Redwall books. Jaques is constant with his characters. The plot lines, although there are sometimes several, are simple and easy to follow. Any Redwall book is enjoyable, and I strongly recommend that you read them all. These books allowed my cousins and myself to fall in love with reading in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin as Matthias","review":"I really liked this book. This book is about a castle called Redwall and Cluny and his gang come to take it over. Matthias, a young little mouse becomes a brave stong warrior and hero to alot of people. He gets the sword of Martin the Warrior, a hero formally at Redwall. Matthias fights Cluny the scourge in a battle and wins. He took back Redwall in a battle against Cluny's entire army with the help of his friends, the sparrows and the mice of Redwall.My favorite character (that didn't die) was Constance, the badger. She was big and bad throughout the whole entire story.For the most part, this was a good book. I just wish the story line didn't have alot of the characters dying like it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read for all ages","review":"The first book in Jacques' series surprised me with its excellent imagery and relatively mature message. Although the writing style is simple and easy to read, this is not really a kids book. Although it is listed as being for ages 9-12, I believe that this book would be enjoyable (even exciting) for people of any age. I'm 22 and plan on reading the next (Mossflower). So, if you're contemplating reading this book, I strongly reccomend it and you shouldn't worry about it being below your reading level. It is an extremely enjoyable book from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST SERIES EVA!","review":"O.K. let me just say that I may be a younger person but this book is great for all ages.

The only people that wouldn't like this would probably be those that don't like mice or badgers and other woodland inhabitants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for kids, but...","review":"This book tries too hard to be _Watership Down_ and doesn't succeed. It might be entertaining for young readers, but this was on the adult fantasy shelves at my bookstore and I picked it up hoping to be enchanted. Unfortunately, unlike _Watership_, the characters are way too one-dimensional, which makes _Redwall_ rather unsatisfying.I might have liked this book better had I not read it right on the heels of _Watership_, or had I read it when I was younger. However, this, unlike the Chronicles of Narnia and other classics, is a book that doesn't satisfy adults as well as children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather unimpressive, actually.","review":"Sure, the \\"Redwall\\" series is well-written, and unusual in its use of animal characters rather than humans. That does nothing to alleviate the fact that the plots are all the same as any other epic sword quest. The characters are flat and stereotypical, and the conflicts wrap up a little too neatly. I read the first two books in the series, but I don't think I'll be coming back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, and a Sore Inconvenience","review":"I ordered this product for a present for someone, under the impression that it was used, like new. The description clearly indicated that it was in prime condition. However, the jacket is badly wrinkled, the pages are discolored and marked, there are 'Houston Public Library' tags on the cover, a bold 'DISCARD' stamped on the inside, and even a card slot on the inside. None of these blemishes were described by the advertisement. I obviously cannot give this as a gift to someone, and now I am precariously caught precisely a week before Christmas, with no book to give to this person, thanks to the very dishonest description of the book. I want my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is The Bomb!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This an awsome book! I read it and i loved it.

Too predictable, contrived, melodramatic, and cloyingly saccharine sweet for adults; too full of blood, death, and violence for children, Redwall seems to have aimed at the hazy middle and missed. Jacques seems never to have met adjective he could resist, or a cliché best left out. And let's not even mention character development. I had to force myself to finish the book.

I enjoyed most of it, with the exception of some of the rough scenes wherein someone dies or is tortured. The author doesn't make a great deal of it, yet they are descriptive and perhaps too much for younger readers, or listeners... an adult can handle it fine.Anna del C.Author of \\"The Elf and the Princess\\"The Elf and The Princess: The Silent Warrior Trilogy - Book One (The Silent Warrior Trilogy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Book!!","review":"Listen up yall this is 1 of the best books i ever read and the only good book in the redwall series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kalo","review":"This book is about a group of mice in search of the sword and grave of one of their most beloved warriors.This is a book with much action and much description; it is sure to be a classic for many, many years to come.

But, that is what I got. Brian Jacques has created a modern masterpiece with his superb usage in detail,dialogue and wit in this delightful tale of good versus evil. As in all true classics, good finally overcomes evil, and Jacques has left us with a lasting gift that will be cherished each time it is read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the bests.","review":"Brian Jaques' first Redwall book, I think, is probably the best.

I think that kind of says something about the actual story.After reading several Redwall books, you come to realize that......they're all the SAME. Different details, yes, but the plot structure never changes. To sum it up: They have a feast. There's bad news of an oddly-named vermin leader come to invade/pillage/destroy/conquer something. Someone goes haring off on an adventure. The vermin are defeated and the leader killed. They all go back to Redwall for a feast.

The part that was most apealing to me was when Matthias and Log a Log killed the giant snake"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start to the best series ever!","review":"This book is about an abbey called Redwall and the creatures that inhabit it. The story mainly focuses on a young mouse, Matthias, who longs to be a hero and warrior like Martin, the abbey's warrior spirit. When the evil warlord Cluny the Scourge plans to take over Redwall with his vermin army, Matthias embarks on a journey to find the lost sword of Martin which was forged from a falling star at the mountain of Salamandastron, domain of badger lords. This leads Matthias to befriend the sparrows living in the abbey steeple, defeat a hypnotic adder, and other adventures. This book is the second in Brian Jacques' saga. The books, in order, are Mossflower, Redwall, Mattimeo, Mariel of Redwall, Salamandastron, Martin the Warrior, The Bellmaker, and Outcast of Redwall.

The book is about an evil warlord called, \\"Clunly, the Scourge,\\" who is trying to destroy Redwall Abbey, but the abbey dwellers will not go down without a fight. A young mouse, called \\"Matthias,\\" will journey to fight the warlord away from the abbey with the help from Martin The Warrior's spirit.

I was spellbound, taking every spare moment I had to finish it once I had started it. I became completely absorbed in the characters, the writing, the humor, and the adventure. It became my favorite book at the time, and still remains close to that place, though it's been over 6 years since I first read it. I read it again just a few months ago, and despite having read it easily over 6 times, I found that I still had trouble putting it down once I had started, and that I still picked up on subtle details in the story I hadn't noticed before. Brian Jacques writing is simply beautiful, detailed and exquisitely written. It's hard to find such a wonderful book these days, it's comforting to know I can still return to favorites, even if the pages are worn, and the cover is fading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A set of books perfect for everyone!","review":"The librarian at my school suggested the Redwall chronicles.

This album is a favorite of mine simply because I can just pop it in and maintain an uninterrupted groove. My favorite song would be \\"Sweet Misery\\" since I know that oxymoron all too well. I felt the misery in her voice just as I have in life, and that's the type of music we need. Music we can FEEL. But anyway, I think the cd's best described as 'jazzy' and smooth.

It's paced by subtle changeups in tempo (\\"down,\\" \\"i n i\\") but maintains a consistent sound. Amel's voice is light and easy on the ear. What surprised me most were the maturity of the lyrics throughout. The standouts on this LP are the bouncy 1st single, \\"get up,\\" \\"i n i,\\" and the title track.

I think I would like to hear guitar along with the other instrumentation to compliment that beautiful voice. The music is a little subdued but hey, I am still giving it four stars!

At first, her songs took time to grow on me, but that was only because it is so different from what the music industry generally has to offer. I experianced the same effect with Sade & her music. After a while one song would become my favorite, & then another, until after a short while the entire album was my favorite. I think part of it has to do with what type of mood you are in & what you are experiancing in your life, because sometimes the words & music seem to be touching the deepest parts of you soul. There is a quality to her voice that just wants to take down that protective barrier we all have, & just cry - whether for sorrow or joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong, tight smooth release","review":"She brings to mind the best parts of badu's musicalities, Caron Wheeler's political sensitivities (and voice) and really brings us a CD that doesn't insult, annoy or berate.

It has a smooth, lush sound, and plenty of seduction. She has a great vocal range, and she does her own serious singing and background work.

If you've seen the first \\"Taxi\\" film then you know what to expect and you won't be disappointed. If not, think along the same lines as \\"The Transporter\\" (which is also written by Luc Besson, writer of the \\"Taxi\\" series), only funnier, or the remake of \\"The Italian Job\\". \\"Taxi 2\\" is lighter on character development than its predecessor, but the whole reason for watching a \\"Taxi\\" film is for the comedic action sequences, and the action sequences in \\"Taxi 2\\" are just as cool as those in \\"Taxi\\". And the best thing about this film is knowing that there are two more sequels after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is a great CD. It was actually one of the early CDs I bought when I started listening to Classical, and my most modern purchase at the time. I wasn't at all put off by it. Even where it isn't \\"pretty,\\" it's tonal, and often quite rhythmic. Both pieces adhere somewhat to classical forms with Shosty developing material introduced early on.I think these are good works to try even if you're fairly new to Classical.The players sound great.

I own everything he has ever done and love all of it except this. It is just a jumble of audio clips from a very bad film with a few minutes of mediocre and terrible songs. Each song has 30-90 seconds of clips from the film attached to it. You can't skip them because they are merged into the track. It means even if the music was good, you wouldn't be able to listen to it without the really low grade clips (sounds like a terrible movie...like a jr. high school student wrote it).

The movie is shot beautifully, and the performances are stellar. Branaugh's screenplay makes the transition from screen to stage seamlessly. His performance is deeply emotional. Branaugh flawless Henry is supported by a throng of Oscar caliber performers. For example, Judi Dench plays a small role, but you'll remember her performance long after the movie's end. Derek Jacobi gives a cameo appearance as the Chorus and pushes the action forward with precision. Jacobi's character functions as the bridge between present and past, so the audience never feels distance from the immediacy and beauty of the text. WONDERFUL! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody warn Branagh about this!","review":"The visuals of the film and VHS were brilliant on screen, even with candle-lit scenery; a cinematographer's masterpiece!

No problems. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"O for a muse of fire!","review":"I confess to being a big Branagh fan. This is the first film of his which I ever saw, and it is truly fantastic.King Henry V, goaded by his nobles, launches an invasion of France, to take the crown he thinks belongs to him. Despite treachery, disease his need to prove himself to his countrymen, King Henry eventually leads his men to the field of Agincourt, where the outcome of the battle depends upon ingenuity and courage.This version is more realistic than the Olivier version. Grittier, more down to earth, portraying a world that was harsh, unforgiving and often cruel and brutal, but not without emotion.Many of the roles are filled with first class actors, Iam Holm, Emma Thompson, a young Christian Bale and of course Brian Blessed, looking rather fearsome in plate armour . Excellent performances throughout. Truly an epic.By only gripe is that there were no English subtitles, which can make the dialogue a little hard to follow, but don't let that put you off."},{"rating":"2","title":"bare bones dvd edition of spectacular film","review":"Kenneth Branagh's directorial debut sets the bar for Shakespearean adaptations. Branagh as Henry heads a spectacular cast that includes Emma Thompson, Derek Jacobi, Ian Holm, Paul Scofield and Judi Dench. The sets and lighting are wonderful, and Branagh proves to have as perceptive an eye as an ear, with beautiful shots the norm and language rendered so as to be both beautiful and accessible. This adaptation is quite different from Laurence Olivier's interpretation, and they make interesting viewing together.This dvd edition, however, is pitiful and if I didn't adore the film I'd mark it down. One gets a trailer and subtitles available in French or Spanish. That's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So wanted it to be wonderful!","review":"I love this movie and use it annually with my students to bring Shakespeare to life for them, but with a realistic slant.

One of the great things about DVD is that you can skip over parts and repeat some of the really great bits as you have time.There is no single greater rendition of the speech before the battle of Agincourt in the history of performing Shakespeare, and the over-all manner in which Kenneth Branaugh interpreted this role is sheerly out of this world. It moves one in time, in emotion, in perception, it is just the best thing, the highest quality, in the world of theater on DVD.If you don't buy and treasure this DVD, you too will lie abed and weep that you missed the battle of Agincourt. This is a world-class virtual experience not to be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN BEST TRADITIONS","review":"This is a classic English film. Excellent acting, powerful performance, and great cinemotagraphy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent film production of a classic play","review":"Not my favorite of Shakespeare's works, but solidly performed by Branagh and company. As with the play, one needs to understand the back story or you are lost with the distant relations and references to past events not shown.. Still the movie is acceptably true to Shakespeare's original script. Nuanced as a protest of the bloody unnecessary deaths caused by ridiculous unwarranted grabs for power by church and state, the movie dwells long on the battle scenes. However Emma Thompson's portrayal of the French princess is hilarious, giving the movie an overall lighter aspect than otherwise could have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"Banagh's Henry V: \\"Once more unto the breach\\"","review":"Excellent adaptation of Shakespeare's play, with greater emphasis on cinematic effects than on poetry. The script is not a literal translation to the screen; anything that would take away from what the audience could experience visually - long speeches and monologues, for example - have been reduced drastically or expunged altogether. The movie concentrates on the Agincourt campaign and subsequent battle; the battle itself is lavishly rendered while there is little on Henry as the developing conqueror or boy-king. This is what makes it different from Olivier's HENRY V, which was more about the man than the events. Banagh's version is more an epic than an inciteful character study. Banagh, who also directed, is excellent, however, as Henry. An excellent movie in its own way; well worth a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"Branagh's Henry is a triumph. I found it to be more real and inspiring than Olivier's."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie with only one flaw","review":"This is really a great version of Henry V. Great cinematography, costumes, acting, and sets. The only major flaw is a ridiculously out of places scene starring Brannagh's then-wife Emma Thompson goofing around learning english etc. The movie would be much, much better with these integrity damaging scenes removed (or at least you can hit the foward button on your dvd player).Otherwise, a wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Class Harry!","review":"Kenneth Branagh does an absolutely BRILLIANT job of bringing Shakespeare to the screen in this film. It's largely true to the script, and leaves in the treason of British soldiers that the government forced Olivier to cut in 1944. Not having to boost a nation's morale as Olivier's version did, and spurred on by Branagh's take on things, this film depicts a much more realistic image of war. Additionally due to different circumstances the French are portrayed as quite a bit more formiddable enemies than Olivier's version. However while Branagh rarely touches Shakepeare's words, it is probable the French were lampooned in the Bard's day. It's an odd mix as Shakespeare was obviously (from the script) telling a factually slanted story, however Branagh sobers it up while still maintaing a sense of glory and the promise of a bold new leader. It's a wonderful interpretation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Anamorphic?!?!?!","review":"This GREAT film version of Henry V deserves a better video presentation! I love this film, but I will NOT buy a DVD with the degraded image inherent to NON-anamorphic Letterbox formatting. What kind of idiots does MGM take us for???

I read the reviews, I like Shakespeare, I love early settings from the 16th and 17th century... this film has to be great. No... I'm afraid it's not. First of all, it's stage drama in a movie format. The lines are delivered for stage performances... its continous dialogue. The sound track is stereo only and muffled at that. I kept turning up the sound to hear the words. I have a fibre optics stereo/movie system with full surround. After an hour of forcing myself to edure the movie, I turned it off. I have over 700 DVD's in my collection, and only two I regret buying and this is one of them.

If you can get your hands on a copy, you'd do well to listen to it before buying your own based on its hype. You may becomes as enamored as many others have. You find find it so-so as I do.

Years after first buying the album I still have it in \\"active rotation.\\" This is not for everyone.

I've heard so many people gush over Jeff Buckley and how wonderful he is and how I absolutely *must* get this album. I even pretended to like it, because I felt like I ought to. But, well, I don't. There's some good stuff here, but, having listened to so much of Tim Buckley's music, I can't help feeling what Jeff did was only a good start. Tim really knew his voice and did some amazing things with it. Jeff was a good interpreter of others' songs, but he hadn't quite arrived as a songwriter. Tim, of course, wrote his share of duds, but he wrote some wonderful songs, too. And his best ones sound effortless, which is more than you can say for Grace. Sketches... shows Jeff moving in a really interesting direction, and it's unfortunate we'll never see him fulfill his potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different","review":"I find his voice irritating, the mood down, and not a single song that I could tap my toes to, sing along, or an irresistible hook.

He sounds like he can't control it. Sometimes his voice sounds good, but then it goes weak. I'm amazed that so many people love it. This album is borderline pretentious and I just don't think the songs are very good. But some of the more atmospheric stuff sounds kinda cool, especially on the last song.P.S. - the guy's review below me is laughable. Buckley doesn't hit any \\"magic frequencies\\" - how pretentious! He can't hold a candle to NFAK either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointing","review":"When I bought this CD, the only song I'd ever heard Buckley sing was \\"Hallelujah.\\" Naturally, I was enthralled by Buckley's incredibly expressive falsetto--he really does make that track a religious experience. What I was not prepared for was the application of that same technique to every song Buckley sang. When I first listened to this CD, I felt like his rendition of \\"Hallelujah\\" was cheapened: he hadn't adapted his voice to the demands of that particular song, but simply poured his old formula into a particularly suitable mould. I don't mean to disrespect a late legend, but Buckley's impressive voice quickly loses its luster because of his disappointing lack of versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Speaks Here","review":"My ego wants to block out the spirit.

But, in my humble opinion, this is one of the best albums ever. Every song is a joy to listen to; though sometimes melancholy, the bitersweet tone of the man's voice is superb. Amazing song writing and he definitely put Hallelujah on the map as a beautiful piece of work. Cohen's haunting piece is made even more somber and sweet by this wonderful artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a second breath of fresh air.","review":"Current music has been sailing through a creative doldrums these past few years. The resurgence of c_ck rock and prefabricated pop acts had left me high and dry so I went through my old records and rediscovered Jeff Buckley's \\"Grace\\".I popped it in the cd player and immediately cued the title track. It was familiar yet it was refreshing to hear such a voice and a melody so alien to the ears. No 1-4-5 chord progessions, no cliched blues licks, no guy trying to sound like Eddie Vedder... I listened to the rest of the album. The haunting \\"Hallelujah\\" that Cohen himself couldn't hold a candle to still gives me shivers. I still knew all the words but I didn't dare sing along. It's a cardinal sin for a man to sing like that. But in this case Buckley is forgiven. \\"Last Goodbye\\" now carries with it a tinge of irony...It's such a waste. The whole experience just makes you want to think: WHY DIDN'T GOD TAKE SCOTT STAPP INSTEAD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must have album~!!!","review":"Not sure why I'd not heard about this album until last week. Thank goodness for Amazon's recommendation!What a gift this young man left us so shortly before his tragic death! That voice, oh his voice!! This is timeless, beautiful, lush album...I would have wanted to know before I purchased this album that I would become addicted. Hallelujah is so raw, you can feel it in your bones. Corpus Christ Carol... the vocal range, the vocal control is almost unearthly. Then going into Eternal Life, you cannot believe it's still him, his ability to move his voice around a song is uncanny.This is a treasure of music, lyrics, melodies, and that hauntingly beautiful voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"a lone voice amid the chaos","review":"Every once in a while an artist comes along that defies all description and categorization and rises above the chaos vying for our attention in popular music. That voice is Jeff Buckley! This cd will change your life. From the haunting mojo pin and dream brother to the flowing grace to the almost catchy last goodbye to the hymn like corpus christi carol, this cd is bound to move you beyond words. Pieces of his iconclastic father are inherent in him. Buckley operates at a level that forces you to confront conflicting emotions that lurk just beneath the surface in all of us but does it in such a way that it makes you comfortable being in that realm of the unknown. It's hard to describe. Like a long lost friend forcing you to confront yourself and who you are. Constantly challenging but never alienating. A voice like an angel and one that will be greatly missed. If you buy one cd this year, BUY THIS ONE! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and Beautiful","review":"Grace was the perfect showcase for Jeff Buckley's remarkable talent. Not once does this CD drag on or begin to sound all the same. Buckley's voice was beautiful, filled with anger, pain, and joy. Songs like \\"Last Goodbye\\", \\"Lilac Wine\\", and \\"Eternal Life\\" are perfect examples of Buckley's talent and passion for music. Grace was a great debut, and it's terrible that we had to lose such an amazing talent. If you do not own this album, buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of the Quasar","review":"This man's music moves through the soul, caressing like a new lover in the dark. I hear Calliope whispered in his dreams from the cradle. Nowhere on earth is his divine gift more apparent than on this, his only complete recording. If what you crave from music is a deeply emotional response, then you must experience Jeff Buckley's Grace. To put it personally, I have a love affair with his sound. With a voice that brings me to the brink and a songwriting style that pushes me over, I cannot resist. He was Heaven incarnate and his music is the blessing for the world. This collection of songs is sublime beyond compare. Please, please buy this and you will encounter a power greater than that at the heart of the quasar."},{"rating":"2","title":"astonishing","review":"i first became aware of jeff buckley when i saw the video for the song 'grace'. it was a song unlike anything i had ever heard before, or have heard since. it was one of those rare musical moments......being \\"blown away\\" by a song.how wonderful, too, that the rest of the disc holds up to the promise of that first song. shiver-inducing music doesn't come along often...... i can't recommend an album more than i do this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNED","review":"what can i say? i am stunned by the utter brilliance of this album. his voice is powerful and passionate, and his lyrics pack a powerfully emotional punch. unfortunately, i didn't really get what the hype was before and right after he died. when i heard \\"the last goodbye\\" for the first time, i became a convert to this wonderful artist, and am quite saddened that such a promising career was snuffed so short. jeff buckley was an artist of tremendous proprtions. i cannot rave more about this album, or this late artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't translate in words","review":"I don't know if Jeff was a genious or not,... I've never met him! But one thing I know, he could feel like no one I know. He surely felt things in a very deep way, and I say that only from hearing his songs. This man makes me cry with some of his songs and that's more that I can say about some other records that I've bought from other bands. I cannot say that he changed my life, but he surely changed my way of going through it, and when I'm sad or lonely, I know I can always count with Jeff Buckley and Grace to expell my sadness out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect...","review":"This song makes you believe... believe in the power of music, in love, in sensuality, in angels, in beauty, in the genius that was Jeff Buckley.

I listened to it twice to give it the benefit of the doubt and found there are are only 2 or 3 songs I would ever wanna hear on this album ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL MUSIC","review":"Jeff Buckley's rendition of the song Hallelujiah is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I have ever heard and can bring tears to my eyes. I first heard the song sung by Rufus Wainwright and started looking for it. While Leonard Cohen (who wrote it) is obviously an extraordinarily talented songwriter, Buckley's is the voice that delivers something remarkable. While Hallelujiah is worth the price of the CD to me, there are some other lovely recordings on it as well. Buckley has an incredible voice and emotional draw. I plan to share this CD with my special friends this Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghostly shadows swirl","review":"You can feel him listening to this record with you. The voice...the passion...the tragedy. My goodness this performance is what music is and has always been about...great artist gone before his time. The music is heartwrenching and classic.T8"},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Something New","review":"I first heard Grace four months ago and have since become a devoted fan. Without a doubt this mans music saved the 90's from bleak grunge and empty pop.Lyrically, I place him with Joni Mitchell, Carol King, McCartney/Lennon. His ability to communicate an idea or emotion with alarming directness and precision is a lost art in todays world of overly wordy pop music. As far as labeling his musical style... you really can't. Few other artists move from hard rock, jazz, soul, punk, 16th century music, and songs with eastern influences as effortlessly and as honestly as he does. You can tell Buckley was a true lover of music in general and appreciative of it's power.If you're new to Buckley's music, this CD is the best place to get your introduction (or Live at Sin-e). It's a very polished recording, but it's sure to spark your interest in his other albums (each more gritty and earthy) Mystery White Boy, and Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Everything...","review":"Grace is a seriously beautiful album. From the opening Mojo Pin, a mystical, flowing song, into the jamming Grace, from the gorgeous Last Goodbye into the sultry Lilac Wine.. from the classic-rockin' So Real into the sensual and heady Hallelujah, from the what if posing of Lover You Should've Come Over into the choirboy Corpus Christi Carol, from the edgy and posturing Eternal Life into the haunting Dream Brother, this album is a fabulous railroad trip straight into a beautiful state of grace, of music, that enchants, provokes and inspires.. one to get & hang onto, through the sun & rain.. though i must say it does seem to be a 'listen at night' selection.. very intriguing.. get it & never look back..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Lovely","review":"I heard Hallulujah years ago when I saw the German movie \\"The Edukators.\\" I was in search of the song for a long time, and it was not available until recently as a downloadable song after it was sung by an American Idol contestant.What can I say? The album is just beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great albums of all time","review":"Earlier this year I was watching the VH1 program \\"The List\\" and some musician chose Jeff Buckley's \\"Lover, You Should've Come Over\\" for what ever ridiculous category they were voting on and they played a small clip of the song. I was blown away and immediately rushed over to a record store and picked up a copy of \\"Grace\\". I am here to tell you it is one of the greatest albums I've ever purchased and cannot put into words what I feel about this album. From the somber beauty of \\"Hallelujah\\" to the chilling crescendo of So Real, you must buy this album if you like original and passionate music."},{"rating":"2","title":"These boots were made for...","review":"Jeff Buckley was a musical firebomb. He had a slow burn and a long comet like wake throughout his career. He had a nearly 'perfect' range as shown on Crusade era carols and mixed jams like 'Mojo Pin' and 'So Real'. To hear him whisper, 'I'm afraid....I'm afraid to love you,' is to hear beautiful resonate through sound- it was emotive, raw, shimmery, and sensual. The CD is the only full effort produced by Buckley encompassing the title of: complete album. Every other compilation was either unfinished (My Sweetheart the Drunk, revised and fretted over and then Buckley drowned) or it was a piecemeal of other recordings either caught live or pored over in remnants. However, one thing remains standard: Jeff Buckley was a tremendous vocalist with a gift for the dramatic, the flair of artistry, and although he drowned (following a familial confession of depression) his music rises from the fathoms as a beacon for real talent. If only he hadn't gone so soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"where did he come from???","review":"My brother had music playing before his wedding as everyone sat down, and \\"Hallelujah\\" was on the tape he had playing. I stopped in my tracks and closed my eyes. It was the most intoxicating song I had ever heard...I felt like falling to my knees and crying. A week later I ran to the store and bought \\"Grace.\\" I listened to it that night on my head phones and I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest. I couldn't contain it. Music had never, ever moved me so intensly. Right there in my bed I cried and cried over nothing at all and everything that ever happened to me at the same time. It was probably the strangest experiences I've ever had. Buy this CD. You will never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A showcase for his talent","review":"Even though Jeff is no longer with us, his music still lives on and \\"Grace\\" is enough proof of his talent and passion to music. Jeff's voice was absolutely beautiful, radiant, and powerful. I haven't heard such a haunting vocal performance as I have on \\"Hallelujah\\" and \\"The Last Goodbye\\" and those two songs make the album worth it. The entire album is amazing and all of the songs are great, but it's just a shame he wasn't given the chance to amaze us with more wonderful albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I was stranded on a deserted island I would want 3 things. A CD player, a copy of Grace, and plenty of batteries.","review":"This album is supernatural to me. I have listend to this album for over a decade now and still find it to be one of the most consistently amazing experiences every time I hear it. I am haunted that I will never be able to see him perform. That is where Buckley would have been attainable."},{"rating":"2","title":"tragic loss of talent. like father, like son.","review":"jeff buckley's father, tim buckley, was one of the great folk/rock artists of the late sixties/early seventies. jeff, like dad, had talent to burn, know doubt about it. three tracks on this album are classics: the stunning \\"hallelujah,\\" the equally stunning \\"lover, you should've come over,\\" and the string-laden rocker \\"eternal life.\\" these three tracks hint at what could have come had this artist not tragically died at such a young age. so much potential. i give this album 4 stars because i believe that, though a fantastic album you should definitely have, this is not a 5 star classic. it is fine through and through, but mostly suggests the huge potential jeff buckley had. if you have never heard his father's music, i highly recommend \\"happy sad,\\" and \\"blue afternoon,\\" both bona fide classics from 1969."},{"rating":"2","title":"How amazing is Jeff Buckley???","review":"All you have to do is look at this page...

Thankfully, I didn't buy this CD but was able to sample a friend's copy and found the remaining tracks downright awful. Obviously, this young man has a large and devoted following, but I would not recommend this CD to any of my musical friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Pseudo-Hybrid","review":"It seems like Jeff Buckley attempts to sound like a crossing between Elton John, Gary Moore, Montserrat Caballé and Muse, with a twist of progrock.He does not succeed in any of those attempts.His very little voice - whining and weeping, turning to distorted screaming during the refrains - is only partly compensated by the all but original acoustic guitar play, and only little more by the progrock inspired drums and electric guitars.Therefore, Jeff Buckley is at his best when he doesn't sing.But he does. So...The only OK song on 'Grace' is the final 'Dream Brother'. And still, it is only OK, not exactly brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graceless","review":"Regrettably, \\"Hallelujah\\" is the one track worth listening to on this Jeff Buckley CD. Although he was most assuredly gifted, talented and promising, this CD does nothing to buttress that opinion. One wants a more varied and nuanced portrait of this man and he is no longer with us to provide that diversity."},{"rating":"1","title":"So he died, so what???","review":"He's an alright musician, but how hard is it to inherit your fathers talents when it surrounds you everywhere? His music resembles it too much. Another thing, his music is so soft, listening to the first minute of this album made me want to go to sleep. I mean music shouldn't all be heavy, but cmon, this is sleepy stuff that is just, well if your having problems sleeping, pop this in your cd player and there you go. Over-rated to the extreme, the cd now now makes for a nice beer mug coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's EVER!!!","review":"If you have never heard Jeff Buckley's music you are doing yourself a grave injustice. The guy is an incredible musician whose debut album \\"Grace\\" seems to just get better with every listen. Some people might not get into it on their first listen, but given a few plays you are sure to be a member of his cult following. Songs like \\"Last Goodbye\\", \\"Lover..\\" and \\"Grace\\" are absolutely amazing. It's a real shame his life was cut short, for who knows what masterpieces we all missed out on. And if \\"Grace\\" isn't enough pick up \\"My Sweetheart the Drunk\\" where some of his best work including \\"Satisfied Mind\\" and \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" can be found. \\"Grace\\" is truly one of the greatest CD's you will ever find!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most emotional CD's","review":"This CD is amazing. His voice sounds a bit like Thom Yorke's (from radiohead) and is absolutely captivating and touching. Every single song is great. I recommend this album to people who are into brit pop or bands like the cranberries, smiths, depeche mode, or the cure. That list was compiled just to give you an idea of what musical genre he would best fit into. Regardless of the list, I feel it is vital for everyone to have a CD of this kind since it is special and unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeff Buckley","review":"This CD in a word-is horrible.

I've heard so many good things about Jeff Buckley, so I put my hard earned money down and bought his album. HUGE mistake. This album was obviously rushed together with little or no thought involved.

Well I decided to drink the Kool-aid and buy the CD- I figured, 'Hey, I like tragic rock stars, I like beautiful music when it's done right. I'll give it a shot.' I'm sorry I can't give a review to all the songs because I was always either asleep or had left the room by song six. He's the classic singer without a song- his lyrics are full of the type of mawkish, frat-boy pathos that sorority girls swoon over and anyone with a brain rolls their eyes or cringes at. He's nothing compared to the Cowboy Junkies or Nick Drake or Elliot Smith or Simon or Garfunkel. I only gave it two stars because it is indeed a good cd if you can't fall asleep. Another case of early death making someone into an undeserved legend. Maybe he might have matured into the genuine article but I guess we'll never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected AT ALL","review":"I bought this basically because Hallelujah is such an amazing song for his phenomenal voice. I thoughtwrongly that the other songs on here would be similar in nature. Well there are one or two that are sort of similar,but mostly the songs, while showing his vocal range, are like 70's prog rock or something. I didn't like them at all.I'm very very bummed about this purchase, I should have listened to more snippets of songs before I bought it.I still love his voice, the guy sings like an angel, but these songs in my opinion are not the best showcase for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over rated","review":"I bought this CD because I heard \\"Hallelujah\\" on \\"The West Wing\\" and really loved it. Still do, but the rest of the CD is either so so or noise. For those who think he has an amazing voice, have your hearing checked, as his voice is average at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting and Provocative","review":"Music lovers of all genre's will find something to remember in Jeff Buckley's memorable work. After hearing only a few bars of Grace, I purchased the CD, only to be amazed at the depth of emotion and musical ability in all the selections. He uses his voice as the prominent instrument, complimented by glimpses of mideastern melodies, folk influenced rock as well as hard driving rhythms that any rock lover will adore. Jeff Buckley was not afraid to explore and wander through melodies that surprise the listener with their unexpected twists and turns. Just when you think he is turning one way, his voice lifts you into another melodic direction. Each time you listen, there is more to hear and enjoy. Plaintive, sometimes sorrowful, and always beckoning the listener to hear more. Grace is my favorite with its haunting opening, its complex melodies and compelling lyrics and its ending that makes you want to play it time and time again."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure heaven","review":"This album can be described simply as an aural orgasm.

I CAN'T LISTEN TO ANYTHING ELSE.Where's OK Computer? I...just...can't...eject it.Magnificent, haunting, lush and beautiful and it rocks. Can't beat that. To everyone who compared it to Zeppelin, I agree, but he actually surpasses it because his voice makes Plant's voice sound like a banshee and a housecat in a blender, plus he's so PASSIONATE.

So its worth buying the first 4 seasons and just watching the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUGE DC FAN!!!!!","review":"I have waited for this season to be released ever since the show decided to end it's six year run. I am soooo happy about this coming to DVD. I hope that all of the seasons are released!!! Some hightlights of Season One would be:*Pacey and Mrs. Jacobs risky relationship*The episode called Detention, just like The Breakfast Club (classic)*When Joeys sister, Bessy has the baby*The struggle of Dawson's parents with a recent affair*The language used as if they are like 35 years old*Dawson's road trip with Jen's ex, Billy and Pacey*Joey singing in the Miss Windjammer pagentand last but not least...*Dawson and Joeys long awaited first kiss! :)This DVD included all 13 episodes:Pilot, Dance, Kiss, Discovery, Hurricane, Baby, Detention, Boyfriend, Road Trip, The Scare, Double Date, Beauty Contest, andDecisionsThere are some good DVD extras too. You should check it out. Very good buy for all DC fans or even new comers to the series!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Classic","review":"This TV series is really important to me, it is a part of my life I wont forget, watching it evry Friday. The boxed set is amazing!, all the episodes are a masterpiece!, The acting is great, and the plots rock!This is a 4-disc set With all 13 episodes from the first season which premiered in 1998. The only episode which isnt so great for me is \\"Double Date\\" its OK but not as exciting as \\"Detention\\", \\"Detention\\" is my favourite episode apart from \\"Pilot\\". If you are one of the shows fans, you should not miss out on the first season! It is a vital un-missable part of the whole show!, Season two is full of surprises aswell. I reccomend this awesome series 100%. Don't Miss Out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Quality-Low","review":"I just received the 3 DVD set of Dawson's Creek, Season 1. There are 13 episodes with commentaries. All of the episodes playback like the behind-the-scenes \\"look\\" of most DVDs. Any movement has blocks of data and extra digital lines, not the smooth transition from frame to frame. This is seen on normal playing, slo-mo, and pause. They just tried to fit too many episodes on each DVD and quality data was lost. The only good part is seeing the actors and the story line in the beginning. I don't know if the producers will improve the digital quality in season 2. I hope they do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Dawson's Creek...","review":"If you are a fan of the show at all, this is a must have. The first season exudes teen drama which is a guilty pleasure to a lot of us. The way the cast talk is just as fun as the love triangles. I would also like to comment the person who said to buy the \\"Buffy\\" DVD instead. These two shows have absolutly nothing in common and should not even be compared to one another. The only thing they have in common is the WB and teens. Dawson's Creek is a show that everyone can relate to about they're highschool years and coming of age. I recommend it to anyone who loves drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season","review":"This is a great season. When DirectTV carried the WB I used to watch this show in the first season, then directTV stopped carrying the channel. Recently I got into the show during the TBS re runs and decided to to get the first season DVD. I've already watched the whole DVD twice and wasnt bored once. This season had so many great storylines and never got boring. I highly recommend buying this DVD and I cant wait to find out if there coming out with the second season DVD soon.Anyone that watches this will love it. Dawson's Creek is one of the best shows i've ever seen. The acting is very good and the writing was great early on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY!!!","review":"I had just started watching it when it was about to be canceled. I got hooked when i watched it on TBS for the first time. The first season DVD is a must buy if you like drama and romance. It has it's funny parts. some of the episodes were pretty good, but not like the other ones. The saturday detention was my least fave, because that Abby girl was in it. Joey and Pacey are my faves. I can't wait for the second season DVD to come out. But until thenyou can watch it on TBS were their airing all 6 episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best television shows","review":"This is one of my favorite television shows. I have to admit I watched the first episode when it originally aired and did not like it but I decided to give the show a chance. I am glad I did because I grew to love it! I own the first season and final episode DVDs and can't wait for the rest. Season 3 was my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally","review":"I am so glad that this series is finally making it to DVD.

The first season is well-written and well-acted."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO SHORT!","review":"I used to watch this all the time when it was on the WB and fell in love with more and more through out each and every epsiode. Which is also why I now have the complete series as part of my collection. Love, betrayl, laughter and sorrow it is all within this series which is why I was appalled when this series was only six seasons. So if you are someone who loves all of those things then come and join Dawson, Joey, Pacey, Jack, Andy, and Jen and watch them through out this amazing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It took a little longer to arrive than I would like...but that's probably just because I'm impatient.

I can't wait for the other four seasons to be released!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unimaginative, and utterly overrated.","review":"(A teen on her dad's account, by the way) Although some people rave about how realistic this show is, it's not. No 15-year-old talks about the stuff these kids are gabbing about (obviously I know).Forlorn Dawson spends one half of the season fawning for the attention of Jen, and the other half whining about how he lost her. Joey spends her days dreaming about Dawson-either hating or loving him. Pacey, after his fling with educator Tamara Jones, becomes an uncool pimp. Jen is constantly pondering whether or not her and Dawson were meant to be (along with putting up with her strict Grams).Every issue is a dramatic, played-out problem for these overly matured \\"teenagers\\", who look down on anyone who have the slightest different piece of insight.The most interesting part of this O.C./One Tree Hill combo is the truth-or-dare Dawson/Joey and Pacey/Jen kisses in detention.I wouldn't EVER buy this, for the sake of my self-detainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEASON ONE IS A MUST!","review":"i love dawson's creek i have been watching it forever... i cant believe they are cancelling it, but Season 1 is great, just waiting for the rest of the seasons to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible horrible","review":"This show is very slow and not even good storylines.

You don't know what you missed. This is when DC was good. The writing was good and the group actually interacted with each other. It's truly sad to see what Dawson's Creek has become. At least ther will always be Season One."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm so incredibly exited!","review":"Anyone who has been obsessed with Dawson's Creek for as long as I have, knows what I huge deal this DVD is. If you have just recently started watching the show, and you think it's awful.. please buy this dvd and realize that when this show first started, it was an artistic masterpiece that literally blew everyone away. Although I personally favor Season 2 to Season 1, most fans would agree that Season 1 was just as amazing, if not more so. The episode on this DVD to watch would definitly be The Beauty Pagent, #111. It pretty much sums up what made this show what it was. To all the fanatics out there who have been watching since they were 10.. and hung up Pacey posters in their locker.. this one is definitly for us. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing 2 shows","review":"I am the biggest Dawsons Creek fan and i was so excited to get the first season dvd...but was very upset when it did not include 2 of the shows on the dvds.On the paper telling what shows there were suppose to be it showed all of them but then it skipped two when i was watching them.I loved the ones it did show but i wanted to have the other two as well, i just thought i would let someone know about what was going on, i dont expect anything i just wanted to let you guys know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Season, Bad DVD","review":"The first season of Dawsons Creek was great. Filled with the drama of these Capeside Teens, it has everything to keep you entertained. However, whoever was in charge of editing this to DVD did a screw up job. In more than one part, the dialog is totally mismatched with the characters. Its looks like a bad bruce lee movie. Also the picture is very low quality and the most grainy looking DVD I have ever seen. Only buy this if your a die hard fan, and can overlook these very annoying things."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT reality","review":"This show epitomizes all that is wrong with society today. Throw together a bunch of semi-good-looking kids, overpriced mall clothing, and an SAT word list, and producers think they've got a hit show by banking on the stupidity of TV viewers. Unfortunately, they've succeeded, considering that this show is still on the air. This show tries too hard to be \\"realistic\\" (Joey Potter has a pretty nice wardrobe that never repeats for a so-called poor girl) and to \\"address issues\\" (is a student-teacher affair really as pertinent to teenagers as something like bullying or acne?). If you want a real show that portrays teenagers realistically, try My So-Called Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"This show deserves NO STARS","review":"I was in high school when this show came out and I attempted to watch it. However, watching Dawson's Creek is very similar to having someone bludgeon you over the head repeadtly. Everything on this show could be so much better; the acting, the writing, the music. The actors, especially Dawson are incredibly terrible and don't convince you for one minute they are the intelligent young minds the writers want you to believe they are. And, if you are looking for diversity, pass by this exclusionary look at a suburban high school and neighborhood. In this day and age, you would think writers and creators would realize how many different kinds of people there are in the world.Buy the first season of Felicity instead; a show that isn't condescending and totally un-realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why you should buy Buffy DVD's instead!","review":"Dawsons Creek is one of those melodramatic teen shows. It's a stupid show. The dialogue is somewhat interesting, but not enough. They talk, and talk, about nothing. It's just boring [stuff]. Buffy showcases excellent dialogue, great humor, and even violence occasionally. If you want something of this teen genre, then why not the best. Don't buy second rate garbage, buy Buffy the Vampire Slayer. You won't regret it.P.S. If you already own the Buffy DVD's and your thinking about buying Dawsons Creek, don't. Get a movie, I recommend Citizen Kane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up all night with Dawson's Creek","review":"I had never seen any episodes from the series Dawson's Creek, so it was all brand new to me when I purchased season one. I figured that the lovely Katie Holmes was worth purchasing the DVD's of season one. I am very glad I bought the DVD's. I started to watch the first episode around 8:00 p.m. on a Friday night and I was hooked and ended up watching all 13 episodes until about 6:00 a.m. I am now a fan and I can't wait for Season two. In my opinion this is the best teenage TV series of all time. It triggered nearly every emotion in me as I quickly became familar with each of the characters. Being almost 29 years of age I still related with everything in this series. I think this series can help anyone with their own personal dateing experiences. Great series! I am hooked and am looking forward to seeing the next four seasons on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for more...","review":"This is a wonderfuL DVD collection. It literally takes me back to the original reasons of why I was so captivated with Dawson's Creek in the first place. Watching the first season again I realize how much I had forgotten, and having now seen the later seasons and the finale, the first season makes so much more sense now. My only criticism and regret is that the series is now over after six seasons, and only the very first season is available for purchase. In my opinion, they should atleast have the first four seasons out on DVD by now. Oh well, no matter when they bring out the rest of the DVD's I will purchase them all, I just hope that it happens soon..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nido Milk Powder","review":"I ordered \\"Nido\\" because my old favorite, \\"Milkman\\", is no longer being made.

The Canon ink cartridges last such a short time that I find it cheaper to take copies to the nearest quick print store. Now I find that the scanner won't work if ink is empty.

Printer broke on me by telling me that the feeder was \\"jammed\\" when in fact there was not one shred of paper in the machine. I must say, Canon customer service on the phone was very helpful and responsive and is in the process of mailing me a replacement(refurbished) printer. They weren't painful about it at all. That said, I'm not too happy the printer broke down. Print quality was a 7-8 on a scale of 1-10. Not as crisp as I've seen, but not terrible at all.

I bought ink for this printer about a month ago, after using the printer for two weeks, the low ink display came on. It kept showing this everytime I would print. Two weeks later since the first display came on, the ink is now completly empty. Typically we print about ten pages a week.

I have read many motivational books and found most of them interesting, but none have gripped me so strongly that I read it from first word to last without a break. Joe's book takes you back to your beginnings when the world was your oyster and shows you that it still is. Even more, he reminds you of the truth of your early feelings and attitudes which have been beaten out of you over the years, and restores the confidence you once felt. I recommend this book to anyone who has reached the stage that I had, knowing that I was swimming across the current of life or even against it, not knowing how to change direction and go with the flow again. This book is inspirational. So stop chasing your tail and read it. You will never regret it.

It has been cruelly criticized. Quite the most bitter things that could have been said about it have come from the side of literary rather than of political criticism. To that extent they are negligible and beside any real point. Hitler's mind teemed in Landsberg as it teemed since, with a multitude of urgent ideas. It must have been of immense mental service to him to set them down, with the aid of the enthusiastic and devoted Hess, and reduce them to the order and the cogency of ink!THIS BOOK, IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED, WAS ADDRESSED TO THE ADHERENTS OF THE ORIGINAL GERMAN WORKER'S PARTY, AND IN NO WAY APPEALED TO OPPONENTS AT HOME OR TO FOREIGNERS ABROAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Thought this might be an interesting insight into such a twisted man.

He blamed all of Germany's problems on the Jews- they controlled the banks and the media, had money and didn't spend it, horrible for the economy. Also it was revenge for Germany's embarassment during World War One. The language is foul- kike this, Jew that. They set up concentration camp ghettos- sent into gas chambers and ovens. I think it is a sour taste on 20th century Germany. Thise who survived the Holocaust mostly fled to America. Martin Luther started the Jew bashing in the 1500s when he opened up the door to Protestantism. The Jews tried to reinvent themselves as successful. I think Hitler is a joke. Hungary was bought out during WWII and along with Austria was a big turncoat- Sweden remained a neutral country. I wasn't around during WWII, I don't know what it was like. Transylvania was bought out during WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"If not for its infamous author, this book would not sell.","review":"The reason I started Mein Kampf was because I wanted to look inside the mind of Adolf Hitler. I never did finish the book and I found it infinitely boring. There is no emotion in it! It's like reading a newspaper. Furthermore, it is inaccurate. Hitler is usually about a year or two off with his dates, according to other biographies of him I have read. By the way, the book was not written, it was dictated to Rudolf Hess while Hitler was in prison.

Anyone who cannot read this book and see past the facile solutions presented for our world's problems is ignorant in the worst way and/or a racist and anti-Semite.

Its anti-Semitic arguments are still powerful, even though weaker than 80 years ago...I would recommend that only Jews or philo-Semites read this book, others may be swayed away, seduced by many classical anti-Semitic arguments (the alleged ethnicity of the first communists and the communist takeover in Russia, concerning financial and media power, etc.) And one Holocaust is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mein Kampf","review":"Talk about long winded!!!

I went into the library and within reading 60 pages of this tripe, I slept for the next four hours. It should be known that while Mein Kampf was a big seller during Hitler's reign, almost nobody outside the Party read it, it was so poorly written and obtuse. It is too bad that people read this crap and try to make its author more than what he was, an extremely lucky, but grossly ignorant man whose philosophy came from the gutters of Vienna and his inspiration from an event (WWI) that should never have happened. By the way, I hold a history degree which specializes in modern European history, so this is not simply another nay-sayer letter written by someone who has no background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mein Kampf","review":"I am in the process of reading Mein Kampf and am nearing the end. I have found that the book is useful for the purposes of understanding Adolf Hitler as a person. I have also found out by reading the book that Adolf Hitler was not a hypocrit, and nearly all ramblings on did come to light.In addition, I felt that the most interesting thing about the book was that Hitler knew that in order to have a National Socialist State he needed to introduce his policies to every person by making them first nature to all Germans and so that they, particularly younger people, would know little different. In effect, it would be the uniting foundation to their existence, all sharing and striving for one ideal over personal greed.

The Hitler who wrote Mein Kampf was not yet a grand figure, but a rather pathetic racist demagouge who lacked an education, a knowledge of history, and any well-formed, decent ideas. By all means, read this book if you are interested in the modern history of Europe, but understand that this is not the work of a man who knew much about what he attempts to describe. Influenced not by reason and truth, but by absurd racial philosophy, Mein Kampf is terrifyingly devoid of clarity. That it became a holy book of a national movement for twenty years is a testimony to the unholy persuasive powers of the author and to the dreadful pathology of his age."},{"rating":"1","title":"necesary if you want to understand Adolf Hitler","review":"I am not a nazi, and Im not a jew, Im the former of an anti-nazi militia unit. But in order to understand Hitler, you have to read this book, because it will help you understand all the facts of ww2, since the rising of Hitler, to the formation of death and concentration camps and the extermination of more than 6 million jews, by reading this book you will understand that only with the mentality of Hitler, and the discipline of German soldier was it possible to form such things as the Gestapo or the Waffen-SS, only a person with the mentality of Hitler would be able to write all the crimes he would comit in a book, and explain why the Nazi party passed to history as the most dreadful empire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitlers views exposed","review":"Mein kampf roughly translated means my struggle. but how can a man who knows only hatered know anything about a struggle. in this in depth review of his life events he trys to portray his life as one of many inner tormoils. in the 600 or so pages he explicitly made his views known about the jewish community. not being jewish i read this book with an open mind and a huge curiosity about a book that has caused so much trouble. this book however should NOT be read by anyone who i sthe least bit sensitive to the subject matter portrayed. Hitler sees \\"jewism\\" as a plauge and he thinks and feels its the jews that bring his country down. His own inner stuggle comes to light in comments he makes such as \\" i free the world of all that is jewish so that i do the work of the almighty\\".

I like politics also, because out of reason rather than genuinely wanting to be different, I differ greatly in political stance. What he says in some ways has bearing in real life. It's so funny, too. Most people view anything they deem deviant with bias. This is real world history- not just some racist talking. Hitler is an icon- the media made him one just like Charles Manson. Manson was a scapegoat for the love generation, Hitler was a scapegoat for the melting pot generation.

He has some surprisingly shrewd insights but his plans and ambition are pure dementia. It's very political but his plans for the supremacy of the race and destruction of the inferior ones are clearly outlined and the \\"philosophy\\" behind it simply put: basically, the way of Nature is survival of the fittest and Germans will be the fittest and ANY means will be acceptable to that end.I simply CANNOT believe any reviewer who actually read the book could write, as one did: \\"he never suggested the harming of the handicapped, Gypsies or Jews in Mein Kampf, or in any of his writings.\\"You have to be incredibly blind, incredibly obtuse or incredibly hypocritical to not see the writing on the wall in Mein Kampf.

But this book shows HIS point of veiw, and while he did do horrid things, he had his own problems. he lived a hard life, struggling for food adn shelter. He wanted to know, be educated. And this often times led to his being secluded, deep in his studies. I think maybe this slowly, but surely, drove him somewhat insane. And he somehow got dragged into goverment (how, I'm not sure as i havent finished it yet). it really lets you see life through his eyes, and while I'm not defending him, he had reasons for his wrongdoings. he was in turmoil his whole life. the book does have its low, boring points, but as a whole it is totally worth reading, very interesting to see Hitler's story through his eyes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"arbajt mach fraj","review":"You can't attempt to read this book with a closed mind.

What I am attempting to convey is what adolf hitler attempted when writing Mein kampf. if you read this book with an open mind it will surly make you re-evaluate your current outlook on capitalism communism and hopefully life itself. if nothing else you will at least walk away with a clearer perception of how the events of WW2 and Adolf Hitlers rise to power came to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE BOOK QUALITY EVER","review":"The book quality is .... i just can't say it is just the worse , the quality of the paper is just like a very cheap peper.i dont have any further comment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of a Mad Man","review":"I can just simply say that this is the diary of a mad man. Any rational person needs to read this book to understand what state of mind Hitler was in before he completely lost his sense of reality. It should show us to never again allow someone with these views to be allowed in public office or in our military!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor edition: lazy, sloppy translation","review":"I'm reviewing this particular edition of Mein Kampf, not the book itself or Hitler's arguments. If you just want to understand what Hitler's philosophy was, this is fine and inexpensive.HOWEVER, I bought this for research purposes, and have found that the translation is sloppy. Moreover, it is full of typos and I find it difficult to believe it was even proof-read before going to print. For example it has Hitler referring to a battle in \\"1948\\", when it is obviously 1848. Another example: \\"It would be a stake to think that the followers of various political parties...\\". Surely that should be \\"mistake\\", not \\"stake\\". Unfortunately this edition is riddled with errors such as this, which is only a reflection of lazy translation and proofing. As a result, I can't be 100% sure that it is accurate, so will have to cross-reference with another edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Finest Version","review":"This particular version of Mein Kampf by Ralph Manhein is by far the best. It captures the true essence of Hitler's thought in a readable, accessable English. Part of this is due to the fact that it was written before the defeat of the Third Reich, before a great deal of politically correct babble entered the discourse about this important political work. Hitler's thoughts on International Judaism and the long-term threat it poses to the West come across clearly. In other translations, Hitler is made out to look like some sort of monster, while Manhein makes clear that he was simply a somewhat misguided German patriot. A must for anyone trying to understand the real history of the 1933-1945"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adolf Hitler","review":"you cant judge why a tyrant did all his actions without knowing the way he thinks so i have decided to read his book a big one i dont know when i'll start to read it"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fun read","review":"The translation is fine.

The only value this book has to a modern, free society is as a primary historical source and insight into the psyche of the original author. I bought this book as a supplement for my latest Open University module (Religion in History) which will take me halfway through a history degree.

The most interesting parts are the action plans Hitler had in mind for the National Socialists. His insights into the vapidness of the media and the political timidity of the average citizen are quite acute. But this is far outweighed by the unsupported theorizing on race and history and by the Jew-baiting. This was a man in a hurry, who couldn't spare the time to research or re-write this very rough draft, although in the end it did him ample service as it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mein Kampf Review","review":"Mein Kampf is exactly like what it is infamous for.

The problem with this whole\\"Hitler in his own words\\" thing is that this isn't an organized manifesto at all. It doesn't even qualify as a decent rant. It reads like what it is, a transcribed series of demented monologes dictated by *der Adolf* while he was cooling his heels in jail after the failed Munich *putsch*. Sure it's all in there, the Holocaust, the war, the whole schmeer, but who can wade through the morass of turgid prose to find it? Who would want to? Imagine reading a transcript of fifty drunken, disjointed, endless *speils* by your racist old uncle against Jews, bankers, Communists and whoever else he had decided to hate that day.

The tittle, when translated into English means My Struggle. Personally, my struggle was just getting through the first half of the book! I only hope that this look lost some of its meaning when it was translated from German. That would be a pretty good excuse for a book that was very confusing. Hitler uses analogies to explain everything. I wish he would have just come out and say what was on his mind. This would have saved me a lot of time. I have to admit, once you read through this book, it does start to make more sense. What he says explains why he hated the Jews so much. I just think that a 700 hundred-page book on Hitler's political views is a little too much. But, if you like long books about European politics, this is the book for you, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The thoughts of simple hate?","review":"When I read MEIN KAMPF(in the following MK) some weeks ago for the first time, I saw that all the trouble about this book is nothing but nonsense. MK is a book about the thoughts, ideology and fanatism of a man, whose horrible madness brought the second World War. I cannot understand, why a book like MK is a kind of bible for some people. It is terribly written, full of grammatical and orthographical errors; the most terrible German I have ever read. Because of being a history student, I can only see an advantage of reading this \\"work of art\\"; only to understand the ideas that made the ideology of the WWII. This book is worth to be bought only, when the background is known. Without the background, this book is nothing but dirt, just the thoughts of a madman. The only right way to use this \\"thing\\" is to read it together with books like Winston Churchill's \\"The Second World War\\" and the Hitler biographies by Joachim Fest or Ian Kershaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Refuse To Pay More Than One Penny For What Cost The Publisher NOTHING.","review":"This book is an historical document.

If this was the first Hamilton book I picked up I'd never read another. However I do know this is not the norm for her.

I loved the new characters and story line she developed but she dropped them and us cold in the final five chapters with no salve or warmth to make it okay.I despised it when Ann Rice dragged us along on her theological crisis after hooking us with her earlier books. I am not going to like it any better if Laurell Hamilton behaves similarly by the wonton destruction of her characters when she is grieving.I agree with another of the reviews. I hope she writes a sequel (and quickly) that provides the characters with some hope and relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your usual Laurell K Hamilton","review":"I am writing to warn first time readers of Laurell K.'s work. Do not read this one first! I am a huge fan and have been for years. I write the release dates of her new books on my calendar and MUST buy it on the day of release! This almost seems like a book intended for youth. (If not for the violence and gore.) I slugged through it for a week. I usually read her books, even the newest ones that topple 800 pages, in about 3 days. I had to make myself read this one. My advice for all of her fans is DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME ON THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Ravenloft Novels!","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book! A young girl discovers she has the ability to control magic. The novel describes excactly what she feels when working with magic and what the magic does to her. I experienced that whats on the backside of the book is not the core of the novel; the magic itself is! Another great thing of the book is the beginning and the ending. The start of the book has (almost) nothing to do with the core of the book. Only in the end everything falls in place.

I have read and Love all the Anita Blake Series and Meredith Gentry Series, but this book was totally different, it was very dark and disturbing. Though it was well worded written, the characters lacked the vitality of her other books, it was just to mortifying to be enjoyed. If you love Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry I wouldn't suggest reading this book, it takes away from the spirit and Vitality of her other books, and characters. It has neither happy endings nor any happiness in between, it's depressing and sad. It also ended with finality, leaving far too many loss ends and questions about other characters and surroundings. It is almost as if she got tired of writing it and ended it halfway through the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Effort to Read It.","review":"This book is terrible for a dozen reasons.

I felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laurell Hamilton wrote this?","review":"I have been a Laurell Hamilton fan for years. This is my first disappointment in her writing.

I have loved every other book that she has written for her other series. I was dissappointed in this book. I thought the charecters were underdeveloped, and the story line did not stay consistant enough to want me to read any other books in this series.

Over all it is the best Ravenloft book I have read so far out of four."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible... don't buy!","review":"This book was ridiculously bad, and it pushed into a place where I seldom go with novels. Skimming. The amount of pointless exposition, slowness of the plot, and plain stupidity on the part of the characters meant I didn't have the patience to read every word. It was a good decision.The magic and abilities possessed by the heroine (I've already forgotten her name) got ignored or misapplied. In the end there is no resolution; while it is the trend of Ravenloft fiction to leave the reader with terrible despair, that does not preclude a real ending. \\"I, Strahd\\" was so much better...Overall, don't read this. Don't buy it. It is a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Hope","review":"***SPOILERSOkay, I feel entitled to be in rant mode because I just bought this book today and was determined to finish it before I went to bed.

After reading the Anita Blake series where this regular girl gets out of every unlikely and devastating situation it just seemed wrong.

I was extremely disappointed! I don't think I'm simply spoiled by the rich character development in her Anita Blake books. Hamilton does action & tension well enough, but the plot...where was it going? Why introduce the reader to characters, then sloppily kill them off? It was like a really bad made-for-TV movie on paper. I finished the book only because I though Hamilton would redeem herself. She failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dissapointed","review":"Caution - Spoilers!Having devoured the Anita Blake series, and being a big fan of the DnD fantasy genre, I was very much looking forward to \\"Death of a Darklord\\". Maybe my expectations were too high, but the book was a terrible let-down. To begin, the story moves fairly slow with only mediocre character development. Additionally several sub-plots are started towards the end of the book with no continuing development or resolution. At the end we are left in total despair for the hero's, who all face emotional and/or physical destruction, while the villain skates away clean.The last chapter almost feels like LKH went over the deadline for the story and was forced into an unintended ending. Either that or there was a sequel planned that for whatever reason was never published.This is not what I read these types of books for, and I found myself wanting back the hours I dedicated to reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the effort to get excited","review":"ok..I realize this was a rerelease of an early novel..all I can say is Thank whoever needs to be thanked that LKH has improved her writing.

What a scene! That is, until you read the book. I found that the story followed the life of a much gifted young woman and her adopted family. The main backbone of the plot was the family's inability to accept differences in others. I have not read many horror books (this being my first and last) and have found the genre not worth my time. This book is quite a let down after reading Ms. Hamilton's Anita Blake books. It lacks a leading character and a plot. The only saving grace of this book would be Ms. Hamilton's writing style.

The other one involved incest and I think I dislike this book even more than the other. It's got some typical Hamilton elements: angry characters, gross, slimy and undead creations, and dark scary scenery. What is especially disappointing is the utter lack of anything remotely joyful, or happy, or even positive in the ending. Hamilton gives you all these characters, just begins to develop them so you start to care about them - then ruins every single one with the most depressing, unhappy ending possible.I was hopeful up until the very end because it seemed we were at the VERY least going to get a satisfying ending to the love story. Nope, killed that, too.Come on, Hamilton. Give us something!I'm sorry I read this book. It left me feeling depressed and disappointed. I wish I'd never picked it up.

There is also a host of information on chosing fabrics, threads, how to begin on aida and linen, information on streatching, cleaning, and framing and dozens of patters and suggestions for thier use. I have been stitching since my teens and I still use this book almost every single time I sit down to work on a project. It is a compact way to make sure you are doing things the correct way to have your work turn out wonderfully!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for beginner or advanced cross-stitcher","review":"I have done cross stitching for years and still learned alot of interesting things from this book.

There truly is nothing more gratifying than finding the trouble spot, based solely on observing my dog's behavior, and then being able to refer to this wonderful book for stretching and therapeutic techniques that allow my dog to feel wonderful, almost instantly. I have bought this book for at least 3 of my dog owning friends who swear by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who drew this thing????","review":"I expected so much more based on previous reveiws (and price). This small book (yes, it has 163 pages, but it's only 5\\"x7\\") has line drawings that are so crude and childish they are useless. Utterly useless. Since this book is about canine chiropractic--knowing specifically where and how you touch the dog is vital to doing the adjustment correctly. You can't tell what the drawings are attempting to convey and have to go solely by the text which is more detailed than the pictures, but I feel the book really needed both to be of any use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every dog owner should read this.","review":"As a practicing holistic veterinarian, I highly recommend \\"The Well Adjusted Dog.\\" I have a copy in my waiting room.

It had nothing on use of an activator, Chiropractic tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book","review":"This book is pretty good for the pet owner that is interested in the well being of their pet. I agree with other reviewers that the jargon used in this book may be difficult to understand if you are not familiar with chiropractic. The only downside to the book is a little bit of ranting and conspiracy theory done by the author that gets a little old, but it is not that big of a downer. Altogether, this is an excellent book and provides some excellent information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. I could have written a better one if I tried just a little.","review":"Way too basic...

I was excited to find a book on desert gardening. But this book was a disappointment.It is limited in content. A handful of veggies, fruits, flowers and herbs. Nothing that explains the difference one finds with desert gardening. The only thing that made it a desert gardening book was advice on planting time. This could have been accomplished on a single page. I know, because I had already downloaded a single page with the same data, for free, from an Arizona gardener.I've paid less for more information. Everything else, on plant care and soil, can be found in the other books I have purchased.There is no mention of container gardening, which is GREAT for those of us in Vegas with awful clay yards. Right now I am growing black kale in a GeoPot in my kitchen. I bring it in on our frigid nights, and put it out in the sun during the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Organic gardeners: I recommend this read!","review":"Excellent book. Needed it for an organic gardening class, and I think it is a book I will read and continue to reference even after the class is over.

The Postal Service recently honored Mel Ott by issuing a commemorative stamp and named him one of the all time great sluggers.

They combine raw Northern Black Metal style with industrial beats. A trio, they have no drummer.. Instead they prefer the lifeless beats and timing of a high-tech drum machine. Very fast in spots, but yet most every song has a change of pace where it is needed. A couple of songs get a bit monotonous in spots but the overall quality of the album makes up for it. As far as the band's integrity in the scene, they are as true to the music as any band in Black Metal. Get this one today.. you won't be disappointed!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally one big enough ^.^","review":"My grandmother has huge pans, so pancakes & omelettes have a tendancy to spreeeeaaaaaad!

Rather than analyzing the dynamics of why a church experiences a worship war, he instead describes differing worship styles among various congregations. He only gives a passing treatment of why a worship war begins within a church body, and what can be done to diffuse it or to discourage it.I recommend \\"America's Worship Wars\\" by Terry York instead of this title by Towns. Towns provides interesting reading, but the best treatment by far is given by York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Researched..Highly recommended..","review":"One of the best books written about the Bataan Campaign. Whitman brings back to life the actual scenarios, heroes, and conditions during the Battle of Bataan.

Whitman, an Airborne Infantry officer in the US Army, is also a fantastic researcher who has painstakingly produced a fantastic book. \\"Bataan\\" gives a nice \\"map level\\" view of the war, showing where each unit deployed and fought. At the same time, there are plenty of anecdotes and veterans stories to show how individual soldiers acted during the campaign.If you are interested in the history of the Philippines, or the Bataan Campaign, I think you will enjoy \\"Bataan: Our Last Ditch.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"This is just as flimsy as the less expensive models.

He plays the part of a deputy D.A. trying to bring a witness back to court in the U.S. but is being tracked by killers. Some beautiful scenery in Canada as he spirits his witness from a cabin and takes her to the train that will wind through the countryside. The action is non-stop with a helicopter chasing them shooting machine guns to the men hunting them on the train. A game of cat and mouse aboard the train is tense. It has you wondering who exactly is after her, and who are just passengers. Great cast with many familiar faces. Reminds you a little of a Hitchock style like \\"The Lady Vanishes\\". I highly recommend it. The DVD doesn't have much in the way of features but subtitles. Good quality picture and sound. If you enjoyed this be sure to catch \\"The Package\\" and \\"Enemy of the State\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD review","review":"This is one of my all time favorite movies.

Once, we arrived late at a theatre for the movie we wanted to see and couldn't get in. We had to settle for \\"Night Hawks\\" - a movie we thought was going to be another Stallone cookie cutter money maker. Wow, were we wrong. The same thing applies to Narrow Margin. First, it's a remake of an earlier film (1952) and for once, the remake is vastly superior to the original. Hackman is the reason to watch this film - he is pitch perfect as the non-action hero. He is an honest every-man who has to deal with a reluctant witness, relentless hit-men, a speeding train and danger at every turn. Hackman's character maintains his cool, wise cracking his way through encounters with the people who want him and his witness dead.Crisp writing. Sharp dialog. non-stop action and great direction and editing - this film has it all. It's a real surprise and great escape-est entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"takes you to the edge of suspense (but no further)","review":"I saw this in the theater whe it came out. The ads said \\"It takes you to the edge of suspense.\\" And it did, just to the edge, not to actual suspense, just the edge. Stick to Fleicher's noir classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare for the Colonel to bear hug your brain...","review":"I first heard of guitar and vocal expressionist Col. Bruce Hampton Ret. by way of Mike Gordon's film \\"Outside Out.\\" Most of the soundtrack from that movie was lifted from Hampton tunes that he recorded with any number of his previous outfits, such as Aquarium Rescue Unit or Fiji Mariners. On this album you get that same unmistakable Colonel Bruce feeling. If you enjoy listening to chazoid noodlings, truly outceptional freedom of expression, and all around high quality musicianship, this might be a good buy for you. My particular favorite track on Arkansas is \\"Fixin' to Die,\\" where you hear the blues as only Bruce can sing them. The brilliance of the Colonel is that as strange as it may get, and as far out as he may take you, he remains honest the whole time, a guy who's voice you can trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mixed Bag","review":"I picked this book up randomly, being a fan of her novels but not familiar with her complete body of work. I find that her short stories are more satisfying and expressive than her poems, although one of my favorite poems of all time is in this collection. Still, it is a mixed bag overall; some poems are gems and some are absolutely ignorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave the Music Alone!","review":"I am just so upset that they decided to change so many of the songs for the dvds in order to make them more affordable. The music, to me, was a big part of what made some of the episodes so good. I counted and they changed 94 songs for the season 2 dvd set. No more \\"Kiss the Rain\\" by Billie Myers or \\"Save Tonight\\" by Eagle Eye Cherry, \\"She's So High\\" by Tal Bachman, or \\"Shimmer\\" by Shawn Mullins, among MANY others. It's terrible. So if you are just interested in the show and not so much the music, then you'll probably enjoy the set, but if the music is important at all and you already have the episodes on video tape, then DON'T BOTHER to get the dvd sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"I have been waiting for Season 2 since I bought season 1 last summer.I wasn't very happy about the music changes at first, but now that i have watched the entire DVD, the music that Paul Stupin chose to replace the original broadcast is awesome. If you are a Dawson's Creek fan, this DVD is a must. It's my favorite season. A Perfect Wedding #219, is in my all time top 5 episodes. I look forward to getting Seasons 3-6 on DVD.

This DVD is better quality than the first or just as good. The main thing that I wanted to say is that not ALL of the music was replaced and most of the songs are still in the first episode and some of the others. So if these were the things that would make you not want to buy Dawson's Creek that is silly, but if so now you know that some of the music is still there and they only did it to cut cost of the DVD set anyways. The music that is put in was redone by Paul Stupin and he is the one who picked all of the other great music for the show, so therefore, the music will be good anyways. This season is a must own and I hope that everyone that is a fan buys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love dawsons creek","review":"I have seen all of dawsons creek seasons and i love the longest day ever episode...i cried my eyes out on it.

I encourage every DC fan to get this. Keep the DC season dvds coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dawson's crap","review":"I could deal with some songs replaced in the show but some of the more poignant moments like in the SEcond season are ruined with replacement music. Like when Pacey and Tamar reunite or at the Dance. What is even more disgusting is the replacement of the Theme song in the third season dvd set. I hope this isn't the precedent for all Dawson's creek Dvd sets. Not highly recommended but sufficient enough to cure that Dawson's Creek fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Love Dawson's Creek!!!","review":"Wow, this is a wonderful season.

Most people probably don't know who Paula Cole is, but they definitely know the song. Parodies of the show even highlight the song. Dawson's Creek is just not Dawson's Creek without it.

Pacino's speeches as the mayor of New York City were powerful and full of melodrama . . . the good kind of melodrama that made you realize that he was manipulating everyone until the very end. Cusack was great in this movie that gave him a chance to show off his superb acting skills. He completely takes on the persona of the naive politican from Louisana who realizes that the fine web of political intrigue he's in the middle of may be the trap that destoys him and New York. Bridget Fonda also stars as a lawyer wholly devoted to getting justice for her client, the wife of a murdered police officer. As I said, I wanted to love this movie, but I never really got a chance to identify with the characters. But, on the other hand, that may have been the idea all along. A great realistic drama, that I would recommend to see at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film that sticks out in my mind","review":"This film is ver underated. I realise that people have complained about its apparent lack of real direction in terms of a plot development but it is a realistic look into the heart of a corrupt judiciary. Corruption in real life does not always involve a white house assistant / boy scout who uncovers a scandal that directly implicates the president as a murderer. Is film shows us the two faces of the story and aside from that the actors are superb.

Each of the actors in this criminal injustice movie are compelling. Cusack's plight is what endears him to the viewer--restive in nature, the Louisiana boy attempts to save Pacino's administration and future but, is unable to resurrect him in the end. While Pacino is resolute in his hopes, dreams and desires, his role as the Greek mayor of New York City is plagued with a plethora of problems that he can no longer control. His prior associations for good or bad is what is his final Waterloo. This film is resplendent in its depiction of police and political depravity.

This product does not work. I have tried numerous times on different wine bottles and have had absolutely no success. Save your money and soak your bottles in water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricky, but worth the work","review":"Definitely not a quick solution, but by far the most successful. I used to soak my bottles in water only to then have to scrape off mushy labels and paste them into a book. I would recommend rubbing very firmly with a hard object (they recommend a spoon; it worked well for me) and checking carefully to make sure you have no air bubbles. I waited 12+ hours (overnight) before peeling off as the adhesive gets stronger with time. When I peeled them off the next day, I had no problems and the labels came off perfectly. I would definitely recommend letting the bottles sit for a few hours before trying to peel off but this product works. It also helps if you understand that the purpose is to remove the papery front of the label from the sticky back - go in with the right expectations and you will do fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experienced at this","review":"I have been peeling labels for the past year and have had trouble finding HEAVY laminating paper which is what I was previously using. I ordered the Oenophilia Label Lift and the Wine Appeal label remover. NO COMPARISON. The Oenophilia is even heavier and easier to use than the heavy laminating paper I was using. The Wine Appeal brand is thin and takes lots of work and many times no success. I would highly recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a great story, but...","review":"The story is pretty good, but paying 4 dollars for an ebook that is filled with the same errors and lack of pagination as the free Project Gutenberg version is ridiculous.

Especially good for people interested/curious about Aviation / Air Traffic Control."},{"rating":"1","title":"losing interest quickly","review":"the first part of the movie was interesting but waiting for it to get to \\"uproariously contest of wit\\" as described on the DVD box quickly became tiresome. The plot was weak, the acting rather wooden. Even Jolie (fatuously) could not spark this one into a great movie. I wanted a pin to deflate those blubberly lips of hers. And the scene in the pilot's cabin? How ridiculous and fairy tale fantasy. I guess you have to love all the players in order to truly enjoy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a comedy?","review":"I own this movie because it came as part of a box set. I'd never heard of it before and didn't know anything about it, but eventually decided to watch it. I've tried to sit through it twice now, but can't seem to make it. It's supposed to be a comedy, but it's just not funny. I don't think I more than cracked a smile through the first 45 minutes. I kinda skimmed the rest of it, but I just didn't get it. The only things funny about this movie are that someone thought it was a good idea, and that idiots like me actually own it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRASH AND BURN!","review":"If your a pilot like me and enjoy a good plane flick, this is not the movie for you.

Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushing Tin DVD","review":"I was very disappointed when I popped this DVD into my player. It was permanently set at a very wide-screen version, so I had huge black bars on the top and bottom of the screen - if you put the two black bars together, they would equal a bigger area than that of which the movie was playing in. I felt like I was watching a big rectangle with moving parts and voices instead of a movie. I went into the menu and tried all three settings, and the viewing area stayed the same. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting drivel. No intelligent person should endure this.","review":"This film is set in a bizarre fantasy world which vaguely resembles Earth. Supposedly mature adults with extremely important job responsibilities behave like emotional retards and/or felons. The characters are, barely, two-dimensional. The ending sequence, where Cusack's character blackmails a pilot into summoning a passenger to the cockpit of a commercial jetliner, is perhaps the stupidest scene I have ever witnessed in a major motion picture. God-awful stuff. Avoid, avoid, avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushing Trash","review":"This was clearly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I could not conceive of who would have read the script and agreed to take part in this debacle. A serious waste of celluloid.

A better night would be spent listening to traffic reports--it would be as funny and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushing Tin is NOT a comedy","review":"Pushing Tin is most definitely NOT a comedy despite the studio's wish to put it in that category. But then what are they going to say: \\"This is a moderately depressing drama about the morbid competition between two air traffic controllers that nearly destroys both of them and their families\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but too long and not the \\"comedy\\" that's expected","review":"John Cusack, Billy Bob Thorton, and Angelina Jolie star in this dramedy about two traffic controllers who are having rivarly over who's better at traffic controlling, sex, etc. Starts of kind of slow, but onces Thorton enters the picture it starts to get interesting. Then somewhere in the middle it gets lost again and doesn't pull itself up till the end. It's an up and down movie which is why it only gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of a good premise.","review":"What might have been an interesting and quirky exploration of the hidden subculture of air traffic controllers instead turns into a meandering, lost story that never decides what it wants to be. John Cusack is pretty much his reliable self in a nice-guy role that has become a cliche for him. Only Billy Bob Thornton's memorable performance redeems the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought this would be a good flying movie for aviation fans - bad choice.","review":"While there is some relevance to aviation, and some humor sprinkled throughout, the overriding theme was more about people having affairs with co-worker's spouses. We turned it off about half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"Not an Oscar picture, but worth a watch. Great cast. Cusack and Thornton play great rivals, and it depicts air traffic controllers fairly well (albeit a bit exaggerated). I know a few, and they are a unique, diverse group of people. Blanchett and Jolie do an excellent job in supporting roles, too. The actual air traffic control sequences are also exaggerated, but that's not really the point of the movie.Mostly funny, sometimes suspenseful. Worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Montana ceded to Europe?","review":"I received my ordered movie in a timely manor. The problem was it had a European region code and was not comparable with my Blu-Ray in the U.S. A quick call to the capital in Helena confirmed the state had not in fact ceded to Europe which I took as a bonus. :) I received credit for the movie minus shipping. Not thrilled with partial credit but given my many purchases through Amazon this last purchase was an exception and not a rule. I will continue an already long relationship with Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"One of the worst movies, relative to its production values, ever made. It manages to turn an inherently interesting profession, air traffic control, into meaningless slapstick. Filled with overacting and painfully puerile writing.It was sad to see A-list actors wasted on this dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I rented the movie due to it's great cast, and the promising premise. However, it was very disappointing, the movie left me saying \\"so what?\\". The acting was excellent, and there were some great scenes, but it was incredibly boring and silly. This movie is only worth watching if you have some time to kill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining glimpse into lives of Air Traffic Controllers!","review":"This was a well made movie about co-worker rivalry, spousal infidelity, and the high energy stress and pace of Air Traffic Controllers all wrapped into one. The all star cast consists of John Cusack, Cate Blanchett, Billy Bob Thornton, and Angelina Jolie, and they all shine! Dialogue is often fast and direct, which reflects the attributes of an Air Traffic Controller's life, and helps to keep the movie moving along at an interesting pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOFT PUSH","review":"John Cusack. Angelina Jolie. Billy Bob Thornton. Cate Blanchett. Jake Weber. How did such good actors get in such a lifeless, pointless movie? Basically nothing more than a testosterone competition between Thornton and Cusack, the movie isn't funny and its dramatic attempts fail because the characters are so shallow and unlikeable. Director Mike Newell blew this one, folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of a great cast","review":"John Cusack is the best air traffic controller at one of the world's busiest airports, but when small town sensation Billy Bob Thornton shows up and turns out to be an even greater virtuoso of the radar screen, Cusack tries to compete with him (not only at work, but for Thornton's wife) and ultimately has a breakdown.None of this is particularly funny, or dramatic, or interesting. The two leads are fine, considering the material, but Angelina Jolie is wasted, as are several other supporting cast members of note. The end product is uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER","review":"Pushing Tin starts out great. It captures the very true-to-life quirkiness of air traffic controllers. John Cusack is totally believable in this role. And Cate Blanchett is amazing as his wife. However after Billy Bob Thornton appears on the scene as a rival air traffic controller with his voluptuous alcoholic wife (played by his now real life wife Angelina Jolie) things take a turn for the worse. The competition between Cusack and Thornton's characters gets to the point of being ridiculous and dangerous. Their infidelities and personal problems are just too out there. This film missed the mark but had really stellar beginnings. It could have been so much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst films I have ever seen","review":"This is one of the worst films ever made. I kept waiting for the film to end. The first 20 minutes are interesting-you see how traffic controllers work in their high stress enviornment. Aside from that, the film was badly cast. Other than air traffic controllers, I cant imagine anyone liking this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Sure, Pushing Tin has a great cast, but the script they're working with is flat at best. I kept waiting for the film to generate some energy or some thrills or some laughs, but it never happens. The sappy Hollywood loves-story \\"lets make up\\" ending is a real eye-roller. The DVD picture quality is first rate but apparently the studio didn't think the film was worthy of adding any extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pushing Tin","review":"Having seen this film in a theater, I bought it for a friend who is an airline executive.

(And I most certainly hope that the previous reviewer was kidding when he said the portrayal of the TRACON environment was realistic.)The whole plot drags on and on, without much in the way of twists or diversions. The characters are flat, despite the best efforts of the actors, and the script is bland in addition to being fairly unbelieveable.I gave this one two stars only because I was able to stomach watching it all the way through, although I can't say I enjoyed it. I can't even recommend a rental here.If you're a Cusack fan, you'd be better off buying \\"One Crazy Summer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great car","review":"I got this as a replica of my actual car and it is very close.

I was enjoying the book up until about the last two chapters. The story switched paces far too abruptly for my taste. It didn't develop the relationships between Lucy and her two 'beaus' well enough. Suddenly she realized that she actually didn't like her boyfriend when in fact one chapter ago she was perturbed that he would be looking at another girl. Then in the last chapter she just goes off with the actual guy she likes. It never concludes anything, I have a pit in my stomach from reading this book. I feel like it is not complete and there should be some finality to the story, the author gave the impression of a conclusion, but nothing concrete. Overall I found this book entirely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"thanks for perpetuating a stereotype","review":"Wow. thanks for perpetuating the stereotype of the wicked stepmother, right off the bat from your title to your storyline. hopefully the author never marries a man who has children...or maybe she should, so she can be labeled with a stereotype whether it applies to her or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and Light","review":"This book was cute. I enjoyed it. It was light and entertaining reading. The one comment I have that made it a 4 Star instead of a 5, is that I didn't find it believable that Lucy went from practically being ostracized to hanging out with the most popular girls and having the attention of the hottest guy. It happened too quickly. I'm not even sure how it happen. The transition was a bit abrupt for me.

Especially attractive are the standout female vocalists, Paterson seems to be a musical genius.

Sigh. Wish more people could get things this right. The world might be a better place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"This is a far cry from the Orb that originally defined what has become dreamy, mellow trance. Whereas other artists have expanded and improved upon their genre, it seems on this disc that Orb is intent on ignoring the foundation they helped built to try out an amalgamation of new sounds. Within the first 10 seconds of listening to this CD I had a bad feeling about it, as I have in each subsequent attempt to listen to the album. If you thought Orblivion was their best, you'll probably get a lot of enjoyment out like this album more. But if you're like me and pine for a return to the rhythm and composition present on UFOrb and Ultraworld, this album is a real letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please remember that this record was \\"NEW\\" in 1999.","review":"I'm so happy to see so many people who didn't get exactly what they expected.

Alex Patterson keeps us guessing again. I didn't like much on the first listen, but it is ORB, no doubt. OH WAIT! The Orb did do something new...they used LIVE VOCALISTS. They used real singers, not just DJ-geeks with microphones and vocoders.

I couldn't wait for today's \\"new release Tuesday.\\" Finally, a new Orb release. What a disappointment. This is completely unimaginative - not a single unique beat or sound. This release has a background similar to Pomme Fritz, but with sporadic, banal vocals (The Orb with melodic lyrics is just plain wrong). There is absolutely no reason to purchase this (except to round out your otherwise spectacular Orb collection). I give it two stars, because it has glimmers of hope on perhaps one or two of the thirteen tracks. You will find this soon in your local cut-out or used bin. I want my money back, and am very sad.

With a sultry blues score by Ry Cooder and a terrific cast headed by Mickey Rourke in the title role along with Morgan Freeman as the greek chorus, Elisabeth McGovern (the love interest), Forrest Whittaker as a kindly surgeon, Ellen Barkin as a fatal femme fatale and Lance Henrickson as her partner in crime, \\"Johnny Handsome\\" never lets up in the action and tension that ensues when a career criminal (Rourke) tries out a life changing operation. There's a slam bang robbery heist that goes south plus a dynamic conclusion to this under-rated film noir that will leave you breathless, thanks to Hill's direction.

When you're done with it you want it to keep going and never ending. When I was done, I wished so much that there was such a place as Frell. I've read this book so many times. But watch out, once you start you won't be able to put it down!~"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great! : )","review":"Ella Enchanted is a book about a girl who has a horrible curse put on her when she was born by her careless fairy-godmother. Ella must do any command given to her!! If someones tells her to put a coat on, she must, but not if they say they would like her to put one on. The story is filled with magical creatures, a handsome prince, and Ella's quest to break her fairy-godmothers curse!!! You'll have to read the book to see how it ends, but I will tell you that it is great!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"romance/medievalgurl","review":"This was the ultimately BEST book I have EVER read. (And I read tons!) I absolutely recommend this book to anyone who loves romance and medieval books. Believe me. I've read it about 25 times and I still don't get tired of it. This is not one that will sit on you're bookshelf and gather dust! I also recommend Tamora Pierce's Immortal Series, Alice Borchardt's Silver Wolf (for older readers because of explicit material), and the American Dreams series which is spread out among different authors like Jean Ferris (Song of the Sea, Weather the Storm, Into the Rain), and other books which authors have escaped me."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS SHOULD AT LEAST GET A ZILLION STARS!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT! Gail Carson Levine is a great author. She writes funny and sad books. If you enjoy this book, you will also like Dave At Night, The Wish, and The Princess Tales. She is one of my favorite authors. Her books are detailed and exciting. This book was the first book by Gail Carson Levine I ever read and it was also the best of the books that she wrote. Read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. The only reason I only gave it a 4 star was because of the end. The end is very interesting but I was kind of disappointed with the way the author wrote it. Despite that I still love the book. I would check it out from the library before I read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite the typical Cinderella","review":"Ella Enchanted is a great book that every girl should read. It is a wonderful refreshing twist on the Cinderella Story. Sure Ella had a curse put on her at birth, she has a fairy godmother, an evil step mother and sisters, and she falls in love with a prince, but she can think and take care of herself. The book follows Ella on her journey to find Lucinda, the fairy who cursed, or blessed in her opinion, Ella with obedience. She runs into ogres, gnomes, and even giants along the way, but her determination keeps her going. If you read it once you will read it again, it's that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella shes cool","review":"Ella's been cursed ever since she were born, when she is sixteen,her life start to change. Prince Char had fall in love with her ever since they met in her mothers fineral.

Enjoyed all the modern medieval-modern inclusions... the wooden bicycle, the wooden escalators at the shopping mall. Loved Eric Idle's narrator rhymes. The screenwriters took a great idea from a dull book and made it fabulous -- The performing elves, the Ogre of leisure forced to poach for humans in the woods and Anne belting out Queens \\"Somebody to Love\\" (It'll give you goose bumps!!), just to name a few jewels in the movie. So after loving the movie, we sought out the book at the library. YAWN!!!! SNORE!!! Do yourself a favor and skip the book and rent the movie instead!! You'll enjoy every minute of it. And I must mention the wicked stepmother, Joanna Lumley, from Absolutely Fabulous, or Ab Fab to fans of the British TV show, is stylishly wicked. Love the \\"bat ox\\" scene with Eric Idle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Load of Crap","review":"I read this book. And when I finished this book I couldn't wait to get it back to the library. It was that bad! I think the author gave it the title Ella Enchanted to give it some kind of fantasy feel to it. You just had to sit back and say \\"That's a complete load of crap\\". It was not worth reading again! I was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ella Enchanted(I never actually read the whole book)","review":"I never actually read this whole book but from what I did read I didn't like it.

NEVER READ THIS. it is a descrase to human nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid book","review":"Honestly, this is the dumbest book I've ever read. That's why it appeals to girls, duh. It's about some girl grafted after Cinderella who does everything she's told. Now WHY, WHY, is she so stupid to listen to everyone ?! Girl, just go over to the person who's asking you, and freaking scream in her face with hot smelly breath and flecks of spit flying from your mouth, \\"NO! I WILL NOT LISTEN !\\" Jeez, this is such a lame book. No realistic storyline, a fairy tale ending, and a stupid girl who can't freaking SAY NO contributed into making this book such an idiotic teacup of a story. Levine ? Go fly a kite. You are a terrible, intensely hurrendous author. AUTHOR?! Jeez. A mouse writes better then you. No, an elephant. A rat. ANYONE ! You write about a stupid girl who listens to everything she's told because of a spell. Oooh, that sounds REALLY intriguing ! Censored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"\\"Ella Enchanted,\\" is an interesting tale of a girl named Ella. Ella of Frell was cursed with the gift of obedience at her birth. She is complied to obey all given order's to her without having any ability to deny theses demands. Ella embarks on a quest to attempt to break this curse put upon her and live happily ever after. The tale gives our audience a sense of courage and determination. The story being based off of Cinderella, makes for an interesting twist to this story. If you love fairy tale plot lines, I would highly recommend this book for you. For me, it brought back all the wonderful memories I've had reading fairy tale books as a child. The author does a fantastic job in making the reader feel as if they are apart of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Great Book!","review":"To anyone out there reading this review, I just want you to know I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Since I am 16 years old, some might say that I am to old to be reading this book, and its meant only for children. I, however, disagree. Ella Enchanted is a wonderful, delightful book that should be enjoyed not just by children and young adults, but by people of all ages. Although I find most Newbery award winning books boring, this was not the case with this book. Ella, the main character, is a Cinderella for the 90's. She is a unique character, and a role model for all girls. This book is better than any CLASSIC I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted- the best book I've read in a year!","review":"Ella, a girl about 12 or 13, gets stuck with a blessing that turns out more like a curse! She has to obey anything anyone says. For instance if someone said \\" Ella, give me your whole wardrobe for free\\" she would have no choice but to, because her curse makes her. In this rich story, Ella has to deal with cruel people who make her give up things she loves, do bad things, even one who told her to kill someone! This book is so much better than the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We thought this was the best fairy tale ever written.","review":"We all loved this book. Ella Enchanted, despite her curse of obedience, is brave, generous, independent and funny. We loved it when Ella gave Hattie the flowers to smell, making her tell the truth, and we were touched when Ella found out who her fairy godmother was. We cried when Ella and Prince Char were dancing and he whispered a poem in her ear. Ella showed her cunning when she tricked the ogres and got Prince Char's men to tie them up. Ella has to make some tough decisions. Read this book - laugh and cry - and find out how Ella breaks the curse. You will read it under the covers with a flashlight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted, ME!","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Though I will admit it was a little slow starting out. Let me give you some backround. When Ella was born a spell was put on her, a spell that commanded her to do whatever she was told. After her mother dies Ella is determined to find the witch who casted the spell and ask her to put away the spell. will Ella even find the witch? Thar is for me to know and you to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted Movie","review":"well i have not read the book but i have watched the movie. i am very picky about movies but this one exedid my expectations. i have 8 words for you, GET THE MOV IE OR THE BOOK NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is SO GREAT! I love reading, and I've read lots of books, but this is one of my favorites. It's like a classic fairy tale, a twist on Cinderella. But this is better in some ways, she doesn't just meet the Prince at a ball and then live happily forever. She has to go on a quest, and her curse of obediance makes it really interesting. It was so life-like when her step-sisters were treating her mean I was actually mad! I recomend it to any girl who's too old for Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, but still likes the magic in fairy tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Ella","review":"I loved this book! I've read, and re-read it at least 5 times. Personally, I think every girl can relate to Ella a little bit. She's brave, & outgoing & intelligent, but can be shy, nervous, like all of us!Gail Carson is one of my favorite authors. She's up there with Tamora Pierce and J.R.R. Tolkein. Ella Enchanted is a version of the classic fairytale Cinderella. Complete with a prince, a mean step-mother, and 2 step sisters. One who's mean, and one who's just plain stupid.Watch Ella battle trolls, save a gnome, and witness her ever-lasting fight against the curse that keeps her a prisoner in her own body.I wont give anything away, but I think you'll like the ending. Char is sooooooooooooooo cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ella Enchanted\\" Enchants!","review":"The book Ella Enchanted is a wonderful fantasy story that will delight readers of all ages. Although you may think it is just another variation on the story of Cinderella, you are wrong! The story is kind of like the classic fairy tale, but with a wonderful plot woven through that will keep you reading till the very end. The book begins by introducing a girl named Eleanor, and the curse that was bestowed upon her as a child: obedience. It may not sound like a bad thing, but when you have to obey everything everyone says, imagine the sort of danger you can get in! The reader will follow Ella as she meets a charming prince, Char, goes to finishing school, and almost gets eaten by ogres. By the end of the book you will feel as if you personally know Ella, and I'm sure every girl will wish they could have her determined nature, good sense of humor, and her prince! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked Cinderella, you'll love this!","review":"Ella Enchanted is pretty much a Cinderella story except you learn more about \\"Prince Charming\\", and it has imaginary countries instead of the ones we have. It also has Elves, Ogres, Centaurs and a whole lot more. This book is exciting, funny, and downright one of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my very favorite books-- I could not put it down!","review":"Ella Enchanted is sooooooooooo good! You must, must read it. It draws you into the story so much. You live the story with her! I don't know if anyone else has experienced this but its one of those books where when you have to stop reading it , and your eyes lift from the pages-- it feels like you woke up. The book was written so well, It would affect my moods throughout the day. You have to read it ! It's brilliant! Absolutely genius! READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS NOW!!","review":"Wonderful twist on a classic fairytale. Ella touches people of all ages and there is a lot that we can learn from her. Great for dreamers of all ages!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Are you ready for a adventurous, romance, and exciting book?","review":"Ella Enchanted is a wonderful book. It's about a girl named Ella. She has a curse on her, the curse of obiedence. A fairy named Lucinda laid it upon her as a gift. Ella's mother dies and Ella is heart broken. She goes on a quest to find Lucinda and have her take the curse off of her. On her way she encounters with elves, gnomes, orgers, and romance with a prince. This book will leave you wondering and you never want to put the book down. Have a great time reading Ella Enchanted, because I absolutly love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book!!!","review":"This book is really exceptional. I loved it, am still in love with it, and will probably love it forever. I read it in around 6th grade, and loved it from the first page to the last one. I am now in 9th grade, and it is still my all-time favorite book. I highly suggest this book for any reader who likes fantasy, romance, adventure, comedy, and action. It is about a unique girl, Ella, who must go through many difficult times. She has a horrible curse put on her when she was born by a fairy, and must always obey a command given to her. If someone said to her, \\"Jump off a cliff.\\" she must go and jump off a cliff. It is a Cinderella story, with lots of twists and turns along the way. There are evil step-sisters who figure out Ella's curse, and order her to do- and NOT do- lots of horrible things. She also befriends a handsome prince along the way. If you ever read a book in your life, then definitely read Ella Enchanted and you'll love it too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent! Well written! A Winner!.....need I say more?!","review":"It was sooo good! I loved how she twisted a trite, traditional Cinderella story into something far more enjoyable! I loved how she played with names!

It was perfectly well written and showed how well thought out the plot was..but not predictable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Read The Book!!!!!!!","review":"I didn't know if I was going to like this book. For a class course I had to read 30 books in a semester. Well, to my surprise when I picked this book up, ( Ella Enchanted ) I had a hard time putting it down. I'm reading it for the second time now. I see more this time than I did the first. I like the fairy tale it holds within it. Ella sure has her hands full through out the book........I hope that everyone that opens the pages of Ella Enchanted gets the feeling of being there with Ella and/or within her shoes. I enjoyed this book very much!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best!","review":"I'm in 4th gr. and this is a really good bookEven my mom likes it. Lucinda isn't so bad she didn't know what she was doing Hattie makes me sick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for Grandma to enjoy as well as grand daughter.","review":"I like to read the books I buy for my grandkids. I really enjoyed Ella Enchanted very much and felt it was a good choice as a birthday gift. The book was for my 4th grade grand daughter who is an avid reader. Her mother told me that when she was done she closed the book with a satisfied smile and said \\"They got married!\\". I'd not realized it had been made into a movie. Having seen the movie didn't change my grand daughter's enjoyment in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Personal Favorite","review":"This book has been one of my favorites ever since my teacher lent it to me in the 6th grade. Ella's integrity and intelligence really shines against the dumbness that is her step-sisters. She takes on her problems without waiting for the prince to rescue her. Gail Carson Levine creates a concrete reason for \\"cinderella\\" to have become a slave for her step-family. Its just an amazing story overall, and don't judge it by the movie, they changed everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Movie","review":"Up until recently, I had only seen the movie staring Anne Hathaway. I was pleasantly surprised to read a story that was so far from the movie. I am a fan of J. R. R. Tolkien and enjoyed the fact that Gail Carson Levine created her own language for her characters in this novel. I also enjoyed all of the extras that came in the book. Most helpful was the dictionaries of Abdegi, Gnomic, Ogrese, Elfian, and Ayorthaian.I never get tired of hearing old fairy tales brought to life in new ways with clever retellings. This is a new and exciting way to read the story of Cinderella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I bought this because my students were reading the book. They usually like to read it themselves, but we only had one week to read it. They absolutely loved listening to the cds. The reader did a fantastic job of distinguishing the voices. The only disappointment my students had was that she was not Ella in the movie. They also hated the movie because the reader made the story so real to them, they actually asked me to turn off the movie because it ruined their memories! My highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchants Audiences of all Ages","review":"Unicorns, princes, ogres, oh my! These are just some of the surprises one will encounter while reading Ella Enchanted by Gail Carson Levine. It is the tale of a young girl named Ella who is under the spell of obedience and must obey every order given to her. As you read, you will follow her adventures through the forest of the ogres and the land of the giants. Ella Enchanted is just as exciting as it is well written. Levine does a great job capturing the imagination of audiences of every age. Though it is grouped as young adult literature, it never fails to strike the awe in the older audiences as well. This is a book that will make you look forward to every page and make you never want to put it down. With every chapter comes new adventures of Ella and her wonderful unicorn, apple. This book is a must read for people of all ages and definitely deserves 5 out of 5 stars for creativity and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young adult's version of Cinderella","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It was as if I was living the story myself. That's how wonderfully amazing the words got to me. If you think that this is another lame version of Cinderella, think again! This story is filled with more adventure, more romance and much, much more passion."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"This is a great twist on Cinderella, and is, in my eyes, better than the original. If you are my age (13) or at least 9 and you like to read, this is one book that I would highly recommend. It's a book that you would want to reread. It is about a 15 year old girl named Ella who was given the \\"gift\\" of obedience when she was born. To break it, she has to find the fairy Lucinda, who cast the spell on her. You will enjoy the characters, such as Prince Char, and the elves, gnomes, giants, and fairies, but others you might not like, like Hattie or the ogres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"This book is about a girl who was given the \\"gift\\" of obedience when she was young. She is determined to break it. Can she do it? My favorite character in this book was Ella because no matter how hard it was to do stuff, she never gave up. She had to fight ogars, be a housemaid to her step- mother, an dgiven all of her money to a girl named Olive. Over all I would give this book the best rating of any of the books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Ella","review":"It all starts with a gift. Most people like gifts... but then again, most gifts are likeable. Ella is given the gift of obedience. She must obey everything she is told. As she struggles to break the curse, avoid tragedy, and make the prince laugh, the reader will become completely enchanted by Ella. This book combines wit, love, and a little bit of magic to produce an absolute page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing book!!","review":"Gail Carson Levine is a fantastic writer. Ella Enachanted is now my favorite book out of my book collection at home. This book has romance, comedy, and the everyday worries of a teen all rolled into one interesting book. This book was impossible for me to put down, so i read it until midnight! I really suggest you read this book (probably not for boys!) because i enjoyed it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"YAY! Finally!","review":"Wow!... I am a big reader, and I have read this book about 30times! I'm not kidding! It's a great book. The only thing is, itcould be written better. I mean, it's a great, wonderful absolutely fantastically imaginative book with a great plot and all that, but it could be kinda, oh, phrased better. If you want like better written books, go read something like Harry Potter (by the way those are good too). Other than that, I thought it was the best book of the... millenium! END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predicatble","review":"I did not like Gail Carson's Ella Enchanted. I thought that Gail Carson focused too much on the beginning, and then rushed the end. It was way too predictable and the plot was kind of shallow. Ella made a big deal in the beginning about not going to finishing school, and she's only at finishing school for a couple of chapters. It seems that all the characters exaggerated and make a big deal out of something, and in the rest of the book, the problem just seems to go away. Some of this story, like with the prince, was too coincidental that it was unbelievable. Its fun to get lost in spells and a mystic land, but the magic parts of the story was not the part of the book that was out of this world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifuly written romance/action/drama/comedy/...","review":"Any sane human will not be able to help falling in love with this charming, excellently crafted novel. Like a fairy tale for older children and a read aloud book for the younger, Ella Enchanted is pefect for ages 2-112."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT MAKES YOU FEEL AS YOU ARE IN THE BOOK!","review":"I am not finish with the book, but it is the coolest! I found it in my school's libary! She must do as every one says to! tHIS BOOK IS THE BEST With Orges chacing them, elves and a housekeeper or a cook who is really a fairy godmother!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Story","review":"Ella Enchanted is a thrilling adventure full of action and sometimes a hint of comedy. I like how the author put in little things that you have to remember in the next book in her series, Fairest. The only thing I did not like about this book is that it has a very abrupt ending. I would have liked to know more about what happens after her journey. Overall, I liked the story and I would definitely recommend this book to any fairy-tale lover wanting action. I give this book four and a half stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fairytale","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It is a classic fairytale very similar to Cinderella but with a more mature theme and morals to the story. Ella is a fifteen year old girl with a rare gift for obedience. The story covers her life as she struggles to be obedient to those around her and true to herself. This story has many mystical creatures as well as a magical love story. I would recommend it to anyone who loves fairytales, no matter the age. I am 20 years old and would read it again. The book is far better than the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella with a twist","review":"What girl doesn't love a fairytale? This tale of Ella's journey to break her curse of obedience which was given to her as a \`gift' from Lucinda, a fairy, at birth will have everyone who picks up this book absorbed in its tale of love, ogres, evil step sisters, forbidden friendship, and of course a prince. I love how the author has taken the classic fairytale story of Cinderella with all the elements from the story including a fairy godmother and glass slipper, but has put a more realistic spin on it. For example all fairies have to follow certain rules or there will be severe consequences. Ella Enchanted will keep you on the edge of your seat, and as the story unfolds it will show you that ultimately you are the only one who can determine your destiny."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"This is one of the best fairy tale retellings I've come across. It's intelligent, witty, and fun, but it has enough depth not to be forgotten. I think Ella herself is possibly the best part of this book. She has such a strong personality and voice, and her sense of humor makes her especially likeable from the very beginning, as though she has a perpetual smile quivering on her lips and an eyebrow always good-naturedly raised at the fantastical world around her. She also has the ability to feel deep emotions like love, in which she can be self-sacrificing but always remains human (with a bit of a feisty edge).The only part I thought could be a little longer, or a little more fleshed out, was the ending. A few things after the ball happened a bit too fast for my taste. I considered giving the book only four stars because of this, but I reconsidered. Ella Enchanted is wonderfully enjoyable, and such an overall good book doesn't deserve to lose any stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Creative Twist of a Beloved Fairy Tale!","review":"I enjoyed this book for several reasons. One was the creative use of Cinderella as the base. However, the author changed the plot and characters enough that it was exciting. The challenges that Ella face can easily be related to by readers. It is one of my personal favorites. Don't be mislead by the appearance of a mushy or boring fairy tale. Iits pages contain adventure, suspense, trickery, magic, and inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Are you interested in magic? Do you believe in magic? If you do, read Ella Enchanted. It is filled with magic. Giants, fairies, and orgs. The best fairytale you'll ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"Have you ever wanted to read a book about a girl that had to do whatever someone told her because she was put under a spell. Then you should read Ella Enchanted. I think you will really like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading & Writing Festival","review":"Ella Enchanted was one of the books chosen by our local Reading & Writing Festival for students to read, evaluate, discuss, and enjoy! At first, I personally was frustrated with the pace of this story; however, the strength of Ella's character was awe-inspiring! I hope the students value the message this Cinderalla story imparts to our young audience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book!","review":"Ella Enchanted is my absolute favorite book. I read some parts of it over and over every night. Even though it is a little young for my age, Gail Carson Levine captures Ella's personality so that I feel as if I am on her adventure with her. I also like how Gail Carson Levine makes Ella her own heroine, not like all the other Cinderella stories where she must wait for a \\"handsome young prince to sweep her off her feet and come to her rescue.\\" Ella takes matters into her own hands, and with this we go through a fun, adventurous and humorous tale of a girl struggling to do away with a curse that a fairy put on her when she was born."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I found Ella Enchanted to be a wonderful children's novel. It is a fairytale about a girl, Ella who from birth is given the curse of obedience to every command. This novel takes the reader through her adventures of trying to break this awful curse of obedience that a fairy cast upon her. This novel is a great spin off the famous fairytale, Cinderella. All throughout the book it gives little hints about how Ella and Cinderella are similar.This novel is well written and can be enjoyed by all ages. The author paints a great picture for the reader causing a great suspension of disbelief. I think that there is a great plot and the storytelling is appropriate. I feel that these are just a few of the many good examples of why this is a great work of childrens literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Twist on Cinderella","review":"Ella is indeed enchanted. She has been \\"blessed\\" by a fairy's gift. She is unable to disobey, even against her best interest or heart's desires. Gail Carson Levine uses a variety of sentence length and is told in first person view of Ella. Her use of imagery allows the reader to travel into a land of fantasy, ogres, giants, and spells. Connections are easy to make to some blended families. [...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical!","review":"This book was beautifully written and completely magical! I am a teacher and am recommending this book to all of my students because it was such a wonderful story. I think Ella would serve as a great role model for many of my students.

I can't say enough great things about this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella enchanted","review":"This book was good and I could definitely make connections to Cinderella.

There have been TONS of retellings of fairy tales in recent years, so this story definitely felt less fresh for me than it probably would have when it first came out in 1997. Nonetheless, it was funny at times, and Ella is a realistically rebellious teenage girl. I would definitely recommend this book to girls who enjoy tales of princesses and fairy tales, especially those who are just transitioning into longer chapter books from beginning readers or Magic Treehouse type books. If they like this, I would be sure to check out Princess Academy by Shannon Hale for a similar princess story with an equally spunky heroine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for 8 year old","review":"My 8 year old granddaughter was very happy to receive this book on her birthday. It was recommended to me by her mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay book","review":"I thought Ella Enchanted was an okay book. I reminded me of Cinderella. This book is mainly about a girl who can't brake a curse her fairy put on her. I don't recommend this book to people who want an origanal story, and not a remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enchantingly Boring","review":"I really did not enjoy the book Ella Enchanted. It was about a girl, Ella, growing up in a magical world filled with fairies and ogres and elves. It seemed a bit too feathery, if you ask me. There was way too much romance for this to actually be a good book. Read it if you want to, but I would only give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was \\"OK\\"","review":"I have to say that this book wasn't that good. I struggled to get through it. It just wasn't interesting. It gave you details of things that didn't matter. The only good part in the book was when you are about 3/4 of the way finished with it. I think that is too long of a wait for a book to get good. If you are looking for a book that will hold your attention as you read, you probably don't want to read Ella Enchanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"From good to bad","review":"This book started out excellent: It was the author's own idea; a good one at that. I was very interested in it. However, near the end of the book, it started to sound exactly like Cinderella. And I mean 'exactly'. It got boring. This is a good book for young readers, like, I'd say 8 and under."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninventive and for-girls-only","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book, which has somehow achieved successful status with readers and booksellers alike. Not only is it both a precious and boring retelling of a story already told clearly and simply, it is an unfulfilled promise of an adventure story for much of the first half of the book, and an insipid, somewhat chauvinistic romance for much of the second. After two children turned their noses up at it saying that it was \\"boring and stupid\\", I thought that surely they must be wrong. After a quick read (more time than it deserved), I fully agree. A two-fisted \\"thumbs down\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disenchanted with Ella","review":"Ella Enchanted, by Gail Carson Levine, is a novel based on the Cinderella story, that depicts the life of a young girl, Ella. When Ella was born, she was placed under the spell of obedience, by a fairy, Lucinda. Ella soon falls in love with a charming prince and has to break the spell to save their love. Will Ella be able to break the spell, or will she have to leave her true love? I gave this book one star. Although it started off very strong it lost its power very quickly. Bouncing back and forth between proper english and hip phrases did not have a magical effect on this reviewer. I began to wish for my own fairy to save me from the tedious task of finishing this disjointed book. I didn't think that this book was a refreshing new twist on Cinderella, but rather, it made me long for the pages of Charles Perrault. I would not recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imagination problems?","review":"I think that this book was terribly unoriginal. It started out ok with Ella being forced to obey everyone but got lame with the stupid pumpkin carriage and so forth. It's ok for little second graders who like fairy tales like cinderella and other little kids, but not for anyone who knows how to appreciate REAL fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT GO IN THERE","review":"This Book was asighned to me for a book report. As soon as I got past 5 chapters I knew that this is a girls book. I had a hole month to read it but I barely finished it. I dont recomend this book for boys. My partners in this book report were two girls, they loved it. So boys take my advise Dont waist your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOO BORING","review":"Ella Enchanted was one of the worst books ever!I an 10 and have read too many books to count. This book had a weak plot and I could randomly guess what would happen next. If you want a thriller, dont get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story!","review":"This was a fantastic book! It was so different than the tipical ''cinderella'' story.

Pepole of all ages love this story ,my mother ,my sister,the ones I babysit are all intrigued by the funny, romantic twist in her story .Ella is a real girl with a real heart and soul .

If you are reading this and happen to be a parent, this book is perfect for boys, who want to dream of castles and man-eating ogres, or girls who want to find true love, or just want to explore the world! There are many twists, and some exciting chapters you never have thought would be so thrilling and captivating!Note: This book is almost totally different from the movie, so if you want to read the ORIGANAL version read this, if you want to read something just like the movie, i bet you can find a movie copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted is the perfect book!","review":"I love this book because of the magic and romance, but most of all for the corageous, smart, not-so-perfect heroine. This is a modern/old timey book that combines the characteristics of modern people (you won't find any thous or thys in this book) with fairy tales from the past. Ella is a cinderella of her time, but she isn't one to sit around and wait for her fairy godmother to solve all of her problems for her, she takes care of things herself. If you like adventure, suspense, or just like a good book, you will love this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"Ok, let me just say WOW! this was an amazing, gripping book. At first i only read it because i heard about the movie and one of my friends had read it. But then i gave it a try and may i say it was the sweetest book i ever read.

Lucinda thought it was a gift, but it wasn't at all. It was horrid. The curse was odediance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A woderful book","review":"I thought Ella enchanted was a wonderful book not only romantic but funny and every thing else a novel should be. It paints a background for the old cinderella story. For example: where did she live? what was it called? how did her mother die? ect. I loved it and got it on tape. I listened to it over and over and i am still listening to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why Cinderella was such a WIMP","review":"My 10-year-old son brought this book home from the school library, and we enjoyed reading it together (so it's not just for girls). I thought it was a great retelling of Cinderella and included the one thing no other storyteller has covered: \\"Why was Cinderella such a WIMP?\\" Levine's possible explanation (a fairy's \\"gift\\" of obedience) is imaginative and well thought out. She also surrounded her characters with a wonderful world to inhabit. Although it was definitely written for younger readers, I enjoyed it, too. This is a book that needs to be in every fairy-tale-loving little girl's library. It's a wonderful counterpoint to wimpy \\"someday my prince will come\\" fare. Ella is a strong female character. I wish there were more of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A spectacular retelling of Cinderella","review":"Harry Potter turned me on to the world of young adult fiction and the more I read, the more I find that the best writers out there aren't writing for adults, they're writing for young people. This book has the excellent characterization typical of such high quality youth novels. The underlying themes about friendship, loyalty, and self sacrifice are lovely.As the mother of a young daughter, it thrills me to find a book with such a clear depiction of a young woman believing in herself and using her brain to get her ahead. I've loved this book for years before I even had a daughter and it makes me very happy to know that it is one I will be able to gladly share with her. Truly a wonderful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantasy Full of Enchantment","review":"Ella Enchanted is a remarkable book in which a brave young girl is tormented by a spell cast on her, binding her to obediance. It grows unbearable as when she grows older she can not risk falling in love with the prince she meets for she may bring him to his death through the dreadful curse. The only way to save him would break her heart and she is caught in a decision that she doesn't know how to bear....And at any time creatures from ogres to evil stepsisters can command her death... and she will be forced to obey.This book is so amazing and as you place yourself in the mind of Ella you are able to gasp, groan, cry and laugh with her. This book will leave you feeling so wonderful. It's an unexplainable experience...one that you will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Book","review":"This was the first book I bought by Gail Carson Levine. I had no idea how good it would be. It is based on a familar fairy tale(I won't spoil the plot), but it is cleverly hidden until the last third or fourth of the book. She has also changed the fairy tale so it is a lot more interesting than the original. It is a story about a young girl who was cursed by a fairy on her naming day. The fairy always gives gifts that are disgused as blessings, but are really curses. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes fantasy with a twist of reality . I would even recommend this book to adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a story of a girl who was \\"blessed\\" by birth.","review":"This story, I believe, is one of the greatest children's stories ever written. It is the kind of book that makes you devastated when it is finished. It is a touching romance, a delightful take off a fairy tale, the story of hardship, friendship and love, and all in all a glorious novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"!~~whoa!!","review":"Oh My Goddess!!!Once I read the first sentence of the book, I couldn't pause for a moment to stop reading it.I'm totaly in for this book. It's a retold story of Cinderella which Ella of Frell(the main character) has a gift of obedience which a foolish Fairy gave to her that turns out to be a curse for if anyone orders her to hop on one foot for a day and a half, or chopping off her hown head she would surely follow and do it. Now, she struggles on a quest with princes, ogres, giants, wicked stepsisters, and fairy grandmothers to break her curse and live a life free. I recommend this book to everyone. Even adults would surely enjoy reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fairy Tale for ALL ages. Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful","review":"Ella Enchanted is a wonderful book. If you are a parent, and are thinking of buying this for your kids, read it for yourself as well, you won't be dissapointed. It follows a long tradition of classic children's literature that can be read by all ages, including works by Lloyd Alexander and Patricia C. Wrede. This had to be one of the best reworkings of Cinderella that I had ever read. I didn't even recongize it until nearly the end. But it gives you a good reason for everything, why Ella is a servant, ect. ect. it even tells you why her feet were so small in the first place! So Please buy this gem of a book. I promise you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Girl's Dream","review":"this is your classic cinderella story but with a twist.this girl got it tuff! she never sees her father, mother dies, and then she is ristrained from being with the one she loves. yet, every young one has fantasies/dreams that her prince charming would sweep her off her feet just as charming did in the story. no bad influinses could ever be tought in this book except to follow your dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Levine Masterpiece!","review":"THis is a book retelling of Cinderella with a few twists and turns here and there.

That carries me away with the romance, adventures, and the passion. This book is wonderful. It makes me cry sometimes. It's about a girl name Ella which has a gift of obedience. I love the it when she spend her times with the prince, Prince Char. I really didn't like the way her stepmother treated her nor Hattie or Olive. She had to obey every single demand. Till she found Lucinda, the fairy that gave her the gift. And Lucinda remove the gift from her. At the end she marries the prince, and wished not be called princess. And Mandy is her children's fairy godmother. It's a wonderful book. I want to read it again and again. But I can't I don't have the book. And I wish that I had it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!!!","review":"I thought Ella Enchanted was great. I stayed up until 11:00 on Friday night just to read the ending.

When Ella was 13 her mother died and her father married a woman named Dame Olga who has two girls that adore Ella. Soon before her father's wedding Ella met Prince Charmont. Ella Enchanted is a great fantasy with a touch of romance. Ella Enchanted never left me bored. It is full of enchantments. I have always loved the classic Cinderella and Ella Enchanted is a great new version. All of the things that Ella goes through really make this book exiting and surprising. I could hardly put the book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING! GREAT!","review":"This was one of the greatest books I've ever read!

I reccomend this book for anyone who likes \\"fairy tales with a twist\\".

There are subtle connections to the familiar fairy tale that I find ingenious.Ella is not Harry. I confess that I am one of the many adults who love Harry Potter. However, for parents who are bothered by the some of the darker sides of Harry Potter, especially where their younger children are concerned, Ella Enchanted is much gentler. It is an excellent example of pure, enjoyable fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one great book!","review":"I found \\"Ella Enchanted\\" during a book fair at my elementary school during seventh grade. I am now a sophomore in high school and I still love this humorus tale.When i began to read this richly woven novel, I expected something much different. I figured that it would be a simple story with a typical fairy-tale plot (You know. The princess meets the prince, gets married, and lives happily ever after.). Instead I found a story with a wonderful plot filled with humor, friendship and love. I believe that any person who is in love with reading would enjoy this book (heck! My mom even loves this book!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bending over backwards","review":"Ella is truly like the Cinderella in all most every Cinderella fantasy novel she meets prince Charming and falls deeply in love except there is a catch that will make it hard for the two to live hapilly ever after.

The movie is nothing like this book, and thats a good thing. The book is special all on its own. Personally, I love this story over the story of Cinderella.

Always. If she were told to cut her head off with an axe she would have to obey. Though very much based on Cinderella (hint: Wicked Stepmother and Stepsisters, Prince Char, Kinda like Charming, and obviosly Ella, though her name is Eleanor)This book is hilarious and sometimes suspensful. It is very much beyond me why Out Of The Dust beat this for the Newbery. :~("},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my favorite book and the best book ever written!","review":"This is a version of Cinderella that is so much more wonderful. I grew up on those wonderful stories of love that continues happily ever after. This story is so touching to me. It has the classic story book features- triumph over evil, villans, friends, and love happily ever after. But, it has a much more realistic touch. This happiness was not handed to Ella, she earned it. This book describes her inner most feelings and makes you express yours. I cried when I read this book, because I felt for poor Ella at times when her step-family was so wicked. And I do not cry much! This book is so delightful that even a four year old would find it enchanting. And as you well know, small children are not held to things that have no pictures. This book is wonderful. It really makes me wish I had someone to love like Char."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally amazing","review":"An enchanting story of spells, faries, giants, a handsom prince, and much more!

Most of us read it to our children. The plot was very good the second half of the book, but the first half was slow, with lots of difficult vocabulary and the story got confusing at points. So in the end I thought the book was okay but was really geared toward 11 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really didn't like this book","review":"I read this book when I was in elementary school, before the movie came out. I really, really didn't like it. It was confusing and the plot just wasn't that interesting. I think the movie might have clarified the book a bit for some readers.

For a modern fairytale, the girl getting the prince is a tad bit boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting Book","review":"This is a wonderful book! I loved it!

In the old version, Cinderalla was described as a passive and (too) good person who does not know how to stand up to the bad persons around her such as the step mother and her 2 wicked daughters directly but endure all the unfair treatment she had to take. In this book, Ella enchanted, the heroien is described as a strong and persistent person who knows exactly how to cope with things around her.

She only has her godmother, Mandy, to care for her in that household, though there is also another person whom she writes to quite often. Can you guess who it is? Yes, it's the prince!I really enjoyed this book because of all the fantasy. There are orges, elves, faeries, centuars, giants, and a lot more of those creatures. How Ella frees herself from the curse is very exciting, like the rest of the book. This book was very well-written; I rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Twist On a Classic Story","review":"I honestly couldn't put this book down.

First of all the setting, I instantly connected with it, just the thought of there really being such a place filled with princes, ogres, elves, dwarves, fairies, I love it all. Now, coming from a child of the KoRn, those are pretty strong words. Gail Carson Levine has a devine way of conveying the emotions of her characters. I pride myself in my emotional strength and, well, coldness, but I felt every moment of happiness, every tear, every hint of pleasure or nervousness. If you are alive, read this book. P.S. I read Ella Enchanted three times in four days in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"An original,imaginative, and funny retelling of the Cinderella story. Ella is a young girl who has been given the dubious gift of obediance by a flighty and sappy fairy. She has to obey, no matter what is asked of her. I found this to be a very profound book, interesting for adults as well as children. Ella's problem kind of reminded me of what people who suffer from compulsive obsessive disorder go through. The scene where she breaks the curse is deeply moving, I kept thinking about it all day, its probably one of the best scenes I've ever read in a book. I recommend this book to adults as well as children, it will be sure to enchant."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you break a spell that controls you?","review":"Ella enchanted is a grabbing book.

The cover is falling off I have read it so much. This book is about a maiden named Ella, who is cursed with the \\"gift\\" of obidence from a fairy. Of course, the fairy thinks she is giving her a gift. If someone said cut off your head she would have to. Basically, Ella runs into Prince Charmont (or Char as he wishes for her to call him) Heir to the throne of Kyrria, she is sent to finishing school, and under the thum of Hattie her soon to be stepsister.This is a wonderful book, a must read for all of the girls in the world. 10-14 would probabally be the recommended age range. This Newberry Honor Book is The Best in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella With a Twist","review":"Gail Carson Levine creatively writes a fantasy story that takes place in the mystical land of Frell. Ella, the main character of the story has been given the \\"gift\\" of obedience by a fairy named Lucinda. The characters and setting in the story are unique in their own right but are not believeable. The characters are not believeable because they are unrealistic life forms such as elves and gnomes. The theme is well developed throughout the story. The theme is a combination of bravery, selflessness, obedience, and perserverance. There is also a suprise observation that pops up in the story. That observation is that Ella gains her obedience back.I really enjoyed this book. Coming from a male's point of view, it was enjoyable for me. It reminded me of the famous fairy tale Cinderella.

Probably the only really interesting part about the book was the curse."},{"rating":"2","title":"gift","review":"{Ella Enchanted} had been recommended by some young ladies in a store.

The first time I read this book, I fell instantly in love with the characters: strong-willed Ella, her fiesty godmother Mandy, the kind and gentle Areida, the noble Prince Char...I could go on and on. The story and the characters are so well developed, that it pulls you in and makes it a difficult book to put down.I would highly recommend this book, especially to middle school aged girls. In my opinion, Ella is am amazing role model. She's brave, smart, best of all, instead of sitting back and waiting for a handsome prince to come and rescue her, Ella takes her fate into her own hands and sets out to rescue herself.That's the kind of story I want my daughters to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ella Enchanted","review":"I am a 6th grader in Maine.

This book starts out with you crying, and ends with you glowing with joy. (And not to mention a whirlwind of emotions between.) I only suggest to start this book in the morning, because you won't want to stop until you finish it. (I started reading it at 11:30PM and ended somewhere around 2:00AM.)

Its good for preteens and teens alike. It is more for girls then boys. I am very picky about the books that I read. I couldn't put the book down. I loved it.It is about a girl named Ella, who is cursed by a foolish fairy spell. The spell is that she obedient and has to follow every command, if she doesn't follow she will start to cramp and choke and suffer the consequences. It is a twisted tale of Cinderella that all will enjoy. You'll see what I mean at the end. At first I didn't like the movie Cinderella, but this book gake it a whole new meaning. By the end you'll wish you were Ella."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchantment Review","review":"I thought the book would be about a girl,Ella, that was cursed by a fairy. After reading the story I thought it was really good and romantic and I loved it. It was what i expected but it was a lot like Cinderella but it was still a lot different from it. I still feel the same about the bookand nothing has changed.A girl called Ella was cursed and her life was mostly miserable.Her mother die and her father married a bad woman who had two daughters.They would always tell her what to do and they made her a servant. But she was best friends with the prince, Char. The book is a historical fiction and the author is Gail Carson Levine.I love this book because its sad but romantic and just a fun book to read. Its sad because Ella's mom dies but its romantic because romantic because she lives happily ever after at the end.My rating for this book ,from 1-5,would be 5 because Ithink its a great book.Its a great and fun book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We Were Enchanted","review":"This book takes place in an enchanted world with ogres, fairies, and elves in a place called Ferrell.

Along the way, she has some incredible adventures that include staying in an elf's cottage and being captured by ogres. This book is an exciting page-turner.

It was thoroughly researched, because as anyone who has read the book would know, it doesn't take place nowadays. In a far away fairy-tale world, Ella was born. At birth, a fairy who meant well put a curse on her. The \\"blessing\\" from Lucinda the Fairy was obidience. What ever someone tells Ella to do, she must do; hence in danger at every moment. If you like fairy-tales, or mythical, magical, any type of stories in that genre, you will absolutely love this. It is, again, well researched, with a spin and an unpredictable plot. I think it is a must-read. Get it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Wonderful!","review":"For fairytale lovers, this is a must read! Basically it is a variation of Cinderella, but with so many unexpected twists and turns you don't recognize it without thinking about it.Gail Carson Levine does an exsquisite job of heaping all kinds of emotion into this book. You can't help but laugh at the jokes and cry during the goodbyes. There's the villains you love to hate and even suspense in some parts. The descriptions make you feel like you're really there - Ms. Levine describes the scenes with just the right amount of detail so you know exactly what is happenning but there's still room for you to use your imagination.If you want to read something totally different than anything you've ever tried before, read this book. It's a quick read - once you start it, you won't be able to put the book down. I'd reccomend it to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A cinderella story ...but even better!!!!","review":"This book was the best cinderella story i ever read!

Some actors said in front of the camera they did it because they loved it. Like a well-known actress who quit it in 2000 only to came back to this career in 2006 because she found out it really showed who she was.One of the interesting scene showed 2 vibrators created by an engineer from Taiwan. The first one's top part can vibrate at different frequency than its bottom part. The second one looks like the jaws of a crocodile. He said it stimulated both the G-spot and the clitoris at the same time. Consequently, it can bring on orgasm in 5 minutes.Overall it satisfied my curiosity and provided me with 90 minutes of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Baked Pie","review":"First the disclaimer, perhaps being English so no high school or prom night and being the wrong side of 30 I missed the point but a lot of this I had already seen in the 80's in Porky's and Lemon Popsicle etc. The story is simple. 4 guys agree to lose their virginity by prom night. Hence lots of trying too hard and lots of failure. The funny parts were laugh out loud funny admittedly. The father explaining the art of masturbation to his horrified son and the guy referring to a sex bible whist the girl is unaware were extremely clever. I am not sure that the supposed tender scenes and realisation that sex is well just sex really worked in a teenage movie. But judging from the reviews and sales I am in a minority but there were just too many unfunny moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny movie you can watch over and over...","review":"This movie was surprisingly good. It was, for the most part, funny when it tried to be, although many of the jokes were old and oft-used. The acting was pretty good, the actors looked good, and the movie just wasn't boring.

I suppose it appeals to an age bracket oh, roughly 14 years and 1 day old to 14 years and three days old. They'd find it a riot. If you're over 14 and still find it funny, get help imediately since you must suffer from retarded development. Y'know if George Washington had realized that his fledging state would get as desperate as this he'd have packed his bags and emigrated to Canada right then and let the British rule America.

The worst film of the millenium!","review":"I did not know one could write, produce and especially direct a film like this one. The accumulation of unbearable (I hope this film does not reflect the average American suburban precollege teen) nonsense is hardly imaginable. I am really sorry about those people who liked this film and especially two things: a. the dichotomy between explicit verbal sex and the absolute absence of any realistic love scene (I would be very astonished if every single American teen is negotiating his First Time like this). b. the stereotypical image of the east-European girl. Although Nadia was really amazing (but a bit too solarium burnt and silicon breasted for being a Check or Slovakian girl (note for the scriptwriter: there is no Checkoslovakia any more), I wonder why she was the only one who had to get naked (and no American girl or guy)!

Haven't we been down this road way too many times before? Enough times to know the outcome before the opening credits even finish. Now that we know the plot, let's talk performances. This movie signaled the official typecasting of Jason Biggs as a loser who can't buy a date who ends up a winner in the end(His next movies, Boys and Girls and Loser are basically American Pie ripoffs with less sex with pastry). Mena Suvari, however, was able to put her average performance behind her after her brilliant acting in American Beauty.

Even though the jokes were funny, after a while they just kept coming in no order at all. After about 40 minutes, it seemed like the movie was trying NOT to entertain, but test the audience, and see how much raunchyness they can take. Although most of the movie was jokes, and not events or plot, the ending and actual events that weren't one big joke, were very entaining, and never dull. I recommend this movie to people who like raunchy jokes, and don't need a plot throughout the movie. In that way, it's sorta similar to Scary Movie, which is MUCH funnier."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of (if not the) the funniest movies of the decade","review":"Hilarious, better than all other teen comedies or slashers or whatever released recently.

I came out disappointed and puzzled that so many people (other college students included) thought this was a great piece.The \\"I have to lose my virginity\\" line is taken to absurd levels that even made a liberal person such as myself shake her head in disgust.Not even the inclusion of Alyson Hannigan (BTVS) could have convinced me this movie was as good as everybody said it was.I really think the script writters and the directors could have and should have done better.

The story is about a bunch of teenagers wanting to get laid, and their embarrasing experiences. The movie is very vulgar and relies completely on vulgar humor to get by. The movie DOES have a point but it is sadly lost among the gimmicks and jokes. The movie is highly overrated, I think. I will say only giggling teenagers can find this funny(or people with an incredible juvenile sense of humor).

Thepremise is about as fresh as the idea of an escaped mental patientkilling sexually promiscuous teens. It's about a group of friends that vow to lose their virginity before prom night. Along the way, they get involved in some pretty outrageous situations. I know. It sounds like I've just described every teenage comedy from the last 40 years.But, I must say that the characters are very real and the performances by the young cast are good, as well. But the film has as many mis-fires as it does hits in the gag department. Plus, as a whole, it just doesn't hold up.

With witty writing, superb acting (from Eugene Levy, of all people), perfect comedic timing, and enough realism to hit home, American Pie is a must for any collection.

The plot revolves around four guys trying to lose their viginity before the prom and the various ways they go about it.Some of the scenes are perverted, but isn't almost every movie about teenagers? The best story line was the one where the star jock joins the chorus to impress a girl and ends up delivering the moral lesson of the movie- sex is not as important as most teenagers would like to think.The actors did a great job and this movie never gets boring or slows down- a good, funny movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pie; like home made","review":"I bought the movie before I'd seen it.

All of this has been done before. (ie Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, etc) I was actually rather bored by this film...I'm sorry...I guess pastry and internet sex shows don't do much for me. I wish someone would realise that people between the ages of of 13-20 (well, some of us, anyway) aren't really that amused by bodily fluids and flatulence. The performances were very good, very believable, with the exception of Shannon Elizabeth, but I seriously doubt that she was cast for her acting ability.

Chris joins the choir and finds a date in a choir girl named Heather. Finch doesn't have a date to the prom due to a suprise bathroom incident.In the end Jim scores with Michelle, Kevin convinces Victoria to score with him, Chris scores with Heather, and Finch does Charlie Stiffler's mother on a pool table.This hilarious tail of high school life is not for the faint hearted.

It's been a while, but I seem to recall that John Landis, even at that early stage of his development, managed to balance a desire to challenge the sensibilities of those days without sinking to the obvious or cheap without some offsetting subtle gags. No such luck here. It's play for the \\"quick and dirty\\" laugh all the way.My fifteen year old asked me if he could see this picture and I replied in the negative. I wish I could say it was because the content and sophistication were beyond him.

If I wanted to see people have sex, I'd watch a damn porno. The movie isn't that funny. There's some funny parts, but the movie's still retarded. I hope there's an American Pie movie where Jason Bigg's character gets in a divorce and committs suicide, while his wife becomes a crack whore. That'll show people how much life really sucks.

I won't say what it is (some of you may already know anyway), but I will say that I was dissapointed in this edition because of it.

This movie is funny. It entertains you. After all that's what a movie is supposed to do right? Entertain not send a message, that's why we have parents.

I was disappointed to miss this in the theater and was really psyched to see in on video. Even the guy at the video store gave me a five-minute diatribe about this being the funniest movie he's ever seen. I get home to watch it, anxiously awaiting these side-splitting moments and... nothing. I waited the entire movie and got nothing. The jokes were delivered with all the subtlety of a baseball bat to the head, and it seems the producers were banking on the Internet scene to drive their movie. They were obviously right, judging from the number of glowing comments here. Besides that, I already knew most of the big jokes from the previews, and the movie offered little elaboration on the ideas.

I had been told that it was really great and funny. I do admit that there were a few scenes that were very funny that I got a kick out of, but the film still wasn't that good. I wouldn't mind watching some of the scenes again, but most of the movie was forgettable and not that original. American Pie wasn't poor, but it wasn't that good either and seems very overrated.

Amazing--it's been years since Hollywood portrayed teenage life in this manner. Anyway, \\"American Pie\\" is a raunchy teen flick happily devoid of the aesthetic ugliness that characterized John Hughes films (what happened to John Hughes?). It's actually a pretty funny film, even in its nastier moments (the, uh, hyper-expedited digestion scene with Finch is completely contrived and unnecessary). One question--why would Jim get jiggy with the pie in the kitchen, with the blinds open where anyone can see or walk in? He couldn't wait to get the luscious pie into his bedroom, where he could spend some private time with it? That one stretches the limits of plausibility. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd hate to see the rated version","review":"The movie was mildly amusing, but if are expecting to see more skin in the unrated version, don't bother.

The whole thing is about sex, but at the same time, it's marketed to teen viewers. The movie is sending a wrong message. \\"If you're a virgin, that's bad.\\" Well, I kind of take that back, because I'm a girl. Guys are the ones who are usually eager to lose their virginity, whereas girls are encouraged to keep their chastity. No problem in that. The movie makes sex seem fun and as Jessica (Natasha Lyonne) said, \\"It's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.\\" They don't show the reality of sex; STDs, pregnancy, other scares. Teens are beyond impressionable. They see this and feel that they need to do the things these 20-something actors playing high school students do. \\"Kids\\" is a better teen-sex movie. It's a blunt, shocking and real look at what may happen when you let your hormones get out of control."},{"rating":"1","title":"What do you expect?","review":"Okay, I watched this film and honestly, I tried to keep an open mind. I wanted to see for myself if the movie was really as bad as I'd expected. Well it was worse. This movie is offensive to the very same crowd that it targets. I mean come on what do you expect from a movie whose whole plot is centered around a scene where an adolescent jerks off in a pie? They could have spared us a lot of agony by just having people pay to come and see that scene and then leave, because the plot line was remanufactured, overused and only funny if you are one of those people who believes that Elvis is still alive. The difference between Porkys and this movie is that Porkys WAS original and WAS funny. This is just another 90's flick whose plot was cut and pasted from many previously successful films and then promoted as being unique and made \\"original\\" by pushing the envelope of baseness and depravity. Bottom line - really bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"immature antics","review":"For some reason, this movie didn't make me laugh out loud. It didn't even make me crack a smile. What's so funny about seeing a person screw a pie? I didn't understand why every teenager in the entire world calls this \\"one of the best movies ever\\". I personally thought it was non-stop immaturity and gave out bad messages to teens (i.e. sex has no reprocussions). If you're looking to be grossed out by a bunch of raunchy oversexed people, go for it, but if you want to remain mature and take your comedy on a different level, avoid this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed It, Missed Out","review":"To make this short and sweet, one of the best teen movies since the Breakfast Club.

Along the way, one of them enters the school choir, because it is an \\"untapped resource\\", and another pays a girl to talk about the size of his, well, you get the idea. Jim, of course, can't even find a date. His father, I don't the name of the actor but he is great in this, tries to talk to Jim about sex, and even gives him a stack of skin magazines. But the best moment is deals with Jim assaulting an innocent apple pie, while his father walks in the door. The only difference between the unrated and regular versions of the film is a couple of extra hip thrusts during the apple pie scene. Shannon Elizabeth is also in this, and she enjoys herself too, in another funny scene. But at end of this movie, you will find it has heart, too. A great film for anyone guy who has survived highschool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone help me with this noose!","review":"Sweet Beejesuz this is one bad movie.

I'm male myself and like some female reviewers I despise the ida of portraying women solely as sex objects. Y'know if George Washington had realized that his fledging state would get as desperate as this he'd have packed his bags and emigrated to Canada right then and let the British rule America.

Sure, it is all about teen sex, and has plenty of gross-out moments, but throughout the movie, you really care about most of the characters. It reminded a lot of Diner, in that the main characters talk a lot among themselves, and it was fun to listen in on them.For better or worse, this movie took me and most people I knew who saw it back to their teen years and reminded them of themselves and all the types of people they knew.

The film follows the attempts of four friends to lose their virginity by prom night of their senior year in high school. Hardly an original plot, but the actors all give refreshingly honest performances and rise above what could be characatures of teenagers. There are some gross but hilarious scenes including sex with an apple pie, drinking tainted beer and reaction to drinking a laxative. Jason Biggs, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Allyson Hannigan, Sean William Scott and rest of the young actors all give hilarious performances, but it veteran actor and SCTV alum, Eugene Levy who steals every scene he's in as Jim's understanding dad.

Everybody says it influences teen sex and teen drinking, but this movie isnt just about teen sex and teen drinking its about growing up and the stuff teenagers go through. Jim is the dorky guy that tries to hard, Oz is the sensitive jock, Kevin is the guy who wants everthing to be perfect, Finch is the 40 year old living in a 18 year olds body, and Stifler is the wild crazy party guy. This movie also has great acting by, ( Jason Biggs, Chris Clien, Thomas Ian Nichols, Eddie Kaye Thomas, Sean William Scott, Tara Reid, Shannon Elizibeth, and of course Eugene Levy), a good script , and great first time directors.

It was hilarius as the four friends make the pact to get laid by the senior prom. This film showed how rumors could really boost your rep, and how bad it felt when you saw some nerdy dude get a piece before you. Jim is kind of the focus of the friends who will do anything for that first piece, or something that feels like it. Non stop laughter from a cast of unknowns. This is really a hit. Only disappointment was my expectations from buying the unrated version. There is very little difference between the two versions and definitely no reason to tag this movie \\"unrated\\". I think it is just a marketing ploy to sell more movies and I'm sure it has worked, I fell for it.

I was let down as far as extra scenes (no, there's no more Nadia than in the original), there's not much more and I personally don't think they should have cut the extra scenes anyhow.What's great about having this on DVD is that you can just sit down and watch a couple of the best scenes. I mean, this is not a movie that will loose a lot if you don't watch it all the way through. It'll be great for parties and whenever you want to laugh your head off. You need to be a teenager at heart, because the comedy is squarely aimed at the coming of age group, but the beauty of this movie is that people like me that have moved on can still relate.Run out and get this if in your face, juvenile comedy amusues you as much as it does me."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Pie Rules!","review":"I liked this movie, because it depicts the life of real lifeteens in real life situations.

This movie is not about shock and more about wit; Wit that comes with youth. A better comparison could be made with those early John Huges or Cameron Crowe films.

The plot only deals with sex. Good ending though. This film is not for anyone under 16, or over 21. Though it has it's moments, (the laxative scene) a comedy it's not! It is a teeny porn film disguised as a comedy. If I were a 16-21 year old as opposed to a father with impressionable sons, this would be a great film. Although it's not graphic visually, the dialogue is very graphic. It could have been done more tastefully, and the message at the end would have had more effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing Trend","review":"The hollywood trend continues...that is to say the pandering of film to lower the tastes of film going audiences. This masturbatory mis-adventure about guys who continually objectify women seeks to say that a male adolescent's brain is located too far south of his cranium. The disturbing aspect of it all is that the film was so popular among teens that it seems like a whole-sale endorsement for ignorance. Do you get the fact that what we watch determines little by little who we are? As Hollis Little Creek says, \\"Be careful what you advertise on your t-shirts, people might just think that's who you are...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"American Pie- A masterpiece for all teenagers","review":"Let it be said that while it may be hard to make a movie for teenagers, this one hits the ticket. It focuses smartly on sex, drugs, and alchol,some of the things teenagers can be affectred by. If you see only one movie this year, make sure it's American Pie"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's no political correct, but a splendid comedy","review":"I was shure about AP should be one more film from college boys. Definitelly I was wrong. This is a great film, this is the real thing. I'm 37, but I enjoy it as a teeneger. Is the funniest movie from the 90's. I'm not keatting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Flick","review":"This movie was good. I liked it very much. It was about some kids who wanted to, you know, do it, because if you don't do it then you're not cool. There were lots of scenes in it that would be extremely amusing to third graders. That's very funny. A guy tries to do a pie. That's also funny. But this movie is also about wholesome values and the youthful spirit that causes kids to waste their money on pathetic trash made by people who have the same kind of respect for them that a crack pimp feels for a ten dollar ho. That's also very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film is a feeble punch at the dome of comedy.","review":"Im very disappointed to see veteran comic/actor Eugene Levy waste his time in a piece [like] this. Maybe he needed the money?!?!?!? WHo knows!?!?Stupid film... Thumbs down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like warm Apple Pie","review":"I think American Pie is an awesome, funny, entertaining and also partly true movie.It's always fun to watch! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comedy Of 1999","review":"This was one of the best movies of 1999 and certainly the best comdedy. I saw this at the theatre when it first came out and laughed my &^@ off. I just purchased the unrated movie on DVD yesterday and i still laughed my &%$ off. This movie never gets old and would be a great gift for a mature teen. Also i dont really know the difference between the rated and non rated versions if anyone knows please email me at kylemack@worldnet.att.net! GREAT MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"turned off one hour into it","review":"I was advised by a friend who is in my age group (early 30s) that this is one of the funniest movies ever made. It isn't. I gave it as much of a chance that I could, but once it got to the scene where Nadia the exchange student is undressing on the webcam and pleasuring herself on that dude's bed my suspension of disbelief just couldn't hold out any longer and I shut it off.Look, you can have gross-out scenes and sophomoric sight gags in a comedy all you want so long as you balance it with some smarts in the script-writing. Too much barf and not enough bite. Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"ha ha another one","review":"Another one of thoose movies that have the same dumb teen plot.But more graphic it reminds you of cant hardly wait' shes all that' fast times at ridgemont high ' its funny in some parts but at the end you wonder what was the whole point of the movie anyway. if u are in to premarital sex teen drinking and masturbation, you will love this low life film . stupid movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad teenage sex movie","review":"This movie was awlful! Its just a bunch of high school kids trying to get laid.

The movie had lots of hot girls I waited to catch a glimpse of, but that never happened; Just teasers. I suffered through the whole thing and in the end was bummed I bought it. I had heard this was a good movie but it wasn't that funny and didn't show much nudity either. Buy \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" instead. Same idea but much better executed with Phoebe Cates to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I thought that the film displayed what many teenagers go through when dating and experiencing sexual relations for the first time. Extremely funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would you like some pie?","review":"American Pie was not as funny as I thought it would be but overall this film is quite entertaining. Featuring an all-star cast including Jason Biggs, Mena Suvari, Tara Reid, Chris Klein, and Shannon Elizabeth. American Pie is vulgar, frank, and somewhat heartwarming. I have seen all three films and I have to admit the second one is probably the best, but the original is not a total letdown. Defintely one to watch, nothing like homemade apple pie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, seen that...","review":"This flaccid stab at comedy is basically a mish-mash of ideas stolen of other, better works. If it's raunchy fun you want, try \\"Porky's\\" or \\"Animal House.\\" If it's a funny look at teen sex/romance, try \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High.\\" And if you're into disgusting acts with food, for goodness sake, go to the source: Philip Roth's \\"Portnoy's Complaint,\\" published in 1969, kiddies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"American Pie is yet another bad film for teens today who capture all the annoying things. This movie captures all of the annoying people like Jason Biggs who plays the kind of character who got on your nerves in high school. It is some what realistic but not even near I was expecting so much more but got a big boring teen movie once again. Boo! really stinky!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If anything under rated!","review":"Wow! is all you need to say when describing this movie, it is SO FUNNY. Although i think it will only appeal to those of a certain age group (teens, twenties) it is definatley a must see for those. I have seen it loads of times and its just as funny each time. Out of the rated version and this one, the extra bits in this will get you in histerics, you have just got to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNNY, FUNNY, FUNNY! The girls aren't bad either!","review":"This is a movie for just about everyone who remembers their days in high school. There is at least one character in American Pie that we can all relate to, be it the band camp girl, or the choir chick, or the plain old foreign exchange student. This movie is raunchy, but that is what makes this an instant classic. What about those awkward father-son sex talk moments? We have all been there! Still not convinced? American Pie is worth seeing at least once just for the 12 minute scene with Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) as she is caught by Jim (Jason Biggs) ah, let's say, \\"going downstairs.\\" And that is not even the best part of that scene! It get's better with naughty Nadia making Jim nervous, as he sorta \\"blows it\\", so to speak! GET THIS MOVIE JUST TO WATCH SHANNON ELIZABETH! 10 stars if it would let me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"If you liked There's Something About Mary then this is your film! The funniest film I've seen in months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rehash of Porky's","review":"This teen film makes the obligatory reference to Shakespeare--this time to Henry the Fourth, Part One, in a class discussion led by an Asian-American teacher. (Theere's a battle over Shakespeare in Porky's 2. For other references, see Never Been Kissed, Jawbreaker, The Rage: Carrie 2, and 10 things I Hate About You.) Unlike Risky Business, this film does not offer anything by way of an interesting account of boy teen angst over getting laid for the first time. Another overhyped disappointment. If you really want something sexually explicit (this film isn't), go rent a porn."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame and insipid, i'm worried about all these 4 star reviews","review":"This was a truly lame movie. There are no laughs here, becauyse the sophomoric high jinks are so clumsily scripted and unbelievable. To have the character sleep with his friends mom and put \\"Mrs Robinson\\" is not funny, its lame, and it steals from a really great coming of age movie.I'm disappointed to see how many people not only tolerated this film, but embraced it. To say its the POrky's of the 90s is not a compliment as far as I'm concerned..A Christmas Story on the other hand, thas a funny movie. I can not imagine someone buying this film and watching it repeatedly, its just not funny.South Park, Office Space, Being John Malcovich, The Graduate, Airplane, This Is Spianl Tap, these are funny movies, not American Pie--believe me--you can skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a child molester's dream come true","review":"That is all this movie is...a child molester's dream come true. It is a sick way of portraying young girls. This movie is truly degrading to women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this supposed to be There's Something about Mary 2?","review":"This movie had no real point at all. It needs to make up its mind. Is it some sort of film promoting celibacy? Or is it some sort of comedy? Either way, it fails horribly. This movie is not very funny at all, and it tries too hard to be like \\"There's Something about Mary\\", maybe trying to ride that bus all the way to the bank. Do yourself a favor and steer clear of this \\"film.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Funny Teenage Hijinks","review":"I must say that I was very disappointed in the film, \\"American Pie\\". Why? Because we've seen the formula done before and done better than it is here. For example: \\"Fast Time At Ridgemont High\\" and \\"Porky's\\".Don't get me wrong. I don't completely hate the movie. The actors are very good with the material that they are given. Plus, it is well-directed. Also, there are several very funny scenes in this movie, but as a whole the film just desn't work.Eugene Levy steals every scene he is in as the father who tries to deal with his pastry-porking son.The DVD is nicely done. The picture is good, as is the sound. The film is available in an R-Rated and Unrated version. There is little difference between the two. Apart from the pie scene and a few snippets of dialogue, they are the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! That was the funniest movie I've seen in a while","review":"I had no idea that anyone could actually capture what life was like during highschool.

The laughs you will have and the things you will see will leave you in awe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I found this film extremely funny. Not a moment passes without a joke being cracked. Also, not only is it funny but it also teaches valuable relationship lessons this is an absolute MUST-BUY CLASSIC"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Fast Times\\" anyone?","review":"There is something about this movie that immediately reminds me of Fast Times at Ridgemont High(1982, Sean Penn, et. al)...sort of a late 90's, perverted recreation of it. It blends the day-to-day culture and situations of typical American high school students with overwhelming hilarity; at the same time covering subject matter such as \\"commitment,\\" \\"sex,\\" and \\"true love.\\" I have to say that American Pie was just a bit more hilarious than Fast Times at Ridgemont High, while at the same time putting old 80's social issues in the background (i.e. unwanted pregnancies, infidelity) and replacing it with \\"pseudo-serious\\" issues. It is a perfect reflection of direct and to-the-point 90's comedy and far-out fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the funniest movie of the decade!","review":"This has to be the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. It tells you what every teenage boy is thinking about! It is, however, very sexually explicit - so be prepared. I would recommend this film to any adult, though. If there is a mom out there who wants to know what their teenage son is thinking about, this movie explains it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damn Funny!","review":"I've seen this movie at the theatres and thought it was awesome.
