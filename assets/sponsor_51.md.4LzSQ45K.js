What's genuinely depressing is the fact that she actually has a decent voice, and could record some good tracks if her style matured. If I had to guess, I'd say that she's being told what to sing and perform by her managers and record label, and most likely has no control over anything she does. She has to, at least, be a little embarissed, I mean, if I was eighteen and singing this stuff I'd be positively mortified to be seen in public."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST ARTIST OF ALL TIME (or close enough to it)","review":"Nikki Webster is an absolute JOKE of a singer.

She has a song called 'the monkey song.' People like Nikki Webster and her fans make me feel ashamed to be Australian. They deserve to be shot!

Let me tell you, I know that there are a lot of good whistlers out there and Mr Eide should not be referred to nor should he refer to himself as a \\"VIRTUOSO.\\" Blowing air through your lips does not a whistler make. An out of control vibrato makes a whistler unlistenable. He also happens to whistle with an annoying breath included in the whistling instead of a clean whistle sound as I produce.

This book isn't an easy read, but the writing is so lyrical and beautiful you're pulled along almost helplessly ... into a violent, unpredictable world few of us can imagine, traveling the narrator Marianna's difficult journey in her effort to somehow come to grips with her past. The layering of past with present is so skillfully done, the reader experiences memory the way it really happens, the way our lives are made up of layers that communicate with one another all the time.

I have always loved Konami games since way back in the days of the NES and Contra Castlevania & Blades of Steel, & i also love monster movies so i figured that i would give it a shot. The story mode is a lot of fun, its very similar to Gauntlet. You fight through levels with all 4 charactors. You can also switch between them in game. Each has a specific power , fire, Poison, Electricity & Guns. Each player has a normal attack & they also have a special attack and they also have an airal attack. I also like that the bosses are classic movie monsters wolfman, frankenstein, dracula, voodoo queen & the sea creature). The one problem I have with this game is that you cannot play multi player in the story mode. The multiplayer modes are played in a dungeon type area and you can play with or against the other players.

What I really enjoyed about the story was the reality that was presented in the characters that encountered Joshua. I also appreciated greatly the accurate portrayal of the places that were involved in the story, especially the reference to the first place Joshua met offically with his group of followers: \\"Seven Arches Hotel\\". While on tour in Israel, our first hotel was Seven Arches.

If this game wishes to capture WWII combat it needs the barrel rolls and arial stunts, as it is the planes all the planes fly like rockets, not like hawks. Despite this major flaw, I like the target system, and the lanscapes are not bad. However for all around game play SWON should seek some advice from her bueatiful cousin Crimson Skies. Better dogfighting next time, secret weopons of the cold war? I'd love to fly a spyplane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Crimson Skies instead.....","review":"This game does not meet usual Lucasarts standards. This game would have been great about 10 years ago, but with todays technology it is way below standard. You fly these WWII planes, but the planes do not move around, it seems as if the screen is rotating around and the planes are stationary. The graphics are sub-par, and the controls are not that great. If you want a flying game buy Crimson Skies instead. The difference between those two are like night and day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK could have been so much better","review":"Rent this game first before you buy. I purchased and played all the way through and was greatly dissapointed. Nothing like the original Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe not even close. If you play Crimson Skies then try this game you will know that this game is subpar by todays standards. I finished the game and sold as quickly as possible. The reason is i knew after playing this game it has terrible graphics and the missions are rediculously easy. This game price will drop when most find out how bad it really is, just wait and get your copy cheap but do yourself a huge favor and rent it first and only buy if you can get it cheaper than renting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disapionting","review":"I am a huge W.W.2 buff, so I was happy to hear about an arial combat game set in France in the 1940s. The graphics are not what I would expect from Lucus Arts. They can do better, and they have done better. The gameplay is just plain hard. In the German Bomber, as soon as I get close enough to see my target I'm crashing and bruning in the ground. It has realalistic sounds and it incorperates history well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it as good as SWOTL?","review":"I am a little wary that this new game is not up to standard obtained by the old DOS based SWOTL game. After devouring all the information the SWON website had ... I am left wondering if SWON has nearly the depth as SWOTL. Will I get to: Determine what technologies are researched, which engines are built, which air frames are manufactured? If this new game is just about flying and graphics...then we might be better off keeping our 486's alive and grabbing our SWOTL floppy disks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooktacular","review":"This is a cool game. Lately, I've been treading the waters of the survival horror genre and so far, I'm quite impressed. The story sets you up in a lost village in which a great massacre occured. Now the village is haunted to relive that night eternally. All you have to survive is a camera which has an exorcismal effect on ghost which you encounter in various parts of the game. The freaky part about it is that you can't always see the spirits but you can hear them. The vibration on the controller also quickens as you near one. The mixture of the spooky sound effects and atmosphere really make this game an enjoyable experience if you play it at night by yourself. The style is somewhat similar to Silent Hill 2, which is also an excellent survival horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the first","review":"This version is much better than the first one. The environment is much more clear and you can see the character's face better(the first one looked very blurry).The puzzles are a whole lot easier to solve, and you don't get really stuck on them much. I actually about to rated this game 5 star because it's really fun, but I rate it 4 star instead( becuase I'm stuck on the part where there's a ghost blocking the way and when it attack us, we will instantly die, and stone mirrors won't work. The size of the ghost is SOOOO big!!!) try it, it's fun!!! (p.s if you know how to get past the ghost, write me it!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I was excited to see a new survival horror series I could play. And after reading the reviews I had high expectations. I was sadly disappointed.This is the most frustrating game I have ever played. The characters movements are slow, which make its hard to beat the ghosts, and do not even think about 'running' away. It does have stunning graphics and interesting storyline. Unfortunately I stopped playing halfway thru because I just could not stand how slow things were."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Of It's Genre","review":"Fatal Frame 2 is now one of my favorite games of any generation. The scares aren't cheap \\"monster jumps out\\", but well constructed and psychological. You will be scared of turning every corner, opening every door and exploring this village in depth. Thanks in part to the mysterious atmosphere and haunting score. The gameplay is straight forward and easy to pick up and get right in to the action. The only real drawback there might be is that some may find the story too hard to understand at times. It will require some pondering or a second play through to fully grasp every aspect of the plot. That said The Crimson Butterfly is one of the best examples of great Japanese video games and every gamer owes it to themselves to try out Fatal Frame 2 and witness Survival Horror at its finest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Hall & Oates, hate this collection","review":"Now dont get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Hall & Oates, but whoever the sound enginneer was on this album, should be fired.I'm big into sound quality car audio systems and have always enjoyed my hall and oates CD's as listening material. They've always really popped and sounded wonderful.Something about this album though just doesnt sound right. I know some of the songs are not the radio versions, but album versions, which Ive heard before. Most songs on this collection sound either flat with no vibrance, or completely uneven as you listen to the song. It's almost as if complete frequency ranges are missing. This is from listening back to back to the same track from different CDs.I wouldnt recommend this \\"remastered\\" collection to anybody. Buy a couple of the other greatest hits albums that are available for this great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate...well almost","review":"The version of \\"She's Gone\\" is the album version and not the 90 second shorter hit version.

So aside from those two things great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Here...","review":"I actually bought this CD set for one song that is unavailable pretty much any place else...\\"Do What You Want..\\" I was in a San Francisco flophouse with no money and no hope and this song came on the radio and sort of summed it up...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Complete Collection","review":"You know how sometimes a group will release a greatest hits or compilation and there is that one song that you like that's missing? Well that's not the case with \\"Ultimate\\" Hall and Oates, this is the most complete Hall and Oates collection I have ever seen and I couldn't be more pleased. Disc one includes a lot of their early songs like \\"Sarah Smile,\\" \\"She's Gone,\\" and \\"Lost that Loving Feeling.\\" Towards the end of the disc come the early 80's pop tunes, \\"Kiss on my List,\\" and \\"Private Eyes.\\" Disc two is my personal favorit, it rolls hit after hit, \\"Maneater,\\" \\"Method of Modern Love,\\" \\"Out of Touch,\\" and \\"Adult Education,\\" and more hits.

The song \\"I can't go for that...\\" was especially good...and the jam sessions were great. Why not capture some of that kind of stuff on a CD?

She's Gone, Kiss on My List and thought I'd give this a try. What a mistake!! This is awful! If you want real soul listen to Sam Cooke, Otis Redding or Mowtown. If you want Blue Eyed Soul listen to the Righteous Brothers rather than this crap. The remake of You've Lost That Loving Feeling is horrendous just like 99.9% of this trash. Hall and Oates belong at the local Holiday Inn on a Wednesday night amateur hour. Brutal 80s garbage!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only One Song Missing","review":"This is the ultimate Hall & Oates. When paired with their release of the music that influenced them on \\"Our Kind of Soul\\" the collection is almost complete. Everybody has a favourite cut on a favourite album that never made it big or even to the airwaves in some cases. Mine is from the H & O album \\"Along the Red Ledge\\" and the song is \\"Melody for a Memory\\". It is a terrrific song for its vocals, instrumentation and change in tempo throughout its four minutes and fifty seconds of playing time. I would like to see it considered for inclusion on any future rerelease of their material because its my opinion that it pales a lot of their hits by comparison. And that says a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revisionist/biased","review":"This book was a disappointment and is shallow in the way it treats the Church's history.

God bless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Catholic, Nor Historical","review":"From the historical-critical method of presenting the Bible, to the thinly veiled lashing of the Cardinals for following the guidance of the Holy Spirit and not the media, the author has a distinct penchant for recasting the beautiful flow of History according to the dictates of the cold, stagnant modern scientific Worldview.The only reason for purchasing this book wouuld be so that the next person won't be tempted to read this tripe. But then, that would just encourage both the publisher and the author to continue this title, and kill even more trees - and souls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author never heard of a liberal idea he didn't like","review":"This is a review of the new third edition, Jan 2004. From looking at reviews of the older edition, the author has kept his liberal viewpoint in the new sections. All liberal issues are good - all traditionalist views are no longer appropriate. He has added material up to 2003 including the sex scandals. Unfortunately for him as a liberal, he quotes from Archbishop Weakland who now has been discredited. He does have a good defense of Pius XII for his handling the Nazis and Jews. I didn't mind the first half of the book, in fact I enjoyed it. But I really got tired of the liberal voice always having the last say. Being a modernist, there are no absolutes, no dogmas, all is subject to change and change is good. Since the author is an elderly Pastor at a Cincinnati church, he has fallen into the Pastoral approach error that justifies all as long as it is done in a spirit of love and conscience. I can not recommend this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed to the Max","review":"I ordered this book and was excited to begin reading it. Never again will I buy a book without first reading the comments. Most reviews were on the money. This book is entirely fiction, with a few historical facts sandwiched in between. I began reading it and by page 28 the red flags were brightly waving, but maybe I was ignorant of Catholic Tradition. So I had the pastor of my church read it. He believes the author shows great ignorance of Greek as well as the Aramaic languages as some of the definitions were erroneous. If there is anyonelooking for the truths of the Catholic Church stay clear of this book. The only reason I gave this one star was the review would not go through without a rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I should have read the reviews before reading.

Crocker III's \\"Triumph.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"How not to write a history book.","review":"Throughout the book the author attempts to force his personal opinion onto the reader. The means applied are elegant but for the experienced quite transparent. First level documents are rarely cited, a deficiency that makes the recommended list of titles for further reading useless. Relying on secondary and higher order sources alone is unacceptable for composing a history book. - There are several thousand volumes in my personal library. Bokenkotter's history was one of the few books I filed in the waste basket after having read it ones. The author may want to consult, e.g., Aland's \\"A History of Christianity\\" (translated by J. L. Schaaf) as an example of an objectively presented history of a religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time or $$$","review":"I opened the book recently since I received it by mistake.

The last half of the book is more a political and social agenda than a history. Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"An open, non-defensive account","review":"Bokenkotter reviews the issues and decisions of Catholic church history in a fair, non-defensive way. He gives balanced time to the losers in contests over orthodoxy, and doesn't assume the temporary victors are always right. In explaining the choice to ban families for priests in 1074, he honestly shows the arguments in play. The difficulties of controlling priest's wives showed no sign of going away, and the hierarchy's patience ran out. The great Gregorian reform for priestly chastity gathered force because the mainly monastic higher leadership realized how greatly marriage assimilated its clerics to Western women's values. (p. 141) The other defining moments in church history, from the codifying of orthodoxy under Constantine, the turn to holy war and persecution against infidels, the great \\"counter-reformation\\" revival of service vocations, or the conflicts over modernity, all receive an honest, open treatment.-author of Correcting Jesus"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Introduction","review":"I found this book to be a concise outline of the major events and influences of Catholicism.

Bokenkotter colorfully portrays the triumphs, tragedies and personalities that have guided the Church over the past two millinia in a brief, easy to read format. This book will not make anyone an expert on Catholic Church history, nor is it designed to do so. It will enhance anyone's knowledge of the most significant developments in history.Who first wrote the Bible? What made Gregory so great? What is a \\"Renaissance Pope?\\" Did Martin Luther really nail his thesis to the door of the Cathedral? How did Catholicism spread through America? What prompted the Vatican II reform movement?This book provides the basics, and it provides them clearly and cogently. To write a concise history about the Catholic Church is no small task.

Also, I have recently had a stem cell transplant and chemo, I'm now looking for alternative therapies to keep a relapse from happening and was very curious to see how Michael's experience was. I was disappointed in this book.I didn't really like his style of written, to me it seemed choppy as he was jumping from one part of his life to another.

I mix my own cereal, and add lots of nuts and seeds. So it is a lot heavier than the fruit loops that are always shown in the pictures. The way that the holder fits into the base is not at all secure, and when full of heavy cereal, disaster is assured. Also, neither the top or the bottom cover is a really secure seal, so tipping the holder caused the top to fly off for me, and some interesting times for my dogs cleaning up the floor. I had a hard time taking the bottom seal off when my cereal bowl was in position. If you take it off first, then some cereal leaks out, causing the problem I was trying to solve - namely no cereal laying around my counter inviting unwelcome guests.I tried this product for awhile, but threw it in the trash pretty fast.

It's a very clever device for it's intended purpose except it's really messy. We use it for storing Cheerios and Raisin Bran, and I've seen it pinch out a Cheerio that bounces off the bowl bottom and skitters two feet across the counter. The rubber plugs which snap onto the bottom openings to keep food fresh are a pain to replace and often don't get put back on correctly; they eventually fall off. And what's the purpose of the chrome grill underneath which fills with crumbs and is difficult to clean?On the up side, it is kind of cool looking and would remain so if you didn't use it.

I ordered it on a Friday and received it on a Monday, and that's with Super Saver Shipping. That alone was pretty great. The only issue I had is that one of the storage reservoirs came cracked in the front and the back. Not only did that look bad, but it also indicated to me that I might have a flimsy product. Amazon did a good job of replacing it and the new one that arrived came quickly.I like the looks of it and it seems sturdy enough that I would not advise you to spend the extra $30 on the stainless steel version.

According to reviewers, it's great, so I gave it 4 stars (I trust Amazon's customer reviews) but would have given it more had I not been put-off by the size of the thing and the small amount of actual crayon you get for that money. As long as you know that it's very small, and you're ok with that, I say get it.

Since there were a lot of positive reviews about washing off these crayons, I took a chance. Our boys love them and I love that they are all contained. And everything washes off easily with water and a quick wipe with your hand.... all except for purple! I freaked out when I went to wash off the purple... the stain of my sons masterpiece on our white tile.

When we went to clean it up tho, some of the marks we made wouldn't even come up with a scrub brush. The crayons are very waxy, like real crayons. Wax repells water.

Compared to the other option on Amazon, I decided on this one because of the stopper at the opening. It made sense considering that putting a lid on both ends would keep things fresh longer.My only suggestion is that you pull out the container before refilling it and putting the stopper back in to avoid putting too much force on the machine...it's plastic after all.

As another reviewer stated, it does hook you in the beginning, but then continues on with nonsensical poetry and meaningless tales. Once I got to the correspondence between Ash and LaMotte, I didn't know if I could make it through. I finally skipped the whole section, as well as most of Sabine's journal because poking my eyes out seemed like more fun. However, I'd already invested that much time in the book so I had to finish it. Interesting tale. Maybe someday it will follow in the footsteps of The Princess Bride and publish the \\"good parts version.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-crafted and thought-provoking read","review":"Possession is, to use a hackneyed phrase, a tour de force. The novel showcases Byatt's ability to work with countless genres to create a satisfying whole. Ranging from a modern-day mystery novel to an epistolary novel to epic poetry, Possession is a many-layered novel that demands more than one read. I recommend reading it once for the plot (like any mystery, we want to know what happens next), and then again for the textual pleasure derived from Byatt's style. One warning: do not be confused by the title, \\"Possession: A Romance.\\" If you are looking for a love story a la Danielle Steel, you will be disappointed; Byatt is writing a romance in the true sense of the genre. This book is definitely a worthy read, thought-provoking and entertaining. It's truly one of the best novels I have read in quite some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second read - still difficult but really really interesting and fruitful","review":"This book is so hard to read if you try to get into the poetry, the Latin and mythological references. So I suggest if you struggle with it, skim the difficult bits on the first read through. The mystery is really good. Then I recommend you go back and re-read it again, seeking out an understanding of the difficult stuff. Worth the time. The author must have an amazing retentive mind, we're lucky she likes to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possession: A Romance","review":"The book was in great condition, the condition exceeded the sellers description and my expectations.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite reads of all time!","review":"Although at times I questioned whether I was even going to make it through this book, it became one of the most rewarding experiences of my reading life. Byatt weaves a classic love story that becomes a complex tapestry of utter delight. One of the most rewarding chapters in the novel was one that I approached with much trepidation--the multiple-page chapter of the correspondence between the 2 19th century lovers. I was plowing through it, when suddently I became utterly absorbed and amazed at what Byatt was doing--going from cold respectability to intense and troubled passion is simply astounding. A. S. Byatt is truly in total charge of her medium in this wondrous novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"It is clear that she put effort into this book and she knows how to string words together.

Do not read this \\"book\\"","review":"This is without doubt, the worst written book ever.EVER. AS Byatt writes with extremely pretentious language. She uses words that only the best dictionaries have. Within the first 160 pages, absolutely nothing happens. The mindboggling slowness of these 160 pages is only exceeded in incompetence in the non-stop interruptions of her story, with bad poems and bad fairy tales.The book is so badly written, with so much unneccessary padding, and so many unneccessary interruptions. ... and while there may be pretentious values of the book like \\"postmodern\\" techniques and all that, it is a very slow, poorly written, difficult book. There is no great meaning or message. A twist, but, who cares? 500+ pages of agony"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly boring","review":"Hmm...how best to describe this book? Dull. Dull. Sleeper. Boring. Dull. Take my advice: don't read it. It hooks you in in the beginning (however slight that hook may be) but then it drags on FOREVER.

I desperately wanted to like this book, and finish it. Although, I found aspects of the book intriguing (the letters) and the writing was very descriptive, the story dragged. I was going to stop around page 75 but forced myself to continue. There are much better books out there like \\"The Sun Also Rises\\"-Hemingway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passionless and tiring central characters and a weak double ending","review":"I stayed with this novel despite the frustration of dealing with the tedious poetry and passionless characters. Deconstructing literary researchers, dull and self-involved. Only briefly interesting beginning about page 250, and towards the very end when the book converted into a conventional, but second-rate Agatha Christie mystery, quickly answered. The novel ended with an unconvincing bedding of the two main characters, followed by an almost as weak second ending. Two weak endings don't provide a strong end. In summary, this was \\"twits and twats, academics all, searching for lives.\\" My rating is actually a 1.5, but I can't in good conscience give it a lenient 2.0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad poetry made it hard to take seriously","review":"I really did not like the poems, and thought it might have been a different better book if this wasn't the case (and I actually like Victorian poetry, as I believe that's what the poems were modeling). It's hard to get involved in a book about a romance between two poets when you can't help thinking, is it me or is that poetry bad? I didn't get past page 69, as skimming through the rest of the book gave me a general idea of what I thought was in store, and I just wasn't interested. I give most books a chance but I thought this one was overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intellectual tour de force","review":"Ms. Byatt most impressively gives birth to two19th century poets within the context of a contemporary plot. Her modern day sleuths, scholars Maude and Roland embark on a long journey of intrigue, scandal, mores, and ethics; delve into the past lives of Byatt's creations; and return to reality, changed from the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would explete if allowed....better left unsaid.","review":"Weak character construction;overwrought prose, Byatt falling victim to the worst symptoms of the romantics without their sometimes redeeming beauty; excesses of self indulgence...enough said? When you find yourself more interested in the possibilities suggested by the academic research than the characters of this work it is a definite sign of worry. It was at this point I gave up on yet another booker winner and satisfied the slight desire Byatt raised by returning to my own dusty student notes on the real romantics and their lifes...even my cribbed notes made for more satisfying reading...how depressing if only I had read Possession ten years ago when I was studying English she might of shown me that there were worse things to read than journal articles. So I refrain from swearing about it but this book is a disappointment that might have been better off not being discovered."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars, if I could","review":"I have found that this book tends to really draw responses at either end of the spectrum. People either hate it or love it. I hated it. Just as several other readers wrote, I could not get into the characters. It was torturous trying to finish this huge book about people I could not connect with. One other reviewer wrote that this book is for literary intellectual types. Not true. I am what most people would call a literary intellectual type, and I though this book was awful. But, I do know several people who loved it, and if you are the type who finds the ivory tower of academia romantic, then this book is for you. If you would rather read a book that deals with real life, your time will be better spent reading any Alice Munro short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emperors New Clothes","review":"I have to agree with \\"Michael\\" from Australia, although I liked it a bit more than he did, he is basically correct. I think Byatt is a talented writer who can evoke places and people well, however, the amount of unnecessary material is \\"the emperors new clothes.\\" It is not only not necessary but it drags on the story to the point of distraction. Almost all of it has so little to do with the story that you have to wonder if it was a way for the author to show off her considerable skills and scholarship. That is not a good enough reason to plow through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book","review":"I really did, and kept reading it even though I found it and the characters lifeless. It won the Booker Prize! Shouldn't it have been a little less predictable? A little less tiresome? But I did read it through to the end and finally found a lovely passage -- the piece about the braided hair. A Booker author should give us that level of beauty for more than just one or two pages . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEE THE FILM TOO","review":"Great book. Did you know that there was a movie made of this book ? It is also called \\"Possession\\". It is available on DVD. It was the only time I have sat in a theater ,totally undone,helplessly crying my eyes out and sobbing. It will MOVE you. The movie was so beautifully done,so incredibly romantic and heartbreakingly, hauntingly beautiful. And if any part of it reminds you,like it did me, of any person or past relationship then you will REALLY need a box of tissue and a good rest afterwards. It's worth it but you will not be the same afterwards. Poetic beyond anything I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Romanticism","review":"I feel that I first have to state that I read this only after watching the movie, and that I enjoyed the movie a little more, but for different reasons. I didn't care for the ending of \\"Possession\\", but I'm not about to tell a brilliant writer like A.S. Byatt how to end a brilliant romantic story. I think what sets this apart from all other romances is the fact that it is about two different romances from two different eras, but both being similar, and linked. The mix of poetry, short stories within the story, dialogue and beautiful settings make this a very unique and compelling read. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves classic romance, poetry, English manners and mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"slowly takes 'posession' of you","review":"I have just started Posession and, I must admit, it took me a while to warm up to Byatt's stilted writing style. Some of the introductory matter was a bit tedious, but necessary. Once the plot got rolling about 50 pages into the book, I started getting more and more involved. Definitely worth the effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For People Who Love Literature","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. It combines poetry, romance, and a detective story--what more could you ask for? While the subject is academic, the prose is lively and engaging and you can't wait to see what will happen next. It's like a literary \\"Da Vinci Code\\" without the continuous cheesy escapes. If you are looking for a \\"romance novel,\\" then this isn't for you. If you seek a thought-provoking work that will move you, then pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"True, it's difficult, but the poetry is worth it","review":"I read this book a long time ago (maybe four years ago), but I still think it's one of the best books I ever read. Admittedly, it's a difficult read. (Warning: do not take this book on a road trip or on the beach wih you!) Byatt has an incredibly poetic writing style (and actually wrote considerable amounts of poetry for this book). I think the language alone is worth the 'work' of reading this book, but she manages to combine her linguistic finesse with a compelling story. I would liken this book to Doctor Zhivago: a great love story crossing historical boundaries, with lots of poetry. I can see how it's not for everyone though. If you don't have patience for long descriptive passages, no matter how beautifully written, then don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too have tried...","review":"After devouring Colleen McCullough's wonderful Masters of Rome series, I was looking for something light, like romance. \\"Possession\\" seemed promising: forbidden love. And winner of Booker Prize.I was wrong. It was pure torture. But unlike one of the reviewers here, I managed to finished it, but not without difficulties.While struggling to read this, Dorothy Parker came to mind. She once said: \\"This is not a novel to be tossed aside lightly. It should be thrown with great force.\\"I have tried to like this book, I really have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I realize this book has garnered a great deal of praise, and was thus disappointed when I finally read it. The writing is turgid and repetitious and swamps the story to the point where the poor little plot struggles and nearly suffocates. The characters are two dimensional and stereotypical, and indeed, save for the squire and his wife, who were delicately and beautifully drawn (and to me a luminous contrast to the rest of the book), seem like people the author thought might have existed, or perhaps had been told about, rather than individuals with a living, breathing presence. I wouldn't have finished it had I not been trapped on an 8 hour flight with nothing else but the flight magazine to read. Byatt gets two stars for the Squire and his wife. I wish the rest of the book had been as well written."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Long Slog","review":"This book was recommended to me by a fellow UC alum. She majored in English Lit. and I was in the Political Science department, which may account for our differing views of the book. I found the book to be heavy in every regard--physically and literarily. And though some of the language was very beautiful, I found most of it to be dense, murky, and arcane. The latter overcame the former, and I found myself simply wanting the book to end. I also found the story too neat and tidy. No loose ends here, no unanswered questions, nothing left to ask or imagine about the characters. Not the return I expected for my time investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overstated","review":"A.S. Byatt is obviously a gifted writer and intellectual. I enjoyed her ability to convincingly write in the \\"voice\\" and varied style of her different authors. My problem is that I could care less about any of her characters and the development was painful and slow. I am sorry to say that this book is clearly for those literary intellectuals. Not for everyone. My blessing to those who love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious, mind-numbing pretentious bore. Highly overated","review":"This must be one of the most over-praised, over-rated pieces of \\"literature\\" I have read in years. Every word, every page practically screams out at you that this is a novel that is meant to be taken seriously. However, it fails to capture the imagination and is a masterpiece only of tedium and pretension."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, the second, third and fourth time around","review":"I read this book years ago when it first came out. It was incredibly well written. Very much a contemporary romance novel (not the 18th century term of the word), but so well written that it defies those trashy paperbacks that line the grocery store checkout aisles. If you are looking for clever writing, intelligent adult dialogue, and a romance that makes you believe such a thing still can exist then read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"I bought this book after listening to a good friend rave about it, and continually hearing Byatt's name pop up in favorable reviews. Unfortunately, I could just never get into the story. While I thought the premise was interesting, the plodding story bored me to the extent that it took me about three months to finally finish the book - I kept putting it down for extended periods of time.Interestingly, the parts I really enjoyed were the poetry and letters by \\"Ash\\" and \\"LaMotte\\". I was very impressed by Byatt's ability to change tone enough to convince me another voice was there. I suppose that on an intellectual level I appreciated the skill, but I just did not enjoy reading the novel. By the end, I didn't care much about what happened to the characters - although the postscript was quite poignant.If you want to Appreciate the Literature, dive in. If you want to enjoy the plot and find out what happens, rent the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow beginning but a fabulous book!","review":"Part mystery, part homage to classic literature, Possession is definitely a modern classic. The novel's plot builds slowly so that the patient reader is rewarded with several interesting twists. The characters are sharply developed and complex while the structure of the novel (in which two separate love stories unfold) adds to the intrigue. Anyone interested in the study of Victorian literature will be pleased with this novel. Furthermore, anyone searching for a romance that does not wallow in trite dialogue and cliches, will enjoy this literary masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing - GREAT BOOK","review":"So romantic, so learned ...and all that. But above all WHAT A PAGETURNER!I so wanted to see what the truth behind the documents was!!I saw a few comments below that suggest it was hard to keep reading, but I did not find that at all. HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better the Second Time Around","review":"Possession is a book worth rediscovering if you have trouble getting through the poetry the first time around. I read it years ago with a reading group, and although I thouroughly enjoyed it, it took a long while to get through it, and the poetry bogged me down. Although I vowed to read the poetry -- didn't! This time around, I am choosing the book as my choice for a new reading group, and am discovering the thrill of it all over again. Mystery, love story, certain to become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read. What a masterpiece. Byatt is just superb in this book. I've read one other book by her and didn't care for it at all. With Possession, she managed to tap into a wealth of talent and imagination. It's about as close to being perfect as a book can get. I was always totally engaged by it, and loved even the poetry she'd written (and I am NOT a poetry fan by any means! .. so this was quite an achievement.) ..Fabulous, beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Novel!","review":"I cannot get over the voices in this book. Four separate voices (two in verse) and one would never know that they were written by the same woman. Academia, love, mystery are all inter-twined in this novel and though it is a dense read, it is engrossing. Recommended wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work, worth reading and re-reading","review":"I liked this book a lot. I like everything I've read by A.S. Byatt, but Possession is the closest to a \\"modern classic\\" that I've read in some time. I like that Byatt is so interested in stories, writing, language, and symbolism, and she crafts her fiction to mix these elements in a natural way. She reminds me of Jane Austin in how she fits a story together and how she treats her characters. She gives dimension to heroes and villains, allowing you to identify with their triumphs and tragedies. Possession is a rich story with several interesting dimensions woven together, examining the idea of different kinds of possession in her characters interconnected stories. It is titled as a romance, but it is also a detective story, and equally uses devices from both genres. The story remains fresh 'till the end with several twists, and doesn't take the cheap way out. All in all, great work. Worth reading and re-reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I have been slogging through this book for weeks now and am only 18% into it (Kindle).

(other virtues please step FORWARD)","review":"This is a terribly slow read because it's extremelty BORING; however, it has an authentic feel to it both in terms of the portrait of scholarly problem-solving (two literary experts--who know all there is to know about One Enlgish Poet each--become detectives) and in its psychological portrayal of the love affairs that are developed simultaneously throughout the novel. The ending will leave you wondering whether you feel happy or sad; but in any case, you'll be glad you have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ WITH UNDERSTANDING AND DRAMA","review":"Virginia Leishman imbues her reading of this Booker Prize-winning novel with understanding and dramatic emphasis as she performs Byatt's fascinating multi level tale of literary scholarship.Two young academicians, Maud Bailey and Roland Mitchell, are engaged in research projects involving a pair of Victorian writers. They study letters, journals, poems, and track the pair's comings and goings. Roland is hopeful that he will perhaps discover clues in the Victorian author's marginal notes.But, it is Maud who brings to light the romance between the late authors, he who was thought to have been contentedly wed, and she who was believed to have been a rather reclusive spinster.As the story of the romance between their research subjects surfaces, Roland and Maud begin to look more deeply within themselves.\\"Possession\\" is an intense study, an intriguing blend of the cerebral and the physical.- Gail Cooke"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and overwritten","review":"i believe the poems were excessive and unsubstantial and the constant interpolations of other texts, diaries, memoirs, etc(one of which exceeded 30 pages, mostly a dull rendition of victorian daily life) were simply technical writing exercises posing as literature. it was a great idea for a story, with a nod to fowles, that was poorly executed. if byatt had spent more time on just simple character development and interior life, plot, etc and less time on extended writing samples for stage scenery, it could have been a great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tripe and Punishment","review":"This is one of the most tedious books I have ever read, from the painstaking reproduction of turgid Victorian poetry to the unbelievably bad and predictable Scooby-Doo ending (A-ha! I knew it was the Professor under the mask all along!) Hundreds of pages of writing, and yet the characters remain caricatures throughout (what do they like? do they have interesting opinions about anything? what do they do when they aren't squabbling with each other?)

It's larger than I expected, and the visor mounting doesn't work well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, but she has a nice voice","review":"I thought the album was boring. I didn't watch Nashville Star but I'm a big country music fan and I like to listen to new artists. I bought the cd and loved the catchy song \\"I Break Things\\". The other songs really didn't grab me, even after several listens. I was disappointed in her cover of \\"I'm Not Lisa\\"- although Erika Jo has a beautiful voice, I found the rendition lacking emotion. She's a good singer but I hope her next album has some better material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This was a great item, great price and came quickly.

She lacks the emotion the songs need. I was so excited to finally see a woman win Nashville Star. After listening to this cd, I believe someone like Tamika Tyler would've been a better pick. I am so diappointed in this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Almost Cruel","review":"But really, its just more sad. Nashville Star is a show where a bunch of label heads, including, Anastacia \\"What-the-he**-were-you-thinking-Tony Brown, pretend they actually have a clue about where country music is going. It should be noted that every Nashville Star winner prior to Erika Jo is without a label.And the latest in their dregs of dreck is Erika Jo. It is almost cruel to send a woman this clueless into a world where the sort of country she makes has already become a passe joke. So much so that Erika Jo come across almost like a Saturday Night Live Parody. From the 80's. Except that neither she nor the label suits that hired her get the punchline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute melodies","review":"I enjoy listening to Erika Jo.

But there are only about two good songs on it. On the CD, there aren't enough fast songs. I think there should be a good mix of fast and slow songs. There's one fast song and ten slow songs. They're ok songs, but it wasn't very enjoyable to listen to. I'm very disappointed because Erika Jo had such a good voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Be Honest, It's A Big Disappointment .","review":"I have listened to the whole Erika Jo album and I was very very disappointed.Erika Jo has a good voice for her age but the song choices are terrible and do not fit her.I think that this album was rushed into and if more time was taken that it would have been more sucessful.This debut album has been a total flop.I don't know if she has a future in music but I do like her and I think with the right songs she could turn out pretty sucessful."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Hug A Porcupine: Dealing With Toxic & Difficult to L","review":"How To Hug a Porcupine should be read by every person who is in or has been in a toxic relationship. I found this book to be one of the most inspiring self-help books I have ever read. I found it difficult to read at times, because I felt I was reliving my past. Dr. Lund starts out with a very detailed Table of Contents, outlining every chapter. There are numberous case studies, I appreciated the fact that they didn't always work out like the textbook said they should. There are quizzes to take. Specific step-by-step directions on how to help you become a more healthy person despite the porcupines in your life. Dr. Lund helps you learn how to use \\"armored gloves and other tools\\" in dealing with any toxic person - young, old, spouse, child. Dr. Lund uses similies/medaphors in describing behaviors.

Its a very easy read on a topic that is so central to Christianity: LOVE. Its so easy to get bogged down by life in the world and to forget that our basic calling is to love, this book reinforces that by describing love in various ways.After a brief introduction, Dr. Cavarnos discusses the following topics: 1) The General Nature of Love, 2) Kinds of Love, 3) Christian Love and Other Virtues, and 4) Faith & Love.There are ample quotes from the Holy Scriptures as well as quotes from the likes of great mystics like St. Symeon the New Theologian.I highly recommend this book. Its so simple and powerful that it is astounding. This book can still be found through many Orthodox booksellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Justice!","review":"I first read about the travesty of justice in Tulia, Texas in columnist Bob Herbert's column in The New York Times that I get online. I immediately felt an outrage at this situation, so I was eager to read this book that details the whole thing. It is a fascinating look at what seemingly passes for justice, but is really a gross racial slam to about 40 people in this small town. I especially liked the last 2/3 of the book when the \\"good guys\\" got their day in court and exposed the only witness to this travesty as a lying, bigoted criminal. It was court room drama at its best. I recommend this book as a great piece of nonfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tulia","review":"I found this to be riviting reading. The writer gives us a glimpse into the lives of many people in Tulia. After reading the book, we feel that we know these people. A good job of covering the whole story.Having lived in Tulia at one time, I could picture the places in my mind. I was horrified that there could be such a miscarriage of justice in a town that I thought was a very fine place. It lets us look at the power of people: those who misuse systems and those who try to make the systems work. Thank goodness for journalists and lawyers who will not sit idly by and let people's lives be unjustly distroyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH BETTER","review":"I have little UNIX or Solaris experience, so for me this book provided a spotty overview of the Solaris 8 O/S. It didn't provide an overall perspective of Solaris, tying all the pieces together to form a complete picture. It would have been great if the authors listed out the applications that come with Solaris (there are a truck load); it would have been even better if they detailed some of them. For those of us that don't have time to read through an author's opinions, this text leaves much to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Book","review":"I've purchased this while I've started working in a Solaris Shop.

Who would have thought that such an indespensible reference book could also be a page-turner. Once you start reading this treasure trove of information it is hard to put down because of the insider tidbits and behind-the-scenes facts that fill the well-written pages.

This is a must have for all libraries and any scholar of musical theatre or musical film or just popular music of the 20th century. Well worth the money!

Rampart in the arcade was great because you could play multiplayer vs the invaders. No such option here - you can only compete against each other. Road Blasters has to be the worst, though, since the steering controls are left, right or straight with no in-between settings. So how do you shoot something in the next lane over? You don't. What kind of port only gives you 45-degree steering in a driving game?The video looks very soft on every game, perhaps to replicate the worn-out tubes of '80s screens.I found some games I'd never played in the arcades to be fun, but Namco's Museum set such high hopes for me that these games would deliver that I can't agree with the other reviewers.

It seems to me that Sahlins had a list of things to tie the Pelopennesian War to before he wrote the book, and just did whatever he could to connect them. The purpose behind this is dubious and isn't explained in a satisfying manner at all.I just fail to see the value in this book. My recommendation: don't waste your time.

No question, it is well made, comes in a nice case, with a wide range of ear seals. The sound isolation comes from the tight physical seal, not any electronics. Even the smallest seals became uncomfortable after about 10 minutes listening and pulling the earbuds out was downright painful. I tested these with a Walkman while operating a blower. The Walkman was barely audible and the blower loud and clear. I was expecting the opposite. I could have tolerated discomfort had they worked, but not both discomfort and lack of noise isolation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinney, thin,no bass sound!","review":"I was duped again by some decent reviews of this product.Who are these people,do they work for Shure?

Walking down the street, I found I was reinserting them in my ears about every 20 steps. I contacted Customer Service of Shure and was literally told \\"there's nothing we can do about YOUR ears' being too small for our earphones.\\" Their suggestion was for me to buy a higher end Shure product which has supposedly smaller and more comfortable ear buds (which don't fit the E2c's). I won't be buying anything from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ears still hurt days after return","review":"The small flex sleeves were too small for my ears and so gave no bass. The medium flex sleeves were too large and would not fit in my ear. It is not as if I didn't try and make them work: I pushed, pulled and twisted them so much that my ears still hurt several days after the return.Unless you can somehow test this model before you buy you will be risking the same hassles as I have had because if you don't get a perfect fit the sound is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big bucks for dismal headphones","review":"I paid $74 for these, expecting to hear amazing sound and decent bass. What I got in return was mediocre sound quality and no bass. Also, the earbuds did not stay in my ears, no matter which size I tried to use. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"In getting these earphones I was looking for something ultra-portable, easy, and good sounding.By ultra-portable I mean I want to carry them in my jeans pocket every day. While these headphones are sturdy, the sturdiness comes at a price: the case is about 1 1/4\\" thick, so they don't meet my pocket-friendly requirement.These are my first experience with in-ear earphones. While they come with a wide variety of ear-piece fittings, I couldn't really find one that stayed securely in my left ear. Maybe I've got an extra-wide ear canal. Maybe I'm just uncomfortable jamming something in there so deep. So they aren't as easy and convenient as I wanted.When in position, they do sound great. The sound quality varies a lot if they come out of position even a little, though.For someone who doesn't have the same criteria as me, and who has had success with in-ear earphones, these could be great. But they just weren't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use while running","review":"I bought these earbuds for my IPod for use while running. They sound great while they remain in your ear, but keeping them in your ear is the problem. The large foam inserts only remain in your ear only for a short time; that is until you build up a sweat. Once you start to sweat, the buds will no longer securely fit in your ear and will slide right out.I'm back to using my lousy IPod earbuds again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money, at all","review":"I purchased a pair of these after some experience in earbuds and research and also based in part upon the reviews. I was greatly disappointed. The sound quality is terrible. I was prepared for a lack of bass which is to be expected in smaller headphones and earbuds in particular, but these were below par. As for the noise suppression/cancellation, it was on-par with other earbuds and depends primarily on how they fit. But given the size of these earbuds which are on the ungainly side, I would have expected much better sound.The thickness of the cord is another disappointment. They are too large (think) and inflexible. Again, given the price of these I expected something better.I realize these are at the low end of Shure's product line for these type of headphones/earbuds, but I've had better sound in products that are far less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't Stay in my Ears","review":"I followed the directions, but I could not get the earphones to stay in my ears.

They sounded good while it lasted, but unfortunately, that wasn't long. After less than a month of normal use, they developed a short on the sleave where the headphones connect to the jack, now, one month and $80 later, they are unusable.Think twice before ordering these."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is definitely over-rated","review":"I got Shure E2c sound isolating earphones primarily for use during flights.

Worst sounding headphone ever!","review":"These were recommended by the Store Personel, but he admitted he had returned his first pair due to lack of Bass. I was told it took 3-4 hours of play for the Bass to synch with noise isolation system. After 10 hours of use these still have less bass than any of the \\"el cheapo\\" headsets I have ever owned.

And two, they took a serious beating over in Iraq, and they still work perfectly.He's one warning for new buyers. Start with the small earpieces. You don't want to try to shove the big buds in your ears. It will hurt. Other than that, I am very satisfied in this product. Phenomenal sound..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good earphones, sore ears","review":"I don't have any reference to other similar earphone types, but based on other reviews and the relatively reasonable price point, I chose these earphones. The sound quality is good and range seems fine.The key reason I bought these, however, is that I can wear them when the neighbor's dogs bark incessantly and loudly. With them in, the barking is only noticable if I listen and never over music. Thumbs up!The drawback to these is that I can only wear them for about 90 minutes before my ears become some from having them in. I switched to the included smaller ear buds which helped, but daily prolonged use isn't an option. I haven't had an opportunity to try them on a plane ride, but I suspect they will work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone.","review":"Personally, I think these sound terrible (weak bass, distorted high end, midrange bias) and tried every combination of all of the ear sleeves. Only with a lot of cramming could I ever get the bass to work and then it would mess up the highs. Very likely its just the specific shape of my particular ear canal. Who's to say that even 6 different sleeve types are enough?For travel, I do have some non-earplug type earbuds that came with an inexpensive mp3 player I actually prefer - found them by accident after trying both Sony and the Shure earbuds and not liking either. Did not try the high $$ ones though.I would suspect many people might have a problem with the ear plug type headphones. If high quality, accurate sound is important and you can put up dragging around a full sized over the ear headphone the Sony MDR 7502 is one I would recommend that sounds great and is inexpensive and works well with low output devices like portable mp3 players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected","review":"Yes, these earphones do isolate the sound around you; however, they magnify the sound of your breathing and your heart beating to the point of distraction. Unfortunately, these earphones will join the pile of other also-tried's."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Pair I Bought!","review":"This is the second pair of Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones I bought. After several years of use, I ruined the first set by inadvertently cutting the wire. These are nice headphones. Good sound, good fit, good build quality (nice heavy wire), AND good price. I particularly like the moldable foam earpieces (included) that once compressed, will form fit to your ear canal. I routinely use these when I am exercising....doing yard chores..etc. I have to say that when I'm cutting the grass for example, the earpieces just about cut out all of the mower noise. If I had to give any critique, it would maybe be that the bass may be a bit lacking at times, and an earpiece has cut-out once or twice during periods of increased exercise ..and I would assume because of sweat getting into the ear-piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones - not for my music","review":"Thank goodness I got these on a Gold Box deal. Only paid about $40 for these and to tell you the truth, they are not worth the money when it comes to listening to music. There is almost no bass in these earphones. I listen to a lot of audio podcasts and books on my iPod, so the lack of bass is not a big loss. However, for my music the loss of the bass range is a big deal.Pros for these earphones are:- good ear-external sound isolation. great fit due to the multiple cushions- like the over the ear wire wrap (except if the wire accidentally get caught on something. gives your ears quite a pull)- like the thicker wire. feels like better qualityCons for these earphones are:- no bass frequencies come through at all- jack a bit large for use with some iPod cases, absolutely overwhelm a Nano unit.Bottom line: Not worth even the Gold Box price. A better choice would be almost any of the Sennheiser MX series earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait? Pretty much!","review":"I have followed prices related to the Shure E2c headphones for well over three years; when an Amazon saver e-mail found its way into my inbox a month ago I was happy to take the plunge at a discounted price of more than 60% off retail. The sound from the headphones, while not as rich as I had dreamed of, is very nice and after a solid week of fiddling with the enclosed foam sleeves and flex sleeves I'm a happy camper. Let's put it this way - these are the best $40 earphones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for $40","review":"I ordered these when they were $40 a couple weeks ago. It took a little bit to get used to putting them on and their fit but I really like these now. Like others have mentioned, the bass isn't as boomy as other headphones but these are these sound pretty good, especially for $40. Before I got these, I had been using the Sony MDR-EX81LP. While the Sony's sound pretty decent (not as accurate as these E2c's), the quality these Shure's are so much better. Personally, I wouldn't buy these for their \\"normal\\" price but I would buy it again for what I got them for, in a heartbeat. Funny this tonight, I was listening to music with these and my wife came to my office and I was facing the other direction. She was talking to me but I had no idea she was even in the room. So when I turned around, there she was. I was a bit startled you can say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Sound","review":"I purchased an iPod and withing 2 months the ear buds that came with it crackled and sounded terrible. I needed to turn the volume way up to hear anything. I looked for another set of earbuds and decided to purchase these ones.For the price you will not believe the sound and quality you get. Some reviews state that they fall out of your ears, this does not happen with me, as I have used the correct size flex fits in my ears and they fit snug and secure.The sound, right down to the little details will surprise you! I can't explain the difference you get with these earbuds. True they are a little costly, but more than worth the cost!Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even try it......","review":"I can't understand how is it possible that so many people rate the Shure E2c with 5 stars.

They are very uncomfortable because of the pressure inside the ear. I disliked the lack of ventilation because it felt unnatural. I was not amazed by the audio quality, it lacks detail and power unless you want to pump up the volume and maybe damage your ear. I'm sure that Sure makes great products but this canal phones disappointed me.Pros: Good construction, carrying case, cable length.Cons: Uncomfortable, audio quality.I am returning this item to Amazon. As always exelent customer service! 5 stars for Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure E2C","review":"These earbud headphones are very good at noise isolation. The fit is pretty comfortable. The cord is longer, bulkier and heavier than the iPod headphones. The sound quality is quite good as long as you have the earbuds positioned deeply in your ears. If not, the sound is flat and muffled. I think the iPod phones are superior in this regard because no matter how they are sitting in your ears, the sound quality seems ok. Overall, I recommend these particularly because you get rid of ambient noise and can focus on the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Performed exactly as expected, although the earpieces are still a little big for my ears. It's uncomfortable after a few hours use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good drivers killed by cheap and nasty cable.","review":"Basically owned these for 3 months when the plastic covering on the cables began to crack, not only making them uncomfortable but then eventually the audio began dropping out. I think part of it is even caused by the travel case they supply. Just comes down to some engineer or product manager picking the wrong cable supplier probably just because it was .01 of a cent cheaper than some decent cable.Drivers were good. They're not the best in the world but they're good enough for listening to Mp3s and also make flying a bit more bearable.Shure's service also sucks since you need to mail it to them and in an email they said that the cable deterioration whilst being a known issue is likely my fault, so not to expect them to cover costs. Just makes you feel that it's not worth paying the premium when your mp3 player is edging closer to the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"Well, i realized almost directly after opening these that i didn't want them. I like bass a lot and their just wasn't any in these. on the the hand, the fit was great and the sound was pretty clear. Just not enough to listen to music, more for speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound","review":"These headphones have a great quality of sound. The mix is just great. The only thing I will say about them is that they are totally noise cancelling. If you need to pay attention while listening, then you won't be able to hear a thing if you are using these headphones. I was listening to a full episode of LOST on the internet and missed like 3 phones calls because I couldn't even hear the phone. Unlike other headphones that you can hear relativley good what is going on around you, with these SHURE ones, you cannot. That is the only thing sorta negative about it. Other than that, they have SUPER great quality of sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good quality if they fit.","review":"So I bought these headphones just because I had heard how well they worked. To my disapointment I had a hard time fitting them into my ears. They were very hard to adjust to, and I would not recomend them to anyone who has smaller ears. Also it was complicated how to wear them, because they made you put the cord around your ear so they would fit in the canal. Since they didn't fit they did not cancle noise at all.On the positive side though, I could tell the cord was high quality because of its thickness.If you think you can fit them in, it might be a good product for you. If you are unsure, do not take the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Earphones for the Money!","review":"I originally bought these Shure E2Cs for my commute to work. After doing my research online I ended up buying these pair of headphones. There are a lot of reviewers who did a great job of capturing their experiences so I will just keep this short and simple.The sound coming from these earphones are great! Like what other posters state, you have to try ALL the other sleeves because everyone has different types of ear canals. So try them all. In the end I chose the clear sleeves which gave a better fit and comfort that helped a lot with the Bass.My only problem with my Shure E2Cs is the way the cords have to slide behind your ear. In the beginning it didn't faze me that much but as I got to use it everyday the stiff cord would not seat well behind my ear. I felt liek the cord had a mind of its own. lol Other than that I believe these are excellent Earphones that you should get especially if you're in a budget.Enjoy Them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I bought these over a year ago. I couldn't be more disspointed with them. Although the midrange and higher sounds ok, it's nothing to write home about. I didn't like the fact it has almost no bass. You won't get any bass if they are not sealed in your ear, so I tried all the pad sizes and still no bass. I don't like how they stick out of your ear at all. I feel like I put the money through the paper shredder I shelled out for these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fitting earphones at last!","review":"I can never use any of the in-ear earphones (that come with most mp3 players, my ipods,iphones etc) as they fall off the ear in a few seconds. This is the first one that doesn't fall off.- excellent noise isolation- normal audio reproduction (not the best, but good enough for most people)- excellent fit for all types of ears!- nice packaging (the carrying case does have a spool that can cut through the wire, so be careful)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful -- get Sennheiser instead","review":"I fly a lot, so I wanted some earphones that would reduce the airplane noise. First I got the Shure E2c since they were the most widely advertised. What a disaster -- I hard a very hard time getting them to fit in my ears, and when I finally did they were uncomfortable and the sound was pretty awful (very tinny).Then I got the V-Moda Vibe earphones and the Sennheiser CX-300. Both were much better in every way than the Shures -- better fit and better sound. Overall, the sound on the Sennheiser was slightly better (more bass) than the V-Moda. I also felt the Sennheiser did the best job of the 3 of blocking out the ambient noise. Add that to the fact they cost about half of the other 2, and the clear winner is the Sennheiser CX-300."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"The ear buds that came with my nano were crap! Not only was the sound not great, but they hurt my ears and were always falling out. These are a tad confusing at first...as far as how to put them into your ears... but not for long. The sound is really quite good and I can do mindless work around the house without distraction from others. Vaccuming is noiselesss! Be warned; people can and will sneak up on you, dont wear them when you need to have your wits about you.the only things that I would change:* the cord over the ear thing is hokey, it seems like there must be a better way to deal... but in order to keep them small I guess not* I dont care for the way it plugs into my i pod, it seems like that would be something to really work on, the plug and the connector/cord comes out at a right angle and is kind of bulky and not flexible plugged into something so very smallother than those petty things, I am really impressed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"I had been through several cheaper sets and needed something for my ipod that had pretty good sound. These are excellent earbuds--good sound and fit. They come with a great array of covers in different sizes and materials so you can choose what feels best for you.Unless those $400 dollar ones make you look skinny or attractive to the opposite sex, I think these are a great bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly tinny","review":"Very little bass, compared to my existing earpods for my iPod. Weak and tinny sounding. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If they didn't break I would love them","review":"First - I could really love these headphones. Great sound and has been great in heavy noise situations - especially New York subway.However, due to their lack of durability I cannot recommend anyone to buy these.The piece of the wire that goes around the ears cracks and falls apart. Mine started going within about 6 months, and it wasn't even everyday use.I bought mine when they were still going for full list price of around $100, which makes it an even worse investment. I definitely didn't intend to buy disposable headphones at that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"After 6 months they are falling apart. One of the earphones broke in half, so I have been listening out of one ear only. The second one is now full of static....I have had $10 earphones last longer! BTW, I only use them for about an hour a day, so definitely not a heavy user.Even before they started breaking down, I was dissatisfied with them. None of the earbuds fit - I have gone through all of them trying them for a few weeks at a time. The cord is too heavy so the earbuds keep falling out when I am walking or jogging. I spent most of the time getting frustrated and jamming them into my ear canals than actually enjoying the music. They are ok if you listen to them in bed or when you are not moving - which defeats the purpose, especially at the $70 price tag.Save your money, and try something else! I am about to find out how the warranty works..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to wear","review":"I found these headphones difficult to wear because I couldn't find a good fit with the ear pieces provided. The black mushroom style plug was the only fit that seemed to produce he bass that made the sound decent and because I had to push them so far into my ear, it became annoying after a short time. If you don't mind something pushed into your ear snuggly enough to allow the sound to come through, then these work fine. I guess I prefer something that isn't so snug. For the price, I will be looking for another model that works better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some love some don't","review":"I happen to love my new Shure E2c headphones especially with the soft foam inserts because I think the bass is better. I thought it was missing a little bass with the clear inserts and I bought a pair for my girlfriend and she did not like it with either insert. I kept her pair in case something happens to mine :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent isolation, precise sound","review":"The included ear fittings seem ugly to some, the ear pieces difficult to put in at first but the sound is exactly as described - clear, precise and most external noise is drowned out. The bass levels are a bit dim, no rocking of the ears with heavy drivers, so they are probably a better fit for pop, classical, jazz and instrumental rather than percussive, hip-hop and electronic music. Interestingly, when I plugged these into my pc at work (a run-of-the-mill dell desktop) I got slight noise from the motherboard being transmitted across the sound card. This would probably be inaudible with any other speakers or headphones, but with these clear drivers, you'll spot any flaw, crack or poorly encoded mp3 file instantly. Overall, worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small size = small bass","review":"The E2c sounds good for an earbud, but in fairness the praise ends there. Earbuds just can't match the low end sound of a larger headphone--even the inexpensive types. Other variables held constant, a bigger speaker accompanied by a stronger magnet will increase bass response. I prefer the overall sound from my $45 titanium driver headphones from Radio Shack.The E2c is not \\"noise cancelling\\" it is noise isolating--just like the earplugs you get from the drugstore. I hate to say it, but this product is really just a hybrid ear plug/ear bud. Really, there is not $99 worth of product, technology, or even clever idea.If you're an ear bud fan, you'll like these (as other report, they sound good for what they are). However, if you're the type to trade some convenience for superior sound, I suggest you pass on all ear buds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure E2c Earphones","review":"These earphones have a very good sound quality and are comfortable to wear in the ears. These are much better than a pair of Sony in the ear earphones I used to own before these Shure earphones. The Sonys used to clog up with ear wax and also pop out my ears very easily, while these Shure earphones have a little screen stick-on that helps prevent ear wax from getting down inside the earphone. These Shure earphones also seem to sit inside the ear better and not fall out. Also the sound quality is much better. Overall, a good product at a good price - worth getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounded awful","review":"When compared to every other pair of earphones I have, including some $10 radio shack headphones, they sounded awful. Very little base, and almost like it was coming from a tin can. I've tried the headphones from multiple sources, if there is a trick to making these sound better, I missed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected a more durable product","review":"At this price point I expected a durable ,well engineered product. within a month of use I started noticing small cracks in the wires near the earpieces .I figured it would be OK,they're thick wires. It's not OK ,they broke after 2 yrs. of lite use.I read thru some reviews, there seems to be a lot of consumers reporting same issue. Shure offers a repair service, but I can buy a better set of in-ear buds for substantially less than the repair will cost.... theAltec Lansing UHP336 Snugfit In-ear Earphone(which have user replaceable cords)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad insulation","review":"These earphones have a nice sound, but they use inferior insulation in the wires. The wires are stiffer than I expected and maintain their shape around the ears. While not a problem in using them, the isulation cracked and broke a few months after the warranty expired causing the sound to go in and out in one of the earpieces. This happened despite the fact that I treated the earphones very gingerly throughout their lifetime. Shure service was very unsympathetic and wanted almost as much to fix the problem as the earphone cost in the first place. If you purchase these earphone, don't expect them to last very long."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I had been told that these were far superior to the phones that come with the ipod.

Amazon is awesome in the returns department."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waist Your Money Unless You Enjoy Pain","review":"I bought these a while ago and hate them. They are the most uncomfortable earbuds I have ever used and for the price they should not hurt your ears after 10 minutes. I tried every combination of the pads to no avail. Putting them in your ears is a hassle and the design is horrible. The cord is also very heavy for earbuds and the weight pulls on the earbuds as you are wearing them. The earbuds that came with my Ipod are far more comfortable, light weight and I can wear them for hours without any pain. I just threw these in the trash since my return date has past.WHAT A WAIST OF MY HARD EARNED $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought this earbuds, i was very exciting to use em but i hate to say that but the truth is they are even worse than dollar store earphones, trust me or not, completely Waste of time to read other review, peoples who give 5 star i believe they don't know the meaning of sound even technology.

And they are without doubt one of the worst headphones I have ever bought. The sound is flat with no bass. It doesn't matter how much boost or sound equalization you apply. I think that I can get better sound response from any cheap, pharmacy bought, earphones. Seriously, if you like good dynamic frequency response, these are not the ones for you. Don't waste your money with these. There is nothing good I can say about them. The cord is thicker than the one on normal earphones making it heavy and uncomfortable. The fit is awkward and they fall off very easy. As another reviewer very accurately put it, I just want to cry cry cry for spending all my money on these Shures, based on the reviews I read on this site. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping taking too long!!!","review":"I ordered this product over a month ago and still haven't received it. A month for delivery is a bit ridiculous! I was originally given an estimated delivery date of Oct 3, then received an email that week saying it wouldn't ship until this week! If I hadn't purchased as a gold box item, I would have cancelled the order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks really cool...but not really","review":"I recieved these today and I have to say that I was really excited about getting them, but I have to say that I am disappointed with them. Once I got through the time consuming process of figuring out which mold fit my ear, I finally got them in. To be really honest, they are not noise canceling compared to my Bose noisecanceling headphones. Yes, I know the bose headphones have added noise.. but who cares.. .anything that makes the noise go away is fine with me. So all in all these are expensive headphones that are really not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Durability and ok sound for the price","review":"I was initially impressed with these headphones but after 4 months there were shorts in the wires. Yes the replacement is painless but it still shows how poor the quality is. I have recently listened to other headphones in the same category and do now believe these are anywhere near the best for the price. There are some entry level Ultimate Ears headphones that sound better. The sound is ok. It does a good job of isolating outside noise. I think the sound is somewhat shallow and have tried all the earpeices for these. I only realized that when I tried other headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another unhappy customer","review":"Maybe these work for some people, but my own experience with these is terrible. I fiddled and fiddled and fiddled, and read and re-read the directions, and fiddled, and tried every combination of included attachments, but could never get them to stay in my ear, nor sound anything but tinny. I'm smart and I'm diligent and these do not work for me. If they work for other people, we have different ear canals."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"After reading all the hype on the Shure earphones, I purchased the E2C earphones. I was really disappointed in the sound quality once I got them. I have to push and hold the ear pieces in my ears to get a tolerable sound quality. If you like extreme treble in your music, then this product is for you. My first interest in earphones was the Bose earphones but was turned off when the reviews said they put out too much base. Judging from the sound of these earphones have zero base unless I press them against my eardrum, I think Bose is just what I am looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only OK","review":"For what these cost they are a disappointment!

None of the options for \\"earbuds\\", foam or plastic would fit deep enough into my ear for me to hear all of the sound. I had to cram the foam insert into my ears so that it was VERY uncomfortable for me to hear the bass at all. So I returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good...","review":"Obviously a lot of people think these earphones sound good, I don't. The sound is weak, the bass response is terrible, the highs are twangy and thin, and the mid-range is loud but hollow. They aren't that comfortable to wear, but I didn't think they were as bad as some of the other reviewers did - they didn't hurt my ears of anything. However, they don't stay in place very well, even after you get the right fit. Even swallowing can cause them to shift a bit, at which point the music sounds even worse. I spent a good half hour swapping these back and forth with the earphones that came stock with my Crative Zen MP3 player - listening to a song on one and then on the other. These don't sound as good as the stock... which is really sad becasue I paid 65 bucks for them, and only 220 for the player. These aren't the worse sounding earphones on earth, far from it, but they aren't good, and they certainly aren't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I was really looking forward to these things. I forked out over a hundred bucks, after shipping and taxes, so I knew I was in for a treat. I was so wrong. First of all, they are very uncomfortable, now I know that everyone's ear is different, but for mine, these don't work. Second, I am a fan of deep, rich bass. They don't have it. Besides the weak bass they do have pretty good sound quality, that is why they are getting atleast 2 stars from me, but for my musical tastes, they just fell short. I really wanted to like these given what I paid for them, but I just can't get into them. Very Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound - don't last","review":"These have good sound but, I have had to buy 3 pairs over the past year (to my shame) the internal wires become disconnected from the speakers after a couple months of light use.

The Shure E2c Sound Isolating Earphones do a decent job at blocking out a lot of the sound around. If you plug your ears with your fingers, you can get a good idea of how much exterior sound is blocked out. Sound quality is pretty good, too. I can even sometimes hear the nuances in recordings: like music pages flipping or the pedals of a piano. For me, this has been an excellent purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product.","review":"well worth the price. mine came w/ 9 different earbuds. 3 foam sleeves in small med and large and 3 soft flex sleeves in small med and large as well as 3 stiffer flex sleeves in small med and large also. the hardest thing about these earphones are finding the right size and shape earbuds, but after you play around with the different ear buds and find the right one, they are great. they are extremely comfortable once you get use to them. the sound is terrific and the design nearly blocks out all outside noise. great for busy environments. just be careful jogging with them in busy streets 'cause you won't be able to hear cars driving by, but great product overall. was hesitant to buy because of the price. i figured i could get two pairs of regular ear buds for that price, but am glad i spent the money. you really do get what you pay for. would recommend this product to anyone looking for ear phones w/ really good sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very detailed overall sound, but evident lack of bass","review":"This are not for bass-lovers, but for the people that love to listen to classic music, jazz, and others not-so-bass music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure E2c- the best","review":"I love my Shure E2c earphones. I work as an aircraft mechanic, so I am around alot of noise all day. I used to wear foam ear plugs while working. But now that i have my E2c's, they are all I use.

Thanks shure."},{"rating":"1","title":"really unpleasant after the break-in. not for me.","review":"Didn't mind them at first - had my hopes up, since I believe in breaking in quality components. I have broken these things in thoroughly. Listened via my iPod and my computer. I have come to the conclusion that they are like early high-end audio and studio monitors - lots of detail, utterly unnatural and thin tonalities. Music sounds bleached. Comparing them to the Etymotics ER-6i - which may simply be a better match for the devices I'm using, but I don't think so - the ER6i is a bit more detailed, has much more impactful bass, sweeter tonality and in general sounds more like music. I will miss the heavier construction and behind the ear security of the Shure's, but, to my tastes, they have become increasingly unpleasant to listen to. The Etymotics are a bit more money, but not much, and they are designed, clearly, by people in touch with the FEEL of music, not just the frequency range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothes my audiophile heart","review":"Ive been looking for good earbuds for about a year now and these fit the bill perfectly. The only headphones I've seen perform better are my closed-ear sennheisers.They're perfectly balanced, with just the right amount of solid bass. If you want your earbuds to pump out defeaning volumes of bass that weren't originally mixed in with the song, LOOK ELSEWHERE. Like v-moda bass freq.Also, if you have abnormally tiny ears, you might need to look elsewhere.There's a 30-day love-em-or-return-em policy through Shure, also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular Performance","review":"These earbuds were more than I ever expected them to be. The sound clarity is absolutly amazing. Every little sound ranging from the plucking of a guitar to the deep thump of bass drum is clearly and accuretly recreated. Sound isolation is great as well. You can mow the lawn without any interference with your music. They also seem to have a somewhat wider field of sound on particular songs making it seem like you have surround sound. Overall for the money these earbuds are an absolute steal and would be hard to beat at this price level. I would highly recommend them to any audiophile who is on budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad!","review":"I mostly listen to eletronic music - drum and bass, ambiant, jungle, IDM, etc. So the bass of these earphones somehow disappointed me at first. But I tried some other music and slowly discovered the diversity of sounds these earphones are capable to play clearly. For those of you who have bought this product and hated it, listen to Brian Eno's \\"Music For The Airport\\" with it, you will see why you have spent $100 for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible sound, very comfortable","review":"I absolutely love these ear buds! The sound is fantastic, and I can wear them for hours. I use them on my daily train commute and it cuts out the noise without blocking it all together. I've also used them on planes and they worked great to cut out the air noise.The cord is super long, which is good and bad. I use one of those plastic pieces that you wind the cord around to shorten it a bit.There are a couple of various types of ear padding (foam, soft plastic, firm plastic) so you can find just the right fit.The other HUGE bonus is that the way they work, unlike other in-ear noise cancelling phones like the Apple ones, you can't hear yourself chew, and it doesn't make huge sound if the cord brushes your clothes.Make sure you look at the instructions on how to wear them properly - it makes a difference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound until they broke...twice.","review":"i bought two, not one, pairs of these because i liked the noise canceling and the sound was ok. but the first pair broke from normal wear and tear after get this 4 months, the second did so after 3 months. and after spending $200 ($100 per pair) in one year i tried to do the warranty thing. guess what they said??? we dont replace phones with \\"physical damage\\". well if they were made better there would be no physical damage from using them EXACTLY as the instructions say 3 times a week for 3-4 months.a complete waste of money. if you have money to throw into head phones like these 4 times a year there are worst ways to spend your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Bass Boosters","review":"I would not recommend E2C's for people who prefer the Boom in their ear. Although really great response for High and Mid range frequencies, its the Low that is the killer. My Sony Fontopia (EX51) sounded better in Lows and its only 1/3rd price. The sound isolation was pretty good though. Another aspect was the lack of labeling on the sides, instead it is color coded. You have to remember which color goes where. But I guess you can get used to that. Overall my opinion is - I returned mine after a week of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes a little patience, but then they are marvelous","review":"These are great headphones. Initially, they are a bit confusing and take some determination as to the best tip to use and how to position them in your ear. However, after that, the sound quality is incredible and the noise isolation is striking. I take them on the train everyday, and then walk with them to work, and I can't hear anything beyond my music. It is almost bizarre at times. The main reason I bought them was to save my hearing, and have found that I can listen to my iPod at roughly a third the volume I was before. That's a major difference that I am hoping over time will save my ears. They are very expensive, but if you take care of them and balance that price against your long term hearing, it is worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure love it!","review":"Shure makes some great products. I had these headphones for 2yrs, and they are the best I have ever used. The clarity, bass, & noise canceling are hard to beat. IMO Bose are overpriced and over hyped in comparison. I have used these too death, from daily commuter travel, Europe, and every US state in between. One month shy of these babies 2yr anniversary, the sheath cracked and exposed the inside wire. After attempting to patch it and looking for my next set, I came across a review that reminded my of Shure's 2yr warranty. I quickly sent my dying headphones to the company, along with my saved receipt and less than one week later I received a completely new upgraded pair (SCL2). Since I wasn't sure I would get them repaired, I went ahead and purchased another pair of Sure headphones. Now I have two brand new headphones.

Shure is a legendary brand of high quality headphones, and this set proves it. The sound quality is great and they are not hard to put in.The E2s have a balanced sound and you can listen to any type of music and you get a very nice clarity. The music does not sound stale, it just sort of jumps out at you as if you were really in the recording studio with the artists.One common misconception is that these headphones are hard to put in. Not true. All you have to do is find the right headphone top fit for you and then learn how to put them in. I learned how to put them in in 5 minutes. If the manual doesn't really help at all, then you can go to Shure's website, where they have a video showing how to put in the E2.Note: On the shure website, you should look under the Shre E2c's.

They come with a lot of different choices for earpieces from foam to rubber. There are enough different types and sizes, that I find it hard to believe someone couldn't get a good fit. I tried the foam pieces because a lot of people said they worked for them. I ended up using the rubber pieces. They seal out outside sound VERY well, too well if you are outside around traffic. The sound quality is very good and the cord is thick and sturdy. I have owned a LOT of different headphones and for the price, these are the best headphones I have owned hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable enough for me!","review":"I love these earphones don't get me wrong,,,the sound is soooo freakin' great. I have already purchased two pairs in the past year and a half,,making me think...I'm spending way tooo much money on earphones,,well the last two pairs i bought were for almost 100 dollars a piece. So for that type of money, i was hoping they would be able to keep up with me,,which they surely are not, I am always on the go and listening to my Ipod almost 2 hours a day on a regular work day,,due to public transport, but putting these things in my bag and out of my bag four times a day,,seem to much for this product, the last two pairs lasted me for a couple months. I just wish they were more durable. One headphone just simply dies out,,won't let any music through, then later the other one gives out too, unless you pinch the cord on an exact spot you can have one earbud working,,but i'm just giving up and going for a cheaper version."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cord sucks","review":"I've had these for a couple of years and the sound for me is great, made me remember what my music should sound like. But the biggest complaint that I have is, and this is why I gave them 2 stars, that the cord on my right ear where it bends at the top, cracked in cold weather and I had to electrical tape them, then the next winter the left ear cracked and I have hade to do the same again, which makes for them being a bit uncomfortable on top of the ear. Plus if you where glasses the cord seems to not want to fit that great over your ears. I'm going to try the new version of the Bose earbuds and see if the review of those are true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an audiophile, but...","review":"...these seem to be great earbuds. I use them with my iPhone (of course, an adapter is required to fit in the recessed iPhone jack) and have been very impressed with the sound quality. I got rid of my big noise-canceling earphones in favor of these, and frankly, I think the \\"earplug-style\\" design of them does just as good a job as the active noise-canceling feature of my old cans. Sometimes my ears get a little irritated if I have them in for a long time (even with the softer covers), but I don't know...maybe I just have sensitive ear canals or something. Anyway, highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure Earphones","review":"I have bought these and the Bose earphones and I perfer these.

You will have no bass, and they will be uncomfortable. I bought them and after spending an hour trying to make them sound as good as the $10 pair from wal-mart, returned them. I have a feeling the negative reviewers have small ears, and the positive have normal to big ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed; no bass","review":"I knew these earphones would not be the best from Shure, but I expected a better sound compared to the original ones that came with the Apple video iPod. I tried to wear them as recommended, deep in the ear canal and all, and I couldn\`t here any bass after a lot of pain trying to fit them. Two friends tried it and they also said the original iPod phones sound nicer. Unless my pair has a defect, I don\`t recommend buying them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it for the price","review":"I'll keep this short and simple. For this price, these headphones should stand up to normal, or even a little rougher than normal usage. They fail in this respect. Sure the sound quality is good and so is the noise isolation characteristics, but none of that really matters when one of your ear bud's goes out and you have to pay $50 to get it fixed. Sorry Shure, if you want to charge the money you have to make a product that's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear PLUGS not ear buds!","review":"I, too, was taken in by the Shure name. Selecting buds (there are about 5 styles that come with the E2c) is critical because you're not selecting something that comfortable fits outside your ear, but rather selecting something to go IN your ear, snugly. Too snugly.Let me be absolutely clear: These must be seated in the ear canal with an absolutely perfect seal, much like a hearing aid. If the seal isn't perfect, ALL the bass goes away, the tone changes, and they sound like a tiny AM radio. Yuck. Again, when they're shoved in the ear canal, they sound great - if you can stand the feeling of something akin to industrial ear plugs.The only reason for 2 stars, rather than one, is that the sound is good if they're shoved in far enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, faulty construction","review":"I purchased my pair of E2Cs in December 2005. By August 2006, they had already frayed and I was forced to send them back. Fortunately, Shure's customer service is excellent and they have a great exchange policy. However, now, six months later, my newer pair of buds have again frayed and I am again finding myself having to send them back for exchange (hopefully they will).I'm thinking that maybe the cold, dry winters of New York aren't good for the plastic wire coating. Nonetheless, perhaps Shure should look into using a different, softer type of plastic that won't crack and fray as a result of the elements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought for my son","review":"I purchased this for my 21 year old son for his birthday. cheers!

I went to my local Best Buy and picked up Shure, Bose, and JBL earbuds. The Shure earbuds were the worst, they were uncomfortable and hard to fit. I have an Apple iPod and a SanDisk Sansa, and on both MP3 players I could not go over 1/2 volume. The earbuds would cut out, and sometimes not work at all. The factory buds were better then the Shure E2c. The JBL earbuds were the best. They were easy to fit, included great accessories, and had excellent build quality. Another pair of GREAT earbuds are the Bang and Olufsen. They are reasonable at $149.00 and are excellent quality. However, I would not recommend the Shure E2c to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture","review":"Bought these based on reviews by other users. What a major disappointment.

I used the smallest settings as well, but I couldn't get the damn things to fit well enough with good sound.This may be just me or perhaps my ear canals are too small for this type of earphone but I was not happy at all with these highly praised earphones. I traded them in for some sennheiser HD 515 for the same price and absolutly love them. They are much much bigger, but my ears now feel great and the sound is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Name, Poor Sound","review":"I've heard great things about Shure in the past, so I decided to buy a pair of the E2c ear buds. It took me more than 30 minutes to find a decent adapter so the buds would stay in my ear. After that, my ear was sore and they still didn't want to stay put. After putting them in, I connected my MP3 player to them and was terribly disappointed by the sound. The high frequencies were OK, but the mid and low tones were completely absent. I adjusted the EQ on my MP3 player and the sound was not improved. I'm not sure if these things just need to be placed inside of the ear, touching the ear drum, or they are not designed for full range sound.They are not worth the money and I'd not recommend this product. The case is also a piece of junk. The cord is not easily wound around to contain them. Very poor design, but I guess the size is the only good thing about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"the product is terrible. the plugs, all the different sizes, don't fit and were very comfortable. the plugs kept falling out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me A Break!","review":"Where do I begin? Proper seal or not these things sound like 2 cans and a string (or worse). I tried ALL of the earpieces over a several hour period. And yes I read the instructions thoroughly. What a joke. Also they fall out of my ear no matter what position I use. Seldom have I seen a product so THOROUGHLY disappointing.This doesn't seem to be a popular review but I am telling you now that most of the people who gave these a good review don't sound convinced. I believe they are trying to justify a bad purchase to themselves. I am no stranger to quality audio and the E-2C has NO low end, NO mid-range and are THE MOST uncomfortable things you will ever pick up. If this is the kind of sound you like, I still think you would be happy with 2 cans and a string. It's much cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This thing is overpriced, yes, but if it works is ok, I though. Fact is, it does not work, unlesss you implant it in your ears. I found it very unconfortable and I could not have a refund because I don't live in the US, so I didn't even bother tryed to get it.

Some may get a good fit but unfortunately I couldn't, so I returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"For $100 I was expecting Awsome earphones, but the base is horible! I bought them form my Ipod while working out. They stay in my ears better, but the sound quality of the standard issue Ipod earphones was a lot better.

They are great at blocking outside noise and the sound is phenominal! Glad I bought em!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"I really wanted to like these earbuds. Really. On the positive side they are comfortable to wear and are well made. The problem is that the sound they produce is sub-par for what they cost. In fact, I was shocked at thin quality of the sound that they produced as well as the lack of bass response. The sound is clear but certainly not worth the price. I had a pair of Sonys that I wanted to replace for comfort and improved sound reasons. Unfortunately, though the Shures were far more comfortable the sound, particularly the bass, was very disappointing. And, yes, I did try several combinations of earpieces to get a good seal in my ear canal. I returned these and will keep looking for other contenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones LOUSY chord","review":"The sound is very good, however the chord quality, especially where it meets the earbuds are very poor in quality. The chord will get brittle in cold tempertures and eventually will crack, exposing the wire, and then break eventually. Given the high price of Shure headphones, this is unacceptable.Good luck in trying to get Shure to listen to the customer complaints when describing the problem with their product.Furthermore, the inner ear plug, does not lock into position, and is easily lost. Replacements are only available through Shure at a ridiculous high price (Something that is worth literally 10 cents in material is sold for 10 dollars.Good sound, but a faulty product design therefore ultimately a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound. Stays In Your Ears, But...","review":"I like the in-ear models. I get very tired of the \\"stock\\" earphones that continually fall out of my ears. The one caveat on these particular earphones are the somewhat flimsy plastic cones that the wires attach to on the bud itself. On my first set, the plastic broke and subsequently so did the wires, making the earphones useless. Shure will replace them for me, but at a cost of $53.00. So, be careful with these things and they should give you ample service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure E2c Great Product for the Cost","review":"I was first exposed to this product as an In Ear Monitor (IEM) system for live performance. I was so happy with the quality and fit of them that I had to purchase them for personal use with my mp3 player. I tried several different types of ear buds and I couldn't find any that fit my ears without pain or falling out. The different sized fittings of this product make for a great fit in my ear and do a great job of drowning out background noise such as a lawn mower or ambient noise in an airplane. I am not a professional audio engineer but the sound quality exceeds my expectations for ear phones in this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better than standard, but not great","review":"These were on sale when I bought them, marked down to $50 from $100. They are vastly better than the stock earbuds I was using, I will admit. I actually kinda liked them, until I did some research and picked up a pair of Sennheiser CX300's for 65 bucks. Compared to the Sennheisers, the Shure E2C's sound horrible, like the difference between the Shures and the cheapest earphones you can buy. For an extra few bucks, you can have vastly better sound quality with the Sennheisers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks","review":"The sound is very good and is almost comfortable. However, between me and my roommate, we have gone through 8 pairs of these (I bought one he bought 3 the rest warranty replacement) they all break. the wire over the ear cracks no matter what you do. they all fail within 12 months. shure has 2 year warranty so they'll send you a new one the first time it breaks but the second time you'll be out of warranty and they want you to buy a new one.I would love to use shure but I am looking for a different brand now because I can't afford to spend >$100 on headphones every 10 months. if anyone has any recommendations drop in the comments. section."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice design, but thats about it","review":"Quick rundown:Nice fit in the ears, but only when wrapping cord up and over the lobe.Sound is awful...like it's in a tin-can, use caution when purchasing to make sure you can return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"The earphones were very uncomfortable.

No bells and whistles here...just meat and potatoes...but meat and potatoes that are dependable and workhorse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works with right attachments","review":"I was looking for a set of head phones to work out with that didn't hurt. I tried a couple other pair, but they pinched my ears or went out quickly. The most comfortable, until this point, were the headphones that came with my rio cali, ironically. So I got these. I tried the black and clear attachments, but those pinched my ears, or would slip, or just didn't get a good sound. The cable is long if you want to wear your mp3 player on your arm. (I don't have 3' between my upper arm and head) So with a clip, I loop the cord and keeps it out of my weight. To solve the pinching of my ears, I tried the foam buds. What a difference. I can't hear anything else, and the sound is great. I can hear the bass with these compared to the other buds, and I can listen for hours without discomfort. They're like foam ear plugs. I'll probably buy more buds, but these phones should last a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read first - How to use foam tips and get GREAT bass response","review":"I've seen a number of reviews complaining of bad bass response for these headphones. I used the rubber tips for 2 months and agreed whole-heartedly that these things had great mids and highs, but no bass. Then I figured out how to use the foam tips and it made a world of difference. Since I have several friends who also took a while to figure it out, and from the posts here, it appears we are not alone, I figured I'd post this.It takes some work, but you want to roll them up (basically compress them between your thumb and pointer, like the world's smallest violin playing if you've seen Resevoir Dogs), then pull up on the top of your ear to expand the ear canal. After rolling them up, quickly put them in the ear canal while pulling up on your ear, let them expand, then release the top of your ear, and you'll have a super tight fit. The difference is night and day, you'll get much better bass response with the foam tips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure says \\"Value\\".","review":"I have always been hesitant about spending over $50.00 for a wired pair of headphones. In my experience, the plug and connecting cord have always been a major weakness in this type of product. Until now. The solid, quality construction of these headphones does not end with the part you place in your ear. The connector and wiring is of the same quality. Solid connector and sturdy wiring make this product a great value for the price. I finally feel justified paying more for a quality set of headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality Control Issues","review":"I bought these earphones about a year and a half ago, and they worked pretty well putting aside that it hurt my ears and the bass was relatively low. Additionally, these are sound isolating - not noise cancelling - earbuds. About 5 months in, the right ear gave out and crinkly static replaced the clear sound. Because my earphones were still under warranty, I sent them back, and to my delight a new pair was sent to me! But after only ONE month, the left ear gave out completely. What a disappointment. I appreciate Shure's satisfaction guarantee, I just don't think it's worth it to spend any more time or money sending broken pairs back and fourth. It's time to move on and find a different pair all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure E2C > ER6-i","review":"These are the best headphones for the price you can buy. Tried the out vs. the ER6-i's and they did everything the ER6-i's could do and it did it better.-Awesome bass reproduction-Good, loud sound-Strong cords-Comfortable in the ears (use the foam earpieces)-When they say they \\"isolate\\"...they really do. Be careful to watch for traffic! :-)-Great price (got them for $60 via Amazon)CONS-I have no complaints.If you have an mp3 player, do yourself a favor and pick these up so that you can actually appreciate the audio quality of your player.

The 2 stars was for this.Cons:* The overall sound quality was poor.* I tried all the different earpieces and found all of them to be very uncomfortable.

I was able to adjust this using the player's balance setting, but with my other problems with the item, I just returned them.

I was looking for a solid headphone performer in the $75-$100 range, and these came out on top. I thought I was upgrading from my $25 Phillips headphones by purchasing but was wrong. The Sure E2c sound is flat, as if I was listening to music through a tin can. There is absolutely NO bass response, which is disappointing. Furthermore, the earphones tend to fall out of my ears rather easily because none of the ear pieces provided fit. They are either too big or too small. The design is difficult to keep in the ear because they are curved at an awkward angle. I am very disappointed in these headphones and now have wasted money on them because I can't return opened headphones. I would steer clear of these earphones; if you are curious, try them out first. I'm going to stick with my Phillips headphones. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What great sound?

The instructions (not I) say it's essential to form an airtight seal in the ear in order to hear the bass frequencies properly. I.e. shove the things in until they are snug like those foam earplugs you buy at concerts.Shoving ANY kind of earbud in deeper makes the bass sound deeper; but I don't think quality earphones would rely on this principle.

The sound of these earphones is below average at best. Sure they beat those five bucks earphones you find in Wal-mart, but they do not justify the sixty dollar pricetag. They don't sound good with bass heavy music and can hurt your ears. Even the smallest fit pieces are too big for me. You are better off with the Sony Fontopia for 1/2 of the price. The Sony earphones are far more comfortable and sound better in the low end. But I have to warn you the wires on the Sony is very thin and won't last very long.

I found on the comfort leval a 10, but was shocked to find out that the stock earbuds sounded so much better than these $100 earphones! It was like comparing AM to FM, the shure's being the AM! The sound was all mid range, and not much in base tones, the clairity was great, but that was about it. I guess I expected too much, so needless to say, I'm returning these, and trying something else, or keeping the creative earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the bass","review":"I purchased these headphones after two pairs of Bose stopped working. Bose offer a much better sound quality. Listening to my songs through these headphones have wiped out the bass completely. I almost don't recognize the songs on my IPOD. I'm seriously disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I bought these headphones as an upgrade to the premium headphones that came with my Zune. However, these headphones are more expensive and don't sound any better than the probably overpriced Zune ones. I had a really hard time finding end caps that fit into my ears without falling out and ensuring the sound isolating properties of the headphones. When I did finally find a set that works, the sound quality isn't any better than what I was used to. Sound isolation was achieved, but didn't really matter since the sound quality was not there. Finally, after about 4 weeks the right ear bud no longer works... and I can't figure out why. These ended up in the trash and I will not buy these headphones again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and lacking warmth","review":"After reading the many reviews suggesting that this headset was great I bought a pair for myself.I found the earbuds very uncomfortable and did not like the pressure it caused on the inside of my ear. I also found that there was way too much high end and not enough bass response. I found the sound to be way to harsh.I'm an audio producer so I plugged these earphones into everything from an i-pod to a hi-end studio system with same results.After a couple of days trying to get used to these earphones I tossed them for the Philips Surround earphones which are much more comfortable and sound very warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Than Cheap Earphones","review":"This was a complete waste of money. I feel absolutely ripped off. These earphones have ZERO bass and won't stay in the ear. I can't imagine why this company has a good reputation. I had to throw them in storage and I am back to using my $15 cheap earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are my earphones?","review":"I ordered these on September 17th. Twice now, I've received e-mails from Amazon saying shipping was delayed. NOW they're expected to be delivered in late December!! And to make things even worse, Amazon now won't let me cancel my order like I had the opportunity to do in the first e-mail which was sent in the beginning of October. Although the price was right (39.99 & free shipping), buyer beware of a deal to good to be true.UPDATE: 1 day after writing this, I received an e-mail from Amazon saying my Shures had shipped and should be arriving by October 25th. Stay Tuned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I bought these because my cheap sony earphones had been chewed up by a dog. It took amazon 3 weeks to get them to me. I then spent 30 minutes getting the perfect fit, and then I tried them out. It was almost all treble, I thought it was my ipod so I tried them on everything and anything. They were almost painful to listen to, and if I changed the equalizer on the output device they sounded distorted. I am now listening to music on my cheap dog chewed headphones and returning these back to amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good phones but...","review":"These ear phones are great at isolating outside noise and the sound is far better than any standard iPod set. However, I have had mine for 14 or 15 months and the wire casing (especially around my ear) has bent and cracked open, leaving the copper wiring exposed. Because of this, the connection is failing, ruining the sound. I may buy another pair unless I find something more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent earphones","review":"These earphones have excellent sound quality. I used to have one of those $25 earphones and thought I was getting the best sound. I didn't realize that I was missing so much quality of the music until I started using the Shure earphones.The only problem I have with them is that they are a little tough to fit around and in your ear. There is no \\"R\\" or \\"L\\" on the earphones to show which one goes in what ear. I might be a little particular but when I'm at the gym or out for a walk I don't like fumbling to get my earphones in my ear. However, once their in my ear and I turn the music up, I'm in a whole different world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than your average headphones","review":"They're certainly better than the average earphones, but don't confuse them with noise-cancelling headphones. These are noise-isolating earphones which means they don't have the microphone/electronics to produce an opposing frequency to cancel out ambient noise. These earphones, and all other noise-isolating earphones, rely on the removable ear pieces to block ambient noise. With that said, I think these do a great job when using the right ear piece.They come with three different types of ear pieces. I found that the foam ones did the best job of blocking ambient noise. My main issue with the headphones is that they have absolutely NO bass. I don't really \\"bump\\" my music, or really listen to music that relies heavily on it, but it's noticeable.I paid about $70 for this pair. $50 would have been more reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"best in class","review":"I currently own two pair of E2c earbuds, for both work and home. I also own a pair of the newer and more expensive SE210s. The E2c earbuds outstrip the SE210s for sound quality, largely due to the material used in the in-ear inserts. The older E2c earbuds use a less spongy material that fills the outer ear and seals it. The newer SE210s (and the entire new line of x10s I believe) uses a spongier material that doesn't provide a solid seal and allows for ambient noise to muddle your music.I notice no different in bass, mid tones, or high tones of the two different headphones when the room is silent, so I recommend the cheaper E2cs to those looking for a great in-ear bud experience that would rather not spend 150+ bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke 3 times before warranty was up","review":"I got these in part because of the warranty. Mine broke 3 times during the 2 year warranty period and each time Shure replaced them, but I had no headphones for two weeks. Each time they broke, I got a new pair in sealed packaging, so I think that these headphones just break a lot, which is surprising considering how sturdy they feel. The warranty just ended and they broke again, not buying another pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wires Rot and Short!!","review":"I loved the sound and the fit more than any other pair I've ever owned. They lack in bass but not a big deal to me. Loved them EXCEPT!!!! Within 6 months without fail the wires' insulation rots, gets brittle, and breaks. I've owned 3 pair because I like them so much, but without fail they short out. I'm nice to them too!! Sad because their fit design is SO GOOD! And sound isolation is the best I've experienced. If I was rich I'd just but 20 pair and go through them like toilet paper, but I'm not.VERY NICE..............SHORT LIFE."},{"rating":"1","title":"too expensive for such poor durability","review":"Bottom line: this is supposed to be a \\"portable\\" product; it's not. The wires are simply too delicate to endure. Plus, as another reviewer mentioned, the carrying case is designed to practically guarantee failure. It's like storing a paperclip in a container that forces you to flex it back & forth a bit each time you store it.To me, an expensive product that is, in fact, designed to fail & designed to produce a follow-up purchase is not acceptable.So, if you plan to use them on the go, don't expect them to last more than several months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as they say","review":"Based upon all the reviews i read, I couldnt wait to get these ear buds. I must completely disagree with the rave reviews. I could not have been more disappointed. When I took them to the gym the first day, they kept falling out of my ears. alas, i did not take the time to properly fit them to my ears. Soo back home i went, and sat for 30 minutes adjusting the different fittings. nada. i mean not even close. I could not find a comfort fitting. they never did fit snugly, and quite fankly, all i could think was..this is a lot of work for a dopey pair of earbuds. when i finally got a \\"decent\\" fit, the sound was nothing special. a bit weak on the low end. high end a bit harsh. Just an overall negative experience for me, so back they go to amazon..and i am back to my ipod buds. to each his own i guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bass, ok sound isolation, but doesn't beat my old noise cancellation headphones","review":"I was disappointed, partly because of how expensive they are.

I take care of them, but I think the chord is just too sensitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound great but not built for running","review":"These sound great, the bass is awesome for a set of earphones and the noise reduction is pretty effective. They are perfect in planes, work, etc but the problem is while running they tend to slip out :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped","review":"I bought these head phones a couple years ago. They have failed on me 3 times in all. The part that failed was the mini jack that you plug into your player (mp3/cd/etc). While Shure honored their warranty, they never did anything about the fact that their product kept failing at the same place twice.Iver all i didnt like the fact that the headphones were too big and heavy. The 3 different sizes ear fittings offered by Shure didnt fit my ear (my ears are smaller then the Shure avg).Would I buy them again? Nope, in general I'm staying away from this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!","review":"These just aren't comfortable in my ears. None of the many ear canal adapters seem to feel comfortable enough. Definitely can't wear these for more than 15-20 minutes at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound, heavy cord","review":"I love the sound from these headphones.The only problem with them is the cord is very very heavy and can pull the earphones out. Can not be used while you are moving.Bass is excellent and all in all worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, but be gentle with the wires!","review":"I've used these for 3 years of daily train commuting, and they isolate the outside sound fairly well. My only major complaint is that, despite carefully winding them in the supplied case each day, the wires eventually frayed near the earbuds. I had the same issue with earlier Sony earbuds, and I thought the thicker gauge wires of the Shure would help.On the plus side, Shure honored the 2-year warranty and promptly sent me a brand-new replacement. But now, barely a year later, the cord is fraying again on both sides, the signal is dropping out, and I've finally decided to order a pair ofEtymotic Research ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones (Black), since I've had a lot of success with their musician's earplugs. Their wires look delicate too, so I think I'll pre-emptively wrap them with some electrical tape near the bud end, a precaution that might be advised with these Shure models as well.Bottom line, I loved the e2cs, but it's time to move on. YMMV..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good earphones","review":"There were a lot of negative reviews on these earbuds, so I was skeptical. The sound quality is quite good, and the noise isolation is also very good if you have them in all the way. Problem is they pop out just slightly very easily and the wires are annoying when they're still stiff from being brand new. Lots of people also say the bass is terrible, and that's not true, but again, they do have to be completely in before you can really hear it. I'm no audiophile, so these earphones suit me perfectly fine. They're a lot better than my last ones in any case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound half good","review":"After some very meticulous shopping I decided on the Shure E2c Earphones. My first problem was that the supplier shipped a different model with no real explanation for the difference or the spec difference between the units. My second problem was with the earphones themselves. Right out of the packaging I was disappointed to discover that only one channel worked. Almost nothing from the right channel unless I had the volume level at full and then it was only barely audible. I tried the earphones with various sound systems with same result. Called Shure and they told me to return them for a replacement set. This review will be continued. The left side seemed to sound just fine but I am concerned with Shure's quality control. How difficult can it be to verify sound coming from both channels in a set of earphones before you package them up in an impenetrable plastic shield? I expected more from such a renowned company."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"Got these for only $40, but might as well have thrown the money in the trash. The sound is worse than any headphones/earbuds I've ever had including the ones from the Dollar Store. I found the sound VERY TINNY, so gave them to my son & he agreed- they suck. Wouldn't use them even if they were free. Unfortunately by the time I got my son (lives out of town)to check them out it was past return period. Afraid to put on Ebay as buyer would probably be dissatisfied also. Oh well, win some, lose some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shure review - not great","review":"I bought this pair for running and was SOOOO annoyed that they would not stay in my ears.

I eventually splurged for the Bang and Olufsen...the best ever!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These are TERRIBLE!! Tinny and no bass!","review":"These things are terrible. After having high expectations based on the reviews, I tried them and found the sound horrendous. I currently use Sony MDR-EX71SL's with my Ipod.

I read the positive reviews and the caveats pertaining to getting the buds to fit properly, but after carefully following the directions and trying all of the bud sizes, I was still unable to get a snug fit. The ear pieces continually slipped out of my ears, and when I could get a temporary good fit, the sound quality was akin to having a bad head cold. While walking, my breathing competed with the sound of music, as well as the sound of each of my steps as my feet pounded the pavement. The wires are too heavy and cumbersome. It was difficult to keep the wires behind my ears while wearing sunglasses. It comes as no surprise that Shure discontinued this poorly designed product. I enjoy better sound quality with my IPod earphones and none of the hassles experienced with the Shure E2c."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for my ears","review":"Had to return this product since I was unable to get them to comfortably fit in my ears after many, many, many attempts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure Sound Nice!","review":"These earbuds sound great.

They put out high quality sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No bass, ok sound isolation, but doesn't beat my old noise cancellation headphones","review":"This definitely does not have full range. Some songs I listen to have very low base frequencies. I would have been fine if I could hear it, but it was quieter. That's what I was expecting. To my surprise, entire bass lines were completely absent from the songs when listened to through these E2s. And the sound isolation is something I'm new to. I've been using old AIWA noise cancellation headphones, which work better. Whether you want isolation or cancellation, my bet is that there's a much better product for the price, and I intend to find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"As it turns out, the sign is not entirely arbitrary.","review":"Magnus eloquently shares the findings of her research in sound symbolism. Contrary to popular assumtion, the assertion is not so much that the phonemes of a word create its denotation; but that the connotative difference between two synonyms is accounted for by the assotiative sound qualities of the phonemes of the respective words.This small, lovely book is for people who love words, books, a turn of phrase; folks whose hearts can resonate with the throb of a well-crafted poem. Its design- look, feel, and sound- is elegance itself. If you are the sort of person who is happiest when submerged in words, this book is a salve to the heart, an inspiration to the mind, and a confirmation to the spirit, which always Knew there was something more to words than the dry bones they taught you about in school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The good news is that Gilbert has a lot of good and occasionally humorous material about how our minds work. He uses mental biases and errors to illustrate our mental processes and understand their limitations. However, if you've read even a few popular books on neurobiology and the mind, you already know much of this and have seen many of the examples.While the book has received a lot of hype, I was disappointed mostly in the weakness of his conclusions about happiness. The conclusions derive in large part from studies about whether you can anticipate how happy or sad you will be after eating ice cream, eating potatio chips, or losing a pizza. My key disappointment arose because I do not see that studies about momentary feelings of happiness tell us anything interesting about the pursuit of happiness as the longer term sense of life satisfaction and well being that most of us are interested in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"This book was very humorous.

The book contains many valid conclusions and eye opening statements but they are unfortunately overshadowed by the repetitiveness through the chapters. The author illustrates his points by providing countless studies (along with humorless puns) that make the book seem long to read.

His easy dismissal of animal intelligence, denigrating their limited \\"nexting\\" capacity when compared to the grandeur of the human imagination , indicates that he is very ignorant of animal behavior...and failed to use his much touted human imagination to perceive their intelligence.

It's fairly amazing to me that the subject of happiness can be that unintersting, but it is. I'm sure Dr. Gilbert is fun at parties, and I bet he can cheer up sick people quite well; but, as an author, he did not succeed in telling me anything useful.

Like some of the other one star reviewers, I'm puzzled at the amount five star reviews this book received, because usually books here at Amazon with those kind of reviews are actually pretty good, like Freakanomics and Fooled by Randomness.The book itself just seemed to be a lot of high level analysis of unrelated, simplistic college student experiments on human nature strung together enough to make a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful book which made me happy","review":"Who knew there were so many elements to making us happy that we have no idea of?

Instead, the book is more about errors in predicting our happiness. \\"Happiness stumblings\\" would have made more sense as a title, but of course would not be so catchy.Second, and more serious, the book tries to make a lot out of a little. The book can be summarized as saying \\"When we predict our future happiness, we do so imperfectly!\\". It tries to make out that this a real problem, as though if we can't be right 100% of the time, there's no point in trying to be right at all. Of course we can't predict the future 100% accurately, our own happiness included. Some of the psychology experiments confirming this are mildly interesting, but that's about it.Add in an overdose of attempts at humor (presumably to cover the weakness of the argument), and you're left with a disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed with Stumbling on Happiness","review":"I had more fun reading this book than I have had reading in quite a while. It was informative, intereseting, and educational. It's been about 4 months since I finished the book and I still find myself reflecting on some of the lessons learned. I had very little previous knowlege of psychology. I reccommend this book to anyone interested in how the human mind works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish this book","review":"There is nothing succinct about this book. I really wanted to know what the author had to say on the subject (I have read three other books on happiness lately and have ordered a fourth) but I simply couldn't wade through all the tangents to get to his point. I usually enjoy a quick side note by an author to illustrate an argument or theory, but this author's side notes went on for pages. By the end of the chapter I was no longer sure what the author was trying to say. What I was able to read was pretty interesting, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one, but after several chapters of wanting to scream, \\"Get to the point!\\" I simply put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get to the point already","review":"I get what the book is about. However, I found that if I were back at college and he were a professor, that he would be one whom I'd classify as \\"Likes to hear himself talk\\". I found that he digressed from his points way to many times in the book, or would list off examples that took up almost an entire paragraph, vice one or two followed by a succint \\"etc.\\". This caused me frustration, and often i would scan through this to get ahead just to see what the point was he was driving at. Overall, the book is just okay. Not very in depth, and doesn't really resolve anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ir's basically a list of experiments","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to know how I could become happy. However, this book turned out to be a long list of psychological experiments that proved how badly human imagination and memories are flawed and follible. Yet the author concludes that nothing is better than our imagination and memories to depend on to predict our future happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"More fluff than substance","review":"The author presented basic findings about human perception and judgment rather than actual findings about the concept of happiness. If you've ever taken an Intro to Psychology course in college, you probably already know about 90% of what the book contains. He describes numerous studies in full detail (much more than needed) and doesn't seem to tie them together well. He meanders around his point in this haphazard way.He inserts tons of little jokes and witty comments that are clearly designed to just entertain us. It was clearly an approach that came off as trying-too-hard, and it just suggests to the reader that they would consider his points about the subject too boring to be interesting on their own.All in all, you end the book with more questions than you have answers, and you think of all the better ways out there that would have actually taught you something about the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unhappy Read...","review":"While reading Stumbling On Happiness I was constantly aware that the author was using me for his fame and furtune. I felt VIOLATED. But seriously, this book is a collection of mildly interesting facts, presumptions, and absurd psychological studies. A book on happiness? Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not worth buying","review":"There's not much substance in this book. The lard factor of this book is at about 90%. He talks about nothing most of the time. I'd often finish a whole chapter and find one or two sentences that are meaningful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed review","review":"Amazon showed the vendor as having my book but turns out they did not have it. They also sent me the wrong book in the mail by mistake.

Enlightenment is something the author would NEVER enjoy...Waisted time and money for those readers, who could sense the historical merger of all scientific disciplines and ancient wisdom we are witnessing now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a How-To, but a Why","review":"Dr. Gilbert does an excellent job of explaining, in layman's terms, how the emotion of happiness works in the human mind. This book is more inspirational than instructional: it helps you understand how your emotions work, rather than how to manipulate them. So if you're looking for something to teach you how to be happy, this book isn't for you. But if you're interested in logically dissecting your emotions, particularly in relation to how you think you should feel, this book can be invaluable.I would like to thank Pete Wilson on KGO radio for interviewing Dr. Gilbert. This interview inspired me to buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appreciate the effort, but nothing new here","review":"Reading this book was like listening in on a rhetorical conversation that started with 'Isn't it weird how we always think....blah'I decided that this book has the knowledge equivalent of a conversation you would have with good friends over a bottle of wine, except you have to read this one.Sorry, but I found myself wanting to hurry through this book looking for some gripping anecdotes or new insights. I think this book marks the official end of the whole 'Tipping Point', 'Blink' and 'Freakonomics' movement. It's all been done to death and now this book is giving the academic treatment to things that we all realize ourselves, but still do.I appreciate the author's effort but I was underwhelmed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing insights, good humor, scientific validity","review":"The book is thoroughly brilliant (actually, read the Kindle sample and find out for yourself).Basically, it describes the inherent flaws we humans have when we try to envision our future and predict our happiness in it.Each chapter made me think \\"Click! That's me\\".As the authour notes, it is not a self-help book. It's purpose is to educate and entertain you, showing you your own limitations. It does not give any directions for becoming happier (like meditating or reaching your goals or whatever else)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, scholarly approach to finding happiness","review":"We've all gone down certain roads looking for happiness and found out, sadly, that the roads were dead ends.If you're like me, there have been times in your life when you have wanted to just give up on happiness. But Gilbert shows that happiness is attainable in ways that we may not expect.Gilbert shows why we seek happiness, and gives practical on how to \\"stumble\\" upon it. This book has given me insights that I never even imagined.Another book on this topic I'd recommend is: \\"Christmas Gifts, Christmas Voices\\" by John Allen. It's more than just a Christmas story. It shows how kind acts and service to others are the real keys to lasting happiness.Also: the classic \\"As A Man Thinketh\\" by James Allen. (Are James and John related?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I agree with all the other one star reviews. Can't figure out how he got so many positive reviews. One or two interesting tidbits like the information about the Siamese twins, Lora and Reba Schappel who are happy with their lives even though conjoined, and the card trick on pp. 44 & 49 but one has to plow through so many pages of verbiage and unfunny \\"humor\\" to get to the few goodies that it's not worth it - life is too short. Malcolm Gladwell's books in a similar vein are more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you really know what you're thinking?","review":"This book shattered every preconception I had about how I think. I found myself saying \\"no, no, that isn't what I'd do,\\" but ended up agreeing with most of Dr. Gilbert's insights. I've read many books on this subject, but this was one that I thoroughly enjoyed the writing as well as information. It is a book that everyone can read and learn something new about themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better psych books in a long time","review":"I found this book to be extremely insightful, and it has really informed my decisions a great deal moving forward. After reading this I sent myself an \\"email from the past\\" to test if the things that I think will make me happy actually come to pass five years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"I will read it again!","review":"I so enjoyed reading this book. I was not expecting it to give me the cure for unhappiness. The author tells you in the forward that this is NOT a self help book. It's entertaining, informative, and a very good read. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very impressed, this book is overrated","review":"I was not very impressed.I had to force myself to read the second part since I lost much of interest.Author's inclination to try to be funny and insert lame jokes everywhere became a turn-off.This book is overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I was expecting a Malcolmn Gladwell type of book where interesting ideas are backed with solid evidence but more importantly narrated in an engaging way. Unfortunately, this book did not have anything I didn't know and the author's style was repetitive and boring, definitely not like Gladwell's. If you want an easy read with somewhat interesting topics, go for it but otherwise it's quite forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of twelve bucks","review":"Fscinating message. Too bad about all the rest. Wordy, self-importnt, meandering, and unfunny, this book takes a random walk through poor allusions lame jokes and irrelevant trivia to fluff his message from its proper size (5 pages would do) to a book he can feel justified collecting 12 bucks for. Skip the book and just read the wikisummary or the NYT review."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring (er, sorry, Dr. Gilbert)","review":"Big fan of popular science books, especially books in the social sciences. I like nothing more than reading books likePredictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our DecisionsorNaked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science. I'd read anything done by Malcolm Gladwell, for example.Yet I found this book a struggle to finish. Given Gilbert's reputation, I expected it to be mind-blowing. It wasn't.Weeks after reading \\"Predictably Irrational,\\" I was left with many examples that simply wouldn't leave my mind. I kept thinking about the studies done in that book.Nothing like that happened with this book. Once it was over, I forgot about it completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking....","review":"Similar in style and substance to Tipping Point and Freakonomics, only more entertaining and less bounded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought","review":"The author of this book doesn't claim to be able to make me happier, and I didn't really expect him to be able to do so. However, I did expect a book that was more cohesive and that really tackled the idea of happiness. Instead what I found was a group of descriptions of experiments done by psychologists throughout time. Some of these experiments were fascinating and highlighted interesting facts about the human imagination, but I often could not make the connection between these experiments and the happiness that was advertised by the book's title. Furthermore, the tone of the book's author was a bit informal for me. I like my research scientists to be a bit standoffish, and Daniel Gilbert was often too flippant for my taste. Overall, it didn't capture my interest as well as I'd hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Documentary is NOT Built for Pleasure","review":"Highly recommended for all fans of UGA.

I used it in the exact same locations as I had used me last phone, and I couldn't understand a darn thing anyone was saying, and they couldn't understand me either. Making phone calls was MISERABLE! I hated trying to talk to people. But the problems did not start once the call had been initiated, it had a hard time dialing out, and often would proclaim \\"no signal\\" in places that I routinely used the phone before this one, and the one I bought after I couldn't deal with how horrible this phone was (about 1 month)."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible phone","review":"It makes calls, which if that's all you want then its perfect.

Her past catches up to her when Gig Curry,a mean, old bf of her mom's come to threaten her life for her half brother, Cree. Kade becomes Marshall when the one prior to him had a stroke. He captures Gig after a horse race who is accused of murdereing 12 soldiers and robbing. Throughout the book they try to solve the problem. They also try to resolve the relationship between the McKettrick brothers and Holt.I thought the story reflected too much on the outlaw problem rather than having it focus on the relationship between Kade and Mandy. Romance is lacking in this book, which is why I would call it more fiction than anything else. The book was a bit dry. This is not something worth buying, perhaps buy as used or rent from library."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST HORRIBLE!","review":"I have read more romance novels that I can count and I think this was the VERY worst.

Unfortunately, for me it was too much \\"Western\\" and not enough drama/romance. I am all about romance novels with depth and great storylines- I'm not in it only for the sappy stuff. This book, however, went into WAY too much of the Western-type book. I am not a fan of hearing gory details of men who were murdered, how they were murdered, how bloody and gory the scene was, and how they were scalped or \\"butchered.\\" There were SEVERAL of these scenes in this book. The book dragged on for me, and about half way through I realized that it was just a book to get through to read the next in the series- and HOPE that it is WAY better!!

These are clearly the best sounding of the bunch (and should be for the price) -- they are very true to the original sound. Other than physical limitations of small phones, they sound almost as good as high end audio systems. Unfortunately, they are not as comfortable as either of the other shure phones. Because there is a fairly large \\"unit\\" that fits in your ear, it gets fatiguing and uncomfortable after relatively short listening sessions (1 hour). Leaves me with a dilemma -- they can't be beat for sound quality, but if they are uncomfortable, am I really going to put up with them and actually use them??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just buy the e500 already","review":"I'll spare you a breakdown of the sound signature of these headphones. They sound great for IEM's, and pretty good for the price. My beef with them is that they are hard to drive out of any of the portable devices I own. I have a 4th gen iPod, a Creative Nomad Jukebox 3 and Zen Vision:M. Out of the headphone out, they sound muffled and receded in the high end. The bass is also very muddy and uncontrolled. The mid-range doesn't suffer as nearly as much but is the headphones over all week point. When amped with a good portable amp they sound amazing (again for an IEM). The E500pth don't suffer nearly as bad from unamped sources although do with out a doubt also benefit from amping. It's just with the e5c really suffer. Just a heads up to people trying to decide between the e5c and the e5oo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Combat Tested!","review":"Have to be the most amazing pair of earphones that I have ever purchased in my life! A few years back I was in a band and had the Shure E2's (another amazing set) and loved them. However, we broke up when I joined the Army, and I since sold the E2. Now, Stationed in Iraq, I needed a set of phones that would block out all the background noise of passing by tanks, trucks, and aircraft. The Shure E5c's were there to answer the call! Cant hear a thing at all with these things on, except for, of course, the finest quality sounding music ever. A little difficult to get in the ears at first, but after the first 2 days it was very natural. I use these things for everything now, from listening to radio tranx, to my ipod, they have stood up to the Combat Test!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, cumbersome fit","review":"The E5c lives up to its sound, pricing and build quality, but the \\"back over the top of the ear\\" fit is a bit cumbersome and odd looking. Also, the silvery-clear long cord is quite long -- many in-ear Sony phones have a two-section cord -- and cannot be shortened. The included volume attenuator unit is a separate black piece. If you are using the E5c with an iPod it does not mesh well visually. But the sound is certainly top-of-the-pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Napa Valley: The Ultimate Winery","review":"This is, without a doubt, THE LAST WORD in information about the Napa Valley.

The special effects were pretty bad and it would have been a better film if they had used more comic book pictures instead of low budget special effects. An alien is attacking a community. The film centers on a core group, but then deviates to total strangers whenever it needs to have it kill someone.The scenes are dark and mostly shot at night. A lot of screaming in the dark type of stuff. Poor camera action to go along with the stiff dialogue.Parental Guide: F-bomb, no sex, shower nudity- An odd scene where a teen gets out of the shower to answer the phone where she says she would do nudity in a film.

As soon as the first song started, I go \\"Oh crap, not another hardcore band.\\" I just don't like that shouting singing style, at least done with such good music. There are other places the vocals are not so bad. Sometimes they kind of touch on the \\"alternative\\" vibe which I don't like either, but in other places not so much.What I really like is the varied music. It is quite interesting with lots of twists and turns. I read another review where the guy says the band basically cut and pasted this album together in the studio. Maybe so, but they did a pretty good job of it. They are all competent musicians and if I was not mistaken, I actually heard a decent guitar solo in there! It seems many of the new bands are anti-guitar solo but these guys don't shy away from it. Kudos for that.This is adventurous metal and I really like it, all except for the vocals.

The result of this sonic brinksmanship is usually sloppy guitar work, played through over-cranked amps with some guy vomiting out lyrics on the mic. A handful manage to rise to the top of the pack. Slayer out thrashed everyone; Pantera took gut-punch brutality to new levels of artistry, and then there's Mastodon.Unflinchingly unyielding in their intesity, yet they bring a level of musicianship and carefully honed artistry usually found in the realms of prog-rock. This album assaults the ears with Slayeresk ferocity, but entices your brain like Dream Theater. It's meaty, fast, furious, complex, and simply one of the best albums metal has seen in it's entire history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"I'm a big mastodon fan and expected something better than what they did on this album. I mean, these are just rehashed riffs that they have used before, only now they are rearranging them.

Mastodon truly has produced a masterpiece with Blood Mountain. he songs are brutal, sublime, sprawling, and psychedelic. Nobody sounds like Mastodon.

There has already been a band that has forged this ground long ago, \\"Thinking Man's Metal\\", and that was IRON MAIDEN. These guys cannot touch MAIDEN in their heyday. The music is good and they have talent, no doubt, but man, what happened to singing a song instead of gagging it. 2 stars for the guitars. Also, the drum fill-ins are cool the first 150 times, after that, it wears a little thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut And Paste","review":"Watching the creation of the music on the DVD showed me why this left me cold. It wasn't performed, rather it was assembled in the studio. As such, its an exercise in high-tech recording techniques and currently-fashionable metal stylings.

There is no hiding the conflict of life which Storlie is quick to point out.The guest appearances were also fun additions (Suzuki Roshi, Timothy Leary). By the end of the book, the reader still questions what the point of his story is. It seems like Storlie's journey is still in process.

Dr. Wolf rejects the need for punishment, but he also thinks its wrong to think that children should always be made happy and not have to do what they want (as is recomended in \\"Smart Love\\") The philosophy in Dr. Wolf's book is that you as a parent must be in charge but that harsh punishment simply is not necessary to get well behaved kids.

Yes, it is necessary to discipline children, but not by beating them.

His life was characterized by consistent compassion for others...even for sinners. His life's message is perverted in this book.Christ's teaching, in my opinion, can best be summarized by: Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

To whip the child until he is in complete submission as mentioned in the book, sounds like breaking this poor child's spirit to me. I think it's sad that we feel that we have to whip our children in order to bring them into obedience. God doesn't whip us does He?? I have heard the arguments about how it's to be done in love and so forth, but coming from a position of trying Dr.Dobson's method on my son (mildly), I found that my son was getting very aggresive...this from a boy who is the most loving kid I have ever seen.

This disturbing advice is a sure recipe for creating an anxious or even a depressed child. Parents should run from this book which claims to be for Christians, yet contains not one quote from the teachings of Jesus Christ. I have raised seven wonderful children and had no need to strike them or dominate them with fear and pain. Seeking parents should look elsewhere for good parenting instruction.

He speaks lovingly of having his legs switched by his mother, and though he protests that he does not believe in child abuse, it is difficult to understand where he draws that line. Also, be warned that the author emphasizes Christianity (and occasionally broadens it to the \\"judeo-Christian\\" heritage)often in the book as seemingly the only belief system that can provide the basis for an effective system of discipline. Non-Christians may find this idea offensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I wish I had one of these books when my sons were young.

Certainly corporal punishment can be abused, but that is not what Dr. Dobson is advocating. I am guessing that those giving this book 1 star are: a) not parents b) haven't read the book or c) have children that run all over them. Limited spanking is a tiny part of this book, the focus is on common sense discipline.If you want children that have tantrums in stores, roll their eyes at you at every opportunitity and end up resenting you trying to be their buddy rather than their parent, then leave this book on the shelf and read Hillary's treatise on child rearing instead(which is working so well with her oft soused daughter in England).

I have no doubt that Dobson's own parents were wildly insensitive people who had little true compassion for their child. (I suspect Dobson is so profoundly repressed that he will never feel his feelings about this.) I think Dobson' behavior as an author and media minister is one big act-out.I don't think Dobson's advice is \\"all bad,\\" but hitting and name-calling of your own children is a dreadful mistake.

I was very saddened by Dr. Dobson's approach, as he shares stories over and over again about humiliating children (name-calling \\"brat\\" \\"terror\\" \\"a butterball\\" etc.) in ways that I cannot truly believe is Christ-like. In one section of the book Dobson describes a mother shaking her 3 year old for spitting - yet shaking can cause brain damage and death, but Dobson doesn't comment on this. In addition, many of his statements contradict research which shows spanking increases aggression.

The ideas which it endorses, of physically attacking young children, shows a real lack of understanding of the sensitivity and complexity of human beings. The lack of understanding about how to teach children how to behave is extreme. Dobson focuses on using such force on tiny children which would bring him a jail sentence if used on a contemporary.

Since that would have gotten them good results, the only reason I can think of that they didn't use those methods always is that for some adults, when the child makes them angry, it just feels good to vent by hurting the child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"This is the worst book I've ever read. I only read it out ofcuriosity. The title itself is degrading to children. Dobson hasforgotten what it's like to live.

It was a very dangerous place. Lots of drugs and everything. But I had FUN. Thank God I didn't have parents who would've followed this drivel. Dobson promotes constant spanking and meaningless boundaries that restrict children from any sort of real freedom. Part of being young is being free of responsibility.

My parents did not spank me, I was expected to behave, but encouraged to be creative, empathetic, and stand up for what I believe in. Very anti-Dobson. Guess what, I am a happy well adjusted adult who looks at each day and each new sitaution optimistically. I guess I didn't realize how many people did not grow up like this.

Moreover, in the Discipline in Morality Chapter, The author spouts right wing rhetoric and completely undermines any good advice that was offered in the first half of the book.

The decision to structure the raising of my children has been absolutely essential to their growth. All of my children know they are greatly loved. The ability to discipline them with love and caring makes the love they feel even stronger. DO NOT believe those who try to make Dr. Dobson out as a person who over-emphasizes spanking.

I remember going to parenting teaching based on this and other of this author's books.Sadly, I implemented it in my family, believing that this kind of harshness was Biblical and beneficial to my children's future. Oh how many times I wish I could press the rewind button and do it all differently!As I look back now, I would have urge other parents to find alternative material, that is more balanced and far less harsh and controlling.

In Jesus' words, these are the false prophets. Dobson takes the thinking of a far-right, almost Fascist, political philosophy and cloaks it in Christian language. Anyone who takes seriously Jesus' Sermon on the Mount will immediately spot the fraudulence of Dobson's counsel.

(and yes, spanking IS hitting).One part that just makes me shudder with disbelief is where he insists that if a child cries \\"too long\\" after getting a spanking (which he warns should not be too gentle), then they are being defiant and should be spanked again (this time for defiantly crying).He is constantly name calling- he refers to children as \\"tyrants\\" \\"rebellious\\" \\"destructive\\" and others. He constantly makes children out as the enemy, that needs to be beaten.Please, do yourself and your child a favor and skip this one. There are a lot of other GREAT parenting books that do not suggest hitting a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible book of terrible advice","review":"Dobson, who exhibits no understanding in either religion or child psychology has written a book touting corporal punishment as a primary means of raising children. This in a day when our knowledge of child-rearing clearly shows that corporal punishment, while it may cow children into immediate obedience, is also a precursor of anti-social behavior. Children who have been beaten learn that \\"might makes right\\" and often become bullies on the playground and abusers in their marital relationships. The evidence is that today's abusers were punished with belt, fist, rod, and whip as children.Dobson has nothing useful to offer in this book. Neither his psychology, nor does his understanding of the bible teach a method of raising loving and caring Christian children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Dare To Discipline","review":"I find it interesting that the reviews aren't listed in such a way as to represent anything current, or present a balanced view of what readers think. Shame on Amazon for placing the worst reviews up front for people to read and making them \\"dig\\" for the good reviews. The first review is a single star, & written in 2003?! 5 years ago!! There are other good reviews written in the last month, but they aren't presented up front. What a shame. Dr. Dobson never promotes child abuse of any kind and never would. It's too bad that some children have to grow up in environments where their parents weren't able to use his advice in such a way that the child didn't benefit. However I can't believe that someone's entire abusive childhood can be blamed on a single book or two. Sounds like something was desperately wrong with the parents that isn't or wasn't obvious to the child at the time or even now. So sorry for all who had to grow up like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Child Abuse!","review":"I leafed through a copy of this book at a woman's house today and am SHOCKED that this book is even in print. Do the world a favor and buy a Sears and Sears book instead. This book literally made me sick to my stomach. I feel so sorry for all the children being raised by this book and for the parents who have fallen prey to this type of \\"advice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Frightening guy with frightening ideas","review":"I find it very interesting that so many people who like this book mention Jesus. Let me ask you where in the New Testament does it imply that Jesus would treat his children (if he had any) with anything but gentleness, love, and respect? ...Just because a parent doesn't spank or yell doesn't mean they don't discipline. Don't mix up the two. I certainly wouldn't want my children afraid of me like I was of my father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave my abusive Mom the excuse she needed to beat the tar out of me my whole life.","review":"These practices used on an adult are called assault and battery AND are illegal! My mom daily beat the snot out of me and degraded me. Loved to use the muscle pinching technique on me. Well guess who I don't see and who has seen my son only once...my Mom who loves Dr Dobson's Dare to Discipline. Want your kids to hate and fear you their ENTIRE lives, cause they will if you follow this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"The New Dare to Discipline","review":"The content of this book is appalling. The author has some severe problems from a spiritual and human viewpoint. Just the thought of advocating hitting children with hard objects like \\"the Rod\\" makes me sick, especially since I was raised in a non-violent home. I feel giving any attention to this book is a complete waste of a human beings time. I strongly to do NOT recommend this book to any parent in any place on this planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sickening to Read","review":"Please do not buy this book. Though supposedly based on Christian principles, this book repeatedly calls children degrading, horrible names and suggests that they are manipulating their parents when they cry and trying to make them miserable. Hitting an animal is illegal in most states, but this book suggests that it is okay to hit your child. I regard my children as smarter than the family dog, so I don't need to hit them to teach them. I am appalled that someone might think that hitting their kids is acceptable because they think it's a Christian way to parent. It's abusive, not at all the way God wants us to treat anyone, much less innocent kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Psychology, not enough Scripture","review":"Although I respect Dr. Dobson and his agenda, I have to say that I believe there is way too much psychology and not enough Scripture in his parenting advice. There are no \\"timeouts\\" in the Bible, nor is there the differentiation of willful disobedience and disobedience. ALL disobedience is willful!! So, it is either disobedience or a mistake. There is too much gray and not enough black and white. It is possible to have consistent discipline in a loving environment. Be encouraged that there is no need to make tons of excuses for our children's behavior. Simply address the heart issue, remove the foolishness, snuggle and love your children and they will desire to live lives that are pleasing to the Lord. Check out Ginger Plowman's book \\"Don't Make Me Count to Three\\" for a much more Bible based approach to reaching the hearts of our children through loving discipline."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just sad","review":"This book is just a sad justification for corporal punishment. All the other reviewers have said it eloquently enough, I just wanted to add my one star to the vote. If I could give no stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dare to Abuse","review":"This book is about how to abuse children when you are an impatient parent. Children need unconditional love and patience. Children can learn that the parent is ultimately the boss when the parent is patient enough to teach. I once waited for my son for 4 hours because he refused to do as he was told. We would not do it his way, we would do it my way or no way. He learned I could wait for him longer than he could wait for me to give up. That was not the last of his demanding his way, but it never was anywhere near that bad again.Want a quick fix? Use this book. Want a child who doesn't trust? Use this book. Want an excuse to hurt your parents for all the times they hurt you? Use this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure terroristic crap","review":"I read this book and then needed to take a shower. He hates kids. He says he loves them but then advocates beating them again and again and again, all in 'love' of course.He should read 13 corinthians a few times and stop pandering to those too damaged to know any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence Begets Violence","review":"Dobson has it wrong. Children's susceptibility to God and the attributes of God has to do with rearing them with the love of God in their hearts from the beginning, praying and relying on God, and being taught to please God. Violence begets violence. To spank and be violent toward children is proof of the perpetrator's ignorance of modern scientific evidence that spanking is detrimental to the emotional, physical and spiritual evolution of children. Ignorance begets ignorance, and if you're in charge of children, feeding your mind with ignorance is no benefit to your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can immediately apply these principles for good results.","review":"My wife bought this book at a time when I felt like my 3-year-old was taking charge of me. I was skeptical -- all I knew of Dr. Dobson was his interviewing of that serial killer who claimed that pornography played a role in his violence, and I didn't think that link was made clearly enough for Dobson to draw his conclusions. But indeed, Dobson has written a practical, thoughtful, and effective guide. Not only has it helped me regain calm composure and even hand with my young ones, it has given me insight into ways to help build my sons' characters for the long term. Bravo, Dr. Dobson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent child rearing begets angry and revengeful children","review":"As a society, we reap what we sow: Violence begets more violence, as well as a host of other problems. Thirty years of research has consistently found that corporal punishment in all forms increases the risk for anger and aggressiveness in children. Corporal punishment also has been found to increase the risk for many physical, psychological, sexual and social problems, including:Physical injuryEscalation to legally defined physical abuseSexual abusePost Traumatic Stress DisorderDepressive DisorderPoor self esteemSuicidal IdeationJuvenile aggression and violenceSibling violenceDomestic violence in adulthood towards own partner and childrenSadomasochistic paraphilias (fetishes)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Dare to Discipline","review":"After getting this book in the mail one afternoon, I spent the following 2 hours reading it.

Fully recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAre to discipline","review":"I was almost as bad a disciplinarian as my mother but this book has taught me that it is possible ti discipline that works and is done in love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent advice from Dobson","review":"I have always been a fan of Dr. Dobson and his parenting advice. This book, an updated version of his previous work, encourages parents to be just that-parents-and that discipline is not a dirty word. In a world where parents have been told to be their children's friends, Dobson reminds parents that they have an important job to do raising their children, and that discipline is not cruel. The word itself means \\"to teach\\" and most children learn through consequences. It is well written and thorough, and challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"A kid says no stars!!!!","review":"This book is so terrible. I wonder why Amazon even sells it, because it recommends hitting little children, even babies only 18 months old! We children are not defiant spitfires like this book says. Children have feelings and are human beings. If it's not OK to hit an adult it's not OK to hit a little kid. And where can a little kid go to get away from being hit? It's not like we can go out and rent an apartment you know. Maybe adults should just get used to the idea that young people won't always agree with them, and maybe they have good reasons, and should be listened to. Anyway don't buy this book it's not full of Christian kindness."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book made me hate my childhood","review":"I grew up surrounded by Dobson-ideology; not only did my mother read 'Dare to Discipline' and 'The Strong-Willed Child', she kept them by the paddle in the pantry. I've read the books myself, now that I'm an adult, and see them as psychology-shrouded justifications for violent people to exercise their angst on their smaller, defenseless children. I'm afraid to be a parent. I don't know how to be a good one, and it's mostly due to this book and its dangerously self-righteous author. He doesn't understand how far his sugar-coated words can be carried, or how many people he's unwittingly hurt by way of all those royalty checks. Please, please don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should be sending Dobson my therapy bills","review":"If you want to render your kids deeply unhappy, confused, and fearful of you and the world, this will do it. ...The application of Dobson's techniques and outlook by unthinking, unreflective adults who sincerely thought they were doing their best for me wrecked my relationship with them, my confidence, and my sense of inner well-being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply wrong.","review":"Use your logical brain before you follow the advice in this book. Studies repeatedly show that more than 90% of Americans spank their children, but Dobson argues that it is the lack of spanking that is cause of our societal ills.If almost everyone is spanking, and according to Dobson, society is near collapse, then how is it that spanking is the cure? It seems rather obvious that, at best, spanking is ineffective.Dobson wants to claim that if more people were disciplinarians, things would be better, but his argument falls flat because most Americans already follow his advice and it isn't working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this how Jesus would do it?","review":"This book is very disturbing. The author clearly doesn't like children. He is so focused on labeling children as selfish, demanding, defiant, bratty, rebels that he forgets to consider respect and love. The bible tells us to 'do to others as you would have them do to you.' I am pretty sure that Jesus didn't go around smacking people in order to train them into submission. Dobson turns parenting into a contest of wills. Dobson's mother once whipped him with a girdle and he says that it made him feel loved. Come on! It is extremely upsetting that this book is even in print, but to think that he makes these statements and then passes them off as God's Instructions makes me very very sad. Consider reading How Would Jesus Raise a Child by Theresa Whitehurst instead. Your children will someday thank you and so will all who come in contact with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Deadly Arrangement (Feng Shui Mysteries)","review":"I loved this book. It was such fun to read a book about a character that thinks and operates like I do. As a feng shui practitioner thinking and seeing things from the feng shui aspect is automatic. I only marked the book down because I found way to many homonyms. One or two I can overlook but there were many in this book and careful editing would have caught them, spell check will not.

Too \\"gray\\", meaning no \\"light\\", in the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good literature.","review":"I liked Yate's novel \\"Revolutionary Road\\" very much, but found Easter Parade disappointing. Lots happens in a short book, and Yates exhibits the clean, simple prose style of a good crime writer. Looking back, at the end of the novel, I was touched by all the fruitless effort Emily Grimes had put into establishing a satisfying long term relationship, only to be thwarted by the limitations of the men in her life. Yet Yates is really writing about people, not making them come alive as well developed characters. When Emily turns her back on her sister, which should be a major event, it is almost casually dismissed. \\"The Easter Parade\\" is readable, but it is not good literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Premise But A Disappointing Result","review":"Richard Yates is one of those authors who seem to have fallen off the radar screen. In fact, I only came to this book because it was a selection of one of my online book clubs. While family dysfunction has proven the grist for many a great book, this is not one of them. The main problem is simple: the author doesn't seem to have any interest in or -- perhaps even worse -- any real talent for exploring the inner lives of his characters. This is particularly troublesome here because Yates chooses to focus on the lives of two sisters. This is not to say that male authors cannot succeed in plumbing the psyches of female characters (Ian McEwan's astounding \\"Atonement\\" springs to mind), but Yates' refusal to go beyond the surface results in an uncomfortable -- almost prurient -- focus on their sex lives. About the only positive thing I can say about The Easter Parade is that -- given the spareness of Yates' prose -- it reads quite quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minimal Realism at its Best!","review":"Here we have a less known great author whose every word, every sentence, is packed with meaning and art. Mr. Yates must be the Flaubert of 20th Century writers in his near perfectly written and readable books. This one has about everything.The two sisters of the divorced parents grow up under this cloud of parental dissolution, but by late adolescence seem on their way to happiness and security. The older marries of the British \\"Boy Next Door\\" (Actually upstairs), the younger is awarded a full scholarship to Barnard, no mean feat. With excursions throughout the NYC area,including a visit to the father's newspaper building, the village,etc. we slowly see how these lives deteriorate into a bad marriage, and too many sad relationships. Maybe a bit gloomy, but not without its humor, including a very odd women's group, this is a very breezy and easy read, with more insights than you can usually find in a much longer family saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Easter Parade","review":"\\"The Easter Parade\\" may be the best book you've never heard of before. It's a novel about the Grimes sisters and the way their parents' divorce hangs over their unhappy lives.

Its relatively short and full of great myths and stories dealing with the etymology of hundreds of words we use every day.For example, the common breakfast cereal comes from the Roman god Ceres - goddess of agriculture and grains.The word 'tantalizing' comes from the Greek mythological character Tantalus, a wicked man who was condemned to stare at food and drink that was just out of his reach, for eternity.The book is filled with tons of such stories and fables and is a pleasure to read. Its also not only ROman and Greek mythologies, but African, Norse, Aztec, Chinese and other myths that are mentioned. For example the term 'mumbo jumbo' comes from Senegal, where local priests chased away the evil spirit of Mamba Diambo by yelling and screaming non-sense to frighten the spirit.Great read for anyone who loves myths, etymology and just wants to understand how our language was shaped by history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it for $.01","review":"Exposed was OK ... too slick for me.Carved cuts it up.Do yourself a favor, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would so give this a 5 Star Review only for the fact that this is not the Imported Reissue that Amazon says it is.","review":"I ordered this CD via through Amazon thinking that it was the reissue with the Bonus Track of 25 or 6 to 4.As it states in the information reguarding this CD.

First, this is NOT a metal album, it is a techno dance music, sound effects heavy, guitar deficient, mess. This sound NOTHING like Motley or the \\"You're Invited\\" album which I like. This is a major disappointment and embarrasment. Second, you cant understand the few lyrics that are here, and when the band is the singer's name, this aint a good thing. Anyone could have done this techno album with enough computers and sound effects. Third, this album just plain sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard pellets","review":"These are the standard pellets for competition and marksmanship with airguns. I used these in high school JROTC. They do their job well and punch a perfect circle in the target like a hole punch. These pelets can be as good as \\"hollow points\\" on other targets as well because they are flat tipped. These pellets have great stopping power for lower power (<1000fps) .177mm guns. They can still punch holes in wood at 600fps making them ideal for plinking or rodent control."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title should be 'Understanding Fuel Injection'","review":"I have read this book thoroughly. Although it gave me a great understanding of how TPI works, it doesn't address any of the problems you WILL run into when converting your earlier model Chevy, like my 84 ElCamino. The 50 page troubleshooting guide seems to be straight out of the GM manual.

It totally misses the boat on all the problems of installation and modifications required to swap or add TPI injection to a non TPI engine.For instance There are no reviews or advice on different wiring methods. Nothing much on after market fuel pumps, nothing on cable mods.,nothing on air conditioning compressor/alternator relocation brackets,nothing on converting a mass air flow system to a speed density system. If you are a street rodder or a hot rodder this book will offer you little to nothing in your quest to add TPI to your car.Don't waste your hard earned dollars here."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a waste of money for TPI swapping","review":"If you are looking for guidance on swapping a TPI system this isn't the book for you. It is only a very general overview of the GM TPI systems. It looks like the author trolled through the available GM literature and picked up bits here and there. Most of the information is readily available on the Internet. There is no index, so finding specific topics is difficult. Half the book is devoted to the standard error codes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some what helpful","review":"This book is good for someone that has no idea of what they are doing.

It was very appropriate because I wasn't sure if I wanted to be a priest, but with a fuller understanding of what I will be doing this book certainly helped me with my vocation.Eugene magnificently traces the origins of the Last Supper and of the current Catholic Sacrament of the Eucharist to all of the meals found within Luke's Gospel, from informal meals with lower class citizens to theological discussions with Pharisees.I would certainly recommend this book to every man who is discerning his vocation to perform the Sacraments, but this is a great aid to every Catholic to understand what goes on every Sunday."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLS and other carcinogens, seriously????","review":"I've just been disillusioned... I used Mustela products since my baby was born, no even before, during pregnancy, and all this time I thought they were natural. Yeah right... LOOK AT THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS! It contains Sodium Laureth Sulfate, and 1,4-dioxane.Mustela website provides information about ingredients. They do state that their products contain certain chemicals in small amounts etc. So, on one hand, they are open about it, but on the other hand, they market their products as natural.I am seriously upset by it.

Four were issued on Okeh and five on Brunswick, and Crosby collectors know most of them well enough, from the original recordings and numerous reissues. Moreover it's stretching a point to argue, as James Ritz does in his liner note, that \\"it's sadly forgotten that Crosby was amongst America's first great jazz singers\\". Many of these sides have been reissued relatively recently (particularly on Affinity's 1992 compilation \\"The Jazzin' Bing Crosby\\", which offers 48 sides as opposed to the 35 on offer here).

While the authors provide a few case histories of brands that have succeeded by relying on the (unpredictable direction) of the PR process, there are literally hundreds of examples that contradict their premise. Save your money, read the other books that show on the list when you search for this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"insight into using public relations","review":"The Ries's really knock ad agencies and advertising in general to make their point... one also gets a sense that they aren't happy that some clients did not listen to them.Definitely a worthwhile read for any one interested in marketing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate resposibility of advertising IS PR","review":"In the surmountable aspect of Public Relation, no other device is poorly used, yet has the potential for greatness than Advertising. Advertising is, in all points of fairness, an extenstion of Public Relation... a broad yet clear message of what the company is, what the company sells, and what the company can offer you.For these schmucks to ever think that advertising is not an extension of PR, or to think that it is not useful and \\"dead\\", shows how much they actually know about the business of Marketing. Advertising is a model vehicle for brand recognition, brand strength, and brand longetivity.Any \\"advice\\" in this book is ultimately a reflection of their own personal greed... of course they want you to think advertising is dead and that PR is king.. because they are in the PR business.Do not buy this book... it will be a waste of your valuable time, and it will ultimately doom you to failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regurgitated material. Save your money.","review":"This book is yet another example of symbolism over substance. The book follows a long line of books by marketing dinosaurs (e.g. Scott Davis, David Aaker, Al Ries, Tom Peters) who are on the downslope of their careers. The common thread between these books is this: it is the same material recycled, rewritten and regurgitated with the respective authors' own style of spin. The content isn't new, isn't innovative, isn't anything other than re-purposed content.Who doesn't know that advetising doesn't work? Really? Thanks, Al for repeating something that anyone remotely exposed to marketing knows. This book killed, unnecessarily, a lot of trees.Save your money. Unless, of course, you are a corporate lemming who works for a large corporation; who was just moved from finance to marketing and don't know a thing about marketing, this book might be for you. You won't know any better anyway. However, common sense will tell you that this book is a lot of fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all practical","review":"While some of the information is indeed interesting and a fresh look at the communication industry, I can hardly believe that the authors find themseves with work.One example: They were contacted by the government of Guatamala. Having done some preliminary research, the authors exclaimed that they could not do the job unless the country changed their name to \\"Guatamaya\\" to clearly identify the historical signifigance of the Mayan tribe. Yes...that is right, they wanted a country to change their name. That is all they came up with, all they were willing to do. This theme comes up numerous times throughout the book as they demand products and companies (and countries) change their names so they can better market themselves.Apparantly, brand equity (and the decency to not confuse consumers) does not factor into the authors' plans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Lame book by father and daughter","review":"wow--talk about an insult to my intelligence. they really should try and research their books, provide footnotes for accountability. i am amazed that these books continue to get published. al should have quit after positioning.all of the other reviews on this board confirm my belief--you will learn NOTHING from this 2 pound business card/brochure for their PR services."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes an ad guru to say it!","review":"I am a 10-year veteran of NYC top public relations agencies and found it no less than ironic that it takes an ad guru to point out the value and significant role that marketing public relations should have in marketing strategies. Beyond the title, the book puts forth excellent provable arguments. It gives plenty of examples, maybe a little too many, but the point that advertising lacks crucial credibility and many times serves as entertainment only is loud, clear, and about time. Sheer common sense should send up a BIG RED FLAG for exactly these reasons, not to mention the exorbitant costs of advertising (i.e., art). This book is specific to marketing public relations, not public affairs, corporate communications, investor relations, etc., and is an excellent read and tool to help agency execs communicate their value to clients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Interesting","review":"Some of it is true... PR's wax and advertising's wane. But there's not enough insight, strategic or tactical information to make this book a valuable tool for anyone who accepts the hypothesis and now wants to know what to do about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept ...but","review":"Interesting as a concept; however, the unreasonably \\"passionate\\" attack on advertising, using fragile -easy to reverse- arguments, makes you doubt about its credibility.This very subject, approached, explored, and presented in a different way, could have resulted in a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Procative? I'll say!","review":"This highly readable, insightful book should be mandatory reading for anyone involved in deciding where any company's marketing bucks are spent. The authors speak some serious truths about advertising and how it is misused and overused and about public relations and how it is under-used. Of course, as a former PR consultant, I perhaps am biased. However, the numerous examples the Reises cite are hard to argue with. Ignore this book at your own peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"PR's Where It's At","review":"Ries talks about how important PR is, how it's more important than advertising because PR's got credibility. Discusses campaigns, but not as much on tactics small companies can use. For that, Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired can give you lots of useful advice. Ries's Fall of Advertising is a good read, but it's a bit weak on good ideas if you don't have much money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about a new business ploy","review":"I work in advertising and I can honestly say I've always been open to the other \\"arms\\" of marketing, including the power of PR, so I was very open to hearing what Mr. Ries and Co. had to say. However, as I read this I couldn't help but laugh at the obvious animosity towards advertising and advertiisng agencies in general. The book is chalk full of half-baked case studies that just scratch the surface of a brand's marketing history. What's more, the book feels like it is jumping on the recent bandwagon of the advertising-bashing we've recenlty seen in a slumping economy thanks in part to ill-informed journalists. I stopped reading this book half way through as it become obvious this was a new business ploy for Ries' company and not an objective nor an informative read on what PR can specifically do to help grow a brand.

Everything said about this story could have been said in one chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"The projects in the book all center around a single XML structure, planets in the Solar System. Althought the structure is easy to understand, it does not illustrate other more real world problems, so this book is not useful as a cookbook or idea book.Secondly, the examples show the application of xslt in a simplistic and difficult to understand manner that falls short of the requirements of a reference. It also fails as a reference due to poor organization, poor index, and lack of comprehensive coverage.Finally, I feel that the author moves too quickly and fails to illustrate complex concepts well enough for this book to be used as a primer.Overall, I have found this book to be frustrating to use and would recommend that buyers save their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really helpful!","review":"The previous two reviews cover the detail...I will only add to them. I've looked through several XSLT books at length, and this one is by far the best. One of the aspects I like about the book is that it uses the same XML document throught. Various XSLT Transforms are preformed on the document and they systematically build in complexity and scope of features. The transforms start out very simple and progress at a comfortable pace. I'm very happy with it. Steven Holzner has become one of my favorite authors overnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the first Ajax books","review":"This book is one of the first books mentioning MSXML and the XmlHttpRequest object. I am happy that I bought this book in 2003. I wrote stunning web controls with MSXML for MS IE.

The book is great with lots of examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to start with..","review":"This is a good book to start with but definitely not the \\"all in one\\" XSLT book.I would suggest to start XSLT with this book and then read \\"Learning XSLT\\" as well as \\"XSLT cookbook\\".That combination would make you an expert in a couple of days.This book follows the example of planets.xml and uses it consistently, but the example gets boring after a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"His earlier work is far superior.","review":"Far too sappy. Vastly overproduced. Where is the rawness and fire of the earlier days? A tremendous dissapointment. The only good thing about it is I don't own it.

I personally did not find it all that exciting, only because there was no good goal or reason for playing. I prefer puzzle games. You do unlock more dishes, but it was not quite to my taste. That being said, my children are absolutely fascinated by it. My daughter is now convinced that if I let her have free reign of the kitchen, she could cook anything, and my sons love to watch. It is also a hit when friends come over to visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"my 10 year grandaughter asked for this game and loves it. she loves to cook and this teaches ways to creat different dishes, fun game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Idea...Poor Execution","review":"I thought that cooking on my DS was going to be great. And it was for...the first 10 minutes. There just aren't enough variations to keep you interested for long. Chopping onion and cutting up potato is the exact same motion...Just like measuring rice and measuring water is the same. There weren't that many different dishes to make. So if you can already cook...stay in the kitchen. If you have no idea how to cook and are afraid to touch raw meat, then maybe you should try this before attempting the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and do not recommend","review":"I purchased this game based on recommendations from friends and on-site reviews. My 7 year-old daugther has cried on numerous occasions playing this game because the feedback from the game is very negative. It basically makes \\"YOU FAILED\\" type statements as opposed to \\"GOOD TRY - TRY AGAIN.\\" I have taken this game away from my daughter. I do NOT recommend this game to any child."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a cute concept","review":"Cooking Mama is a game where you basically choose which dish you want to make and take you through the process step by step. You can chop, slice, dice, peel, mold the dough, decorate your plate, etc...It's a pretty creative concept, but it gets pretty boring if you play too much at once. It's fun if you play maybe twice a day and seperate the times, because it will get pretty repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After all the wonderful reviews, I decided to try Cooking Mama out. It didn't last long; I played it for about five minutes and proceeded to forget about it for a week before trading it it for Yoshi's Island DS.Visually, there's really nothing \\"wrong\\" with the game; the graphics are great. The controls, though, are clunky and counterintuitive. It seems to take forever to learn how to do some of the techniques, and by the time I practiced enough to learn how to do it for real, I had lost interest and tried to move on to nothing else.But that's the worst part of the game; there is nothing else. The minigames are as dry as the rest of the game, and there's really nothing else to scream about.If you're huge into anime style graphics and games that make heavy use of the stylus, buy this game by all means. Just don't be surprised when it bores the life out of you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Fun for ALL!!","review":"I loved this game! Not only can I play it easily, the controls are basic enough for my 5 year old to have a great time. She even beats me at the game. We play this as a family and have tons of fun. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a video game novice as it is not really difficult to master"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST DS GAME!!!!","review":"Bought cooking Mama for my 5 year old dughter to go along with her new DS system. This is by far her favorite game! Some of the new games we bought her are a bit difficult and require lots of reading, which she is just beginning to do. This game is easy for her to handle and requires easy, minimal reading or in some spots none at all - she wants to help me in the kitchen all the time now. She was telling me the other day the best was to cook and cut an artichoke! My 7 year old son even wants to borrow this game - very fun - HIGHLY recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 7 year old","review":"One of the first games we bought when our 7 year old received her DS.

I even played once in a while with her. Something about it that isn't very good, is that you beat the whole game in about a few months.

The whole album is solid you will not skip a track on this cd. Of course the breakout single \\"Hey man nice shot\\" got the radio play but there are so many other gems on this album ex: Dose, Under, Take another,. Robert Patrick has such a distinctive sound in his voice he goes from low pitch to high very well. I just want to mention in regards to the other reviewers Filter does not sound anything like NIN in the least bit. The album came out in 95 and is still relevent today I always go back often and put this in my car stereo for it had a sound unlike any other that time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theres something about this cd...","review":"The AMazon review is spot on when they commented this cd by Filter was a guilty pleasure. On first listen, it sounds like a lot of other music already circulating the scene. Yet it just sticks in your mind and theres a few stand out tracks, \\"hey man nice shot\\" and \\"Dose\\" among them. Far be it form me to cirticse, the last track \\"so Cool\\" is probably the worst, with lyrics that could make you cringe. Other than that, if your in the mood for something angry and something to inject some sort of testosterone feeling into your brain, this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least track one is excellent","review":"I came to this CD looking for...a good CD. I found a good song. Unfortunately, everyone has heard the song before. Yes, the song I'm talking about is \\"Hey Man, Nice shot.\\" The two stars above are for this song only. The rest of the CD is followed by 10 butchered versions of the first song. Seriously, though, Filter reuses some of the highlights of that track in the other songs in painfully noticeable ways. It seems as though Filter had one great idea (track 1) and tried to stretch it for all its worth. I afraid I can't recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"this album is great","review":"People say that filter is a rip off of nine inch nails. But i believe that filter evolves beyond nin weird music. I find that they copying nirvana's style. I'm not a music expert but I don't find filter either weird or poppy like most 90's group. They seem to be on the right track. good luck to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd","review":"Anyone who has ever given this cd a bad rating has obviously been listening to too much Hanson, and the Backstreet Boys. Breaking away from the mold of poppy guitar rock of the 90's, this album is one of the only good musical things to come from the earlier part of the decade. But that said, this cd has some of the best guitar, and drum programming work of the metal/industrial scene as of yet. Love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs but nothing original.","review":"I absolutely love \\"Hey man, nice shot\\", and as a matter of fact it's one of my 10 favorite songs of all time. Unfortunately after opening with that song the rest of the disc leaves you hanging, waiting for another song of the like, no such luck. Although coming close to greatness on a couple of tracks, it falls far short of my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm","review":"Well, this is a pretty good CD. But! There are a couple of things that really detract from it. First is the feel that its all been done before (and not just by NIN). This really makes the whole album seem tired and boring. And, sadly, all the songs sound the same and are not individual from each other. This is a decent album, but its really not worth it because it's quite boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"damn, dude!","review":"I love Filter and have all their stuff. I will probably always keep Short Bus, but only to study it not to enjoy it. The entire album sounds like a demo disc. Every time I listen to it I get the same feeling and it's one of stagnation. Besides the first track all the songs sound too similar. That can be ok but only in moderation. I feel like I'm being generous by giving it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated and not consistently great","review":"I'll admit that this album has a couple shining moments, Hey Man Nice Shot is not one of them though despite its radio time. I feel that Dose is an extremely good song and I'd give this cd a 5 if all of them were as good. However, hardly any others are any good and it keeps getting worse as the cd progresses. The cd can hardly be dubbed industrial in my book, it is mainly alternative metal and reminds me of a weaker version of tool. Another complaint is that the lyrics are not thought out well at all except for the first couple tracks. Stuck In Here is a prime example of bad rhimes and low vocab. along w/ the fact that most songs have little emotion or atmosphere. Listening to this paints no image in my mind of any sort. I'd recommend Gravity Kills,or Stabbing Westward. They are way more inovative and convey a darker, more atmosperic feel"},{"rating":"2","title":"take another piece of filter","review":"short bus was a classic in the making. title of record was a downfall in the filter good music work. dose is good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good...","review":"It's maybe closer to 2 1/2 stars, but I docked it a half point because of something I'll explain in a second. I like \\"Title of Record\\" much better... there are more good songs, and they aren't so \\"white noise\\"-ish. I would give \\"Title...\\" 4 stars, rather than the 2 I give this. First off, to the reviewer directly below mine; Maybe Godsmack did rip off the bass riff from \\"Hey Man Nice Shot\\", but Filter ripped it from Stabbing Westward's \\"Ungod\\" (or they 'borrowed' it with permission from Stuart Zechman; either way, it isn't Filter's). THAT is the reason I give it 2; I bought this CD for \\"Hey Man Nice Shot\\" (I should consider myself lucky I got it used), but once I got SW's \\"Ungod\\" (which is AWESOME, a 5 IMO), it became redundant, and rather pointless to have. Short Bus has a FEW other OK songs, but not enough. And the best one with the awesome riff isn't even really theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"FILTERED\\" OUT THE GOOD STUFF.","review":"Well, this is just not a good album.

You should it, because it rocks the house."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Effort In Hard Techno","review":"Filter gives us a tour in hard rocking techno, similar to Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, some creative effects that echo Kraftwerk, and overall creepiness that tends to leave us feeling weird, yet appreciative. \\"Hey Man, Nice Shot\\" starts the album out with a heavy monotoneous flanged bass lick and keeps moving with a slow beat, and lyrics from Richard Patrick that are scary, but cool. \\"Dose\\" is just as effective and so is \\"Gerbil.\\" The album is excellent, but some of the tunes sound the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"god this is really good.","review":"Don't believe any reviews that say this is a bad CD. The songs rock and so does the singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"Filter's 1995 debut album, Short Bus, is a fine example of industrial rock (although Richard Patrick doesn't like the term) at its best. I find the criticism Rich has received regarding Filter's similarities to Nine Inch Nails to be absurd. I am a fan of both Filter and NIN and they are both very different. Trent Reznor relies heavily on electrical methods (which I do not condone at all), whereas Rich's music is a lot more rock-based. \\"Hey Man Nice Shot\\" is the song that stands out after the first listen (partly due to the fact that its the first track), but repeated indulgence reveals the raw skills of Patrick and Brian Liesegang (the other main musical contributor to the album). The gritty music and Patrick's often lazy vocals add to the album's edge, the former being highlighted in \\"Under\\" and the latter in \\"Stuck In Here\\" and \\"So Cool\\". A must-buy for people with ears."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST-HAVE","review":"This is one solid piece of music. The former NIN guitarist can do a lot on his own. SHORT BUS is better than Filter's second release, TITLE OF RECORD. Their hit, \\"Hey Man Nice Shot\\" is one of the best industrial songs ever written (Did anyone else notice that Godsmack stole the bass line from that song to create their hit \\"Keep Away\\"?). If you like industrial music (NIN, Ministry, KMFDM), you have no choice but to buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its like a glob of clay...no definate shape","review":"The main part of the album is the same old screaming and power chords. Like clay, for the most part its formless. I mean, the first five aongs are okay, but after that its just the same old some old. i hope you agreee, filter has seen much better days.

It is a pitiful history written by a very bitter man, filled with inacurasies, slander and just plain lies. It is so incredibly innacurate I began to doubt if the writer even got his name right. Reese is an incredibly bitter man who has never forgiven the people who staid behind after he left. This is his revenge on them. He claims he \\"built\\" CNN, well.. he may have built the building.. but the people who have been working there the last 19 years after he left are the ones who really \\"Built\\" CNN. It is an excellent read if you enjoy page after page of pure self-indulgent tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great account of what went into CNN","review":"Overall I enjoyed this book a lot, there were many great behind-the-scenes stories that were quite intriguing. The only flaw is that the author uses the book to take a jab at Ted and pat himself on the back. But, he makes no qualms about that in the book's introduction. But, I can't really blame Reese. If I worked as hard as he did creating this network and nobody knows who he is, I'd be rather bitter too.Still, a very good read - I would recommend to anyone in the media."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Reading!","review":"What an exciting account!

Second, the tube does not work that great even after I reviewed the You Tube video demo. in the end the tube does not hold up to the banging on the ground to get the spore onto the grass.

Rent the Prince of Egypt, the Passion, or Ben Hur, but do not see this extremely pathetic impersonation of Moses. You are going to be disappointed. It is a disgraceful impersonation of Moses. There is no passion. Couldn't even finish watching it. Spare yourself from this grotesquely awful movie. I love Christian movies and movies about the bible. But I hated this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie for Family","review":"This is an excellent re-telling of the Bible's Exodus. Vivid animation, color and captivating storyline that kids will just love it. The voice cast is strong and the music is excellent.The story follows the Bible closely with scary scene tastefully done up. A good resource to introduce bible stories to kids, sunday school, etc. A MUST for any Church Sunday School Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another positive account of Moses","review":"This is one of the most frequently told stories from the Old Testament. This version does a credible job of presenting the biblical account. The dramatic license taken for dramatic purposes does nothing to contravene the biblical history. The voice casting was pretty good.The reason I only gave it four stars was for purely technical causes. The 3D animation, not Claymation as incorrectly noted in another review, was clearly done on a limited budget. It looked more like a video game than much of the contemporary animation. For overall production values I would recommendThe Prince of Egypt. And the best work both artistically and biblically isThe Miracle Maker - Special Edition.Having said this, I too would recommend this for anyone interested in a reasonably accurate presentation of the account of Moses and the birth of Israel. This is especially apropos at the time I'm writing this, the time of the Passover, 2008."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for","review":"There is little reason for this movie to exist. The Prince of Egypt is a fantastic movie, even if it makes a few story changes from the biblical account. It ends after crossing the Red Sea, and this movie goes until the arrival at the promised land, but it is so poorly made that after seeing The Prince of Egypt, you can't bear to watch this. Another reviewer calls it \\"claymation\\". If only. It's very cheap computer animation, looking like something from one of those CD-ROMs for kids that came out in the 90s, or a Nintendo 64 video game. And the writing and voice acting are equally poor. I really can't believe that the famous actors listed in the credits were really part of this production. It looks every bit as cheap as the selling price would suggest. You have little to lose in buying it, but don't expect much."},{"rating":"1","title":"YUCK","review":"I am so disappointed to say that this movie was horrible. The story line at first tries to mimic THe Prince of Egypt to get the story going and then actually does follow a lot of the Bible story but it is aestictically unappetizing. The animation is annoying. I just really wanted my children to see the full story, as the Prince of Egypt leaves out Awesome parts of the story of Moses.

Good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"good Bible video for fourth grade students","review":"I ordered this video for our fourth grade CCD class, as they are spending the year learning about the Old Testament and how the stories and the prophecies are ultimately fulfilled in the New.

There's a lot of humour, and of course some incredibly beautiful scenery.

She was so cute, the archetypical Warner Bros. babe!I missed out on the LPs the first time around, and collected them all in the 70s. Her fresh, crisp & cool delivery was like a Malibu breeze. No hint of cigarettes & brandy in her style! She had radio hits a la Connie Francis, but her LPs were strictly swinging jazz. \\"For Those Who Think Young\\" features a studio session with the great Marty Paich, and a live set with a Bob Florence combo - both first rate. Joanie still sounds just as fabulous 40 years later, and this is a wonderful place to discover her terrific singing style, even though all the discs are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joanie: Big Band Dynamite","review":"\\"For Those Who Think Young\\" proves that Joanie Sommers was and is a dynamite big band jazz singer, one who makes musicians stand and cheer after she knocks the roof off. Sell chart-topping popular singles she will. Sell out popular jazz venues she will. In this album she is the ultimate headliner in total command all the way. For starters, \\"Blues In the Night\\", a driving big band honky tonk, finds her belting Mercer's lyrics to the moon and back. She follows up in the same way with a rocking original \\"Hard Hearted Hannah\\". \\"Out of this World\\" is reflective of her deft, precise jazz timing. The jazz ballads \\"My Ship\\", \\"Round Midnight\\", and \\"Why Shouldn't I?\\" are gorgeously executed. Of course, the arrangements of Mr. Marty Paich are first class, and provide Joanie a perfect backdrop for her original and creative phrasing.

True it does retract the plug so that it will not bend or break off (and how often has anyone had that happen except when trying to remove it from a computer?) but IMHO the major 'risk' to the plug is for foreign materials to get into the plug and clog it up. Remember, that's why the cap was put there in the first place, to prevent pen tips, paper scraps and other briefcase or pocket debris from getting into the plug. Retracting the plug still leave it open to debris and other foreign materials such as liquids since the end is still open to air. I'd rather just cover the tip with the plastic cap which protects it just as well from bending and prevents foreign materials from getting stuck in the plug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Problems","review":"It's just a storage device.

I have to unplug and plug back in the drive until it gets recognized (happens @ home, school, Kinkos, Staples, etc.) Also the software is fairly useless and it gets in the way and slows work time. If the information you're saving is important I recommend using another brand. I have to buy a different drive and back-up constantly since I feel I am taking a risk whenever I use this device.Also, as stated in many other reviews, the user has no choice regarding the software of the device. It will load onto your computer everytime you plug it in. The practicality of the software depends on if I want to spend extra money: Do I want to use the Skype applications? I need to purchase a subscription. Game applications? Photosmart? AntiVirus?

So, when I wanted a flash drive for storing and moving photos from my camera to my laptop or my PC, the cruzer was a logical choice. Big mistake. First the retractable port is an idea whose time has not come. It retracts as one is trying to shove it into the computer's slot--really clumsy and awkward. Obvioulsy one is supposed to hold down the little sliding part but that's not easy to do, and certainly not intuitive. Getting the stick out of the computer is no piece of cake either, it's very very tight, and I worry about damaging the computer. Once it's in, possible error messages and pop-ups questioning my set-up are gratuitous; everything is just fine--copy the damned file, already!!

I copied a 207 MB XAMPP folder to the drive which took over 40 minutes and required over 420 MB of space on the drive. Copying the same folder to an external USB hard drive took only 4 minutes and 209 MB of space. So the SanDisk drive is 10 times slower and has more than 100% overhead in this case.

Of course there is a love story tie-in, but the twist is really fun. I have to admit, I was surprised with that twist. This is currently one of my favorite movies, and not because Zac Efron is in it.

Subtle moments of direction and photography from Burr Steers. Cool songs throughout underscore feeling in the viewer from the likes of Electric Owls, Ramones, Andrew Bird and Pink Mountaintops supported by a superb melodic score from Rolfe Kent. A magical, MAGICAL, allegory comparing the sailing setting against Charlie's home setting as a metaphor for life, dreams and the choices we must ultimately make.

They don't have nearly as much effect when they're used in just about every sentence in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Jake O'Hara yet","review":"Jake O'Hara's mother Maura witnesses a priest's murder while in the confessional. It seems to be related to a South American drug lord, but noone is sure. Jake is having strange dreams about being murdered. Then at the memorial service for a dead ghostwriter, Jake feels a strange connection to a woman who was murdered the day she was born. Strangely enough all of these mysteries are connected as well as being connected with several rich and powerful Washington bigwigs. With the help of the ghosts and Dennis Kim, Jake, Gypsy Rose and Maura solve the 34 year old mystery.This is the best of the Jake O'Hara mysteries so far. The author skillfully blends the mysteries of the past and present. The supernatural angle is entertaining but not too overdone. Gypsy Rose Liebowitz's character really stands out, and the Ben Rubin character is strangely absent. Very fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"This book seem to have a large dose of the supernatural which turns me right off.

I thought I might like it from the description and while the drawing style is fantastic it's just not a good show. The characters are very immature and it's kind of a weird relationship they all have with one another. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time, falls very short","review":"YUCK. The only reason this did not get zero stars is because the premise is a very interesting one. Famous researcher, Claudia Morris discovers disturbing patterns in children's crime in a not-so-far-in-the-future England. Enter reporter Peter Levin who smells a ripe story to help booster his rapidly sagging career. The two soon discover much more than they bargained for as the dig in the children's histories, genetics, and the strange powers the kids appear to posses. Were these kids manufactured to save mankind or to destroy it? And by whom?Plot had more holes than swiss cheese. Characters were never fleshed out. Writing was very dry. I kept reading HOPING that it would turn itself around (while kicking myself the entire way). I guessed the \\"BIG SURPRISE TWISTS\\" about a quarter of the way into the book. The ending was one of the most far fetched things I've ever read. I was very disappointed in myself for wasting my time on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loose, wild brilliance","review":"A nice retreat from highly structured albums like the also-brilliant \\"When I Was A Boy.\\" I'm not a jazz fan, yet Jane's take makes me swoon in rapture.

With the oldest conveniently gone from home, second born Frisco Joe Jefferson smelled one big rat. The ladies claimed to have answered a housekeepers ad, but Frisco Joe could spot machmaking at ten paces. He almost shooed them away, then he looked into single mom Annabelle Turnberry's beautiful blue eyes, and \\"Go away\\" became \\"stay...\\" Oh, my! The eleven hunky examples of pure testosterone intimidated the once burned, twice shy Annabelle, especially the tall, dark and glowering Frisco. But when Frisco sweet talked her cranky baby girl to sleep, Annabelle's wary heart warmed. This cowboy acted tough only to protect his family. Could he be gentled by a woman's tender touch?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique book","review":"I have received my copy of the book and I can't put it down. It has been great help with my AI research at the University. I have the other book from the same author \\"Programming Spiders, Bots and Aggregators in Java\\" and I have the same comments for both. Both are easy to read, have precise information and great code. Chapter 7 of this book \\"OCR with Kohonen Neural Network\\" makes the book more than worth it. Great stuff. I hope the author does not stop and keep writting books like these. I recommend this book for anyone interested in learning AI and also experienced programmers alike. The author makes though topics seem easy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow","review":"First - somehow I have missed that there is second edition of the book. Of course its my fault, but anyway its not nice to still sell old book with the same price. It just happened that on my search in amazon older version popped up and I bought it - no need to tell I felt bad after I find out about second edition.Anyway after reading the book don't feel that bad :) Maybe this book is just not for me, because it looks like other reviewers liked it, but it was very hard to read and understand. Explanations was not deep enough for me, there is a lot of stuff like \\"we'll see in the next chapter\\", code quality does not look good - pretty hard to read and understand. Maybe it would be good for someone with sound theoretical knowledge on the subject, I didn't have that (I'm just software developer that become interested in neural networks). Anyway I didn't like the book - would give it 2 stars, but because its old version that is still sold - I will give it only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"code heavy, concept light","review":"I bought this book based on the strength of the other reviews. The free neural net engine, JOONE, that the book is based on is no longer supported or available. There are JOONE downloads available but I couldn't get it working on Windows 7 and I'm a professional programmer. Writing style is stilted and very poor with lots of spelling mistakes.My impression from going through 3-4 of the chapters is that the author failed to convey an adequate conceptual understanding of the topics, such as backpropagation and feedforward networks. Instead, he vaguely describes it and then presents the source code for you to read. This seems pretty lame to me.I was hoping to develop a good conceptual understanding of neural networks from this book, but it's not going to happen with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The First and Best Book on Southeast Minnesota","review":"I wouldn't fish without this book! This is a beautiful area of Minnesota and it deserves to be explored. It's also easy to get lost, so this book is key to finding your way around. And unlike any of the other books that have come out since this one, every single trout stream is in this book. In fact, some of the best streams were left out of Mickey Johnson's book and also Humphrey & Shogren's book! Who wants a book that doesn't include every stream? It's also less expensive than the other books.This book is the standard for trout fishing books on this area. John's written more than half a dozen fishing books. He knows what he's talking about. I always have a copy of this book in my truck! You should too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much for Hard Core Fishing Info.","review":"This book, like Humphrey and Shogren's, was a waste of money.

How's that for female liberalism?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fingernails on a blackboard.........","review":"If you like the sound of someone dragging their fingernails across a blackboard you'll love the sound of Alanis Morrisette's voice.

I don't understand it?....of course the music here is okay, but the autenticity of the performer not that much.

One bit of advice: Listen to this music at high volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"Okay, let me say that I'm more of a Korn/Eminem/System of a Down kind of spread, but I bought this because I knew I liked a couple of the songs (basically \\"You Learn\\" and \\"Ironic\\") and I heard her new \\"Hands Clean\\" on the radio. When I got it, I listened to it full through, and since have listened to it probably 18-20 times (I got it about 10 days before writing this review).Great album, I actually enjoy every song on this CD, and highly recommend it. She has everything from just fun songs to really touching songs. I'm very impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock Heaven - Thank You Alanis","review":"16 million copies sold and I STILL think think the numbers do justice to this album. Everybody who listens to music should have this CD as part of their collection. Alanis has a simply mindblowing voice that exudes so much emotion, so much sincerity.

You won't be disappointed with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smash Hit Galore","review":"This CD is a million times better than her latest one ( supposed former infatuation junkie ). This CD is pretty awesome, she's got a really ecstatic voice that can make you high. In this album there are various world-wide hits like \\"you oughta know\\" ( track 2 ), \\"hand in my pocket\\" ( track 4 ), \\"head over feet\\" ( track 8 ), and the best one of all her hits which made it up to number one on MTV's top 100 music video clips 1997, \\"ironic\\" ( track 10 ). This CD is absolutely fabolous. I guess along the way, the time between \\"jagged little pill\\" and \\"supposed former infatuation junkie\\" was a little messed up and she had bad influences.. i guess...."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most talent you will find","review":"This is one of the best CDs I own. I swear, I am in love! There is but one song on this disc that is bad, and that is Wake Up. But except for that, it is fantastic! Alanis's voice itself is not so hot, but she has one helluva band behind her and her songs are meaninbgful and rockin!!!! All in all, this is best CD, like, ever.

She doesn't know how to sing. Like many young male and female singers these days, she just sort of bellows and yells somewhat in tune. Her phrasing is terrible, all those yelps and whoops are annoying. Check out her vocal inflections on \\"one hand in my pocket\\" after the line, \\"I've got one hand in my pocket\\" the next line is \\"the other one's hailing a taxi cab\\" I can never hear that line without cringing. Her emotional level seems to be a jilted junior high student. \\"You,you, you ....man, you!!!\\" If you are over 25 and you think that her singing is great and her lyrics are really insightful, you need to check out more mature and much better singers like the late, great Eva Cassidy and maybe a country artist like Carlene Carter."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's amazing how far someone can go with minimal talent","review":"While Morissette has received lots of press since her debut I can't help but be surprised at the hoopla over her very minimal vocal ability. Morissette has gone far with a voice that sounds like nails on a blackboard. I actually turn off the radio when one of her songs comes on, something I've never done before. I tried to like her - listened to various songs & albums - but just can't. Some of the ones who have benefitted from the doors opened by Alanis (Jewel, for example) are much more deserving of recognition in my opinion. Oh well, it's all subjective in the end. If you want to buy this album, listen to the tracks first to make sure it's up your alley."},{"rating":"1","title":"You oughta know this is overrated!","review":"I had to listen to this album constantly thanks to my college neighbors. All I can say is, it made me wince in pain on a daily basis. Isn't that ironic? Well no, really, it isn't. It's just a bad album. While her emotions may come across as sincere if you are used to listening to Tiffany, nothing can stop the chills I feel when I hear her high-pitched gargle-and-wail screechfest \\"All I Really Want\\". I recommend this album only as a torture device for cats who fight too much. It parodies them."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD ALBUM","review":"ALANIS DOES NOT KNOW HOW TO WRITE. She is not good. Her annoyin,whining voice gets me ticked off. SO I don't hear it anymore. Instead you should buy the album of SHAKIRA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiled","review":"We've all been hurt in love. Men are betrayed and left by women who vowed to love them forever, and vice versa. Healthy individuals grieve about it a while and get over it and either get back on the market or find other pursuits than stupid game-playing, which is an obsession among both men and women these days, and which brings on a lot of hurt. Alanis Morissette is like the woman who was dumped who stewed in bitterness for too long and confused hating men generally with overcoming a devastating experience in a healthy way. Her later recordings show a gradual increase in mental health, but this one is spookily sociopathic and perhaps psychopathic. Not a good gift to a little girl you know whom you want to grow up well-balanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic?","review":"Hey, I didn't know that when things go from bad to worse that's irony; wait a minute, IT'S NOT.

If she keeps it up she may well descend into self-parody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Her Second Album Instead!","review":"This is awful! Please turn it off! Get a voice, get a better mood, get musical, Alanis! You should have put this one in the trashcan and released your second album right away, 'cause \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" is as brilliant as \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" is unbearable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, manufactured junk.","review":"This album was manufactured to appeal to lonely, jaded, angry, high school girls who are easily fooled into thinking that Alanis is some sort of soul mate. It seems the record companies will promote and sell anything these days, regardless of talent. Oh, and by the way, the song IRONIC is absurd. Alanis should take a 7th grade English Lit class to find out what 'irony' means, and all of you (teenage girls included) should find another album to spend your money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jagged Little Pill","review":"Jagged Little Pill is a good album. produced by Glen Ballard the album contains 12 good songs that all has something special about them. Lyrically the album is good. It mostly deals with relationships with men and people around Alanis, eating disorders etc. Some of the lyrics don't make sense at all but work well in the song. Musically it isn't exactly avant-garde or different but gripping and very melodic. Jagged Little Pill is by no means however a perfect record it is a bit cheesy and corny and often a bit annoying but it has also feel to it that you just can't ignore it. 7.5/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alanis Morissette is too self-absorbed","review":"I bought this CD in 1996, bought all the singles, then realized, after purchasing her new album, that Alanis Morissette has nothing better to do than write about her love life. Come on Alanis, find some other issues to pursue. However, I do love her voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This CD is by far the best that any artist has ever come out with. I rarely hear a CD with as many great hits on it as Jagged Little Pill! I love Ironic, and Hand in My Pocet the best, but they are all great (including the secret song at the end of the thirtheenth track)!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album of the 90s","review":"I got Alanis Morrisette's c.d. when it came out in 1995, and although I was only seven and did not understand the lyrics, I did like the rhythms. Alanis really does have some great tracks to rock out to, and I wish people would just enjoy her music rather than point to her early failed pop career. So what, she made good music? It's enjoyable and decent. It's not like she's avril lavigne who was a failed country singer who sucked and then turned into a pop star who still sucks. Alanis music really allows the listener to care and it actually sounds GENUINE and realistic, unlike all the other crappy music thats out there today. \\"You Oughta Know\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time and \\"Ironic\\" \\"You Learn\\" and \\"Head over Feet\\" are good too, with Ironic being the best of the lot. The only song i never got into was \\"Hand in my pocket,\\" it just was a stupid song and pissed me off, but everything else is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Listen, You Learn To Love This Album","review":"I only wish I could give more than 5 stars! This is truly one of the best albums ever. It is raw, layered, and terrific. I love every song on this album. I got this a while ago and still I love it til this day. My favorite of the whole album has to be You Oughta Know. It's energy and care-free lyrics made it stand out and sound great. Ironic, Head Over Feet, and You Learn are also great songs. All of the songs on this album are great and truly can be cherished forever. If you liked this album as much as I did, go get yourself her other two hits: Under Rug Swept, and Suppose Former Infatuation Junkie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extreme","review":"This was an extreme cd. Very personal, however very capturing. Her voice is different from other artists, it is more harsh and not sweet. I'm tired of ..all those sweet sounding phonies. I highly recommend this cd to anyone. My favorite song is \\"You oughta know\\", I listened to it a million times. I didn't like \\"perfect\\" although i did detect sarcasm in it, it was depressing.(Actually, it [was terrible]) But everything else was very good. I really like the way everything blends together, her vocals and the instruments. I think that Alanis Morissette kicks a** with the feminine lyrics. I tired of \\"I luv you baby no matter what\\" Finally, some real life situation. Its sad, but men are NOT always perfect. Im not saying I don't like men/boys, (in fact, I like them a lot) but I like variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Singles, So-So Filler","review":"Let's face it: the singles became so huge, the filler was overlooked by almost all the fans of this album. But the singles are excellent. I think Head Over Feet is excellent. The secret song is also very very good. The best song on this CD is All I Really Want. It hints at the greatness to come on later albums. It's incoherent, out-of-control, and I love it. We all love Ironic. Anyone notice the irony inherent that there is NONE in a song called \\"Ironic?\\" But who cares? You Oughta Know, the song that launched Alanis, is a personal favorite. People rave about the going down in a theater line, but my favorite is \\"and every time i scratch my nails down someone else's back i hope you feel it well can you feel it?\\" Hand In My Pocket is happy-go-lucky, and You Learn tells us that no matter what, we can grow from experience. Even if the filler is overlooked, I really like Not The Doctor. Overall, it's not her best album, but it's better than most albums anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Great Ones","review":"I consider Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie to be her best work, but Alanis made an amazing debut with this album. I don't know why she was labeled as angry. Out of her 6 hits: All I Really Want, You Oughta Know, Hand In My Pocket, Ironic, Head Over Feet, and You Learn, only You Oughta Know was angry. My favorite song was and is Head Over Feet. The singles were so overplayed that they overshadow the rest of the album. But I love the singles anyways. I also love the secret song, Your House. It's so amazing, and it's a capella. I love it that way. A definite must-buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Album.","review":"This album, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", is pretty good. My fav songs on this CD are \\"You Outta Know\\"; \\"Hand In My Pocket\\"; \\"Ironic\\"; and \\"All I Really Want\\". This is a pretty impressive CD with impressive lyrics and they're not all about loving guys and romance or breaking hearts. Most of Alanis Morrissette's songs on this CD are about life choices and just stuff about life. Of course, there are songs on this CD I could care less for. But I would really recommend this CD. It's probably Alanis Morrisette's best.P.S.: I gave this CD 4 stars, 'cause like I said: there were some songs which I could care less for. So, to all of you Alanis Morrisette fans-I'm not tryin' to diss her music or anything....it's just a review and my opinion on her music and I can say whatever I want. But, all in all, it's a pretty good CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional rollercoaster","review":"I disagree with \\"Was this written by a 15-year-old.\\" I too am a huge fan of Peter Gabriel, Jethro Tull, Rush, et al, but I also like Alanis a lot. Her lyrics are self absorbed and and she leaves her emotions out for everyone to see, but that's what makes the album so great. It is really heart-felt and very powerful. I also like her voice - it is particularly well suited to the angst ridden lyrics (I don't think I'd want to hear her sing Christmas carols or Italian opera, but for the type of music she sings, her voice is perfect). Buy this album for the lyrics - they will hit you like a ton of bricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Music","review":"This album is probably the best ever written by any female artist. Imagine a young woman in her twenties that had the intellectual capacity to write songs that are meaningful, that deals with all sorts of emotions and problems in life. Yes, it might be a little angry and agressive, but it translated so well into music, it's impossible to get tired of the CD. If you want a less agressive and a calmer version of Alanis, try her new one: SFIJ, it's another work of art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bitter Pill to Swallow?","review":"Apart from 'Mary Jane' and 'Ironic', the tracks on this album sound like a recording session way out of control. Morrisette's voice is powerful sure, the lyrics are stark, but...SO WHAT? Frankly I'm sick to death with albums that are supposedly trying to make statements about society or life but are only out to make a buck. Still, Gen-X will buy it and rave about it and miss out on a lot of better music.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Alanis, GROW UP.","review":"Alanis's albums could be a whole lot better if she realized she can't sing. Or play. Or write. Alanis was, what, around 22 when she made this album? You'd think she would have grown out of this 10th grade mentality by then. If mindless bitching about men and life is what you want, by all means, go for it. But people who appreciate real writing and real music know she's not worth it. The lyrics are meaningless, the music is drivel, and the singing is like fingernails on a blackboard. I wish she'd look up the meaning of \\"irony\\" also, because the song Ironic has no real irony in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRID!","review":"Alanis Morissette has one of the most horrid voices I have ever heard -- it sounds like someone who is being jabbed with a pitchfork. Her angst-filled lyrics(which are co-written by someone else, by the way) smack of commercialism. Many people fail to realize this album was a blatant example of an artist trying to reposition herself with little regard for musicianship (not that Morissette has any -- the only insturment she plays is the harmonica). She does have an occasionally catchy sense for grunge-pop melodies but otherwise this album has little to recommend it. Morissette can't sing, she writes crappy, self-indulgent lyrics and lacks musicianship. Hmmmm....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it negative stars?","review":"Two HUGE thumbs down for this one. Listening to this girl attempt to sing is like listening to a mangy, sick alley cat attempt to get its leg free from being caught in a fence. And her lyrics! Geez, we wrote better, more insightful stuff than that in my high school creative writing class.I mean, this is supposed to be a joke, right? Except that Alanis is the only one laughing -- all the way to the bank. Popular music is in such ridiculous shape these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as my supposed former bad lyrics indicate","review":"Bad music mixed with wordy, bad lyrics make for fooling loads of mid teen americans.

This overhyped, crass album is a sad excuse for musical freedom for women. Alanis, do you kiss your mother with that mouth?

The lyrics are moronic and the voice has a screeching quality of excruciating proportions. She sounds like a cat with a digestive disorder singing into a fan. Stay away from this, unless you are experimenting with a new pain killer and wish to generate a massive headache for a trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jagged little piece of trash.....","review":"I have a hard time deciding which is worse, the leader or the follower - in this case the leader being Morissette herself, and the followers being the millions of mindless souls who buy, listen to, and enjoy this stuff. Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, where are you?!? At least you didn't try to misrepresent yourself - you both came off as the pop-diva simplistic artists you were. In Morissette's case, this big bundle of nothing is trying to pass herself off as some angst-ridden goddess that will lead millions to the promise land. Surprise, it's all record company and industry hype - well, maybe Alanis herself even bought into it. She sure can't sing, she's not an artist, and she's not even attractive. What a waste of time. I'm ashamed of myself for even taking an hour of my life to listen to this. Ten hail mary's for me...forgive me father, for I have sinned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage !","review":"This woman can't sing at all, adn is fooling everyone with her \\"different\\" appeal.

I replayed it and it stopped after the 4th song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis","review":"I am a big fan of alanis Morissette. This CD was definatly Alanis' best CD and that definatly includes her first 2 Canadian Only released CDs(which I own) when she was 16 and 17. If I had to pick one Alanis CD to listen to forever it would be this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It figures...","review":"I love this CD. I have all the lyrics memorized... well, almost all. I've had this CD for 3 years and still play it. I like some of the concepts that she comes up with, like \\"no smoking sign on your cigarette break\\". There's a lot of aggression here, you kinda have to be in the mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"I bought this CD in something like 5th grade, and even though I'm much older now, all of these songs remind me of when I was young enough not to have much to worry about and could just do what I wanted to. Alanis's music symbolizes individuality, and every song on this CD is great. Anyone who doesn't like this CD must not be able to remember some time in their life when they weren't willing to conform, and I think these songs, especially ones like Mary Jane, Perfect, and Ironic, are evidence of having difficulty in life and not always knowing what to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jagged Little Pill-Alanis Morissette","review":"What an awesome album! This is completely amazing! Simply put, it could not be better at all. It's outstanding! My favorites (I love all of them) would be \\"All I Really Want\\", \\"You Oughta Know\\", \\"Hand In My Pocket\\", \\"Right Through You\\", and \\"Not The Doctor\\". This is great! Everyone should own this album and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie and the recently released MTV Unplugged. Great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is absolutely amazing!","review":"I must say that Alanis Morissette is one of the most talented singer/performers out there! All though her voice may not be the most beautiful, she makes up for it by having wonderful intense lyrics and catchy song beats. Some people are completely against her singing, and I can understand that. Many people say that she has a bad, angry attitude, which is true. However, if your having a bad time with a boyfriend or life in general, and if your in the mood for something different from your Britney Spears or BSB, pick up this cd, you won't regret it. Still, if you know for a fact that you don't like Alanis Morissette, don't waste your time typing reviews that only criticize what you consider to be \\"awful\\" singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best debut's in history","review":"Alanis expresses her self angry on the inside then deeper down in the album she expresses her self as smart song writer and with her unique vocals she makes this album work and I can't wait to get the 10th anverisary acoustic edition of this album. This album hit # 1 on the billboard charts for 12 weeks straight and was 11x platuim which means it sold around 11 million copies in its time.. \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" sold approx 27 million albums world wide to date. Every single track on here is good and has it's own unique meaning with Alanis witch makes this album so special. I believe she is the best female song writer in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember The Days?","review":"I can remember when Alanis ruled the charts and she still deserved to, by the way. But Jagged Little Pill, while not her best, deserved everything it got. While the hits are the standout tracks, the other songs are also good, like All I Really Want, Right Through You, Not The Doctor, Mary Jane and Wake Up. Your House (the secret song) is haunting. AIRW is the best here, and it really does give you an idea of her style. It sold 16 million and deserved it. Many tried to imitate but none could duplicate this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"a future classic. a modern day janis joplin.","review":"someone that is wise beyond her years. one of the best cd's i have heard in years. you go girl. yes my dear, life is ironic,i really do think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw Talent","review":"Alanis Morissette is awsome in this album. It has the perfect balance of gutsy determination and drive with the raw emotional form. The songs are beautifuly written, all in all a must have album. A rare tresure of raw musical talent that is garenteed to be preserved by people who know a good thing when they hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jagged Little Pill","review":"This album is a great initial effort by Morissette, but her work has declined from here. Her music has completely lost its intensity and, in doing, its honesty. While Jagged Little Pill is a good album, I am not a fan of anything that has come after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retraction","review":"Ooops, Liz Phair made VH1's Top 100. I thought JLP did too but not. Still, a great album. Later you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best cd Ever","review":"This cd has everything a spiritually growing body craves. Depth, insight, meaning. How could one person have so much to offer her fans? Her gift of words and her knowledge of life is an innate gift. We should all feel lucky that she chose to share her gift with the world.\\"You Oughta Know\\" is a raw song with a funky beat, and true to life experiences. It's not an angry song like some say, just an expressive way for the author to show her feelings at that moment. \\"Perfect\\" is a sweet, slow song that gives a powerful punch on how they will take advantage of you and \\"intellectually screw you\\" if you let them. \\"You Learn\\" is a smooth playing song that recommends that you to LIVE life, not just exist. I could go on forever, but I won't. So, if you haven't already, buy this cd. You won't regret it. It's music that everyone can relate to. It will become your favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"24 million copies and counting..","review":"How can I not give it 5 stars? This singer has all the qualities of a diva, and she is.

Women freak out too much - alanis is all pissed women arent treated right - is us men had to put up with any more s#it from women, WE would be the ones complaning. the only morissette fans are women because they dont know any good music. go check out rob zombie or white zombie for some good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh The Depth Of It All","review":"Until a listen of this cd I never truly understood anguish, pain, and authenticity. Morrisette is an artist of the highest caliber. Reaching inside the depths of her soul to produce music that allows mere mortals a glimpse into the heart of genius. Thank you Alanis for having the courage to put the struggles of growing up in suburban Ottawa as a provincial Tiffany child star into this masterpiece. The realism of those mean streets that you survived only serve to make your art more credible. Even the name Jagged Little Pill (and Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie too) is charged with an energy that is free from all posturing and posing. The best that music has to offer. NOT!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"alanis is cool","review":"if you are looking for pop, don't buy this CD. if you are looking for some of the best music around with a dose of girlie angst, pick it up! Alanis has been my favorite since 1995, when Jagged Little Pill took her to the top of the charts. this album had not come out of my CD player since then (good I have a changer)this CD rocks. vintage A.M. at her greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something everyone needs to swallow","review":"What more can be said about Canada-born singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette? She has proven herself over and over as being one of music's leaders with her overly personal lyrics and radio-friendly beats. Jagged Little Pill is as perfect as a commercial rock record can get. It's not only hardcore and controversial, it's more importantly marketable. Every song here is a brilliant piece of art (speaking in terms of rock music, that is--like most music, it may not be everybody's choice), but more interesting is how Morissette sings it--the pain, anger and hurt come off in a wrenchingly shrill, nasally and sometimes annoyingly unique sound that's all her own. Blisteringly personal and full of angst, Jagged Little Pill is definitely something everyone should swallow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I love you","review":"I remember exactly where I was the first time I heard \\"you oughta know\\" and mind you, I only caught the tail end of it; and I HAD to know who the artist was. Ohhh Alanis. I forgot how much I loved you and Jagged Little Pill until Saturday when I accidentally saw Alanis again in concert at Mixfest. Forget India and Providence and whatever else the hell she says in \\"thank you,\\" she should've tipped her hat to Glenn Ballard for producing JLP. Hello, man in the mirror!! Not only did she create the movement for angry female rockers, she demonstrated her musical diversity; no one song is quite like any other on the album and she does have a softer side. Although Alanis proved to be mainstream popular, she's a far cry from and quite superior to the meaningless lyricism that shrouds pop today and then. A two-toed sloth could write that crap. Alanis speaks to hear audience in a way that everyone can relate. This album is one that will change your life if it didn't already."},{"rating":"2","title":"PRETTY DARN GOOD!","review":"Despite a weird title,this is a great CD. Alanis Morisette is a fantastic artist. She really knows how to express her feelings. Songs like \\"You Oughta Know\\" and \\"Ironic\\" are the stand-outs. The CD has a bit of vulgar language in it that wasn't needed,but it's still terrific. If you wanna hear a woman that can rock,this a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is a very angry singer","review":"I really liked Alanis' album, theonly thing that bugged me was that she is so angry in a lot of her songs, most of them. I hope she's not relating to her life. That's sad. But overall the album is really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD BLUESMAN LOVES ALANIS","review":"So i'm a 50 year old blues player so what? I ask my friends when they hear Alanis and ask \\"who's that\\" ? I love Alanis, I love the musicsianship on the whole album. Alanis is one tough mama and I admire her for that. Sure some of the music is depressing but i'm used to that (the blues you know)She's even better live. Alanis baby keep on keeping on."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's A Genius........","review":".... and incomparable!This is truly an amazing album. I had been hearing this CD hundreds of times ever since she released it. I'm obsessed. Alanis Morissette had paved the way for new female artists in no way others had done. The songs in this album, are just bloody brilliant. All of the tracks in this album is worthy of becoming singles. My favourites includes Perfect (I'm sure many kids can connect to this song in particular), You Oughtta Know, Not The Doctor, Head Over Feet, Ironic, Wake Up and Right Through You. Personally the only song that I can't stand is Hand In My Pocket. This album is worth every cents spent, and she is not feeding you insipid love songs like some idiots are wont to do. Alanis inspired hundreds and I'm not surprised why. She sings with passion and you can actually feel the emotion oozing out of your radio. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"You outta know","review":"I was still a teenager when this album came out. The song you outta know was like a knife in the back when I was dumped. Alanis has a way with words.The album does have explicit lyrics but it is worth it to get the point across."},{"rating":"2","title":"One hand in my pocket and the others showing a peace sign.","review":"thats what I kept humming all day after I got this CD. If you want a single cd in which all the tracks are by one singer and there isn't even one track to which you can say that its not soo good.? Well then Jagged little pill is for you...I am sure that you shall love this one. I call her the queen of Alt. Rock. nothing gets better than this trust me"},{"rating":"2","title":"I apologize for the other guy from Austin -- JLP is great.","review":"Don't think that everyone here in the \\"Live Music Capital of the World\\" hates Jagged Little Pill...just those who lack the musical taste to appreciate both the city and the CD. Thanks to JLP, Alanis has become one of the most influential artists of the decade -- look at what Jewel and Sarah Maclachlan did after her. I don't mind what some would call \\"whiny\\" lyrics if they're thought-provoking, as most of Alanis' are. I respect the fact that she wrote or co-wrote all of her own music, and the fact that she can play both guitar and harmonica. And for those who say all of her songs sound alike: Listen to \\"You Oughta Know\\" followed by \\"Uninvited\\" or \\"Thank U\\".One can't help but be excited for the new album, which will show us just how much this already mega-talented star has evolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of all Time!","review":"Alanis Morissette is absolutely amazing. Every song on this CD is an instant classic. This has been my favorite album for 10 years. I highly recommend the acousitc 10 year anniversary edition that just came out on June, 14, 2005. This edition is fantastic. This is just as good if not better than the original. She is not as angry and bitter as she was in the original. I recommend both editions for whatever mood you are in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing record.","review":"One strong song (\\"You Oughta Know\\") and very little else. I bought it as soon as it came out and stopped playing it after the first couple of weeks. AM's voice lacks strength and her songwriting pales beside Liz Phair's. Any of the latters records are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Learn is one the strongest and most haunting songs","review":"The song \\"You Learn\\" first drew me to this CD. It is one of the strongest and most hauntings set of lyrics to be combined with a superb melody. If this were the only song I liked on this CD the CD would still be very highly recommendable. But there are many more, some released and others not -- making listening to Moresset's efforts a true treasure hunt -- that causes me to say this one of the most prized finds I've made in several years. Superb effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An album to be remembered","review":"It's hard to make a comprehensive review of such an original and well-built album, especially when most of you already know no less than five songs from it. All I can say is this is one of those records that own their place in history. If I was Alanis, I would probably never try and release another album, cause it is almost impossible to make anything better than \\"Jagged...\\" But then, I'm not Alanis... :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whining? Maybe so, but it means something.","review":"There are people out there who say that Alanis Morissette is just whining; her songs aren't that good, her voice grates, and who wants to hear her problems anyway? I think those people should take a closer look.Co-written though the lyrics may be, the feeling is real. She's expressing herself in a way that is good for her and the people who listen to her music. When you're angry, there's nothing more satisfying than angry music.I'll concede that Alanis' voice grates, but it is raw, untrained, and powerful. I like it that way. You could say it contributes to the overall tone of her music.Who wants to listen to Alanis whine? Anyone who wants to feel better about the way their life is going. Anyone who wants to think about what she's talking about. Anyone who wants to release anger. The question is: who *doesn't* want to hear her whine?So take a moment. You have the CD; listen to it and think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years old and still as powerful as it was then!","review":"Alanis Morrisette is the queen of angry, angsty yet heartbreakingly vunerable lyrics.Every person should have this in their cd collection its that good!A perfect balance of moody and hopeful this album engages you from the very first listen and i still play it as much as i did when it was first released.Gronudbreaking and honest a cd that could not be bettered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love the hatred and love melody.","review":"I really enjoyed listening to Jagged Little Pill. She really has a strong voice and she says what some people are afraid to say. I will admit, I only got the cd at first because I liked the sound of Ironic. I can't say the same about Hand In My Pocket or You Oughta Know. Then I listened to the rest of the cd. I really liked the messages that she sent with songs like Perfect, Forgiven, and Head Over Feet. There were a lot of qualities that people could relate to. It's not at all like some of the stuff that is playing nowadays. I mean, how much can you take of songs about people's love lives (or lack thereof)? I find myself being a fan of Alanis, even though not all of her work is incredible. Take pride in the small things and check this album out. Disappointment is not really an option with the variety she presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly over-rated drivel","review":"When I first heard \\"You Oughta Know\\", I thought it was a parody of bad female \\"alterna-divas\\". When I found out it was serious, I didn't know how to feel. Alanis whines, gargles, shrieks and mutters. The one vocal sound she doesn't make is tuneful SINGING. The songs are all of the currently \\"kewl\\" retro-60s/70s Pop nonsense, with no real substance, I give this one the definite THUMBS DOWN."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My cat in heat sounds better than Allanis Morrisette-on a good day!

Some of the music was OK, but I didn't find anything spectacular about it. Actually, I was a bit annoyed by the slightly off-key whiny vocals, and I thought a lot of the lyrics were just plain stupid. I can usually overlook problems such as these if the music is good, but it sounds sloppy to me and no better than average.

Being able to pull off the surprise \\"gotcha\\" humor is actually a lot more sophisticated and talented than people give credit for. I also felt he was a very good story teller and told the reader not only about his triumphs, but also of his colossal failures, which makes him quite likable. One of my fav stories was the parasailing story, of course I also thought it was funny when he got dragged all over by a horse and then of course there was the getting thrown off the meanest bull in history.

The book is overloaded with unnecessary detail. Like most historians, Glantz is a big paragraph man.No one has ever told him that short paragraphs are easier to read.I fear in his case, even this slight modification would be of no help.A ruthless editor should get to work on it and cut through the verbiage to leave what's important.And other reviewers are right: the maps are appalling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glantz's research is shoddy","review":"David Glantz's research for this book would be unacceptable ,if he were writing a book ,say, on the American Civil War.His access to original sources was inadequate.Therefore, I would take the information in this book with a grain of salt.He exaggerates the casaulty figures of Operation Mars. Operation Mars was meant as a diversion.Glantz has a bias against Zhukov.In his lastest book ,however, he seems to have come to a more objective assessment of Zhukov. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real military history","review":"This is one of the rare books able to capture the \\"flavour\\" or the russin front fighting. There aren't heriocal defence or fanatical attacks but only histories of men, mugik or landser, forced to fight a war decided from leader withour remors and without any knowledge of modern warfare. All the reports reported in this books demonstrate above any doubt that History is a delicate tissue built from the single men's daily adventures. Inside the book, readers will find a fine report of the stategical basis for the campaign and of the mental status of the two operative leaders and how their decisions and their orders were able to obtain an heavy influence on the ebb & flow of the single fightings and on the entire operation. This is a real study of military history and you'll se no winner no loser but only professional soldiers that make their job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmm, a bit more mature, layed back...I love it!","review":"I must say it took me a while to get used to, but after a while I started to really like it. Yeah, I'm one of \\"those\\"...die-hard fan type. Sound of Your Voice and Home easily steal the show. The only thing I don't like about the album is that What a Letdown isn't on there. I have the Simlish version of it (BNL played that on the Sims 2 Family Fun Pack) but not the English version. That was a great song, too. Oh well.Bottom line, even though this album is mellow, it's still really good. I don't think that now that they're older, they have lost their touch. Definately not true.

Their newest album seems somewhat uninspired, and the lyrics hint at triteness and depression. The tunes and chord progressions seem forced.

Sorry, guys..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I was less than thrilled with this album - not as upbeat as their previous albums.

I have seen the live shows. So the question remains - what went wrong here? There are a few great tracks - Bull in a China Shop, Easy, Take It Back and Bank Job. The problem is the rest of the tracks lack anything distinctive. There is nothing that makes you want to listen to the rest of the tracks. It is rather boring. The lead track is just slow and never develops. That is the problem with this cd. Where is the wit? And why is Kevin singing so much on this? I did not buy \\"thin buckle\\" or whatever his band is.

Especially on the topic of puberty and the menstrual cycle. I think $25 is way too expensive for a 15 minute video. The topic deserves much more explaination and graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the support I need!","review":"Thanks for a video that helps open a discussion that is hard for me to have with my daughters. I feel strongly that it is my responsibility as a parent but I'm uncomfortable trying to talk openly and this video takes away the naughty feel that often comes along when kids talk to each other. The scary part for me was that I wanted to think this was all new information to my daughters but it wasn't! Don't assume that your child is too young and innocent to learn this valuable/factual information - chances are very good that they already have heard much more than you think (by the time they are 10)! Make sure they have the correct knowledge about their bodies and sex - you will be glad you took this step as they enter their teens. As I always try to remind myself - saying nothing at all on this subject is still teaching them about my feelings about sex - my silence would send the wrong message. Thanks for helping me brave this scary subject!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short, not worth the amount of money I spent","review":"Video was too short, the video was partially cartoon when talking about the serious matters and my daughter did not have any questions.

What sets him apart from his contemporaries are his introspective lyrics and killer beats, which he produced himself, simultaneously balancing back to basics ideology with hard-edged underground progression. You'll be pressed to find a song you don't identify with on this album, and this is where Top shines the brightest: telling a story, and making you feel like its YOUR life he's rapping about. Don't hesitate to pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Later Platters?","review":"Had a Platters CD that I really listened to a lot. Then it started skipping. When I tried to reorder, it was not longer available. This CD had some of the same songs, so I ordered it. This CD sounds like a later version of \\"The Platters\\"...other people.

I felt horrible keeping our daughter all bundled up to the point she could not wee what was going on and believe me she let us know she didn't like it either!!! This stroller cover is durable ( it has survived 2 snow storms and a young toddler) in the last month or so... Another great thing is that you do not need to bundle your child in it if it is not too cold we do not even put a jacket on her in there. If you have a long/tall child you may want to also purchase one of the foot /leg covers that just slip over their clothes. Our 1 year old is tall for her age and her feet stick out the bottom of the cover so we just use a blanket but are thinking of getting the extra cover before next winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"my son who is 3 does not like to wear cap n mittens..this cover is like covering him in a blanket. he also loves it... he des allow me to open it till we enter the house.... he enjoys sitting warm n watching outside.

Combining history with fiction is very intelligent.Alice Boley"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and interesting","review":"The author of Marching Through Culpeper has masterfully woven the rich history of this key Civil War town into an interesting and enjoyable story. Once I started the book, I was hooked. I highly recommend this book for those who wish to learn what life was like for the residents of a small town in the center of the action of one of the world's most savage dramas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marching Through Culpeper","review":"This was a very enjoyable, yet historical novel. I do not usually read novels about the Civil War, but can certainly reccommend this one. It brought to life the whole Culpeper area and what the locals went through and stayed historically on target. I am loking forward to visiting the area soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Real You Can't Put It Down","review":"This is the kind of book you just can't put down. While the characters are fictional she blends them with true facts of life during that time and the War, giving the reader the feel of being there. I got so involved it was like the characters were alive. Constance is a staunch supporter of the South and her involvement with a Yankee Officer from a chance meeting is very realistic for the times. It takes you through the hardships of war, how the women were involved, even as civilians. All the War Between the States information is based on the facts and the fictional characters make it so interesting you feel like you are there. Even though I would class it as a romantic novel, it is a book that even the most macho man will enjoy. It is definitely a book that you can read more than once and still enjoy it immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Mrs. Morton","review":"Born and raised in the North I was exposed in school only to the Northern point of view, \\"Marching Through Culpeper\\" was not only a very good read - one of the best books that I've ever read - but was also very informative about the South.

I was appalled when I read this book. These officers are some of the most beloved men of the Confederacy, but this book is putting them in such hideous situations and there isn't even any truth behind it. This book was obviously NOT well-researched. If you're gonna write a romance novel, at least change the names of ALL the characters. Pure slander!! That's all I can say about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great blend of historical facts and fictional characters","review":"I have read many, many fiction and nonfiction books that took place during the Civil War era. This book was the best blend of fact and fiction that I have ever read. I wanted to go to Culpeper, VA to visit the people and places. Mrs. Morton did an excellent job researching this period.

Also had a spot where it is smoother which indicates it was sanded - likely to cover up other worse scratches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it so much I bought two more!","review":"Ok, I admit it. I'm a bit of a wino. After our trip to Napa last year we came home with more wine than our wine fridge could hold so I went looking for stylish wine storage. This little stunner matches our contemporary decor, is quite substantial and nicely finished. I have the ebony color and it's a beautiful rich, espresso color. It comfortably holds even Syrah bottles (which are wider than most regular wine bottles). As our wine selection has grown I've purchased two more of these. Others here have complained it looks cheap and wasn't well constructed. I couldn't disagree more. Mine are all gorgeous! Amazon not only had the best price for this rack but it shipped free to me in 2 days because I'm an Amazon Prime member. Doesn't get better than that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Good Item; Quality Control Could Be Better","review":"I agree that the quality control for this item could be better. I ordered two of these and both came with 2 screws laying in the bottom of their boxes. That being said, a screw driver and 30 seconds later, the units were ready to go.Both were slightly scuffed from the lack of proper packing. The items are packed in paper and the units rub while in transit. A little furniture cover-up and they looked new.With all of that said, the items are very nice and look GREAT hanging on the wall behind my bar. Do not hesitate to purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Wine Rack","review":"Purchased four of these units and placed two beside each other both above and below a shelf - makes a 48 bottle storage cube. These racks are nicely built and look great. The spacers and screws are bright. I purchased the ebony units and black hardware would've looked nicer. Overall, I'm very pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for the price","review":"I like the form factor and functionally. It holds 12 bottles just fine. If I had gotten this at a garage sale for $10, I would have been happy, but I paid enough for this that I was expecting a piece of decent workmanship. Instead, it arrived with some of the screws fallen out and rattling around in the box. The rest of the screws were lose. The stain is uneven. It looks ok tucked away in a dark corner, but if you put it in good light it looks like a 6 year old painted it. It doesn't sit evenly no matter which end I put down. If there aren't enough bottles on it to give a decent weight then it wobbles back and forth at a touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product but workmanship was less than perfect","review":"My step-daughter has been asking for a stylized wooden wine rack with a wave to it for more than a year. When I found this one at Amazon, I was thrilled, as I knew it would be perfect, and she did love it. On close examination, the workmanship, where the pegs hold the wood waves together, was less than perfect, so one peg was crooked and the wine rack wobbled a bit. We turned it over and it was more stable, but not 100%. When she put it in place, on top of her china cabinet, with wine in it, none of that was noticeable -- only the striking unique design and fine wood was visible. I would recommend it, but it was slightly less well built than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin' It","review":"This was a purchase to replace an older CD that has been used to death.

Live recordings are what I like the best when checking out a band that I have heard before (Janis Landing FL) This is pretty much what I was hopeing for when I bought this. Great picking from Dwight and his muscians. Swinging honky tonk and rockabilly,bluegrass and good old solid country.

Dwight Yoakam'sbest studio work has crystal clear sound (vocals andinstruments) and lively energetic arrangements.Unfortunately, Dwight never seems to get in thegroove during the concert[s] and his performanceis lackluster.

The world has evolved significantly with regard to \\"the place of women in the work force\\" since this book was published. Some of the comments and attitudes recounted in this book now seem quaint and archaic.The real value of this book, however, is its description of the life of merchant marine officers, the nature of their work, their career progression from cadet to third mate to ocean captain, and the constant pressure on them to perform as fast as possible with zero errors. This realistic account de-mystifies and de-romanticizes life in the merchant marine. A challenging and fascinating career, yes. A romantic career sailing the Seven Seas, not quite.Would have received a 5-star rating, except for some poor editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke in a week","review":"battery went dead in a week, I misplaced so I never got a refund...disappointed in life of watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reissue of an old favorite","review":"I had this many years ago on 10 inch LP's which have long since disappeared- delighted to have it back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Got this for my teen that loves and collects Stitch stuffed animals and it was a hit.

If you grew up with these songs, you will not be able to resist singing along. If you have never heard them before, you will most certainly love them after this CD. They do change the songs ever so slightly, such as tempo or adding a few personal touches. I am no fan of the \\"cover song\\" but the songs they choose are adaptable, which is why they are timeless classics to begin with.

To be completely honest I did not like many of the sections in this book. The two stories dealing with the Hush Hush editor were forced and too filled with aliteration. While it was obviously Ellroy's intent to write the stories as Gretchell would have done in his magazine, the style crippled Ellroy's talent. In short by tyring to write like an annoying parasite, Ellroy created two annoying stories.That being said, if you are an Ellroy fan buy it, Ellroy writting is like a certain sex act, even when it's bad it's still very good. If you have not read Ellroy before, pass this one by and start the L.A. saga books and by purchasing \\"The Black Dhalia\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISILLUSIONED FAN SPEAKS UP","review":"My copy of AMERICAN TABLOID was so worn I had to replace it. Huge fan since my university years. I have all of his books. Most are superb. Some are good. Some are wanting. This one is the WORST!For a good writer (and Ellroy is an excellent one!) to put out a bad book is understandable. This one though is PURE FAN EXPLOITATION.The same stories over and over, themes all too familiar from his earlier books. Absolutely NOTHING New! And the \\"jazz just ain't there\\". Stories that fizzle and die long before they are actually over. Gone are the scents, the tastes, the feel of life in the margins. Words only pretending to be cool, characters nobody cares about to love or hate or pity.If you want to sample James Ellroy start with BLACK DAHLIA and work your way up to the COLD SIX THOUSAND.I am still waiting for the sequel to the that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with Ellroy after reading this book.","review":"After watching him interviewed on E!, I had to check out his book.

There also some fiction (that seems so real) in the book about some big 50s and 60s icons such as the Rat Pack and friends.

No writer seems to understand this more than James Ellroy.Every City has a history that it's not proud of, that you'll never find in the tourist brochures. Mr. Ellroy reminds us that the past cannot be changed no matter how much you wish it too. Los Angeles is no different. From the Black Dahlia murder to O.J.'s famous White Bronco ride on the expressway, he goes to great length to show the dark side of \\"The City of Angels\\". And once you understand it's history, it makes recent events there(such as the Nationally known tales of Police Corruption) take on whole new meanings and understanding.Every city, from Boston to Seattle has these horrible tales. Thank god James Ellroy is here to remind us of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ellroy fans unite!","review":"Either you love him or you hate him. I love him. He's like lemonade in the summer.

I have read nearly every one of his books, but this one just didn't cut it.

I couldn't get focused on any of the fiction, and the long winded diatribes on the vaccuousness of celebrityism in LA (talk about an easy target), together with an endless, hyper-syllabic dissertation on why the O.J. trial was a circus (really?) made me long for the end.Don't even check it out of the library..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good product for Diabetics","review":"Reviewed by my girlfriend:I'm a type I Diabetic, and I was very hopeful when I tried this product.

Only 1/2 cup is the maximum of carbs for a meal. Who can eat just one cup of pasta?It is very misleading to diabetics as \\"digestible carbs\\" has no meaning to them.

Unfortunately, immediately after opening the box - I noticed that the door would not open. It turns out that there was a large crack at the bottom of the door and it would not even open. I could not tell by looking at the box if it was damaged during delivery but the box did not appear to be sturdy enough for a microwave of this size and weight. As a result, I decided not to try ordering the same product again. I must say that Amazon's return policy was great.

For example, the book has a creative drawing of The Great Bear and in part reads \\"Two bright stars across her back point straight across to Polaris, the North Star.\\" Neither the 'two bright' stars nor Polaris are identifiable. There is no way to see or even imagine \\"the Big Dipper\\" within the pictured Great Bear or get any other celestial reference. To me, the whole purpose of the book.

Howard Johnson would subsequently work with other producers but they could not duplicate this album's magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly cheap.","review":"After days of teaching myself to play via the Internet I was finally able to change the notes, but the instrument was only visible in my own head - no one else could hear me play at all. The product is extremely cheaply produced, and it is hard to keep from bending the metal prongs so that the vibrating tongue buzzes against the sides. Much too quiet."},{"rating":"1","title":"At $4.98 it's about $20 too much","review":"With these you get even less than you pay for, and that's saying something. The difference between one of these and even a mediocre instrument is astonishing. As someone who's played some of the very best instruments of this type, the mere thought of the \\"Snoopy's Harp\\" sends chills up my spine. And that's not some sort of snobbery: I'm all for inexpensive when it works. But these are simply unplayable: poorly made and with a design that would be lousy even if it were well made. If you want to play jaw harp don't waste your money on this item, but instead find one from a reputable make (my personal favorite is Zoltán Szilágyi in Hungary)."},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"These shoes were on sale for 17.99 so i couldn't pass that up.

I mean, they must have actually tried to make this thing this bad. I could have overlooked the threadbare plot and horrible dialog if the sex scenes were good, but they would have to be about 9000 percent better just to be considered okay.The bonus movie, Bikini Goddesses, was better. And it was still horrible as well. In fact, some of the trailers that were included in the extras section were better than both of the movies put together.I strongly do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"This book is good but way too short.\\"","review":"\\"I really enjoyed the book ,but is was over way too soon.I read it in an afternoon.Bill skips around a little too much and never really lets you in too close.But if you love golf and Bill Murray it's a good read\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Murray is a funny writer!","review":"This is the first book that Bill Murray has written. I must say that Murray has really done a good job! He's funny, kinda touching and appealing all the way! He talks about his life in golf from his chilhood to the present. From being a caddy, then starring in the greatest golf movie ever made, Caddyshack; and finally become a golfer himself. Some great stories about playing golf with Michael Jordan, Clint Eastwood, Scott Simpson, and Kevin Costnar, etc. Murray also talks about his family and his will to be in show business. There're occasionally some special sections with other people's comments on Bill like Chevy Chase, etc. Furthermore, you can see some pictures of baby Murray and Murray as Pat Boone! You don't have to be a Bill Murray fan to like this book. This is a book for those who are interested in humor, movies, golf, comedy, and biography!! Read this! I enjoy every page of the book and so would you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Masterspiece","review":"If, like me, you thought that a book about golf by Murray, who caddied as a boy, starred in Caddyshack, and has played golf with dozens of celebrities and pro golfers would be revealing, funny, and touching, think again.Cinderella Story is a slapdash collection of uninteresting stories that are about as funny as a Saturday Night Live skit.The book is so incoherent you may think that the pages were organized at random. A complete waste of time and an insult to any Bill Murray fan who might be suckered into buying this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"missed the mark","review":"I found the book a very \\"jerky\\" read. It seems to be the product of a mind that is hyperactive and it often only has relavence to the author. It's too \\"cute\\". The largely biographical book is neither funny, informative and certainly not interesting. Pass on this one if you want some substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly disappointing!","review":"Bill Murray is a wonderful visual comedian. He should stick to that. This rambling discourse on his life and golf exploits may bring back humorous memories to himself, but for the most part, it leaves the reader wondering just what the heck Bill is going on about. I love Bill Murray the comedic actor, but this book is simply not worth the paper it was printed on and certainly not worth the time I wasted reading it. If negative stars were allowed, I would give this book -4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Gonzo\\" Book on Golf","review":"This book reads the way most people play golf, all over the fairway, which is not to say it lacks direction or purpose. It reads like works by a certain 'Gonzo Journalist' who if you don't know or understand you will not like this book. It is in the grand tradition of Kerouac, Cassidy, and Thompson. It is not Golfing in the Kingdom but it is entertaining and revealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Diehard Bill Murray fans and Golf Enthusiasts Only","review":"If you're buying this book hoping for a typical Hollywood memoir, forget it. This book is as offbeat and unusual as Murray's unique brand of comedy. I'm not a golf fan by any stretch but reading this book did make me appreciate the sport a little more and it certainly conveyed the comedian's passion for it.Buried throughout the book are reminisces about Murray's childhood and does provide some fascinating insight into the man's worldview and how golf helped shape his life. I quite enjoyed this book and it is good, light reading that won't take you too long to read. In many respects it reads like a monologue delivered by Murray -- it rambles, it sometimes veers in and out of logic, but it is also quite funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I reaaallly wanted this to be a good book, but it just was not well written. I found the best parts to be the one page segments from some of Bill friends and the pictures.Other than that I could not follow this book and wound up tossing it aside. I doubt very much if I'll ever finish it.Now I know that Bill Murray likes to scam people in a comical way, I guess this book was his way of doing just that."},{"rating":"1","title":"My one-word review would be \\"Huh?\\"","review":"I love Bill Murray. I'm sure he has funny stories to tell, but they did not translate to the written word in this book. Maybe the audio version of the book works better. Or maybe it works better if you're a golfer. I'm not. My thought throughout this book was, \\"Huh? I don't get it.\\"Murray is not a writer, but George Peper supposedly is. As I see it, it was Murray's job to tell the stories and Peper's job to craft them into a book. Peper didn't do his job.This is disjointed, unprofessional, impossible to follow, and not worth the trouble. But I still love Bill Murray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found the book terribly disjointed and aimless. At times, the book was difficult to read and follow what Murray was talking about, and whether a particular anecdote ever had a conclusion, let alone any resolution. Most of the text goes nowhere, and has little to do with golf. Worse yet, the humor sorely lacks. I received the book as a gift and am glad I didn't pay money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Golf Related Book I Have Ever Read!","review":"This Cinderella is a real pumkin.

The book was funny at times and the photos were great, but it was difficult to follow the entire tale. If Bill was given the opportunity, I think he would be better at illustrating a children's book of poetry instead. I hear he has an artistic side, and I would like to see how he would draw. His appearance on Letterman promoting this book was enjoyable. If he was offered the chance to collaborate on some children's poems, I'd really be interested to see his creative sparks fly. I'd also be interested in reading a book by Bill about his involvement with the Saint Paul Saints..."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unmitigated disaster","review":"This appalling mess of a \\"book\\" has too little golf to satisfy golfers and too little humor to satisfy fans of Bill Murray's comedy. Perhaps we're all missing some inside joke that Murray and Peper have concocted here, in which case I guess the joke's on us. Nonetheless, the authors and everyone associated with this project should be embarrassed to have been a part of it. The only way I can explain its status on the bestseller list is the low price, although it's hardly a bargain even at 50 percent off. If you still want to waste your time on this book, I suggest that you pick it up at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting better","review":"Bill Murray is one of the funniest people in television and motion pictures today. Unfortunately he seems to have wandered into entertainment territories unknown- books. Although it has its moments, this book is nothing more than a collection of inside jokes and innuendoes about Mr. Murray's life on and off the golf course. Difficult to follow and understand, the first half of the book is so disjointed and scattered it made me not want to even put in the effort to read the second half. Bill, I love ya, but please stick to what you're best at, don't quit your day job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Light snack","review":"Some Funny moments and some good stories, but way too short. The type setting and tons of pictures left you with the impression of a college sophmore trying to pass off an essay by volume.

I think he is a tremendous comedian. I loved him in Caddyshack. But I hated this book. It is nothing more than his stream-of-consciousness prattling about golf and whatever else entered his head. I would bet that it took him no more than 72 hours to write this puffery. There are few words on a given page, and there are dozens of generally uninteresting photographs. If this had been typeset like a regular book, it would have been 50 pages long at best. It is, to be honest, a rip-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow...Completely disappointing","review":"I purchased this book as I am a golf fan who greatly enjoys this game. I saw this book by Bill Murray and thought it would be comical and entertaining. Sadly, I'm greatly disappointed.This book flits around from topic to topic without any coherent story line or plot. I found myself going back after turning a page to check if I had skipped a page because the story line was so incoherent. The story flows like the drunken ramblings of that old guy in the clubhouse with a funny smell who can't wait to tell you about how he started playing golf in 1930.Do yourself a favor and skip this purchase, or just light your cigar with the $10 bill you would have spent on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny stuff","review":"Maybe I'm biased because I think Caddyshack is the funniest movie of all time, but I enjoyed this book, even though it only took a couple of hours to read. It won't win any awards for composition, but that doesn't take away from the fact that it's a really funny, entertaining book...sounds like Caddyshack the movie, doesn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"I wanted to love it and found that I could only tolerate it.

We named our daughter Isabelle after the scene in Razor's Edge where he's wandering through the Paris mansion, desperately calling her name. Huge. After reading this book, I really want to see him play golf in one of these celebrity tournaments. I think it would be a hoot. But the book wasn't. It fell short for me, although the little tidbits of the Bill we know and love, which were sprinkled throughout, kept me reading to the end. The photos and captions are worth keeping it on the shelf.

This was BAD....","review":"I was at the local library looking at books in the golf section. I've read a couple by Tommy Armour and one by Ben Hogan, both were good and informative.I saw three copies of this Murry prose on the shelf. Thought, hey this should be good and interesting. I quickly noticed that all 3 copies had not been creased, thus unread.Went and sat down and started reading.....then my mind started to wonder...then I flipped through and looked at the pictures....then quickly returned the book to the shelf. Bill, stick with the game itself and leave the word processor to sending quips to Chevy.The stories did not grab me, the humor was non-existant, and there were very little facts that I could grasp of interest.I did like the movie Caddyshack, but Dangerfield stole that show, Carl the groundskeeper didn't really do much for me as a character or make me laugh.

The DVD teaches cane technique with emphasis on tai chi and its use of leverage rather than brute strength. I believe that there is a new cane self defence style being taught in parts of the US that may take from tai chi technique or similar. Have you heard of or scene Cane Fu? They seem very similar to me. With the help of this DVD you can practise useful drills with an opponent or against a bob boxing doll as I have.

Ms. Wroe, through skillful weaving of fact with some invention of presumed but plausible dialogue, makes the entire era come alive: Who, for instance, would have thought the business community was so lively in 1370? The book was originally promoted as being parallel to the divided city of Sarajevo, but that's not the point. Savor the events, the characters, even their names - who can forget Alamanda Fromenta and Huc Farcel? - then visit Rodez and the Aveyron.

Bottom line... I found this book insulting to anyone who knows and understands the Biblical accounts of the battles they describe. No wonder Israel is in such bad shape.

From the standpoint of era, while we're mostly in the mid to late 1970s, it's hard to imagine a reader who was a teenager a few years earlier or later feeling out of sync with the goings-on in these interconnected stories.

The plot was excellent, but it was lost in the verbiage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inadequate","review":"Raynes follows the popular fashion of the day, with a style of instruction similar to that of \\"Drawing On The Right Side Of The Brain\\". There is a glaring absence and omission between beginning scrawls and the completed subject. Final drawings are shown, inferring that somehow drawing ability is developed by some mystical process of mental transfer between author and reader. When one considers that there are several dozen books just like Raynes' in their ambiguity, lack of distinction, and omission of intermediate processes, it is gratifying to know that there are still good figure drawing texts on the market; but this just is NOT one of them.Far better for the serious student of FIGURE DRAWING to purchase (1)Jack Hamm, Willy Pogany, Famous Artists School, Walt Reed, \\"Art of Drawing the Human Body\\" as well as Stephen Rogers Peck and Robert Beverly Hale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Da King is King","review":"FPJ blasts in this action-packed dramatic adventure of a Muslim Policeman underestimated by corrupt officials...the movie is well-made, sensitive and dramatic... dialogues are deep, acting is superb...quality of the DVD is good and the purchased product was delivered faster than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best at what they do, doing what they do best","review":"Awesome sampling.. no one crunches behind Neil like Crazy Horse, but PJ is one of the few bands around up to the task.

Give Neil Young credit; he will play with anyone and play many styles of music and he almost always pulls it off. He challenges himself here once again by playing with Pearl Jam and it is one of the best pure rock and roll albums I have ever heard. Neil and Pearl Jam sound as if they are having one hell of a good time doing this and we as listeners are the ones that benefit. This sucker really rocks and is similiar to Ragged Glory. This marriage of ideas does take on its' own style though. The sound is muddy but it appears to have been done that way on purpose and here it works well. It has a great garage band feel to it. There is not a bad cut on this thing. Neil just simply continues to amaze me. He is constantly turning out great stuff no matter how old he gets. How many artists can make that claim?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go To The Mirror","review":"Neil Young & Pearl Jam are kindred spirits and they joined forces for a superb tour in 1994. After the tour, they got together and recorded an album, Mirror Ball. Pearl Jam fills the role of Crazy Horse on the record and Mr. Young is inspired by their youthful vigor. The songs have sharp, punchy sound and are crisp and full of verve. Songs like \\"Act Of Love\\", \\"Downtown\\", \\"Peace & Love\\", \\"I'm The Ocean\\" and \\"Song X\\" are all quality tracks. The band are clearly inspired by playing with one of their heroes and they are as tight as they've ever been. The only minor complaint is that Eddie Vedder appears sporadically throughout the album and it would have been nice to hear him sing on ever song and a few more duets with Mr. Young. The album became one of the biggest hits of Mr. Young's career, peaking at number five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Jam does Crazy Horse!","review":"While this cross-generational experiment was being recorded, somewhere in a parallel universe Eddie Vedder was holed up in a cheap studio with Billy, Ralph & Poncho, running them through chord changes patiently. Eh? Neil conveniently doesn't invite Crazy Horse to the MIRROR BALL sessions, and in the process, is able to get Pearl Jam (minus Eddie) to trim their sound down, eliminate the wanky guitar solos, etc., and we get another good-to-great NY album. The rhythm section here is a tad more upbeat, and certainly crisper, to those whose ears are pleasantly accustomed to the Crazy Horse dirge-like attack. I think Eddie does a little background singing, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is bad NOISE!","review":"I have been a Neil Young fan for years. I love the Neil of old but this was [bad]! Teaming up with the band Toe Jam was a mistake. Almost every song here has been done before and better by Young himself. The songs are not a pleasure to listen to, in fact, they are annoying to no end. Where is the originality?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Neil","review":"This is not Neil's best album, in fact probably the most mediocre (IMO). He should have picked a different band to do a collaboration with than the overrated Pearl Jam. PJ fans will probably like this. Fans of Neil w/ Crazy Horse might like it. Those who like Harvest, Goldrush, etc. the best may not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Being A big Pearl Jam fan I was really looking forward to this album, unfortunately this is just another Neal Young album with Pearl Jam as A backing band. Wanted to like the album, listened to it dozens of times but there is just not much there. Instead of this buy the Pearl Jam / Neal Young EP Merkinball which only contains two songs \\"i got id\\" and \\"long Road\\", much better than Mirror Ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great collaberation and not a great album","review":"Perhaps the most hotly anticipated rock pairing of the 1990s, \\"Mirror Ball\\" wallows in the mediocrity of most supergroups (including, I might add; Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young). As a huge Young fan, it pains me to say that this is the weakest of his 1990s recordings, the decade which overall featured his revival as a major artist. One wishes that Pearl Jam had served as more than just a backing band for the record. Maybe they could have contributed some better songs as Neil was not up to his usual fine standards as a songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jewel Case Version","review":"Beware this version is the plastic jewel case version, not the cardboard case version that is pictured and i was hoping for."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can find better...","review":"This is pretty much a waste of time.

Suggestions? 1) \\"Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere\\" 2) \\"Tonight's The Night\\" 3) \\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" ANY of these three would be a MUCH better choice.

Their music and sound is unique but they are energetic and quite fun to listen to. This CD offers a lot of the Smiths at a good price but understand that this is only part of the story. It has fantastic tracks like \\"Hand in Glove\\", \\"Big Mouth Strikes Again\\" and \\"There is a Light that Never Goes Out\\" but it is missing a ton of great works. Also, though they were singles there are a few tracks on this CD that arent the finest. This is an excellent CD to buy as a first CD but I'll say that if you are willing to make the investment buy all of the albums you will be glad you did. Otherwise start here: this album makes a great mix CD for the car once you have bought all of the albums which you will surely do.Ted Murena"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Smiths are the Beatles of Britian.","review":"Aristotle came to me in my dreams and told me to but this CD.

I am human and I need to be loved...just like anybody else does\\" It's pretty funny at times when he starts talking about spitting in peoplel's eyes and stuff, but the Smiths really do have a knack for writing catchy, nicely flowing, pop songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good Smiths starter kit","review":"This was my first Smiths cd and served as a great introduction to this group (I subsequently have bought 3 other Smiths albums and several Morrissey ones). While it by no means is comprehensive, the album does contain many of the group's finest recorded moments. How Soon Is Now is a particularly outstanding song, although that does not excuse them for including it on no less than 5 albums. It is nice that this album isn't a \\"greatest hits\\" so that all singles are included, whether they hit the charts or bombed (in the UK that is, as the group never had a US hit yet received underground cult status).The cover art is quite Smithian, but the liner notes leave much to be desired (no track info, no lyrics). I would have liked them to do what The Cure did with their singles packages and show the original single picture sleeves, since Smiths artwork was always part of what gave the group a certain mystique."},{"rating":"2","title":"This and \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" are all you need.","review":"Unless you are one of the vanishing tribe of Smiths completists, the eponymous first album, this collection of singles, and \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" contains all that is listenable and enduring from this quartet. Many elevate Morrisey (vocals, lyrics) and Marr (ethereal guitar work), but the rhythm section of the Smiths is oft overlooked, with a bass (Andy Rourke, a friend of Marr's) and drum (Mike Joyce) that never overwhelm, nor embellish, but consistently round out and support strong lead vocals and guitars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly written music!","review":"My brother was always a huge Smiths fan, and I only discovered them through him. I am glad I did, this cd comes with me in the car, and follows me into the house to the stereo. I can't get enough or say enough about it. It is too bad they are not together anymore, their music will be around for eternity. \\"How Soon is Now\\" always struck me as sad and was the song I most recognized from them, but they are also really upbeat and a great way to start out in the morning.

I actually purchased this DVD at Sam's wholesale for $8.99 and it's worth every penny. Beware, this is an intense workout and I think you'll love it if you're a P90Xer or enjoy Yoga. Great job Bob!

Awesome for beginners like me but there are some advanced modifications for the experienced yoga people. Bob does a great job of explaining the poses so you don't have to crane your neck to watch.I've done a few other yoga videos that have caused a lot of discomfort and didn't offer modifications. This workout doesn't do that and really seems to fit my style.Recommended for sure. TEAM BOB!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid yoga workout without the spiritual stuff but...","review":"I was hoping this would be a harder workout from his previous yoga video, thats just not the case. This is great for a lighter, all inclusive yoga day, stretching, strengthen, great ab work, and difficult balance poses. Bob moves the positions along fairly quickly, not allowing much time to dig in and hold the position for muscle fatique or get a nice long stretch, but the pace certainly doesn't allow you to get bored either. The seperate ab workout alone is a killer and worth the price of the video. In comparison, Biggest Loser video does not contain the balance poses but does have a lot more planks, push ups, and T stands which I like to have for a greater upper body workout, plus a light hand weight section. Bob's Biggest Loser weightloss yoga is a more strengthening and sweat producing workout. Yoga Warrior will definitely be used in my rotation, just not as much as Bob's weightloss yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"As the video starts Bob says get ready for a yoga workout like you've never done before. Well I did the whole dvd and found this was a very basic yoga dvd nothing innovative or different like he promised. Nothing special I would not waste my money on this. There are many more quality intermediate level yoga dvds that are way better such as radiant flow which is an excellent dvd or Sadie Nardini much more quality yoga without the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweaty workout","review":"who said yoga was easy?...after 15 mins of the one hour workout my sweat glands were active as like running a 5k...and it's for all levels since the guy in the back is less flexible and does a easier routine.

So this DVD stands for its title; it is 'warrior' indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is a total distraction","review":"The music for this DVD seems mismatched, maybe it was a mistake?

The moves were interesting and different than other yoga DVD's I have done, and they really can make you sweat. Great quality workout if you want a day off of cardio.Best of Luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I've been doing yoga regularly for over three years and I had been looking for yoga dvd's that I can do on the weekends or days that I can't get to the yoga studio but the ones I've found haven't given me that same kind of intense yoga workout that I'm used to - until I found yoga for the warrior! Also my husband does obstacle course races like the Spartan Race series and wanted to add yoga to his training routine but couldn't get into any of the yoga dvds until I brought this one home. Beginners may find this a little too intense but it's great for those who are already very athletic and want to add yoga to their workout routine or for those who already do yoga and want to take it to the next level. I do wish that Bob would talk more about protecting your core when doing certain poses and of course one limitation that all yoga dvd's will have is that the teacher isn't there w/ you to correct you if you're doing a pose wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good yoga DVD, but needed more instruction.","review":"There are many yoga DVDs out there that are simply not challenging enough for me and this one did. Although the poses themselves are not difficult (many basic postures), Bob has put together a very nice advanced yoga flow.With that being said, my main concern with this DVD is alignment. If you do not have a proper background of yoga, then this is not a good place to start. Alignment is super important and he only touched on it a few times. I noticed a few of the poses where the people in the DVD were out of alignment and no explaination was given to fix it.But, overall, if you are looking for a more challenging/advanced/power yoga type of DVD and understand proper form, then this is a good buy. I am looking forward to using this one again and growing stronger from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Yoga Workout","review":"This is a good yoga workout. I also really like the 15 minutes of abs he has on this DVD. Both are challenging workouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I bought this video as a way to incorporate yoga and strength on days when I felt like changing things up a bit. I have many of Jillian's videos, some Biggest Loser videos and Bob's Pure Burn Strength video. This video was just okay, the yoga moves did not challenge me very much at all. This may be good for beginner's. And I don't consider myself advanced at all anymore now that I am back in school full time and work out maybe 3x per week. Now, am intermediate at best. I really like Bob, but this one was a little disappointing. I give it two stars because I don't like it and was not challenged. The title Yoga for the Warrior was deceiving."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast shipping, amazing workout","review":"I've never had any issues ordering DVDs from Amazon and this one arrived on time and in good shape as usual. About the product specifically, this is a HARD workout. But you feel amazing afterward. The 60-minute yoga spends the first half wearing you out completely and then calms down a bit so that by the end, you feel brand new. Dead ... but new. Lol.I also love the 15-minute ab workout.

Nothing is as good as seeing them live (WHAT A SHOW!!), but this disc really gives to a glimpse of what they are all about...some great all-American rock-n-roll. Everyone should have at least one BoDeans CD (I have them all), and if you can only get one, this is the one to get!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BoDeans get you jumping up and down and dancing all night","review":"Joe Dirt Car captures the BoDeans at their finest moment, live. The album starts off with the mellow \\"Idaho\\" and mixes nicely with BoDeans hits from their previous albums giving the listener a sense of being there. Joe Dirt Car brings the liveliness of the concert experience and at the same time creating an intimacy that the BoDeans always supply. This album is worthy of so much more than one or two listens. It should be a part of your daily routine. (Great for an aerobic workout.) I recommend jumping and dancing highly as I'm sure you will find out at first play."},{"rating":"2","title":"great disc","review":"this is one of the best discs i have ever heard. every track is golden. i wish this was a four set disc because it i never get tired of listening to it. this one is worth every cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jealous","review":"Jealous. That's what I am. I have read every review of this album and most make some mention of having seen the band in concert before. Sadly, I have not.Now, however, I can at least listen to their concert!Read the reviews. There is not a single bad review here. Not many bands generate support that strong. BoDeans have not been particularly prolific - 8 albums in 15 years - but each is strong. How many bands put out an album where every song is worth hearing?Also, investigate the solo albums by Kurt Neumann and Sam Llanas (Absinthe). Again, strong productions that beg to be listened to over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best live CDs I've ever heard","review":"Normally, I'm not a fan of live CDs. Many bands don't deliver or the recording is lame. Not here. These are great performances of a band that deserved a lot more attention than it got. One thing you notice right away... this is a band that's about as unpretentious as you're ever going to get. You get the sense that the Bodeans are truly in touch with their audience. There's no lasers or smoke machines. Just meat and potatoes rock delivered with something lacking in many other bands--PASSION. I really wish I could have been in the audience at some of these shows. I highly recommend \\"Joe Dirt Car\\" is anyone who appreciates stuff like early REM and early Springsteen. You aren't likely to be disappointed. Take the song \\"True Devotion\\"... sounds like acoustic Springsteen at his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"It moves","review":"IT should not move. But it does.

Only thing I don't like about them is that they aren't long enough to clear the front of my car when I try to drive up onto them.

It slid 6 out of 6 time and thank god it slid away from car and did not hit anythung serious, but it can also damage the car. When one slides and the other tire stays half way up, the car is slanted and you are always scared if one of the ramps gets wedged under the car.

I wish they would make one with lower height and longer (lower degree of ascend)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.","review":"The product has turned out well. The bad part was the delivery.

DANGEROUS!","review":"Two weekends ago, a friend and I decided to enjoy the fall foilage by doing some hiking. We picked up \\"50 Hikes in the Hudson Valley\\" and were on our way. We chose to hike Mount Taurus, outside of Cold Springs (Hike #7). We carried the book with us, and never strayed from marked areas. Nonetheless . . .BY TRYING TO FOLLOW THIS BOOK'S INSTRUCTIONS, WE ENDED UP STUCK ON MOUNT TAURUS IN THE COLD, DARK NIGHT FOR FOUR HOURS!!! If we had not had cell phones, and if the Cold Springs rescue team had not been as fabulous as it was, we would probably be dead.The worst part, was that after the rescue team pulled us off Mount Taurus, they told us that during the last year FIVE GROUPS OF PEOPLE had been rescued -- after trying to hike using this book!Unsurprisingly, I would advise that NO-ONE buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unmaintained Trails","review":"I can't fully judge this book yet, but if the first hike we did was any indication, this book isn't worth it.

The whole thing is one big pink disaster right now and I have no idea how to fix it unless I have a seamstress take it apart and readjust the foam and then see if she can somehow fix the plastic wire.I would recommend only if your dog is 100% sparkling clean at ALL times and you NEVER plan on washing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"....","review":"Chihuahua stepped on it...and then collapsed never could get back the way it was so I threw it out. My Chihuahua was only 3 pounds. Company never responded to my emails."},{"rating":"2","title":"His masterpiece","review":"I've been an Oldfield fan since my early teens, and in his music I have discovered many seminal moments. Ommadawn is awesome, and he performed that aged 22. The last movement of Crises is a visceral onslaught, with the tour-de-force Simon Phillips in harmony on the drums. There have been glimpses of brilliance throughout the years, and, let's face it, plenty of disappointments, yet in The Songs of Distant Earth Mike Oldfield produced his masterpiece. So many reviews here say it all: this one carries you away, and the whole Universe is open to you. It really is a unique piece, and good enough to be described as close to perfection, wave after wave of luscious composition, layer upon layer of floating synth, lilting guitar, and then that crescendo guitar atop Track 16, Ascension. No-one makes the guitar wail like Mike - the musical equivalent of a great orgasm leading to the beginnings of life, and in outer-space. Yes, the man got this one so bang-on right. Beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is everybody crazy?","review":"this album ... it's painfully slow and often seems like a poor [copy] of ENIGMA.

Clarke, imagine my suprise upon discovering a CD that was inspired by the novel.Because of my great fondness for ambient/non-traditional music, I had to pick up a copy. I was not disappointed. The blending of various concepts in the music - voice, synth, percussion - all lead to a pleasing mix that is soothing and just perfect (at least for me) to read by.Until I got a copy of the soundtrack to Solaris, this was my 'read by it' CD of choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Moonlight Shadows, To Frances and Islands gone?","review":"I've heard him play a few songs of this should-be-great album on the Rotterdam 1999 Then And Now concert but after hearing it, as an Oldfield fan, I immediately decided I had heard the whole CD... Where are the rocksongs and good arrangements gone? Never thought Mike would go the tranquill way. Sorry Mike, but I've heard better stuff from you (such as Tub Bells 1 and 2, Guitars, Crises, Five Miles Out, Ommadawn, Earth Moving)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where have the melodies gone?","review":"Is he trying to become Brian Eno or what? If it's space music you want, stick to \\"Apolo - Atmospheres & Soundtracks\\" and you'll be fine. This stuff sounds pompous, self-righteous and grandiose, but the musicwriting is ridiculously weak. The vocal samples, the \\"hi-tech\\" synths and effects are all gimmicks, throw there to conceal the absolute lack of melodies and musical ideas. Really, it tries to show more than it has. It's a void, insubstantial piece of fluff. And Mike's guitar playing sounds uninspired and dull, as if he's absolutely sure that everything and anything he plays will necessarily be utter genius. I've never heard such a disappointing album in my life. If he wanted to create atmospheres, he should go back and listen to Hergest Ridge, not the latest Enigma albums and try to do a cheap copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bombastic Fluff","review":"It is not surprising to see that the overwhelmingly positive reviews this cd has received generates, in the main, from sci-fifans (who listen to the cd as illustrative of Clarke's fiction) or from listeners who have little to no experience with Oldfield's back catalog. It is gratifying to find that so many listeners find great pleasure from this cd, but, speaking for myself (and likely for many other MO fans) I suggest that thoselisteners who had their first intro to Oldfield with this music and who DIDNT like it, should try TB II or QE 2 before dismissingOldfield's music. Relative to most of Mike's earlier music, thiscd is bombastic, new age-easy listening fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhimsky-Korsicov has a student","review":"I was introduced to this title through a friend and has be- come one of my most used cd\`s.

If I had to take only 5 of his albums to the proverbial desert island, this would be one of them. The other four? Crises. Incantations.

It is excellent in itself, both with new tunes but also with the \\"Tubular Bells\\" theme, which has earned its rights as one of my most listened-to records (along with Five Miles Out, and Crises). It is also a really great visualization of the Clarke book, especially with the Hibernaculum where you feel like in a tomb, and the Ascension where the feeling of being put to sleep and journey on, is very well expressed by the hypnotic voice and the voyager-theme which carries the whole record. I can recommend both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updated Review","review":"I wrote a Review before, a great CD by Mike Oldfield no doubt, but the songs are damaged from 11-th to 17-th.

A short but not bad history and the gameplay very cool you can fire cannons in the sea and have a swords duel in land but if you do not like to duel with swords you also have a pistol (but very limited ammo).

I though it would be fabulous because I luved the movie. But it wasn't. The only reason i gave this 2 stars was because the graphics were great. The players are slow moving, and it becaimes frustrating because the enemys move faster. Also they are hard to control. I often found myself hitting pillows and other vcarious objects around me in frustration. The levels are super easy. I returned it and got another one in hope that the game was just messed up and the charecters would move faster. HA HA they never did. it was basically a waste of money.

Jack with a sense of morality.If you've never seen the movie, have been living under a rock, and are 7-12 years old you would probably like this game. The graphics are decent, and the levels are challenging (considering the short life meter).

The first one of a pair popped in the dryer (I accidentally put it in there thinking it would be okay) so after that I never put it in the dryer again) but the other 7 of them (31/2) pairs popped in the washer. Honestly I think they would even do this after hand washing, but I don't hand wash things. They need to be washed because for some reason pads of any type make you sweat more.

The author spends nearly 350 pages revealing things that are obvious to absolutely anyone. He tell us how smiles usually mean happiness, crying usually means you're sad, and faces that look angry.....CONVEY ANGER! The writing style is painful to read. I assume the writer is in his late 70's but trying to be \\"hip and with it.\\" There are aweful jokes through out. He also likes lists and bullets that outline painfully obvious body language rules to follow. How do you tell if someone doesn't like how you're touching them? Are they wincing and flinching? Telling you to stop? Crying? It really goes like this. I couldn't finish this book, you shouldn't start it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money . . .","review":"This book is so basic and boring.

When I read the first page, I thought a seven year old wrote it. Bobbie Darden has the ability to bore the reader with his mundane and souless style of writing.

VERY impressive soda geysers all over my driveway. The birthday party full of 11 year old boys went absolutely nuts with glee.#2 MessyAccidents happen. Sometimes the bottle falls over if you pull too hard, sometimes soda comes out the holes for the pin. Sometimes your kid picks up the gushing geyser bottle and chasing his friends around the yard with it. It's messy. It's supposed to be messy. Be prepared.#3 ExpensiveAfter I bought this on Amazon I saw it in the Toys R Us checkout line for half the price. If you're going there any time soon, don't bother buying it on Amazon.#4 ALSO:Be sure to read the instructions. The first time we didn't screw the tube onto the soda bottle and the fountain was more of a gusher coming out all sides of the soda bottle. And don't lost the pin!

The kids loved it, but the biggest fan turned out to be grandma. The geyser shot up between 25-30 feet, and it worked perfectly both times. The pieces in the kit are simple but made well.

The ease of use and well thought out design were well worth the few bucks it cost. The only thing I would improve is that I would have included different size nozzles to add to the educational value and fun. Most of what I read on home made geysers recommend a smaller hole than the one this has. I am thinking of fitting a disk inside the nozzle to try to increase the height of the geyser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four failed attempts in a row!","review":"I bought this for my children last summer.

First time it shot out the side and the second time I made sure it was as tight as tight can be and the Mentos got stuck in the tube! I tried to get them down but it was too late a couple had already gone down in and I couldn't get them to drop down fast enough to do anything other than you could accomplish by shaking up the bottle!All in all it was very disappointing.

I couldn't take it anymore after a while, because he just wasn't going anywhere and wasn't saying anything that I hadn't heard before from Napoleon Hill. I would recommend reading and listening to the products by Napoleon Hill instead of this idiot Proctor. Proctor is a cheap, really bad rip-off of Napoleon Hill.

We were only 30 at the time and still listening to Inxs and George Michael etc... so had never even heard of Johnny Hartman!!) Well 10 years and 3 kids later we are completely addicted to this album. My husband knows that if this is on when he gets home it will be in a very nice evening indeed.About two years ago we lost this cd - probably on a weekend away - and spent another year trying to replace it. There wasnt a single music store in Australia that had a new or second hand copy in stock. Where did they all go ?? I ended up ordering it from the U.K. - it took 3 months and cost $30 ( approx $50 us). Needless to say we have several copies of it now and continue to play it constantly. We now own various Hartman/Washington albums but the mix on this album ( plus we are big fans of Clint's) just seems to be perfect.

However, the pace of the tape is so slow that it could be a partial cure for insomnia. The music track is sedate to the point of being acceptable background music in an elevator and there are significant gaps in the narration. Furthermore, some of the images are maintained longer than is really necessary. I found it so boring that I had to watch it in segment approximately 20 minutes in length. With so much material to work with, it was disappointing that the producers chose to go slow when they could have sped up the pace and covered so much more information about a state with so much to offer."},{"rating":"1","title":"anachronistic","review":"while a well researched and argued piece, this book fails its readers as an anachronistic piece of scholarship. the \\"key pillars\\" of judicial integirty that the author negatively defines contemporary canadian jurists against crumbled long ago into the dust of ozymendias.while self-evident that everyone should wish to support a judiciary that sports both honesty and integrity, the authors true intention is to butress a school of legal philosophy that is over 100 years old. these formalist and positivist notions of legal decision making and knowledge building are as dead as notions of national homogenaity and elitist decision making. further, it is ridiculous to attempt to dichotomize the legal system from politics, as does this book, because they are one and the same. understanding how that relationship should be re-articulated is the work of future scholars. this book is the work of one whose time has passed."},{"rating":"2","title":"fans of Code Lyoko","review":"My family is a big fan of this series.

Thick rubber is just about the worst material they could have chosen for that... I thought. However upon using it, I noticed that the steam actually makes the rubber a lot softer and more flexible when it's flowing through it. Therefore, when it's working, it's actually a pretty nice machine.The steamer also started up pretty quickly, in a couple of minutes steam was flowing. I usually iron shirts right before I use them, so the quantity of water, though short (another reviewer said it only lasts 15 minutes) is fine for me.The metal pole where you're supposed to hang your clothes from is of a comfortable length."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is it really Professional?????","review":"All-in-all I would say yes!

After hearing a few great reviews of it from friends who already owned it, I decided to just take a chance and buy it; after all, it was 1/2 the price of some of the others I was considering.I purchased it primarily to steam my handknit sweaters, but it has quickly gone into everyday use for my regular clothes too. It heats up quickly and does a perfect job. I would give it 5 stars except the water reservoir is a bit awkward to fill and no matter how careful I am, I always seem to spill a little water when I try to put it back in.

My longest duration of continuous use was about 15 minutes. After each use I promptly turned it off and unplugged it. I was pleased with initial results. It did a great job warming water quickly and removing stubborn wrinkles with ease. However, with no warning it now fails to warm water and produce steam. I used it successfully less than two weeks ago but now when I turn it on the red power light illuminates but nothing else happens.

It got a good work out for two days using only distilled water as instructed. I drained the unit and dried it as well as I could and stored it in a closet until last weekend (August 2012)when I pulled it out to steam some shirts. It worked for about five shirts before it began cycling off and cooling down every minute or so. It would steam a minute and then I would have to wait for it to get hot enough to produce steam again. Eventually, it quit steaming altogether. If you're looking for a disposable steamer, this one did a great job first time around. I was not looking for a disposable steamer, so I'm not all that excited about its performance any longer. (At least it made it through the wedding.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful steamer do not buy this product","review":"I got this steamer for work about 3 months ago. I do a lot of product photography and needed a good steamer for clothing. At first the steamer worked fine. I was a little disappointed with the capacity of the water tank which is hardly any water at all but it still steamed the clothes so that wasn't a huge deal. However, the hose and handle get really, really hot. Almost too hot to hold so we had to wrap a towel around the handle just to use it. Then yesterday I was steaming as normal and the hose completely broke off of the base unit. It's just a small plastic piece that connects the two and I think it just got so hot it broke. Now it's unusable and very hard to contact their customer service. If you're planning on using your steamer longer that 2 months do NOT buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesnt work!","review":"Bought this steamer a year ago and used it a handful of times - worked ok at first but now does not produce steam. Followed instructions to clean with vinegar but that hasnt helped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"The first time I got this steamer, the little plastic ring that screws the hose onto the base crumbled into pieces when I tried to attach it. Amazon was awesome about sending me another one right away and arranging for me to send the broken one back hassle-free. But beware when you are putting it together to not tighten that ring too much.I've had the steamer itself for over a year now, and I have not used an iron since. It works really well and does what it's supposed to. Just be careful not to catch your finger or hand in the steam...ouch! If something is really really wrinkly and a thicker fabric, it is not too effective since you'd have to hold the steamer over the wrinkle forever, but for suits, pants, skirts, dresses, jeans, and shirts that have normal post-washing or wearing wrinkles it works great.Definitely not a top of the line steamer, it's still a bit flimsy, but for the price, it's a pretty good one that has been very useful to me for over a year now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great steamer, good customer support","review":"I purchased this steamer about 3 months ago and use it almost every day. It heats up quickly, produces a good amount of steam, and works very well. You can fill the reservoir about halfway (using distilled water) and if you only steam a few items every day the water will last in the unit for weeks. I haven't had any problems with leaking. One minor problem: I discovered the other day that one of the clamps that holds up the telescoping pole was cracked and the pole would not stay up. I just called customer service and they're sending out a new pole right away. I'm pleased that they have responded so quickly to the problem. I'd recommend this product highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"When my new steamer arrived today, I was excited to give it a try.

I'm happy I purchased this item & would gladly recommend to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Steamer","review":"I do like the SteamFast.

Heats up in about 45 seconds and produces excellent dry-clean look outcomes on your shirts. I use this mainly for suits and work clothes, works great on all.The only thing is that the stick does not go tall enough and so sometimes if you want to steam the bottom area of your pants, the hose isn't necessarily long enough for you to do so easily.

All of my shirts look very sharp and any smells from the item are wiped out.It does not work well on heavy fabric, like pants.

I was used to unfolding the ironing board and ironing with a stainless steel steam iron. I am so glad to have this steamer. The telescoping pole is great. The steamer heats up very quickly.If I had owned one of these in the 80's,I would have probably had more dates."},{"rating":"1","title":"After a month, only creates steam for 30 seconds","review":"I bought this about 2 years ago, and still regret it. It works well for about 30 seconds, then it just stops producing steam. The reservoir is full, the switch is on and lit up, and the handle is up high, but it just stops steaming. It's very frustrating when two people need a shirt steamed before a night out, and you have to speed through them to make sure you have enough time to get both done before the steam stops flowing. Other people have complained about this so I know the one I have is not just broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for!","review":"I bought this steamer based on all of the reviews here, so I was surprised when a couple of days after using it, I ended up throwing it out.In a nutshell, it doesn't work well. I don't know if it's cheaply made, or has some sort of faulty system in place, but this steamer does not work as well as professional ones. I've used lots of commercial steamers at my job at a fashion company, and I've never encountered a steamer that worked so shoddily. I only wish I would have kept the box, so I could have returned it. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this clunker, just because the price is good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I bought this product thinking I would be better off steam cleaning my clothes to pro long their life. And it worked. One thing I noticed with the steamfast is a peculiar smell when I first used it. I thought \\"hey, maybe this will go away after the first use\\" Nope. I steam cleaned 5 shirts the third time I used it and the burning plastic smell was so bad that my wife who had just entered the room had to leave immediately. I was light-headed, dazed and a little nauseous. 1.5 hrs later, I am typing this review, still feeling a little weird. DO NOT BUY THIS. You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not real happy","review":"The steamer itself works well. The hose on the other hand, is very stiff and gets very hot to the touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"steamfast","review":"This steamer is very dissappointing. The only thing I like about it is the wheels on the bottom for moving around. The steamer itself gurgles the whole time (even after holding the hose up like instructions say). It spits hot water out on clothes and on the person using the appliance. It does not do a good job at all steaming the garments. I have used other steamers before and this was by far the worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke immediately....cheap parts","review":"I saw so many good reviews, I ignored the bad reviews, of which there are 26. It broke while I was putting it together. The hose that screws on to the base is really poorly made part, and it broke as I screwed the hose on to the base.

The steam works intermittently ... if at all.

Now, about 8 months since we bought it (and we don't use it that much, as we have a cleaning lady that irons so it's only for emergencies) it has become completely useless, the steam connector is leaking so almost no steam comes out and it becomes a possible hazard.I've tried going for the cheap one, but now I'll have to go for the expensive one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spits Water and Takes Out Smells Not Wrinkles","review":"After reading the great reviews, I purchased this clothing steamer to remove unwanted wrinkles in my fiances dress shirts. This steamer was very loud and it spit water down the front of the shirts as it would steam them. I was hoping there was a kink in the beginning and it would get better, but it did not. I followed the manufacturers instructions and used distilled water but it still didnt help. The water being spit on his shirts created more wrinkles than what they org. had. We did use it on his wool peacoat which worked great to get the smells and a few light surface stains off of it. But, if you are looking for something to get your cotton shirts, dress shirts and other clothing items steamed I would not recommend it. Mabey mine was defective but Im going to try ordering the Jiffy 2000 and see if it does the trick. On consumer reviews website it is rated one of the best steamers in terms of its performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad for the price","review":"Have had the SteamFast for 2 weeks and have used it 3-4 times. Pros: Heats up quick. Easy to operate. Price. Easy to store. Cons: It's little bit too lightweight in both stability and steam ejection. Bottom line: It's probably worth the $50.00 we paid but now realize that a heavier, more stable unit with a higher volume of steam output would have been a better investment even at twice the price, a unit that you can hang 3 or 4 shirts on - not worry about it tipping over, hit them with a high volume of steam and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointed . . . does not work well","review":"I got this steamer in the mail yesterday, immediately set it up, filled it with the recommended distilled water, turned it on, waited 5 minutes (as another reviewer suggested), pulled a bunch of wrinkled poly/cotton blend shirts out of the closet, and was ready to steam like crazy . . .But to my HUGE disappointment, found that it just doesn't work all that well. Wrinkles don't come out unless you make multiple passes and pull a lot on the fabric at the same time - I kept burning myself in the process. And the wrinkles just wouldn't budge from some fabrics. Seems to do the best job on 100% cotton with only mild wrinkles.I wasn't expecting crispness from a steamer. I was, however, expecting to be able to get wrinkles out with less difficulty than ironing - which just isn't the case with this steamer.In all honestly, I'll probably end up giving it away. It's not even close to a substitute for an iron."},{"rating":"1","title":"completely disappointed","review":"My hand held steamer developed a leak in the seam where the plastic halves connect, so I got this steamer to replace it. What a complete disappointment. The water only lasts long enough for three items of clothing, the pole is six inches too short, when you try to do the cuffs of pants you can't because the hose folds in half, and the hose gets hot because it's not insulated. I do not recommend this steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read all of the raves here and decided to purchase this steamer for my dress shirts. I don't have curtains or any other fabrics to steam so I can't comment on this steamer's performance in those areas.Pros: Does heat up quickly, in around 30 seconds or less. Takes up less space than a fold out ironing board.Cons: Needs distilled water. Does not do a good job removing wrinkles from my men's dress shirts that I hang dry. I had to make multiple passes with the steamer to even have a noticeable affect on some wrinkles. Other wrinkles would not come out no matter how long I steamed them, while also pulling on the fabric. If you're looking for something to give your shirts that crisp, sharp look from ironing and dry cleaning, this won't do it (At least it didn't for me)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disppointed and returned for refund","review":"The item arrived with a damaged coupling. Checked it and found that the coupling for connecting the hose to boiler is very weak, Definitely it is a defective design on the materials. Cannot use it and spent time to return it.

Bummer. I've only had it 2 months. Not even."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded Expectations!","review":"If you are on the line of purchasing a steamer, I urge you to do it. However, ANY steamer will not be able to remove stubborn wrinkles from 100% cotton fabrics. This little steamer does an awesome job at steaming lighter and medium fabrics, business and office apparel, and even heavier drapes. I can steam out wrinkles from clothes laying on the floor, or wrinkles out of my slacks straight out of the washer. All in all I would definitely buy it again & again. Just sorry I didn't purchase it sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work as advertised","review":"I had really high hopes for this item, imaging a world where I never had to iron work shirts and pants again. My hopes were quickly dashed, however, the first few times I used this product. If I ironed a \\"wrinkle-free\\" shirt that was slightly imperfect, the steaming made it look a little nicer. Not crisp like an iron, but presentable. Non-\\"wrinkle-free\\" shirts, on the other hand, were completely unwearable after steaming. An iron was still in order.I also had a hard time making creases. The product comes with a creasing pad, but it was awkward to use and I kept burning myself. Perhaps with practice this could have gotten easier, but after several small burns I didn't want to try anymore.I am returning this item and going back to the drawing... or shall we say ironing... board.Oh yes, and this item did not arrive as pictured.

The steamer also began to leak, drip, and spit out water toward the end of its short life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will still have to iron","review":"I was disappointed, as the steamer did not make the crisp no wrinkles my iron does, and rayon does not work at all with this. Only cotton and wool. Not as easy to get going as an iron, and it takes warming up, and then it goes for like 5 minutes, and takes time to warm up again.

I am very glad I purchased this steamer, as it works superbly. It gets wrinkles out easily on delicate materials and warms up very quick. The only negative feedback is that I wish the unit was more sturdy. The caster wheels are very weak, the length of the steamer itself needs to be longer to steam drapes, and the hanger holder can't hold heavy items like jackets, thus it tips over. Every item has it cons, but all in all I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I bought this SteamFast to steam a houseful of brand new lined drapes.

I just ordered another brand and hope for better luck with that product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but needs wheel lock","review":"I am pleased with the product and find it suits my at home needs (I'm probably 10 garments/wk). The one downside is on my hard wood floor the roller wheels can be frustrating, so brakes/locks would be great. Also the base could handle more weigh to reduce tipping once water is low. The positive out weighs the bad and a little getting used to it has lessened the impact."},{"rating":"2","title":"steamer","review":"fantastic! worth every penny.

I was able to steam a wool jacket, press a shirt (with the included press pad), and steam a silk dress with ease.When I first assembled the product, I felt that the product was a bit flimsy. You have to be careful when you hang up a heavy item on the hook holder to steam. When I steamed my wool jacket, it almost toppled over but I was able to catch it in time (this was even with the water container filled).I previously indicated that the reservoir is hard to empty, but I realized after examining the product that there is a drain plug at the bottom.

I love Amazon Warehouse, while I hate to admit it in an open forum since then I will have to share in the deals with others... Ok so the package arrives and as usually it looks to be brand new. I set up the steamer and while it does have a little sputtering of water every so often so I would be careful if you are quickly running it over silk. But its great so far, no iron shine, no worry about appliques being melted by the hot iron. Its super light and easy to move about. Now it does not have locking brakes so depending on the flooring this may be a problem for you.

I had to refill twice.Not that much of a big deal but it would have been better without that added refillCreases back into trousers do not happen.It does take the wrinkles out though.It worked well on all of my shirts that had just come out if a suitcase.All in all it's quite good.I did purchase it at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken before it began","review":"Pulled it out of the box, put it together, screwed the hose to the base and the plastic nut on the hose cracked immediately.

'The Teachers Are Afraid of the Pupils' takes what I can only call an 'orchestral riff' and repeats it for 11 minutes. 'The Operation' is catchy and genuinely swings, but is undercut by offensively dull 2-minute long drum solos. Half of these tunes make no impact whatsoever, except to suggest Morrissey wants to be a singer in a garage punk band. Moz, we don't want you to be Johnny Rotten, we want frilly multi-instrument emotionally direct concise tunes. (Like what you did before this mess, and then did after with 'Maladjusted.') I'm always a fan, but this CD is a career-killer. Only 'Reader Meet Author' works well, and you can get that on the far better 'My Early Burglary Years' compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Morrissey's Best!","review":"The first track does not live up to the rest of the album - but this is, all in all, one of Morrissey's best albums! 'Reader meet Author' is a personal favorite of mine. There is an angry tone to this album - as Morrissey always seems to embrace what he is feeling at the time. This is cathartic music at its finest. Turn it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally underrated... a brilliant, experimental album","review":"Now, a lot of people griped about this album when it came out because it wasn't beautiful like \\"Vauxhall and I,\\" but that's precisely WHY I love this album.

I feel as though I've been lied to. Everywhere in their literature, Sharp touts their ability to display 1080p on this device. Unfortunately, the device doesn't accept a 1080p signal as input. It can accept a 720p signal and up convert it to be displayed as 1080p but that adds no quality, it just resamples the image at a higher resolution, often looking worse than the original source image.

How this album is always overlooked (it was only voted 14th in the greatest Irish albums of all time in 2005) simply astounds me. Huge walls of layered guitar, fantastic drumming, effects, samples...brilliant. If every band in the world sounded like Rollerskate Skinny, the world would be a better place.Also buy Dead City Sunbeams by Kid Silver (Ken Griffen) and Kindness by The Radio (Stevie M).I think Ken's in a band now in New York called \\"Favourite Sons\\".

It does have a loud metallic noise even at low speeds but it has more than adequate power (400watts). The dough hook design is not optimal, it does not grab the flour that well unless it is very wet. My feel is the \\"spiral\\" hook that is on the pro models would work better. We bought ours on sale at Amazon for an excellent price and feel its well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This is one of the less known conflicts of the XIX century. Both sides used modern weapons and techniques learned from the American Civil War, but both still showed poor capacity to adapt themselves for the new kind of war, having a high cost of lifes for a relatively short conflict.

So I sent an Email to Hula Records and they are going to send me a replacement copy and I'll see if it is better.Interesting to note that I got a prompt personal reply from the president of Hula Records who informed me that mine was the first complaint they have had about that title... so I think it is safe to say that I just was unlucky in receiving a bad copy.Otherwise, I love this CD's songs and the liner notes are good at telling the significance of each song and provide lyrics and translations for all but a few songs. The few that are missing from the liner notes can be found easily on the internet...so no worries.I would say that if you only own one Genoa Keawe CD...this is the one to get.

For example - Cubans refer to themselves as white or black or mulatto, etc. not as \\"Hispanics\\" and Truman consistently misuses this term as a racial delimiter (a very common American mistake) rather than a cultural amplifier. The book failed to make me believe that the story was actually set in Havana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can we fix it?!?

My 2-year-old loves the lights & sounds, but we can't let him play with it because he can completely disassemble it without even trying. (Yes, he's beneath the suggested age for this toy; it was actually bought for his older sister. But it's come apart in her hands, too; she's just old enough to know it's broken and ask us to fix it.) Oddly enough, for being so easy to take apart, it's quite difficult to put together.Also, the product description talks about turning sunflowers into products, and the picture shows a cute ball with sunflowers on it. The balls that came with our toy were plain yellow & green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that easy","review":"i was not happy with this toy, the directions were a little tough to understand, they walls didn't snap in too easily and to top it off, there is no way the roof can snap on, i didn't even attach the roof, i have to try and let my husband attach it but right now its sitting on the shelve.not happy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Verging on Heresy.","review":"After reading The Splendor of the Church I can not understand why Henri De Lubac was rehabilitated by Pope John Paul when his ideas had been condemned by the Infallible Magisterium of the Church prior to the Vatican II council. The previous reviewer is right in that this theologian, being a Modernist (Modernist Heresy), had a great influence on the council and its results....and the resulting loss of Catholic identity and confusion that prevaled after the council due to the \\"reforms.\\" If you do read this book, be sure to read what the Popes taught on the nature of the Church prior to Vatican II. They are in direct contradiction to what De Lubac teaches. My own advice is to stay away from this theologian...lest you pick up heretical ideas. Stick with the Thomists and the Scholastic Theologians, otherwise you may be in danger of losing the faith. Its your choice. But why slum around when there are such orthodox treasures to to mine in the Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get out the Fritoes!","review":"It is wonderful to actually sit with a book and be enveloped with the characters.

The heroine, escaping the hangman's noose in Ireland, escapes to America by pretending to be the mother of two children whose mother is diagnosed with Tuberculosis. The description of steerage class, the organized chaos of Ellis Island and differences of the various parts of New York City are well done. Some of the characters seemed to fit a generic mold, but through Molly's eyes they take on a new life. Her ability to survive and thrive makes her an interesting and terrific heroine. Here's hoping that her dream of being a detective doesn't get thwarted by fate or Daniel Sullivan. I couldn't put the book down and wondered when will the next one come out. May Molly have a long and happy life!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Comfort Food to Me","review":"I dread finishing the series as I am on the penultimate book.

I love her spunkiness, and I have no trouble suspending disbelief when I read of the scary things she fearlessly takes on. I am not sure if I want to see her with Daniel.

It takes place in New York during the early years of the 20th century. The squaller of the tenements is in direct contrast to the beauty of Whales depicted in her Constable Evans series. Molly Murphy is a vastly different then her soft spoken Constable. The book like all her books is a quiet little mystery, nothing too bloody. An enjoyable little book to read in an afternoon. I'm looking forward to Molly solving more mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Murphy's Law","review":"I was disappointed in it. I felt let down at the end. It seemed too pat and predictable.

If you run a restaurant or pastry shop","review":"This book has a compelling premise: capturing family recipes for the best of Viennese pastry. The big disappointment, however, is that the recipes are all scaled for foodservice portions, without reference for reducing them to domestic applications. While I'd love to try an authentic linzertorte, I don't have need most days to make 8 cakes worth. I wouldn't recommend the book unless you run a restaurant, pastry shop or other large volume business, or you're interested enough in the topic to justify reading it as an academic learning experience, without practical application. I sent it back - I wish I had known the target reader group was not the home baker."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Caveat Emptor! This looks slick but it just doesn't deliver. It is definitely not for the home chef. One can't help but wonder if the author actually made any of these outside of the resaurant.Viennese pastry are world reknown, and I was looking forward to a specialized work in the ranks of, say, Gourmet Magazine.

Instead, I found the book to be terribly written, overly simplistic, and adding nothing additional to this area of law.All of the anecdotes were obvious and uninspiring. The book tries to cover too much, in the end, becoming an exercise in intellectual futility and redundancy.

I never did figure out what she was supposed to do for a living. Se was snotty one second, insipid the next and totally unbelievable.

The dialogue is redundant and her writing skills leave much to be desired. As if watching a train wreck, I kept reading this book hoping for it to get better or simply self destruct. Sadly, it did neither.It was difficult to figure out which covert government agency was training the hero, and I never did understand who the heroine was working for.

There is no way that a student just learning data structures should be allowed to use this book. As a Dean's List student currently having to use it, I've found that the best way to study is that when the professor tells us to read Chapter 3 on lists, you browse the topics being presented, then actually study and learn the information from another textbook instead like books by Gaddis, Savitch, or Malik.

From the start, this text is confusing. The author constantly makes useless points and wastes time on examples that are meaningless and spends little time, if any, on pivotal parts. Even my professor is finding errors in how the author structured her work and examples and is actually lecturing the author via email! For someone who already has a background in this field, this book is tolerable.

The text in itself is relatively confusing. The book is lengthy, though this might be a good thing, it's lengthy in all the wrong ways. First off, the author spends more time making jokes and using point-less examples to describe a concept. Then, the author proceeds to use not-even-pseudo-code to explain concepts. Then, lastly, the code is presented, but it is not documented properly which makes it harder to trace, especially if you're a beginning data structures student (which I am). The one thing that nags me about this book is the authors use of a stack-implementation in the hash tables (pushing the data to the back of the list) rather than a queue implementation (placing the data at the front of the list), which takes up less operations.

The best part of it is that in doing that, it doesn't make the characters perfect, but rather real people with faults and troubles. In fictionalizing the women in the class, it would have been easy to overlook the little problems, but Ms. Disher captures them perfectly.

The exposition is too superficial to carry the historical narrative. For instance, although the reconciliation of quantum mechanics with relativity is of great importance, its essence is nowhere discussed. Simply saying that quantum mechanics is good in the small world and relativity in the large is neither adequate nor quite correct.The book reads like one of those manuals produced by a technical writer who doesn't really grasp the subject matter. The hope is that the reader won't notice.

I had trouble when I transferred over the mp3s because the title tags did not show up on the DXG. I wrote to CS at DXG and received an immediate response with a number and a person to call. I called the CS person who told me how to fix the problem. I also emailed to ask about mac compatability and was again given an almost immediate reply. I was really impressed with their customer service. A 512 sd card is a must. It does use up batteries pretty quickly, so the next item on my list is an AAA battery recharger and rechargeables. My son was pleased with the sound with the included headphones. It sounds tinny without them, but you can hear it very well. All in all, it was a great present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnifique","review":"We got this camcorder for our daughter for her birthday and she loves it! Her only problem with it is that a memory card is needed because there isn't as much space as she would like and alot of light is needed to film.

Its more for people that are fans of RPGs, like Dungeons and Dragons type RPGs. If you are not of that type of gamer don't waste the $[...] bucks for the game. Other than that its a magnificent game. the only problem I had was that the whole adaptive leveling thing is annoying. And the ending is pretty anti-climatic as well. All that build up and then whoosh, it's over. But the game has numerous side quests that can keep you entertained for hours on end. The only thing i have as advice would be to make sure you have a character concept in mind before the game starts. Makes life easier. A good balance of magic, armor wearing, and weapons are good. Try not to specialize. Some parts of the game are pretty difficult if you specialeze in just magic, or being a basher type character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"The game it's self is wonderful.

Terrible choice. I played it all the time... until I bought my second game. I haven't even touched ES since then.

At first, I though it was pretty cool. The environments were detailed and innovative, the menus were well organized and fairly easy to use. But the combat really sucks. I can't seem to be able to enjoy it. When creatures are sprinting all over the place and you can't keep a monster in front of you to whack or fire a spell at it just isn't fun. I think the characters are ugly, the dialog gets monotonous, and I just don't care for the evolving plot. I'm going to get the Conan game and see if it appeals to me more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion","review":"I recently purchased Elder Scrolls from F.Y.E. and I have to say this game is pretty engaging. I am new to the RPG world and I don't really have any interests in RPG's. I am new to Elder Scrolls, but that's just the thing. It doesn't matter if you are new to the genre or not you still will find Oblivion an addicting game to explore. The graphics are pretty good though they lack a little more rendering possibilities. But the amount of fun you can have is endless. Whats more they don't even tell you what else is possible. It is things like that you will only discover if you play the game. Though I don't fully back Official Playstation Magazines claim, \\"If any game is worth the price of the PS3, Oblivion is it.\\", but all in all it is interesting to play. I mean I am not at a loss of 64 dollars, but it's not dissapointing either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graphics are amazing","review":"This is usually not my type of game. I am usually not into the RPGs such as Zelda and Final Fantasy. But I must say this game blew me away. The environment is amazing, you can touch random things such as chains hanging from a ceiling and it will move when you pass by it. Graphics and sound are amazing, best so far on the PS3. This game can literally last you a year if you decide to do all the side quests and roam around in the HUGE world.For me however I get a little motion sickness after playing this game for more than 30 minutes.

RFOM truly separates PS3 from the PS2 in terms of delivering an immersing playing experience. After playing through the game three times I was ready to take on another awesome PS3 title, and the only one available to purchase that represented itself as a 1st person shooter of the same intensity as RFOM was \\"Oblivion\\". After setting up the game and playing through the first level I am thoroughly unimpressed. Frankly I intend to sell the game on ebay without wasting any more time playing it.

A broken system is one that is very easily abused. This one is perhaps the most easily abused system of any game I've played so far (I'm sure someone can point out something worse). You can get to the max level before you actually start the plot. If you're considering it, resist temptation, it makes the plot very hard (monsters level up, not so much the NPCs).Anyways, the plots and subplots are interesting enough, the world is huge and that's nice, but they could have put a but more effort into it. By effort, of course, I mean \\"have more than one voice actor for each race/gender\\". They probably put millions into the graphics, it's the least they can do.

Here you meet Strongbow and his wolffriend, Kyavek and her winged boyfriend, Ember and her coming-of-age discoveries, Tyleet and her foster kid, and Skywise and his ill-fated parents.

I have been doing yoga for about 4 years and have a serious home practice, doing one to one-and-a-half hours per day. This is one of my favorite DVDs and I do it often.

My conclusion of the matter is you pay for what you get.I decided to return it to the store because the purchase will not be a long term investment.

Average time to print for text is about 7-10 seconds. Graphics take much, much longer. It seems like Lexmark, to make the printer cheaper, made it dumber. Printing a document with complex graphics (a picture, PDFs, etc.) takes forever -- it seems.A positive is the 250sheet paper tray. However, when the printer runs out, it keeps spinning a paper grab wheel until paper is loaded. The printer looks nice with a black shell and grey top. . The output bin is poorly designed and printing big documents will result in pages that have to be shuffled and aligned.Oh, the initial toner cartridge is only good for about 2000 pages.Overall, I was disappointed and will probably replace the printer within a year -- and not with another Lexmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"I support computers for a living and I cant see how anyone can say this printer is good for anything but problems.

Without entering the Science Fiction genre, he was able to do what the Best Science Fiction writers have been trying to do for three generations: Out-do Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World.\\" The Elementary Particles is a philosophical Tour de Force. If you have not read it, do!The power of Houellebecq's vision is amazing. But, this venture into Science Fiction style writing is weak. The Possibility of an Island can not be saved by Houellebecq's profound human insight or social foresight. His sarcastic pop culture allusions read thinly like Salmon Rushdie references. The lack of conceptual grasp of technological context demonstrated in the sections of the book placed in future time are a distraction at best and damning at worst. I chose not finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"Having read \\"Elementary Particles\\" a few years back and loving it, I was excited to tear through Houellebecq's latest forray into misanthropy. However, I found it to be less piercing and clever than (and more than a little derivative of) his breakthrough novel. Even though I generally appreciate Houellebecq's brand of vitriol (and it's not for everyone), I found \\"Island\\" to be a dim shadow of its predecessor, rehashing too many themes from \\"Particles\\" while showcasing the author's hang-ups more than his brilliance. Also, the sci-fi aspect of \\"Particles\\" felt more original than it does in \\"Island\\", which seems to pull directly from the wikipedia entry on the Raelians. Sadly, the experience of reading this book had deterioriated into a chore by the time I had reached the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Progress","review":"I was disappointed by this book after really enjoying Platform, Elementary Particles and Whatever.

They even had the same lifelong hangup: refusal to eat potato skins.The writing style is conversational, with all that implies: easy to read, narrative, thoughts jump around a bit just as you would expect from a person telling his own story.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn more about Jewish life in Riga about 1925 to 1945."},{"rating":"1","title":"Growing up in Riga","review":"This is a very wordy description of one Jewish family and its various branches.

Those yankee reviewers are just out of the loop and need to spend a few summers below the Mason-Dixon line. And it helps to even better understand this one if you're a Boomer and have already experienced a hot flash/mood swing or two!! LOL! This book had me howling with laughter and nodding my head in appreciatation of Ms. Linwood's fabulous wit. And her family is priceless. Talk about typical Southern family!! I loved every single character. My only regret was that Lin didn't get a good romp in the hay with old Grant before she booted his butt out the door...but her munching the (unknown to her at the time) marijuana-laced brownies from her old lesbian pal more than made up for the disappointment.

Pretty please!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you hate men...","review":"I would recommend this book if you hate men and want to jump on the feminist band wagon.

Maybe I was reading this from the wrong angle, but honestly, there are a few good men out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I opened this book and couldn't put it down. It was so refreshing to read about a character who could laugh at herself as she started over and tried to date again after thirty years as a sheltered housewife. I laughed out loud right along with her. And I cried as she faced her father and her uncle's Alzheimers. I especially liked the wonderful small-town chartacters and the way Lin pulled the rug out from under the corrupt mayor to bring about truth, justice, and the American way.

The characters seemed very stereotypical and one-dimensional. I especially didn't get the end, with the drama with Lin's best friend squeezed into literally the last few paragraphs. Made no sense at all except to underscore how selfish and self-absorbed Lin was. To the readers who have said, \\"Maybe you have to be from the south to 'get' the south\\", I think that remark does a great disservice to all of the fantastic southern writers out there. This has nothing to do with geography, it's just a badly-written book.

It started to go down hill and by the time I realized how bad it was, I was more than half way done. I finished only because so I could discuss it with other people I know who have read it. In my opinion, the author seemed to be making up the story as she went along. Character developement was erratic (bringing in tattoos on a character that earlier was a matron type.) Plot was undistinguished. No real story line except man bashing. Certain characters dropped and then brought back in for no apparent reason except to end the story somehow. What a waste of paper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little TOO quaint for my tastes, ya'll...","review":"I'm typically a fan of Southern fiction, but this was just too down-homey to be believed. Lin Breedlove returns to her small town roots and her life, once a shambles, is magically transformed by her fellow Mimosa Branchians, all of whom are just the gosh-darnedest sweetest li'l folks on the face of the earth. I swan, you just cain't believe how wonderful everything turns out for this menopausal matron.I skipped many a passage in this book to come to the rather bland end.

Also as another reviewer said - what is with Jerry Mather's being gay??? I am sure that he is NOT. Loaded with errors and mis-spellings. I could not understand why the lead character did not want to be around her family. Her mother did not seem like a bad person so I did not think that this was developed at all.

We were a little afraid of a revolt when it was due back, so we're so excited to be able to buy it on Amazon! The book stores are filled with Thomas books and not much else, so it's great to be able to broaden our train book collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chugga Chugga Choo Choo","review":"A very enjoyable story. My grandson who is almost 3 loved it. We have read it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love the whooo whoooooo!","review":"This is a great book! My 3 year old son requests this one every night. He wants to look at the illustrations and ask questions and say whooo whoooo with me as I read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun bedtime book for train lovers!","review":"I bought Chugga Chugga Choo Choo for my toddler son, who loves trains. We also bought it because we love My Truck is Stuck, also by the Kevin Lewis and Daniel Kirk team. It is a great addition to our bedtime books and we read it often. It is a rhyming story of a childs train and toys and their work day up until bedtime, when they are all tucked in and going to sleep. The illustrations are quite lovely and whimsical. My son really loves looking at everything on each page. It is a happy, soothing and peaceful bedtime book and we highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chugga Chugga Fun!","review":"This is a book for any young child from 0 to 5 years. Both my boys enjoyed this book for years! A good friend share it with us and I was glad to read the rhymes and enjoy the pictures with my kids. In fact a neighbors little girl loved the book so much she planned her 2nd birthday around the train theme and the book was on the beautifully decorated cake table. If you love trains, rhythm and rhyme you will love this book. A must for nursery book shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"This book is read daily to my grandson. His older sisters loved it as well. It has all kind of objects inside to point out or seek. I have found making the sound choo choo is universal for all ages of both genders. Would recomend this book to everybody. Only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the toys could be a little updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great train book!","review":"My son loves this book. He is 18 months old and had shown an interest in trains. I did some research on amazon and kept coming back to this book. It was a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Train Book Ever","review":"I bought this book for my train loving 2 year old son. He loved this book from the moment it arrived. He is almost 3 now and has it memorized. My 16 month old son has fallen in love with it too. The story flows like the lyrics of a song. I actually have sung the book to my boys. It is illustrated beautifully. If your kids like trains, you have to get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delightful Bedtime Book for Little Engineers","review":"This is a great bedtime book for any toddler or new reader who loves trains. The whimsical story depicts a little boy's toys running his trains while he sleeps, eventually putting all of their \\"cargo\\" away for the night and delivering his locomotive engine and stuffed animals to him in his bed.The pictures are vividly colorful and full of lots of details that your child will love to pick out. The writing relies on a refrain of the \\"woo-hoo\\" sound of the train whistle, encouraging him/her to join along. The rhyming pairs also have a lyrical quality that makes it easy for the reader to interject a lot of emphasis and personality into the reading.The book itself is a board book small enough for a toddler to easily carry or to bring along on a car trip.If your child loves trains, then this is a can't-miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bedtime book","review":"This book is a great quick bedtime story with beautiful color pictures, and of course fun \\"whoooooo-whooooo\\" noises. We read it at least twice a day and my 2 year old soon says the \\"whoooooo-whoooooo\\" part with me. I have 3 children who all like to be read to at night. My 2 year old gets to pick 2 stories and this is usually one of them. I would highly recommend this book for train lovers and families who enjoy vivid colorful pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but the pages are too thin","review":"My son(2 1/2)and I both love this book. It's beautiful and fun to read. However, my only complaint is that he has a hard time \\"reading\\" it himself because the pages are so thin. It makes it too difficult for him to turn the page without missing a lot of pages, and even though he's very gentle, he ends up bending or creasing the pages. It wouldn't likely be a problem if the book itself wasn't so big. But large, thin pages aren't easy for a child to do himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time.","review":"My 14 year old just cited this book today as one of his all time favorites. I was so touched that a teenager would reflect so fondly about it. It sure must be something special to do that for a child. I never thought much of it but always noticed how much he loved it. I guess some things dont need to be explained, just enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"14-mo. LOVES this book!","review":"The illustrations and flow of the book pulled my 14 month old baby right in to it. He enjoys the repetition of the train sound and now sits by himself, flipping the pages, making the sounds himself. He really seems to enjoy the illustrations on each page...they're rich; full of color and details that keep him interested and eager to see what he can discover next.I love how the story starts up on a fun busy train time tone and then winds down to more of a sleepy end-of-the-day night time setting; this makes this book a great addition for our bed time routine (although my child enjoys this book any time of day).I highly recommend this book as a great addition to any child's reading collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoo Whoo!","review":"I think this is one of THE greatest childrens books EVER! My 27 month old asks for it over and over. She echoes along as I read the familiar \\"chugga, chugga, choo choo\\" and \\"whoo, whoo\\". This is one book that I do not tire of reading over and over again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused about all the 5-star ratings","review":"Sorry, but this just isn't a very attention-grabbing book, and my toddler LOVES good books. He looked at this once, gave it back to me, and said \\"no.\\". I tried reading it to him, and it was a chore for me to try to get through it.Don't waste your time or money - there are much better books out there. Try \\"Goodnight, Goodnight, Construction Site\\", \\"Trashy Town\\", or just about anything other than this one.Oh - and for those of you who don't like creepy clown illustrations - DEFINITELY avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average","review":"Just because a book is colorful and not bad alot of people give it 5 stars. Well I think that this book is just average. The illustrations are very vibrant with the colors really attracting the toddlers, the graphics are cute. The words are catchy (some of the pages towards the end don't seem to rhyme well), but it is a very short book especially considering the price and size of the book. Not bad, we enjoy it but it only lasts a couple of minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay book.","review":"I really like books that sound good when you read them and have some sort of story. The only part that sounds good is the title. This one doesn't have any kind of story. Just trains. So, if you're child likes trains I would think they would really like this book. But, it's not that fun of a book to read. Just pretty good train pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Board Book EVER!","review":"This is by far the best book for the little ones. I have a boy and a girl. They both still bring me this book to read to them. The book shows that kids can use their imaginations to play. Even in this small size, the vibrant paintings are easy to see, rich with detail. After reading it many, many times, I still find new things in the pictures.Train lover or not, your little one will fall in love with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all babies!!","review":"This book is a great one for your little one. My daughter has loved it since she was 2 months old, and she still giggles (at 6 months old) when we do the \\"chugga chugga choo choo, whoo whoo!\\" noises as we read it to her. The colors are wonderful and the shapes are very eye-catching. Anyone who has to be a commuter-train mom or dad could even use this book to show how they get to work.A definite must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson LOVES this book","review":"My grandson just turned 3 years old and he absolutely loves this book. Every day that he visits here we have to read it at least 2 times. He is starting to be able to tell me the story from memory. Like most boys his age he loves trains so this was the perfect book. If your little one love trains they will love to repeat \\"Chugga Chugga Choo Choo\\" along with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"My 2-year-old son just got this for his birthday and absolutely loves it! We have read it over and over, and it's actually fun to read. I enjoy the rhythm of it.

It is perfect and he loves going wooooo wooooo with the train!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read & fun for toddler","review":"We've read this book to our little guy since he's been 18 months and he still loves it at 2 and a half. It's a fun reader as it has a good rhythm and fun pictures to talk about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chugga Chugga WOO-WOO","review":"An absolutely beautiful book that contains a sweet story and wonderful illustrations!My train lover is only 2 y/o and will not gain posession of this title for a few more years as it is NOT a board book ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantatic book, great for nap/sleepy time","review":"Not only is this well-illustrated and easy-to-follow for the toddler set but the ending suits naptime/bedtime reading as well. There are many things to look at within the pages and helps imagination along as well, since the train is running along a track in the room of a little boy who has apparently used blocks, tracks, books, boxes and all his toys to make a grand little adventure.I highly recommend this book for any child who is interested in trains."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BOY OR GIRL AGE BIRTH TO 3","review":"If you're having a baby or if you have a toddler you must have this book. My daughter (age 3) loves it and I love reading it to her. I sit her on my lap and bounce her up and down to the rhythm of Chugga Chugga Choo Choo (and I add extra Chugga Chugga Choo Choo's while I turn the page so that the rhythm never stops).It's got such a sweet ending, I start drawing out the Chugga Chugga's at the end and yawn \\"Sleepy Sleepy Choo Choo Till Tomorrow\\".The illustrations are adorable. This would be a great shower gift, it's just so much fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Our Favorites","review":"I just ordered our second copy of this book, as my son loved the first copy to death. I bought it for him a year ago for Christmas, and has been one of our favorites ever since. At 18 months, my son could pour over this book for hours, asking me to name each object in the pictures.The illustrations are absolutely gorgeous, and the rhyme is very lively. Just don't leave young child alone in a room with it!If you have a child who loves trains and trucks, I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is always good for a laugh","review":"Our son ALWAYS laughs at this book. We started reading Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo to him when he was a few months old and just beginning to smile and laugh. Inevitably, he giggled at the \\"whoo whoo\\" sections of the book. Now, eight months later, this book is still his favorite. He hears it almost every night and always smiles at the pictures and laughs at the train sounds. The illustrations are colorful and the story is well crafted and nicely written. It is a family favorite and a must have on your bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this book","review":"This is the first book that my 18 month old son brings me to read, every day. He had a lot of books before this, and would sit while I read them to him, but this is the first one he looooves. The wording is cute, I enjoy reading it to him. It's not annoying and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. If your kid likes trains, s/he will love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story and illustrations. One of my little girl's favorite books","review":"Unlike some children's books, this one has a good story that flows easily from page to page (i.e. there is a bit of rhyme to it -- the mountains tall and steep; valley low and deep). I like how the child is sleeping with the choo choo and toy airplane at the end. This is just like my little girl. Perfect conclusion for a bedtime story.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Train Fantasy","review":"I can't begin to put into words how wonderful this book is. The illustrations are so interesting...seems that every object is doing its own thing. The rhythmic verses keep my sons hanging onto every page, and at the end everybody goes to sleep after a long days work. A great night-night book. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chugga Chugga Choo Choo","review":"We have 3 children of ages 5, 3 and 1. Our youngest enjoys this book the most with laughter and large smiles.

We LOVE it and recommend it to everyone who wants a class 1 book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby loves this book","review":"We just purchased this book for our 13 month old and its quickly turned into her favorite book. She'll dig through all her books to find this one and yell choo choo. I like this book because of the nice story and absolutely wonder illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I bought this book for my 23 month old son. He loves it! I have read it countless times. He loves trains too, and this book has become a favorite. It's a cute and catchy story, and I enjoy reading it to him."},{"rating":"2","title":"So sweet","review":"SPOILER ALERT: It's a story about a little boy who plays with trains from waking up to going to bed. It's so subtly written in the beginning you don't realize it, and then when you start to figure it out at the end, you say, \\"Awwwww that's just like MY son.\\" It really hit home with me and my son and I love to read this book at bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"16 month old LOVES this book!","review":"Chugga chugga choo choo - my daughter will always reply with whoo whoo. So much fun!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro for beginning","review":"Before this book, I was still wondering through a maze of nonsensical calculus textbooks and couldn't get myself out of that trap. I think this book is a good start for going further in math. This book is clearly written and makes me think clearly, relative to other too concise books. Now I know what's going on when proofs are present in books. It's worth a buy. Also, selected exericise solutions are just enough to get the hint on how to approach a problem and also are motivating enough to solve a problem on my own. This book would probably better as a textbook in a course taught by a good instructor, but self-study is probably possible. You get to peak inside for table of contents and few pages, so why not have a look?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Debunks redlining","review":"Before buying this slim volume, know that its purpose is to debunk redlining, using data from 1976. The information from the northern cities they present may be true, but do not expect this to be a definitive work on redlining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great.","review":"The movie is a good effort and does help to understand how some of the concepts of the novel might be envisioned, but is not a satisfying realization of all the events and action of the novel. Probably no movie could do that in two hours. That would probably need a long TV series, such as COSMOS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Gee, what can I say... this is a very lame lower level intelligence movie.

The opening sequence is extremely well done, really drives the imagination. My wife showed it to her high school students as part of an art project. I think Jodie Foster gave her students some inspiration for their own future achievements . A very thought provoking movie, unlike most that are around now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh....","review":"I bought this movie for Demons In My Head. I saw it for rent back in the 90s, now in 2013 I decided to finally buy it and watch it, and it was cheaper buying it in this combo. All the reviews are going on and on about To Become One, which was less than terrible. Same story with Demons In My Head. I love B movies, and I knew what I was going into with buying this because I have watched most of Brain Damage Films (most of which are awful). Don't bother with either of these, they are both slow, boring, and crappy. The only Brain Damage Film worth watching is Terror Toons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children in War","review":"Over 2 million children have been killed in wars over the pastten years. \\"Children In War\\" covers four different warzones: Bosnia, Rwanda, Northern Ireland, and Bosnia. The authors interview children of these war zones, letting the children tell their stories in their own words. The authors also include the childrens' artwork to help punctuate their stories. The book is a devastating indictment of the brutality of war and how it sacrifices the innocent and helpless on the altar of ideology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera.","review":"This camera is as good as it gets - 5 stars.

It is a physical struggle of wit and often humour; it is raw, jarring, and at times red in tooth and claw. Mary Oliver has been a master of it - see her encounters with owls.There is inherent danger with \`nature poetry'. When words fail the poet he may be tempted to replace her curiosity with wonder, astonishment, and eventually mushy spirituality, or even mystic unity. As such poetry moves from long argument to disembodied deist sentiment it loses dimensions - it becomes kitsch (as Kundera would opine).Mary Oliver's Thirst is the record of such deist drift and the result is disappointing. She does not have the frenzy mysticism of a Rumi. She does not affirm her unconditional love of God like St. Francis Hers is consolative - hence instrumental - poetry in a minor key."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Mary Oliver is one of my favorite poets.

The zip pocket on the side is rather small, and there is only one. It would be helpful if there was another pocket, or a smaller compartment inside the main compartment to separate dry items. There is a small opening at the bottom of the bag covered by mesh, which I think is supposed to help the bag drain should any water collect at the botttom. However the opening is facing your back so I imagine that if there is water dripping, it would drip onto your back. Perhaps having the opening face the other surface of the bag might be more effective.

All the wiches and their organizations which*ahem* is odddly similiar to Circles Daylight, midnight and twilight.

It's really the reason not many serious critics give her credit, hell, they don't even bother to look at her books.The thing that bugged me about it was the assassin thing. Does Amelia even know what a an assassin does? They don't play dress up and go undercover like a reporter or cop. What was with the whip? Whips do barely any good use.As for the storyline, there wasn't one. She never came out with the objective. She never does and that's what [ticking] off a lot of people who don't appreciate her work. They are also getting sick and tired of the callous and lonely lead female. For once Amelia could come up with something original.It's sad and despressing.

But if you're a fan you might as well read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Predator","review":"I think that Midnight Predator is one of Amelia Atwater Rhode's best books she has writen yet.

Here Turqusie has learned everything to fight a vampire, and is one of the best in Crimson.

But to kill Jeshicah they have to go to Midnight a vampire building where humans are slaves, so they discuise themselves as slaves.I won't tell you any more because I don't want to spoil it for you.

If you are a fan of Amelia Atwater Rhodes or your looking for a good horror book this is a must read. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing","review":"One thing I am confused by, why is it every vampire she creates is a big macho and no one knows about it being the most rivaled vampire in the world?I admit she has only tough girl wannabes who aren't as strong as they appear or act out to be which is annoying.Though her writing has progressed I wasn't interested in reading after the first chapter. The ending was confusing and we don't find out if she kills the villain. That's the whole point of this book.Apparently she has over 200 characters created, little advice stick to a couple. Having so many characters causes plot holes and you tend to forget that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clone of her other novels","review":"Why is it that everyone has the same personality?Why is the leading female always a mean tough-girl wannabe?Why doesn't the villain ever die?Why is the objective never taken out?Never a conclusion?All her characters look like models?All are cliched loners with no actual reasons behind their need to be alone?These are questions you ask yourself, if you closely pay attention to her last novels, but most importantly this one.Amelia brings us into the world of Midnight (don't ask me what possessed her to name the slavehouse that). It is poorly done, especially in the world of assassins. Does she even know what an assassin is?I prefer hunter, assassins go undercover, for like a short amount of time. They are sneaky and pounce on their prey under sudden attacks. She holds no traits of a real assassin.The saddest thing is. Her characters are unrealistic and have no true originality. If you read closely to most of her books, they resemble plots already used by Pike and Smith."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Ameila be anymore [bad]?","review":"Okay, so her first novel was great. Her second novel was weak. By this time, she's seriously lacking everything that makes a book \\"good\\" and \\"acceptable\\". What is up with all the far out names anyway? This book is [bad]! My kitten could have come up with better plot, better characters, better anything!Don't buy it. It's a waste of your money, seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book For the Perfect Genre!","review":"First thing that I want to say well that this is a great book for all of those vampire lovers out there, and let me tell I know there are a lot out there.

They learn about a vampire mansion, that is the leader of trading people for vamire slaves has just opened again. Which a long time ago, it burned down,and nobody survived except some vampires. Now it is built and working again. Violet and Raven have to go undercover as slaves to kill the vampires, and take down Midnight. The mansion was named Midnight. Violet gets tangled up with the head vampire and starts to question if she will be able to kill him when the time comes. You should read this book, by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes!!!! This is the best book I have ever read!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vapid","review":"When I was in my early 20s I read a book called 'The Third Wave' by Alvin Toffler. It completely changed my life. It made clear the things I felt happening in the world and explained them in a way I still carry with me today. I became a Toffler devotee and read everyone of his 1000+ page books. Then in 1995 he wrote a small 200 word book with Newt Gingrich about the future of politics. It was the worse piece of crap I had ever read. It made no sense. It's ideas were vapid and muddled. Someone recently said that Newt is \\"a stupid guys idea of what a smart person sounds like.\\" I completely agree. Knowledge without ethics, empathy or vision does not make you smart. It makes you dangerous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toffler is a man with a concept looking for a plan","review":"Toffler is a big thinker. His premise in this book as well as in his other books is that just as the agricultural first wave has given way to the second wave industrial age, that it in turn has yielded to the third knowledge revolution. He outlines the differences and prescribes the need for change.In that men have difficulty adjusting to change (see \\"Who Moved My Cheese\\"), Toffler outlines how these clashes will be resolved. Just as companies in growth industries altenate between spurts of growth and plateaus of consolidation, societies experience the same disruptions. The Austrian school of economics would call it \\"creative destruction\\".This book's core principles emanate from the mind of a visionary thinker. If you want a top-down view of the last couple of centuries it's worth the few hours of reading and thinking you'll have to invest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved them but quickly disappointed","review":"I loved these shoes until about 2 months after I bought them.

Superb commentary. Pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ali's greatest fights - Great collector's item!","review":"These three Ali fights were not only great moments in sports history. They were also memorable events from a historical standpoint. Muhammad Ali is the reason why there is so much money in sports today. Salaries were modest before Ali's time. They grew exponentially during his time. And they virtually exploded later on.And his first fight with Sonny Liston changed boxing history forever, just as Tiger Woods' record breaking Master's win in 1998 changed golf forever. Buy this 3 tape vhs set, and own a piece of history. See a young Ali box rings around Liston. See a cagey Ali 10 years later dismantle the younger, more powerful George Foreman. And watch in awe as a heavier, aging Ali goes toe to toe with Joe Frazier in their third fight, the famed Thrilla in Manila."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Shocked The World","review":"These videos show all three phases of Ali's amazing career: he beats Liston with speed, Frazier with power, and Foreman with brains.This is a great set of videos, but I sure wish I could find the first two Ali-Frazier fights in a similar package."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't play","review":"Only the title sequence would play on each DVD in the set.

It is such a cheaply made, poorly constructed tool that you are better off saving your money and shaking or stirring by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product, even worse customer service","review":"I purchased this item hoping it would work as advertised. Problem is it bounces all over the place when you turn it on. It will not stay in one place. Also, the problem is if this thing vibrates off the table, hits the floor, and paint goes everywhere.

It's very cheaply made the, motor that runs the shaking mechanism is weak and it only shakes ONE (1) jar of paint at a time I have 30 jars that need to be shaken at any given time.

My results have been mixed, but when you hit some of the zones described in the book before bed, you sleep WAY better than you would have otherwise. It's well worth the small investment even if you only get a partial long-term benefit like I have.My mom, sister, and other friends have received a lot more benefit from me using these techniques on them. In fact, my sister who was going through a rough divorce couldn't believe I knew how to do \\"magic\\" like that! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to read","review":"This, like Rash's other books, was a great read. Through the characters in the book, readers not only get a great story, but a real insight into the region as well. It's like taking a backstage tour into the life of the characters. I would recommend this, and any other of Rash's books, to people who like more than just a great plot, you get the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travis gets his foot stuck in a bear trap.","review":"And that's the thick of the action for somewhere around 10 chapters, I don't know, I lost count. I thought about quitting this book something like 4 times in the past week I've been reading it. Once Travis gets his foot stuck in that bear trap, the action sort of just disappears. He studies for his GED. Woohoo. What fun. OH, OH, OH! And learns his family history. OH BOY. I ended up just skipping all the parts where one of the characters wanders off into his mind about pretending to be some ancestor of his. I sucked it up, finished the 50 pages I had left, and glady returned it to the library. Avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as his previous 2 books","review":"I am a fan of Ron Rash's fiction too. I did not think that this book was as good as the first two. The characters were not as compelling, the language not as lyrical, and the plot not as exciting. There were too many loose ends--Travis's future college plans, reconcilation with his family, etc. The whole book moved slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a new RASH","review":"Ron Rash manages to combine beautiful prose with an entirely unpredictable plot. His gift is that he doesn't allow the plot to overwhelm the language of the Carolina mountains. The native patwois seems beautifully logical and proper in Mr. Rash's creative hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimonies to augment theories","review":"This is a jarring and eye-opening collection of voices often unheard in our culture. It is highly recommended that this book NOT be read until one has looked at his first REAL BOYS offering. The first work povides the theorectcal context within which these testimonies are most powerful. This is valuable reading not only for counselors and parents, but for pastors, teachers, and all who work with or care about boys and their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"I have read about three quarters of this book and my biggest problem with it is that the testimonials by the boys seem really contrived, as if their words have been doctored up or forged. He has interviews with twelve year olds that flow so beautifully and articulately that it actually comes off as very inorganic and makes you wonder whether or not these kids' words have been doctored up. The vocabulary these kids use is often too sophisticated sounding for their age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Write Some More!!!","review":"I think that this was a great book, and I think that it really stinks that the series ended there.

The ending was so horrible, it was even sadder than the book where Prancer dies. This book resolves a lot of what happened in the past few books, all though I think the Gorge thing could have been handled better. I hope that this not the end of the series, because I love theses books and I know a lot of other people do to. Does any one know an e-mail adress for the publisher so that I can conntact them?

I think that people are going to be sad and angry but it's actually a great new begining. I was wondering though... usually in the fron of the book they say the title of the next book. This was such a surprize ending, and there was no new title to be announced!

I don't know anything about the video games so I can only comment on the movie. Dolph Lundgren seems to be getting very tired from his other movies action requirements. The plot was sorta lame, the \\"special effects\\" minimal, the acting pretty much had a low bar requirement and the concept of the overall \\"plot\\" made me wonder why the film was even made!

First, the instructor explained how you don't have to worry if you can't kick someone's face, you'll simply kick them in the groin and he'll bend over, the next kata starts with a kick over his head. Also, he never explains the basics, like the difference between a reverse punch, a straight punch, any kick or even the fact that every strike is a block and every block is a strike. I could spend all day telling you what's wrong with the DVD, let's just say \\"save your money\\". I also purchased the DVDs by rank, yellow, orange, purple and blue, those were much better.

When 70 year olds like Garfunkel Stewart and Macca start singing the old stuff, they have to realise it's all been done before by better singers who recorded when they were much younger.

I have always loved his voice, so he can do no wrong by me; But his arrangements here are highly listenable in a low key kind of way. Johnny Mathis def. comes to mind here, but this is just a great mellow album to have on when you just want to relax and listen to what is one of the greatest pop/folk vocalists of our time.

It's more fun when you get all the extra buildings, but if it's an iffy situation, then I highly recommend this set. We bought this set for our little one because he just wasn't too sure about these trains. However, after he received it, he found out that he liked them and well, now we have a bunch of them! The $40 is not much to invest n a toy that they're not going to play with either! I just wish this set had more things with it besides just the track and the train. However, you can get a little better deal if you buy the track separately from Maxim, who makes Brio trains now, and the train separately as well. This train will chew up the batteries pretty quickly unless you use Duracell. Energizer only makes it two days in this train but Duracell makes it two-and-a-half weeks. Other than that, highly recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brio is the best!","review":"If your going to get your kid one of these wooden train sets get a BRIO ! all those others are just knock off garbage brio simply is the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Like Zero Stars","review":"Where's the \\"0\\" star rating when you really need it?Bad acting, aimless direction, impossible to decipher soundtrack (thankfully we get subtitles for the dialogue), and worst of all, a premise that might--might--have worked in 1975, but hardly 2005. In short, the story concerns Why It's Okay to Be Gay. Duh. Throw in some absurdly unbelieveable bit characters in the fashion of a sitcom's B-story line and there you are: A Total Waste of Time. I've had more fun watching rocks erode.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gina Gershon had to ownsomeone money!","review":"Gina Gershon is one of the best actresses around now and usually makes really good choices of movies. This one wasn't a good choice. The acting, other than Gina, is horrid - although this isn't one of Gina's shining moments. The writing is so much worse than the acting - a 12 year old could have come up with better lines. The end teases a twist but then takes it away and just ends. There are a few too many loose ends that I would have liked to have seen tied up but we all can't have everything. If you're looking for a good Gina Gershon movieor a good thriller don't pick this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"Just saw this again. The acting is decent, and Gershon is always nice to look at. But the film as a whole falls flat. It's a good premise, but the screenplay doesn't open up enough. You're never really sure who did what or triggered what, and when you supposedly find out \\"everything,\\" it just ends, with a lot of loose ends left untied. Shame because this could've been a far better picture. The talent was there; it just wasn't utilized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent movie . Gina Gershon stole the show!","review":"Gina Gershon has never been best. She makes the sixty % in this film. She deserves major opportunities and I expect this film adds the expected desire in future projects.Sean Patrick Flannery is a young promise and makes a credible role.The script works out with organical flow . There are innovative situations that keep your attention and hold to your seat. The increasing mistery slowly goes involving you to a satisfactory ending.The direction is another positive point to remark.A little gem that might become in a status cult movie . In my opinion this film got it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced","review":"I installed in my corvette. The first redtop lasted under 3 years. Replaced under warranty. Replacement also lasted under 3 years. This battery is way overrated and over priced. I replace it at less than 1/2 the cost with a battery with more power and the same warranty. I would not recommend this battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Battery EVER!","review":"I purchased this battery for my G35 coupe. I have used it for 2 months to replace the OEM battery. OEM battery lasted 4 years, but opitma Red Top is having trouble turning on after only 2 months. The cells cannot hold a charge and the battery sounds weak when I lock the car doors. WORST EVER! Do not recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top brand, excellent model","review":"If its highly suitable (manufacturer recommended) for my V-12, its likely just as suitable for whatever else automotive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to reading \\"Alien Base\\", expecting Timothy Good's usual level of excellence and good sense. Instead, \\"Alien Base\\" devotes a deplorable amount of time rehashing the old contactee cases, George Adamski, among others. That Good has choosen to consider those patently ludicrous \\"space brother\\" fabrications as credible, at least in part, has definitely made me question his judgment.The photgraphic plates were disappointing too, except two shots of aliens, one of which appears to be a dessicated grey.I take the subject matter seriously, but Good's latest book is too uneven, too lacking in analysis, and, at times, presents too much evidence of the author's gulliblity to make for a satisfying addition to the UFO shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the Same","review":"Timothy Good's \\"Alien Base\\" is a bore, with repeated information from other books, and little more than \\"stories.\\" His best defense of these stories is \\"Why would these people lie?\\"I have read his other books and enjoy them, but this one was highly disappointing.I got the sense that \\"Alien Base\\" merely told people's stories, while citing very, very little evidence. This book is \\"more of the same.\\" Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title & disappointing read","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Perhaps it was because I hoped Kirstie would discuss her Jenny Craig experience more, give some insight into her personal struggle and provide tips for struggling with significant weight loss based on her experiences. Instead, she jumped from topic to topic, focused more on her drug addiction history and sex life and barely skimmed the surface of the weight issue. Although her wonderful wit was apparent throughout, the book was poorly written and difficult to follow. If you're looking only for Kirstie's unique type of humor, you may really enjoy it. However, if you're more interested in finding some self-help tips or empathy for the struggles of the obese, forget it because you won't find anything in this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anecdotal but not Informative","review":"Kirstie tells us about a few months in her life, but nothing about how she lost weight, lost her ars, or regained her life.For entertainment value, it's great. For information, it misses completely.Kirstie is an excellent commedienne, but she should have stuck to acting - writing is surely not her forte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny!!!","review":"The book really is very witty and oftentimes insightful, but at the same time it gets tiresome to hear Alley continously wax romantic about her huge [...]! She is so much more than that, and while I think it took a tremendous amount of courage for her to just come out and say, \\"Hey, I am fat, now I am going to do something about it!\\" She need not forget that her being a smart, funny and beautifully vivacious woman, not to mention a true comedic talent has nothing to do with the size of her posterior."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected SO much more","review":"I have always loved and admired Kirstie in everything I have ever seen her in. I expected a thoroughly honest and entertaining book and feel like I got neither.The diary entries that start the chapters are mildly amusing, and generally have zero to do with what the chapters are about.The references to Scientology are really quite annoying and frequent and seeing how 4 years after she has written the book and nothing has changed for her; makes it also quite laughable.I honestly wish I never would have bought and read this as I doubt I will ever find her as witty as the characters she had portrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun book","review":"This is a fun book. Kirstie writes with a sharp wit and candor I found very entertaining. She jokes about herself and speaks with love & respect for her family, parents, and grandparents.Her food & weight issues are mentioned often. I really loved the story about her Grandfather paying her a dollar to spend Saturday night, watching the fights with him on TV, serving the then 6 year old Kirstie lightly salted beer in a \\"thimble\\" sized shot glass. I'm glad I bought this book so I can reread it whenever I want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misled","review":"I was very disappointed in this little book. The title leads one to believe that it will be a journey through Kirstie's public battle with weight.Although there were small excerpts from her journal at the beginning of each chapter regarding her weight and various issues of her daily life, the stories that followed were UNRELATED, but rather snapshots of her early childhood, or some random story about her early life in Hollywood.Kirstie's caustic and ascerbic wit are in tact and although some of the passages were funny, it's not what I thought I was buying.The old adage.....\\"never judge a book by it's cover\\" would have come in handy here.Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Kirstie","review":"\\"What you see is what you get\\" with Kirstie Alley! This quick-read will make you laugh and realize that, celebrity or not, we all face the same dilemmas. I very much appreciated Kirstie's candor - she is real, down-to-earth gal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well.","review":"Ho hum. Big print, double spaced lines, small chapters, not much meat on the bones of this book. She is not much of a writer...unless willingness to be frank about your weaknesses, your demons, and your bodily functions, and your ability to use profanity, are enough to make you a writer. If Kirstie Alley wasn't a famous star, would this book sell even one copy? Would we even be talking about it? Um...no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny but too short","review":"Kirstie gives up snippets from her life that are totally funny. However she skips a lot. Was she ever married, why did they divorce? Is her son really named True or is that a nickname? You can't give us all these intimidate details about your sex life and popping in your car then leave out important events in your life. She doesn't tell the story in chronological order so it wasn't even clear she had kids until the very end of the book.While I enjoyed the book and thought Kirstie to be someone fun to hang out with, I lost respect for her when she talked about Scientology. I felt like her little mentions of this Scientology event she went to or that was like advertising. Why do we need to know you had an awakening at one unless it's subtle advertising? I guess that's why she's such close friends with John Travolta. Still I thought her smarter than that to join a cult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I loved her when she was thin and I loved her when she was fat. No matter how you look at Kirstie Alley, you will get the genuine article. No plastic Barbie doll here.Kirstie writes from her life in such an engaging way, I could really relate. I love the formatting she used. The diary notation at the top to set the stage for what came next. This is a real person! She is funny, poignant and down home. A great read that will leaving you laughing in some parts and shaking your head in agreement all the way through.(I preordered the book as soon as I read about it in the Good Housekeeping article about Kirstie.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This memoir/humor book written by Kirstie Alley takes a humorous and sometimes sad look at what it is like to be a fat woman. In this case, multiplied by the fact that she is in the media.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Kirstie is very good at stating her thoughts without making them sound like huge melodrama. I must admit, though, to wondering what was behind the humour. There is obviously a lot of pain there.I find it interesting that this is billed as a memoir as really, Kirstie, doesn't say much about her life except to mention her issues with her body.Although I would have wanted more in-depth description of her life, I still think it took lots of courage to write this and hopefully this has gone a little way in helping Kirstie with her self-image.Next book should definitely be longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW TO LOSE 20 BUCKS AND 2 HOURS","review":"THIS HAS TO BE THE WORST BOOK I EVER READ- WAS ALWAYS A KIRSTIE FAN ......UNTIL NOW! AND I'M ABSOLUTELY AMAZED SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN GET PRINTED! TOTALLY WORTHLESS DIATRIBE- BE VERY RELUCTANT TO HEAR THESE RELUCTANT CONFESSIONS! BOO HISS !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty mouth!!","review":"I had great aspirations for this book. Finally someone I could relate to in my own struggle with loosing weight, etc. Well I didnt realize that this book was just a bunch of Kirstie's personal diary stuff. I found it vulgar and upsetting. She has an awful potty mouth and it definitly changed my view about her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did She Let her Children Read This?","review":"Hands down, this is the worst book I've ever read. I have always admired the author, but was thunderstruck both by the (sleazy) details of her sex life and the language. I cringe for her poor children once they're old enough to be humiliated that their mother actually let this get into print. And were the humping dogs really necessary? Beyond that, there was no diet advice to be found anywhere - except for some vague discussion about Scientology (also yuck). The airline diatribe was mystifying as well. Yes, you were fat. We get it. How did you get unfat? Who knows? I guess I might have expected something this gross from Paris Hilton or some other 20-something, but it is just unbelievable coming from a 55 year old woman. Looks like John Travolta got away just in the nick of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 brain cells or less required","review":"This book is trite, full of cliches, and has nothing new to offer an intelligent reader. If you seek inspiration in your daily life, check out \\"Living a Beautiful Life\\" by Alexandra Stoddard."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes me HAPPY","review":"I just love this book. Such a great girlfriend gift item. I really love the fact that I could pick up the book and read a chapter randomly and would be given a \\"message for the day\\", something to think about. And because each chapter is short, but chock-full of sage and humorous advice, it allows even the busiest \\"Goddess\\" (as the author refers to us women) to find the time to read. The book really inspired me to see how it is a choice to be happy. And after reading this, I Choose to be Happy all the time. It is much more fun. And girls just wanna have fun!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two different titles for the SAME book published within in 4 months?!!!","review":"BUYER BEWARE: I purchased this book andAdoption: Your Step-by-Step Guide(also by Mardie Caldwell) and to my surprise THEY WERE ACTUALLY THE SAME BOOK, PUBLISHED LESS THAN FOUR MONTHS APART UNDER DIFFERENT TITLES! Nowhere did it say that one was a minimally updated version of the other.While the information that these books contain is very good, I find it a very shady practice indeed to publish two books in this manner less than 4 months apart without informing potential buyers of the duplication. It has left me very wary of the author and the publisher. In fact, I would guess the US ISBN Agency would be interested in knowing these books are the same..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book to have as a parent of a child with OCD","review":"As a parent of a child with OCD, it is possible to become 'compulsive' about trying to educate yourself about the illness to help your child. This book is a comprehensive guide that helps to ask and answer your questions. There are many books out there on the subject but this book is the BEST one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for a confused parent","review":"I bought this book along with \\"Up and Down the Worry Hill\\" and it was very useful, especially as I knew very little about OCD. I would recommend it, especially the part about OCD and School."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for parents who have a child with OCD","review":"This book really helped me when I first learned my daughter had OCD. It's packed with great information and really helped me to know I wasn't alone and there is help for her. This is written by a child psychiatrist who specializes in children with high anxiety and OCD. You won't be sorry you purchased this. I go back to it time and again. I even emailed the Dr. and she emailed me back with further information."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY!! STAY AWAY","review":"I used this product for 2 months and took the max dose.

However, after about a month of taking them, I got sick of the taste and stopped. I continued the water intake and continued to lose the weight.I removed A (TrimSpa) and continued B and C (water/exercise) which leads me to believe that the increased water and exercise really cause the weight loss and not the Trimspa.Maybe I lost the weight due to a \\"Placebo Effect\\", but I think it would be best if I stuck to tried and true methods of weight loss. This was just a means to start the weight loss process and in no means should be considered a way to make the pounds magically disappear."},{"rating":"2","title":"trimspa review","review":"i like the energy it gave me and it did not make me jittery. i lost a few pounds byut not as many as i would have liked. the cost was good on amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Tommy Emmanuel is an absolutely astonishing guitar player.

My wife and I could not turn the channel,on this program many famous players have said He is the best guitar player ever, I think they may be right. I order it yhe next day. I highly recommened this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy (plus 2 players that must be hidden somewhere)","review":"I rated this 5 star only because there weren't more. Absolutely dynamite.

MUST HAVE THIS ONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful Guitar","review":"This DVD made me excited about the acoustic guitar again. I have been thumb picking my git fiddle ever since. Seriously, prepare to be amazed and blown away by Tommy's virtuosity and amazing passion for music. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Collectible","review":"I'll add on to the excellent reviews posted on this DVD.Possibly like those who appreciate TE's skills, I play finger-pick guitar and have watched TE's concerts live.There's one distinct benefit of this DVD vs watching live: it provides close-ups from different angles of TE performing, heightening the audio-visual experience not possible even from a front-row seat (which I was lucky to get on my first TE concert).That said, I'm going with the opinion that leaving in TE's between-song interaction with the audience would be good. It'll provide an opportunity for folks to have the full \\"TE experience\\" which, to me, is genuine human goodness expressed through guitar.Get the DVD, nevertheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love Tommy E!","review":"I've seen Tommy live. I've seen his other DVDs. I like this one the best. The venue is very intimate, which is well captured in this video. The sound quality is very good. And I really like the variety of music genres he covers here. But more than anything else, it's Tommy. for anyone who's never seen/heard him, especially if you've tried to play guitar (and after seeing him, we all are merely trying to play), he's astounding. Enough said. Get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"DOWN UNDER GUITAR MAN IS ON TOP OF HIS GAME","review":"I DON'T CARE WHO YOU ARE..AN ACCOMPLISHED MUSICIAN OR JUST A CASUAL LISTENER YOU WILL BE COMPLETELY MESMERIZED BY THIS ARTIST.

ANYONE CAN ENJOY THIS DVD.//JM"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, disappointing content","review":"I read this book, excited to hear someone talking about how pyschology can be used to study more than just dysfunction. However, as other reviewers have poited out, the author repeats himself unecessarily throughout the book. He also uses anecdotal evidence almost exclusively--which means most of his conclusions or platitudes with little impact.The book Authentic Happines by Martin Seligman is a much better place to turn if you're interested in positive psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BAD, BUT....","review":"A book full of cliches, with little original insight into the composer. Of course, it seems the author's intention really is not to study the composer's life. The way he renders Beethoven's personal dynamic is bested by three other authors: first, Maynard Solomons' classic BEETHOVEN; then J.W.N. Sullivan's great BEETHOVEN'S SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT; and more recently Carter J. Gregory's historico-fiction, MY ANGEL LEONORA. These are more inspired, but Pearsall is still worth it.Todd Hermance"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is a terrible, unreadable book. I'm not surprised it had problems getting published. It reads like a manuscript that was submitted that needed heavy editing and the author refused. There are long incoherent sentences and the author repeats himself over and over. At some point he starts criticizing the food pyramid and mentions in a very sinister way that it was developed by a senate committee overseen by Senator George McGovern. Huh? And PS: Beethoven wasn't happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smile and have happy thoughts","review":"I expected a lot more profundity about this topic. There are much better works out there than this.

Highly recommend this product and brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous sink","review":"I have the double sink version in my home and have loved it. Easy to clean, always looks good- unlike the old stainless one that I previously had- which always looked like it needed to be cleaned. So when replacing a 60 year old sink at the lake house, I picked this one. It came quickly and exactly as pictured. It was easy to install and to punch out an extra hole for the sprayer. I would recommend this sink and would also recommend getting the stainless steel grid for the bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"sink strainer","review":"The first thing i noticed about the sink was the packing. It was packed in an oversized box and enough packaging that when I received the box it did not look like it was shipped. Once I got the sink out of the box I realized how gorgeous it was.

But my installer did see it (thankfully), and my scheduled install came to a full stop. My old sink and all connections were already removed and could not be reinstalled. Now we are trying to cope with just a distant laundry sink. A replacement should arrive in two days and we can only hope this one is OK. This crack was hard to see but would definitely be a problem once it traveled further down the bowl.

It does not appear to be a mishandle problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive","review":"Very nice sink, dark gray actually, not black.Just mind that a simple drop of water will stain it.

It WILL NOT take pictures in an area where the light is dim! Outside it will allow for ok video but to zoom in or out is useless, this camera does not have good focus from any more that 3 feet away.

The quality is fine, and the price and shipping charges were competitive. What really distinguishes this order, though, is the fast turnaround I got, which included delivery via UPS and order-tracking all the way.I should point out that at 50mm (about two inches) wide, these balls do not seem large but they are really VERY large for the person who wants to use them for hand exercises. Few if any people will be able to start right out and roll two of these guys around in the hand without clacking them or dropping them. For beginners, the 35 to 40mm range is better.

Without reading the book (and after that review I'm definitely not inclined to order it) I can't tell if this Italian writer is a prankster or a scholar who knows what he's talking about.

This Copenhagen Ring is completely different....almost a polar opposite of the Met's Ring. Still, I decided to give it a shot. I figured the price of the entire set was less than tickets to actually see a Ring. I actually loved this Ring. It makes you laugh a lot, and it is full of surprises. Just when I thought I wouldn't be surprised again, I was. This is a Ring that does not take itself too seriously, and you actually realize that there is humor in the Ring. However, there are very touching moments in this production also. I highly recommend it.

Any divergent thoughts are punished by a blinding headpain, and individuals who act contrary to the \\"shared reality\\" are ostracized. Ms. Kress chose to juxtapose this storyline with a parallel plot about a mysterious artifact from another alien species, and throw in a third alien enemy to boot. The elements of these two story lines just don't work together. Dr. Bazargan is the most interesting and realistic character in the human anthropological team. David Allen is repugnant, and meant to be, but his one-sidedness makes him merely a plot device. The totally unlikely presence of two human infants on the team provides the occasion for a monstrous cruelty, and as such, is a cheap shot at our emotions. I wish Ms. Kress had thrown out this plot outline and explored her idea in a different way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Surprisingly Disappointing Book","review":"A whole world where all people share the same beliefs or reality together - without question. This fantastic premise could have generated a number of intriguing scenarios.

On top of that the Physics described is juvenile fanatsy. The author 's talents lie in divining how genetic engineering can alter society and people. Stick to that larger theme.

I gave up after about 70 pages. It took that long to get a clear inkling of what was going on, which is not much. More annoying was the constant challenge between characters, even characters who are otherwise friendly with one another. Johansen's characters always seem to be in challenge-mode. No statement, no matter how innocuous, seems to be accepted without a, \\"Yeah, but,\\" or \\"Don't be such a jerk\\" sort of reply. That soon becomes old. Much of the dialogue is unreal anyway, but everyone seems to act like macho-man trying to leave a tough-guy impression.

Thank heavens the book was a loaner from the library.I seem to remember everyone stiffening and grimacing in \\"On the Run\\" as well (which by the way was another terrible book). If these two books are any indication of what we can now expect from Ms. Johansen, perhaps it's time for her to retire. All I can say is \\"Fool me once, shame on you.

The plot is not intense, and the dialogs in the book are too soap-opera like: just plain dumb and plenty bad.I found the main character of the book too whiny. I think the author meant for the main character to be a strong, determined lady with a mother's soft heart. However, it did not come through that way for me. I find the main character to be annoying. Many times I just wanted to slap her face and say \\"just shut up about your kid already. He's fine.\\"I forced myself to finish the whole book. It was a mistake.

I read the prologue and was instantly hooked! What? How? Where? What is going on?!The story itself picks up 2 years after the craziness of the prologue, and aside from terrible dreams, we aren't let on to what happened back then. Which is fine. The plot of the story, such as it is, is actually very good.However, the convoluted story telling, the absolutely unbelievable way that characters met and bonded, the snidely-whiplash bad guy, and the overall feeling of \\"this story must be continued from a bunch of other books I haven't read\\" just made me want to brush my brain after I read it.I did stick it out, not sure why. I finished it.

The last couple though have been so painful to get through. This one however, I don't think I can even finish. I read where someone called these characters \\"cardboard,\\" and I couldn't agree more. The female heroine randomly throws in curse words in a cheap attempt to create tension between herself and the supposed male protagonist. Whereas in the Eve Duncan Books and the Wind Dancer books we are drawn into the story and come to care for the characters, it is patently obvious what will happen with each of these characters - makes me think of a writing 101 class. \\"Now this should happen here, and this here, and this here and boom, climax, happily every after.\\"I hope that Iris can get her groove back and begin writing novels worth my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I normally don't take the time to review books however I felt I must comment in this instance. This book is painfully plagued with \\"romantic\\" desires. The main character Sophie drove me insane. All the characters kept talking about how strong she was yet she was extremely pathetic. If I had to hear the phrase \\"The hell I will\\", \\"Michael\\" or that she was moistening her lips one more time I thought I was going to vomit. Johansen is normally a fantastic author but I was quite disappointed with this one. This book seemed thrown together just to get another novel on the stand.

When reading one gets the impression that she just wanted to complete a book and many sentences were there only to make it the proper lenght.

Unfortunately, it isn't. I find the same stilted, sparse storywriting here. This is connected with the aforementioned Countdown, happening after that book and reintroducing MacDuff and Jane.

Please be careful what you are giving to your children and save this stuff for later. I hope to have it pulled from the shelves at the elementary level.

This book, however, isn't one of them. The advice at times to be a little inconsistant, going between doing it all yourself (which is what I'm doing) and hiring a practice consultant. His methods for dealing with employees is quite heavy handed - I'm quite sure I wouldn't want to work for him.His comments on EMR software is quite laughably bad - using Word to do notes is so old and inefficent that I'm willing to bet a lot of things must slip between the cracks in his practice.Overall, its tough to recommend this book because the advice is off on things like EMRs, and the employee managing style is written by someone who obviously doesn't have a lot of leadership experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful viewpoint, but poorly written","review":"Like the other reviewers have mentioned, this book presents an interesting viewpoint. In effect, the author proposes an extremely hands-on approach to running your practice and esentially makes the case that a solo practice is the only way to go.The reason I wanted to post a review is that I simply could not believe the incredible number of typos and grammatical errors in the book. It was terribly distracting and made the book very hard to read. It seems like it was never reviewed by an editor before being published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Helpful","review":"As an R.N./Manager of a rural clinic, I bought this with expectations of a manual of day to day operations. Scheduling, personnel conflict,(beyond just firing bad employees), how to deal with patients who pose a challenge, i.e. drug seekers. Things of that nature. I realize now that I'm the wrong audience for this text. It is geared more to residents and new M.D.s I understand that, but the thing that made me crazy was all of the typos. Skimming through, I found five typos. The amusing part was the emphasis in the book of cutting staff down to minimum-apparently that goes for copy editors as well.Skip this for pure medical office management-probably useful for M.D.'s starting, or finding themselves confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great insight","review":"I am finishing my fellowship and am at the point of looking for work and deciding my future.

I found it very good for a first novel. The humor is thrown in at the right moments. Baker makes an Elizabethan history lesson at the beginning quite funny with her clearness and cynicism. I look forward to the rest of her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny? I think not","review":"The Amazon SF mailing (attributed to Therese Littleton) describes this as \\"funny... lively...hovers hilariously\\" and so on. By the same criteria Romeo and Juliet is a witty romantic comedy. By no means is this a humourless book; but in my mind, it is rather too bitter to be funny. None of which should prevent people from reading it: it is certainly an absorbing tale and well executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"more sitcom than scifi","review":"The time travel and life extension premise is great, but she doesn't do much with it. The rest of the book is full of sarcastic and irritating characters who really are not likeable that reads like a television sitcom. Once I realized I wasn't going to get a satisfying sci-fi experience and lowered my expectations to rock bottom, it was readable in a tawdry way. I might try another one though as the second novel is purportedly much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea! What happened?","review":"I found the premise of the story intriguing -- protecting plants for future generations. The history and the science appeared to be well researched, the characters had some substance and could certainly grow into rich personalities. I kept waiting for something to happen - interaction between the worlds, a spectacular find that could change history, a breach that required an operative from the company, a murder, something. I'm sorry to say I found it very boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea","review":"It started off as an interesting idea - physically enhanced humans travelling though time. However, once the characters were introduced, it quickly shifted from a science fiction novel to a romance novel and spend over two thirds of the book in the love relationship of the two main characters. Unfortunately, none of the characters were very well developed and so I couldn't even make sense of what they were doing. As a sci-fi book goes, this is a big dissapointment. It might serve better to be classified as a romance novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"In search of an original idea..","review":"I really do appreciate how original this book is. Most fantasy novels are very cliche and have a similar storyline and characters in them. This book was truly original. However I had a hard time following in some places of the book because she knows so much about the time period in which she is writing about, that she wrote too many details. I wouldn't recommend reading this to your children :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Romance with a Little Sci Fi Thrown in","review":"I agree -- they should have had a picture of Fabio on the cover so people would know what they were getting into.The first couple chapters were ok, after that it got really slow and painful.If you like to turn on PBS and watch yet another slow English period drama that takes place on a declining English manor/estate, then you might enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"painful!!","review":"I have to give the author credit for having a very original idea, but that's where it ended. The book is slow paced to a point where you just want to scream \\"get one with it!\\". I mean for being an immortal with such wisedom and skills, you would think that there would be clever ideas and with an attitude \\"I am a demi-god\\", but Mendoza as well as her collegues are boring and stupid.The sci-fi part of the book did not entertain me past her leave from \\"The Company\\". As for the romance, written like a couple of teenagers in love. This book is the first in a series, the question is why are there even more??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eternal Life or Humanity","review":"This was the first book of Ms. Baker's I have read. It will not be the last. I found it engrossing, and thoughtful both on an \\"enjoyable read\\" level and a metaphysical level. The victorian language takes some concentration to get a grip on, but the moments of real insight are in plain English. Mendoza faces fear at a very early age, and will be facing it repeatedly throughout her very long life to come. Good reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept, A Little Slow Paced","review":"Great concept, entertaining read, decent characters - but moved quiet slow. Almost more of a romance novel than a time-travel SF novel. The characters are almost *too* powerful with their gadgets and physical upgrades. I guess at the end of the day, I would say it was a flat and bit depressing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Premise/Un-engaging story-telling","review":"While the premise of this novel sounds like an interesting new take on the time travel, I put it down after about a 100 hundred pages. I found the writing and story-telling to be a bit run-of-the mill, and there didn't seem to be a lot of suspense or sense of curiosity sparked. The premise of the series sounds interesting enough that in a way I wish I get through it and see if it gets better, but I guess when it comes to sci-fi/fantasy I feel if a writer can't get the reader interested early on, I don't have a lot of faith that I'll care a lot about the middle or ending.This may be a sci-fi/time travel disguised as a commentary of historic events, which is fine, but in my mind in the tradition of great fiction you can have underlying commentary, as well as great story. I would also barely classify this book as sci-fi (though that is how the publisher has labeled it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"promising start, sputters out","review":"The premise of this novel is really good - the mixing of time travel and immortality. But after the first chapter, the book falls flat on its face. It turns into, of all things, a love story taking place in a badly observed counter-reformation universe. Well, to those of you hankering for people that live forever - read P Andersons Boat of a Million Years, or even (oh no!) A Rice's Vampire books. And for those of you who want a modern take on an historical situation, C Willis' Doomsday Book is far superior to this. Too bad. Maybe Ms Baker will hit her stride in the next installment - i.e., use the hook of immortality and time travel instead of forgetting where she started (and why most people who will buy her book bought it indeed!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is rare stuff - historical, funny, romantic SF.","review":"I read this in hardcover last spring, and I read it again when it came out in paperback with the nifty cover. It's a gem: science fiction that manages to be both romantic and funny when appropriate, without being a farce. The history is incredibly detailed and accurate, and for once an author seems to be observing the old maxim of those who do not study history being doomed to repeat it: she illustrates and points up her future with the details of the past, and her cyborg heroine's horrified comparison of one with the other. The original hardcover promised a sequal and, marvellously, it appears next month. Checking out the author's website will yeild an excerpt from the new one, and it looks to be as grand as the first. I can hardly wait - Ms. Baker's work is moving, well-crafted, thoughtful and actually entertaining. Hoorah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Valley Girl Meets Elizabethans","review":"In the 16th century a girl is rescued from the Spanish Inquisition, whisked to Australia for some secret training, and cybernetically altered into a genuis. What would you expect? Author Kage Baker clearly thinks the result must be a valley girl. This makes for a jarring incongruity which the novel never quite overcomes. Neither is it explained why our girl genius never seemed to have any affection for anybody, yet later somehow manages to fall in love. This book is typical of a certain sub-genre of sf which offers the illusion of character while missing the essential truth of the heart. Its first person narrator also provides detailed recollections of what happened to her when she was five - down to the things she didn't comprehend. Given the acclaim given \\"Angela's Ashes\\", this must now be acceptable even in \\"nonfiction.\\" This reader finds it amateurish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"After reading some of the great reviews on this site, I was fairly disappointed with \\"In the Garden of Iden.\\"All of the \\"science fiction\\" takes place in the first 10 pages of the book as the author describes The Company and the technology they developed to enable time travel. This chapter was well done and presented an intersting take on time travel.Once the main character makes it back in time, the story unravels like a 16th century Harlequin Romance. I'm surprised they didn't cast Fabio as Nicholas Harpole (the Cyborg's love interest)on the cover of this disappointing novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, moving, good science-fiction & deliciously historical","review":"This novel is a find for anyone who likes a good read, and is tired of vampire wanna-bes and Star Wars pastiches: it's witty, moving, good science fiction and deliciously historical. I'm picky about science fiction, I've studied Renaissance England for 20-odd years, and I don't like romances - but this book combines all 3 elements in a completely captivating way. It's fine original science fiction. The take on pre-Elizabethan England is detailed, fascinating and accurate. The romance is a fine human story. And it's funny besides! There's not enough love OR humor in science fiction, and this novel is a breath of fresh air. A series is implied, and I hope there's more soon. Brava!"},{"rating":"2","title":"correction","review":"I just wanted to mention that this book shouldn't be under the \\"baby-preschool\\" reading level (although I don't suppose it would hurt them much to listen to it).

It consists of a rambling, incohesive assortment of beer trivia and anecdotes that any beer geek already knows, random literary quotes containing the word \\"beer\\" or \\"ale\\" (example: \\"And when I think upon a pot of beer.\\"- Lord Byron), and some eyewitness-type accounts of prehistoric brewing events. Furthermore, Mr. Eames devotes as much or more content to prohibitionist propoganda and factoids than to pro-beer trivia!I think Mr. Eames and his editor were intoxicated. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"Frequently demonstrably wrong, and regularly claims \\"facts\\" that do not seem to occur in any other source, casting serious doubt upon their authenticity. Anyone repeating anything from this book runs a severe risk of perpetuating inaccuracies. For example, the claim in the blurb that \\"Twenty people literally \\"drowned in beer\\" in 1814 when a vat in a London brewery exploded\\" is simply not true - only eight people died, all when buildings collapsed, and the vat never \\"exploded\\", one of the hoops broke and it collapsed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun for beer lovers!","review":"A fun-to-read, qurky little book with lots of interesting information about the origins of beer - the author has really done his research for this book and has presented it in a fun, easy to read forum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda badly written","review":"I was expecting it to be a book and really it's like a book of quotations. Some good stuff about the ancient history of beer, which is really why I got it, but most of it is just quotations, that don't even necessarily have anything to do with beer they just have a word in it that relates to it. Pretty disappointed, but there is some good historical stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy, I'm scared...","review":"This is dark electro-dub, very noisy, very dark. If you like Scorn, Main, Ice and (of course) earlier Techno Animal stuff, this will be right up your alley.

A horror soundtrack for late night S&M, perhaps?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm....","review":"If I could I'd probably give it 3.5 stars but I'll round up because of the originality of the music. This is a collaboration between Alec Empire (of Atari Teenage Riot fame) and Techno Animal. If you have hear ATR let me tell you this is nothing like that. Or maybe it is. Imagine ATR making an ambient CD. None of the soothing sounds and music to put you to ease; Instead this mixes hard breaks and beats with odd noises here and there, while keeping a slow down tempo beat. If you listen to this while trying to sleep, you might get some nightmares. If you're interested in expanding your boundaries and like other solo Alec Empire stuff, this is the CD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many different views of your favorite Elfquest characters","review":"As long as you realize that this book just doesn't follow anywhere about the famous Elfquest adventures of the World of Two Moons (which has by now been named \\"Abode\\"), you will still enjoy all those stories, serious or wacky. Some are quite artful and some are pretty dreadful and not too accurate to the history of Elfquest. And you just won't believe the Warner Bros.-style cartoon featuring Cutter, Leetah and Skywise with all its ridculous visual gags and taunting references to the adventures of the Elfquest! And also, here's a very interesting tale where Dewshine safely drops her cub right after falling several feet right out of a very tall tree!

I enjoy his writing style, and the way he integrates the modern (Matt Mantrell) with the ancient. Fantasy has always been one of my favorite genres; and Stasheff brings it to a new level.I would strongly recomend this book to anyone who has read \\"Her Majesty's Wizard\\"; the prequel to \\"The Oathbound Wizard\\". If you haven't read \\"Her Magesty's Wizard\\", you may still enjoy it; but some of the references will not make sense to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"While I truly enjoyed the first book of the series (Her Majesty's Wizard), I found this and subsequent books in the series to be a major dissappointment. The main character never seems to learn anything, nor does Stasheff follow up with his leads from the previous book. Whatever happened to Max telling Sir Guy what orders to give? Or Matt realizing, after a year as a wizard in this world, that words have power? Major gaps like this shouldn't happen even in a poorly-written series; a Wizard in Rhyme had the potential to be so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"all roads lead to lifetime adoption","review":"I was disappointed by this book.

But please don't let this stop you from reading her Kate Delafield mysteries or The Emergence of Green. I was very disappointed because this is not what I would have expected from a Forrest novel.

It is the only stuffed Bob I could find and my little guy really likes it. Bob carries a flashlight that is easy to operate even for a toddler, all he has to do is squeeze the sides of the flashlight to make it come on. He likes the soft orange glow of the light and the doll is just the right size for little ones. The only thing I dislike about the light is that it does not have a switch, once you let go of the sides of the flashlight the light goes out. Also, the batteries cannot be replaced once they die, there is no way to get to the batteries without cutting the fabric of the flashlight open(unless there is a trick to it that I haven't figured out yet).Nonetheless, my son likes his stuffed Bob and takes it out with him quite often."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flash light Bob","review":"If you have a little boy that likes Bob-the-Builder, he will love this doll.

Having said that, I did found the book material excellent for a vocabulary reference. The verbal CD conversations were difficult to follow as a learning device, however, listening and reading at the same time did give a good opportunity to learn how to speak the Czech written words with some accuracy. I did use the text in the Czech Republic while we were there and it was helpful as a reference. I never made it through the CD's to the end. This to me was not a program that I could learn in only a couple of weeks, but it is a good foundation for someone who really needs to learn Czech over a period of time. The two stars are for the intensity needed to learn from the program, not the quality of what is provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for tourists","review":"I purchased this book for an upcoming trip to Prague, in hopes of at least learning a little of the language. Unfortunately, all I came away with was \\"please,\\" \\"thank you,\\" and \\"hello.\\" The book starts out doing a good job of outlining how to pronounce Czech words and how different accents change the sounds, however, the units stray increasingly far from anything useful to a tourist (including a conversation in which the 2 characters are having a domestic dispute). The book does include the numbers and other basics, but the cd does not cover their pronunciation.This may be a good supplemental cd if you are already in a Czech class, because it gives a good feel for the pronunciation of the language as a whole, however it is not useful for a tourist who needs to learn things such as how to ask how much something costs or needs to be able to read a menu. Thankfully everything in Prague was in English as well, but I would have liked to learn a bit more of the language before going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take only with supplement","review":"I find this book a churning chaos. I only recommend using it in conjunction with something like Czech: An Essential Grammar. Without something like that you'll be flipping around crazily every time you use this book.

Maybe had I not purchased 'Time to Kill' a year prior, my opinion on 'Meltdown', would have been different. Meltdown is nowhere in the same catagory as 'Time to kill'. The graphics to begin with are mediocre and better suited a less powerful system, i.e. the genesis or n64. Second the controls are cumbersome and hard to operate. There is no cycling of the weopons that made time to kill much more enjoyable.

A few of the DVD's were ruined and unusuable. The price was great and they will work fine for recording a sitcom or some funny snl skit (if there ever is one again) but i would not use them to record anything of length.

What else would a person want except a reasonable price? This, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Smart, Compulsively Readable","review":"This is a terrific read. Lerner has such a light touch, and such a delightfully wicked sense of humor, that anyone will empathize with her story: she's not just a fat girl looking for love and attention, but an extremely intelligent and self-aware person struggling with questions of meaning and worth. Her shocking swings up and down the scale are, for Lerner, swings between life and death, and between meaning and meaninglessness, hope and hopelessness. This memoir is one of the best I've read.I can think of about five people I want to buy this book for -- it would make a wonderful gift for anyone who's struggled with weight, depression, or any kind of existential angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Overall, this book was very disappointing. Yes, the author's story is quite poignant, as she recants her struggles in very good detail. It even has its funny parts. The problem is what the book does not do. Honestly, as a person who has had trouble with eating from time to time, I was hoping this book would give me some insight about why people become addicted to food, and some tips on how to overcome it. Unfortunately, I am now much more aware of the author's early sex life than I am of the nature of food addictions.I suppose that one could, after reading this book, come away feeling better about themselves, knowing that they are not alone or others may have it worse, but most readers of this book would probably know that already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in many ways","review":"Definitely one of the weaker memoirs in a long time. She could use some help with her writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a lot to like about \\"loathing\\"","review":"Extremely readable food-addiction memoir that, just like life, has no easy answers. But just knowing you're not the only one, struggling by yourself alone with these issues, is sometimes a real comfort, and this book is that! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"While the text was interesting, the writere never really tells how she solves her problems and merely wraps it up quickly. If you are considering reading this to try to work on your own eating issues, don't bother. The author really uses the book to complain about her shrink and never tells how she conquered her food demons. In fact, while she does recover from her severe depression after going on drugs, she never really conquers her eating issues at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left me a bit offended...","review":"The first half of the book kept me interested and wondering what would happen next but by the second half I was just trying to get through the book and finish. I know eating disorders are complex and personal but I have to say I was kind of offended that the exact weight in pounds that Betsey was (176) that landed her in a mental hospital, is my exact weight now! I think I am okay even though society seems to tell me otherwise. I would like to lose some weight but I found it difficult to understand her total emphasis on weight. I would think the drug use, casual sex and having an abortion would be more damaging. This writer has lots of promise but I can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't think of a worthy title for this awesome book . . .","review":"It took quite a while to get my hands on this book. Then, it sort of sat in my \\"to read\\" pile for a few more months before I picked it up. I read Camryn Manheim's book, \\"Wake up, I'm fat\\" and thought it was so amazing that I didn't need to read another book with this sort of theme.Fortunately, I picked it up one day and read it all in one shot. I knew that Lerner had done some good \\"how-to\\" sort of books, but was surprised at how easy the prose seemed to flow. It was easy to imagine being her at all of those painful stages and \\"Aha\\" moments.Even if you have never had a weight problem, this is a great book to read. As the mom of a 12-going on 20 year old girl, I am going to keep my copy in case I can get my daughter to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst sort of self-indulgence","review":"I was excited to find this book, especially after reading another literary agent's (Frances Kuffel's) fine work about fatness. But finding myself 40 or so pages into the book, I realized (1) the author was never truly fat; (2) the author is not truly crazy or suicidal; and most importantly (3) the author is not an engaging writer.Shame on the publisher for putting out this pathetic, self-indulgent little piece. And my sympathy for anyone who paid full price for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quick read, but not too insightful","review":"I was hooked at the start of this book, when Lerner described her relationship with food without self-pity or melodrama. But once her mental illness came into play, I felt like this was just another depression book about how great medication can be. I think many women can relate to Lerner's obsession with and relationship to food and eating, but few have been diagnosed as manic-depressive, as she was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"A six year sufferer of bulimia myself, I still cannot fathom the selfishness of this woman. Not only did she not care about herself, she couldn't give two sh*ts abut the lives of her unborn children. When you can't manage to stop purging even for the LIFE of a child, then you don't deserve them. The only reason I can give this two stars is because she had the courage to write such a terrible, short memoir about nearly-murderous activities.The book is written like someone inflating some things for extra attention, and desperately needs an editor. I can't tell you how many times there are two sentences in a row saying the same thing (such as \\"I had gained five pounds. They said I gained five pounds at the doctor on Oct 5\\" or something like that)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes me wanna be Straight!","review":"Great titles, HORRIBLE mixes.

Thank you internet for helping find all of these cool groups I would've loved back in the days of my youth. I agree with the other 5 star review that this is a wonderful CD of a little known industrial powerhouse from the early 80s. Excellent blend of rhythm and noise with a smattering of gritty male and female vocals in just the right places. If you like classics such as Nitzer Ebb and SPK you will enjoy Hunting Lodge. Unfortunate that the price is high due to the scarcity, but well worth it for die hard fans of classic industrial music."},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing collection","review":"I had to read a bunch of stories out of this book for a college course.

Stories deal with such varied topics as homosexuality, the Holocaust, Native American mysticism and small time crooks. Women writers are well represented. This collection features some very different choices, including a ghost story from Joyce Carol Oates.This collection will prove an invaluable resource for budding writers and literature majors alike. This would also be a great primer for someone unfamiliar with the most contemporary short fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"RELAX!!!","review":"I have several CD's and audio tapes from Kelly Howell's Brain Synch series. I use them for meditation and sometimes for backgroud ambient music. Some of the CD's in the series sound very similar, but \\"High Focus\\" is notably different from the others. It consists of 30 minutes of a single, continuous, low bass tone with a swirling, electronic \\"wind\\" noise blowing in the foreground. I know this doesn't sound like much, but the result is very effective. It makes for interesting meditation music, and is helpful background music for studying, working at the computer, or anything which requires high concentration.The CD contains two identical 30-minute tracks. The audio tape has the same 30-minute tack on each side.

Sadly, I found the writing to be a lot less compelling than those other tie-ins. The description was flat, the characters were simple and dull, and the plot was fairly predictable. Worst of all, it just wasn't very scary. Despite an attempt at a \\"did it happen or didn't it?\\" twist, I saw the ending coming about a hundred pages away. I'm afraid I won't be making reading further volumes in this series a priority."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad recipes, no balance","review":"This book has great photography, but unfortunately, cookbooks should be for tasting, not looking - and from my experience, this book falls short. Two recipes in particular - one for shallots and one for lemongrass / shrimp soup - have convinced us that we're never daring to try another recipe from this book again. Bitter, pungent sauces like oyster and fish sauce are given no other spices or ingredients to balance it out, leaving one with a soup, for instance, that tastes like dishwater. The curry recipes bear little resemblance to those in other Thai cookbooks, and some staples like coconut soup are omitted. On top of this, directions are sometimes spare. We're moving on to another Thai cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful pictures, unauthentic food, apparently","review":"I showed this book to my Thai boyfriend who poo-pooed many of the recipes in this book, claiming lack of authenticity. His words were \\"this is fake\\". I can't get a hold of many ingredients, I lack kitchen space to prepare many of these dishes, and looking at the ingredient lists, they'd cost me a fortune in money and time if I could get the ingredients.

I thought I was getting at least 180 pages of text, but I was wrong. Not to worry. You get a short workout while following each note in each arpeggio. After a while, you end up learning how to solo over each chord in a standard -- similar to John Coltrane. John Coltrane was known for soloing using a unique scale pattern per chord. This book helps you learn how to form each scale pattern per chord. Of course, you could also solo over the key of the song. I find soloing over each chord more melodic. It's up to you.So, get this book if you're looking to learn how to improve on your melodic solos, but remember, there are only 40 pages in this book --- 4 stars!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"average content","review":"this book doesnt contain the amount of information that you might expect.If you have no idea about apreggios then you will learn somthing from it however if you already have a basic knowledge of arpeggios this book wont be very helpful.it does howveer have a few nice superimposing ideas but nothing spectacular.overall i was dissapointed with the book and could of obtained the information from the web . chord arpeggio shapes arnt hard to come across.the book includes a cd but there are no backing tracks to practice your arpeggios"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful for me","review":"Any one of the many available books can be helpful -- but it depends on your learning abilities and where you are as a student of the guitar. I've been playing for over 20 years (which means very little but sounds impressive)and in the last 5-6 months I've been taking jazz lessons from a very good private instructor. Coming in, I had a good grasp of theory, scales and arps but wasn't able to really make music with them. At this point, I can comp through charts and somewhat melodically play over the changes, utilizing modes, scales, arps and melodic and harmonic minor scales (the melodic and harmonic minor scales are great). I am currently finding this book helpful for me to see other approaches and patterns to using arpeggios (arps) and finding it to be a small eye opener and helping me find more melodic usage of the arps I already know how to use. The book has a pretty basic beginning and expands as it goes. It's helping me at this point in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very complete video for mothers to be","review":"This is an excellent video for new mothers to be. I used it during my pregnancy and it was very encouraging. It starts with a warm-up and arm routine. Then it goes on to the middle, and lower body. It also has some special streaching routines and it has a part that practices the breathing for labor and relaxation. This is part that is the best. After you've had your baby it has some abdominal exercices with the baby near you (I noticed some exercices almost hit the babies)! Overall it was very helpfull and if you want to stay in shape during your pregnancy and practice relation and breathing you can get this video. The only thing is that the music was not very good and you have to listen to all the instruccions very carefully so you and your baby are safe. After having my baby I prefered other routines more ad-hoc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing and Annoying","review":"This 1993-produced workout is much too confusing - I had to watch it several times before I understood what was going on.

The plot is interesting -- I counted six characters with emotional or mental health problems (unusual in a romance novel.) Throw in a haunted house, an angry competitor, a belligerent teenager, her nervous mother, a jealous ex wife, a lovable large dog named Bear and a house fire set with the intention to kill...and you have an interesting story with twists and turns.The two main characters understandably have tension between them because of what happened eighteen years ago when their friend was killed in an accident. Joy blames Jeff for Jenny's death.The story moved along well until the last two chapters which, to me, were too long and full of too much detail. Show don't tell comes to mind. The suspense was watered down with joy's inner thoughts. Interesting, complex characters. Well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Joy returns to her home town and confronst the man she holds responsible for the death for her best friend in high school"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"This book started off slow,but it gets better was you go.You get excited with all the sixpence of what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author","review":"Edie Clarie has some WONDERFUL books.. along with this one she has :Borrowed TimeMeant to beWraithMud SistersTHESE ARE AWESOME ..
