Tracks # 3 to 12 here duplicate the original \\"Guitar Man\\" album. The rest of the tracks are previously unreleased songs from the same sessions. If I had to describe what these remixed songs sound like, I would say that majority of them sound like '80s country songs. For the most part, it doesn't really work for me.

Told in a rhyming fashion, with a couple of miscues and using a couple of the same lines from T'was a Night Before Christmas, Jenny is preparing for first grade and is excited for her new adventure. Unfortunately, this excitement turns to anxiety as she learns that her best friend will be in a different classroom. Being the brave first graders that they are, they go their own separate ways only to discover that after making new friends first grade will be twice as fun.For ages 4 and up, this will be a good book to read together before the beginning of a new school year to help alleviate the anxiety of going into a big kid class."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to the first grade world!","review":"It's hard to write a book about first grade jitters. Many of the books out there make the first day seem just perfect, when it often isn't. What I like about The Night Before First Grade is the way in which the author recognizes the potentially frightening aspects of the first day of school and resolves them in a realistic manner.For example, when the protagonist arrives at school, she learns that there are two sections of first grade and that her best friend will be in the other section. Bravely waving goodbye to her friend, she discovers new interests in her classroom. The lunchroom is busy and a bit scary, but she weathers it nicely.The text is in a rhythmic prose style, patterned after \\"The Night Before Christmas.\\" I was a bit skeptical at first, but it works, and young readers will appreciate the consistent beat of the narrative. Deborah Zemke's illustrations are upbeat and slightly funky - just like first grade!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet book","review":"I bought this for my daughter before she started first grade.

It's an easy and fun read. I recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review","review":"Personally I think this book is a rip off. It has lots of great designs, but the author only includes one category of design patterns. If you want the other two categories, you have to order and pay more cash for them seperately by sending a request to an address at the back of the book. I thought that all the design outfits that are in the book would have patterns, but it doesn't. I cannot believe that this author entices you with some fantastic clothes designs for the larger dolls and then says you have to dish out more money for two more sets of patterns listed as other catergories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Package; Disappointing Contents","review":"This set consists of two parts: (1) a book of photos of various fashion dolls wearing the author's designs, and (2) patterns for some of the outfits. The photos show outfits that are very boxy and amateurish. They reminded me of clothing I made for my dolls when I was ten. The few interesting outfits do not come with patterns. It seems that to get patterns for all the outfits in the book, one must purchase two additional sets of patterns; however, the box is large enough to hold all the patterns.The only pluses I could find in this set were the thumbnail biographies of each of the dolls, and the chart of the dolls' vital statistics.While the patterns are very basic, the directions are not, so this would not be good for a beginning sewer. The experienced sewer would not want to waste money on this.Had I been able to look this over before I bought it, I would have saved some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money!!! Or waste fabric to make anything from this!","review":"I got this when it was 1st released and was amazed at how horrible and amateur the patterns are. If you are new at sewing this may be a good start for basic, boxy outfits but don't expect to make anything really nice.And to add insult, all the patterns shown in the book are not included. You must order additional patterns to complete the set for extra $$.I kept the box to hold my own personally drafted patterns but couldn't even give the book/patterns away. I finally just donated it to a giveaway and I pity the person who received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit good, a bit bad","review":"I really loved the designs and photos, but felt that the directions were too complicated for a novice seamstress such as myself. I was HUGELY disappointed when I realized that, despite the description I had read before buying it, the box didn't contain all 27 patterns pictured. I ordered the additional two sets of patterns directly from the publisher. I felt this was misleading, but I made the investment hoping that I would find something useful. It was about 5 years ago and I think I had to pay about $15 extra, which made the set a LOT more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Came Quick","review":"This came quickly and works perfectly with the V.Smile my son has.

The 8th ed. should be published by 10/99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful Handbook","review":"The only reason this book is a four star and not a five is that you do have to learn to use it. It is especially beneficial when dealing with collaborative problems. The larger book was helpful in understanding the whole process of nursing diagnosis and what it is meant to convey; the handbook will suffice for most nursing care plans, rationale tends to be a student pre-occupation. The organization is alphabetic, very clear for me once you know the few nursing diagnoses that are NANDA approved. Carpenito gives clear assessment data that must be present to support the diagnosis and interventions that make sense to select from as appropriate to your patient.

Every single claim is based on one-sided information warped to criminal proportions simply to create the illusion that the PRC is a danger to the U.S. The author mentions Wen Ho Lee - does he explore in depth how the scientist was imprisoned for months without a trial or even proper evidence of his alleged crimes? Bill Gertz dares to address this issue, when the U.S. itself is playing police to the rest of the world, and within its very borders exists racism and oppression while both Gore and Bush mock themselves on Saturday night live.

Great pre-cursor to the Live with Jeff Beck Album. The drumming on Twenty One is kicking through the whole song. Different sounding bass by Fernando Saunders complimented by bass keys by Jan Hammer on several tracks. Although it doesn't quite hold up after all the years, Jan Hammer's sythesizer is very impressive and unique. Great CD and a good deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece!!!","review":"Having owned the vinyl version of Oh Yeah since it was first released, I am delighted that it is now available on CD. Though it's often hard to tell the difference, Jan Hammer makes a point of saying on the liner notes that there are no guitars on this album.

They play softly a lot--and I find that refreshing and intriguing. The sound quality (and I have a very good home system) is very fine--as if they are in the room with you.Overall, this is an excellent set--perhaps not up there for me with the Alban Berg (my all time fav), but in its own way on a par with the Tokyo, Italiano, and Takacs.

It ran just fine for the first 2 years. During the third season of use, I noticed a strange smell in my basement near the end of the humid season. Just the other day I was moving this humidifier to its winter storage location and noticed the rug under the unit was burnt! Then I lifted up the unit and noticed the plastic on the bottom was all melted and black. It turns out after pulling everything apart it was the compressor getting very hot. So hot I could not touch it. The scary thing is, the dehumidifier still runs and removes moisture. Had it died all together, I would have known something was wrong, but as it stood, I had no idea there was an issue until I unplugged it and moved it away to see the burn in the rug. I guess I now know what the smell was in my basement. At any rate, I'm lucky I did not burn down my house!

But the great merit of the work is precisely the rich demonstration of why the law should always be chosen instead of violence and revenge. Another positive peculiarity of the book is to demonstrate the point of view of several states regarding the defendants of war crimes, proving that the solutions are often the \\"tailoring\\" of heterogeneous interests of several winners of a war."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the all time greats","review":"Very little Howlin' Wolf video exists, making this a must-see for all blues fans. The back-up band (including Hubert Sumlin and Sunnyland Slim) is awesome, and Wolf puts on an amazing performance on vocals and harmonica, having total command of the stage. There are a couple of drawbacks - the audio quality is uneven, with the piano inaudible in certain spots, and Wolf seems a little unfocused - he talks his way through parts of the concert instead of singing. Also there are some unfortunate edits where they cut to interviews in the middle of songs. But these are minor flaws in an otherwise great DVD. The bonus song, \\"Sittin' on Top of the World\\", is the highlight of the set. Also be sure to see The American Folk Blues Festival Volume 2, AFBF - The British Tours, and Devil Got My Woman for other great Howlin' Wolf performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.U.

Knew nothing about it, but did some research online after purchasing. Seemed to work fine for me at first, but this morning, only it's second use, I noticed it was leaking just as many reviewers had complained. Also, the \\"smoothie\\" function produced more of a \\"chunky\\" than a \\"smoothie\\" which was very disappointing. Other reviewers have noted that the blade assembly tends to freeze up, and emits dark residue over time, as well as the motor failing after only 1 or 2 years. With only a 1 year warranty I don't feel too confident about this product. If only this $100+ blender worked as nicely as it looks I might keep it, but it's going back ASAP.Update: Finally decided to go for it and ordered a Vitamix 5200.

He was kind enough to share what he found after opening up the broken part. It was spot on. It's exactly what we found. Our blender lasted about a year. I used it infrequently and then only to make baby food and smoothies. I often had leaking problems and blamed it on my lack of sleep and general incompetence. One day I smelled burning rubber and the smoothie smelled of smoke. I was flabbergasted. How does a such an expensive, heavy duty and beautifully designed piece of equipment break so easily? The bearings do seem to explain what I witnessed. All that green liquid was also getting into the bearings not just leaking all over my counters. Eventually it heated up the rubber too much, thus the smoking and blades froze up. Now to decide if I should by the newest Breville or the Vitamix.... What say you all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!! Parts No Longer Available","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BLENDER!!! I bought one four years ago and the blade assembly just wore out when the blade bearing seized (stopped turning).

Back from customer service, they sent me a new one.Started using and started having problems on cleaning and leaks. Every time I had to take it apart to clean, when putting it back together it seems to have some major issues related to the design. Not easy and not an every day blender.Another terrible surprise, everything seems to be stainless steel, but it's is not.

The lighted buttons worked, but no motor. I contacted Breville Customer Service and was advised the since the warranty had expired, I would have to ship it to the one and only authorized repair facility in Illinois. In addition to the shipping (to and from) costs, I would have to pay a $10 processing fee. If it was the motor, it could cost around $150 (per the people at the repair store)..which would make it the most expensive small appliance I have owned.

I wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst blender ever","review":"This blender is the worst blender I have ever bought. It didn't even last a year before it died and was replaced by Breville. The blade is very difficult to remove. They actually provide a special handle to loosen the blade but not to tighten. To get the rubber ring to line up is a challenge. I would say 4 out of 7 times the rubber ring looks like it is sealing and then I put juice into it to blend and it spills out all over the counter and me. So I started to test the seal with water before I use it. So I have to get out the loosening handle to loosen the blade readjust the ring only to redo the process over and over again. What a nightmare. I just want to blend a simple smoothie without juice spilling all over me and the kitchen. The price is way too expensive for what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blades of Shame","review":"At a minimum, a good blender should not: 1) insolently leak smoothie all over the counter when your back is turned; 2) vacuum-lock base to bowl, thereby proving impossible for non steroid-using mortals to clean; and, ultimately, 3) short-out, tripping all of the kitchen fuses. When a blender does all three of these things in a six-month span from purchase, there is nothing left to do but warn others to stay far away. Basically, this is the DeLorean of blenders: it looks futuristic, has a dashboard worth of groovy functions, and is, at core, a piece of junk. My previous blender, a decidedly unglamorous $20 Sunbeam, lasted a decade. Sure it only ran on one speed and shaped ice cubes into arrowheads, but at least it worked. Do yourself a favor and put your cash towards an appliance where price is reflective of quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after about 20 uses.","review":"Started off great, no leakage like other complaints I've read here, but in the middle of making a Malt the front display lights went out and the Blender was completely dead. Been used about 20 times, mostly margaritas and a couple off malts. It died during what sounded like a free spin... where there is an air pocket in the blender and the blades have essentially no resistance. Accidentally tossed my warranty info, so I'm SOL and can't comment on the Costumer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS","review":"If you blend every day, this isn't the blender for you. It leaks about every other time that I use it. It comes with a tool to help remove the blade assembly, but the manufacturer says not to use the tool for tightening. You have to be very strong to tighten the seal so that it doesn't leak. Why else would it come with a tool? I weigh 195 lbs. and I exercise regularly, so strength is not an issue. I think some of the other reviews are FAKES from the manufacturer.Now it is making some loud grinding noises. I will return it and get a better one. I thought that $200 would get me a good blender but I was mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - bad blender","review":"I don't normally do reviews BUT in this case I wanted to warn anyone before purchasing this blender. I had same problems that all other 1 star reviewers had. Blender initially leaked a little (no matter tightness of the seal). Eventually the rubber connecting piece burned while in use and small rubber pieces became part of my smoothie. Not a healthy addition to a very healthy smoothie. Based on these reviews, I put the blender in the garbage and will not try to fix. AND WILL NOT BUY ANOTHER BREVILLE product again. Just a warning. I should add that this blender worked fine for me at first and I didn't believe the original posts about the troubles. This product doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - for a while but then it WILL fail.","review":"I've gone through two of these now and it is an amazing blender - but only while a certain part lasts: Specifically, the blade assembly - and it will fail. I promise you. If you are one of the lucky ones, you won't discover black rubber in your food (as I did the first time). How long was I eating rubber? Hopefully not long. The thing looks great, runs well for 6 months to a year, then you will need a replacement blade assembly - which may not sound like a big deal, but try to find one. Back ordered no matter where you look. Stay away from this until Breville fixes a serious problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned Rubber Smell all the timeAfte","review":"After about 6 months, the blender started emitting a toxic burnt rubber, electrical smell with use. It is absolutely horrible and I shall never again buy a Breville anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Blender!","review":"This blender leaked from the day that we got it -- never worked properly, which is so frustrating.

After about a year, it went up in smoke, literally! I tried to crush ice using the crush ice mode and it just started smoking. Before that it also leaked from the bottom like other reviewers mentioned. I will never buy another Breville branded item again! I had a toaster that cost about $100 and it too just stopped working after about a year. It seems that they make products that last up until the the warranty expires then they fail on you. Seems like some kind of sham to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking Black Liquid, Contaminates food","review":"The first and second (replaced under warranty) blender leaked whenever I tried to tighten by hand. When I received the second blender, I used the blade removal tool to the tighten slightly. It worked just fine for about 2 years and now it is leaking black liquid and produces burnt smell during use. This smell permeates the contents of the jar and ruins it. I expected a much longer use from a $200 blender. Please don't waste your money on this one. BTW: I purchased three other Breville appliances (tea kettle, toaster, juicer) prior to or around the same time as the blender. All three of these items are still going strong with no issues. Look elsewhere for a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"love/hate relationship","review":"i have a love/hate relationship with this appliance. on a good day it is easy to assemble and my morning smoothie preparation runs smoothly with the blender creating a perfect blend of my frozen banana, ice, milk, and supplements. on a bad day, usually if i take the appliance pieces out of the dishwasher and attempt to assemble them while there is any remnant of moisture remaining, i have difficulty assembling the pieces and eventually i have a \\"smoothie catastrophe\\" flowing through the bottom of the apparatus onto my counter. i would not buy a breville blender in the future unless they redesign this product to eliminate this problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"Worked brilliantly the first time! I'm sure it would still work brilliantly, except for the fact that it leaks. I've read recently that some people still use it & just clean up afterward. Mine leaks too much for that even. I feel like the O ring just doesnt provide a firm seal between the jug & blades or something.Its so sad as I thought I'd splurge so that this kind of thing wouldn't happen to me. I think I'll stick with the cheapies. I've emailed them to see what I can do. Hopefully they will get back to me soon.Just for reference I'm located in Australia too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty design","review":"We have had the same issue as a few reviewers & also will never buy another Breville product. We only used it for making smoothies & stopped doing that, when it kept turning itself off after a few seconds on the purée mode. When it started smoking & caused one of smoothies to taste like burned rubber...we called Breville. They responded by sending us a new glass jar set, which although a nice gesture, does us no good, since the motor is worthless. The irony here is that my parents AND my in-laws, BOTH still have the Oster blenders they received as wedding gifts (over 50 years ago) & they still work! If Breville can't stand behind their product, with a design flaw they know exists, then NO ONE should be spending $200 on one. We now have a Blendtec at home & absolutely love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender terrible! I want my money back","review":"I think it is a design flaw. We never have got this to work properly.

Its quiet, it blends up and chops ice seemlessly - that is for the first few months.I found myself trying to tighten and tighten the blender more and more. Finally, I gave up and have returned it.Breville should recall all of these and work thru the leaking problem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Blender on Planet Earth","review":"If you manage to get the bottom of this unit off which you surely must do each and every time because everything that you make in it will definitely get stuck between the parts Good luck getting it back together. And if you do get it back together good luck tightening it just right so that all of your liquid doesn't spill out next time you use it which it will because you CANT tighten it JUST right. Have you ever heard of a blender that comes with a cheezy contraption JUST to loosen the blade every time? This the second one of these blenders that I have owned, I thought the first was an anomaly but I was wrong. Bad blender straight up BAD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent design, but very poor reliability","review":"I love using this blender.. except when it breaks. This is the best thing I ever used to blend ice cubes, strawberries, and fruit juice. The intermittent feature is very useful. The first time I bought this, the motor burned out the second time I used it and it was replaced under warranty. With the second one.. now after two years, it started leaking heavily from under the blade seal. The plastic slots under the jar are broken so the motor would only turn on when I had the jar aligned in certain directions (cheap plastic). Finally, the metal blade spun into oblivion and broke apart entirely tonight! Into four pieces! This Breville blender has top notch form and function, but it just falls apart after the warranty expires. Very interesting contrast/irony to see a company with such a well designed product have that same product keep falling apart so miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good - until it started to get rusted","review":"I moved into a city by the ocean and after a few months my blender was full of rust.....other than that, excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible blender","review":"Supposedly good reviews caused us to get this blender. But it leaked liquid out the base, and it couldn't blend smoothies to save its life. Threw all the stuff up the sides, had to keep pushing it down. Then I bought a Ninja blender and it rocked!! Half the price, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade Assembly Did Not Last Long","review":"My Breville had about 15 blends before it went bad. It never leaked, but it's always been very difficult to attach the blade assembly to the base and after the 15th blend, the black rubber thing that the blade assembly fits into, started to deteriorate. Talk about burning rubber! It's just a matter of time now before it's totally useless.EDIT 11/9/10I've written to Breville about the blade assembly going bad and they sent me a new one, however, it did not fit. I wrote back and they said I have the older version and are sending me a new glass container also; all at no charge. I am very impressed since I've had the blender for about 7 years. I'll update after I receive the new parts and have made a bunch of smoothies."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks forever","review":"while this blender does nice smoothies, i spent half my time making sure the base was screwed in tight and the other 1/2 of the time, unscrewing it. it even comes with a tool (one more thing to keep track of ) to help get the leverage right to unscrew it. can't do it w/hands alone! also, they tell you a specific way to hold the glass part when screwing in the blade to avoid leaks....too much effort.motor just gave out - i think from too much water getting in the base from cleaning the junk off when it leaked. all in all, good smoothies but a bother..will try other brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product not reliable","review":"This product dies after 2.5 years. I probably used around 50 times and it is about $4 for each blending.The cleaning for this product is also not very good. The bottom cannot be easily seal even with their tool. Not worthy it. A cheap blender will last longer than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS LIKE A SIEVE!","review":"I am so disappointed after shelling out 200 bucks for this \\"high end\\" blender. It leaks every time I use it, regardless of how much I torque the heck down on the base. Loved the design idea behind the curved base and the removable base for access to the blades when cleaning - seems like an obviously bright idea that should have been incorporated into all blenders - but I guess there's a good reason non one ever built blenders this way before. Wish I hadn't given away my good old Osterizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender DOA- I was warned but I did not listen","review":"The blender is DOA after two lite uses so we're returning it to Amazon. I read the other reviews but thought the blender had been improved, WRONG! We have two other Breville products, the tea maker and the convection oven and both are good products, but the blender is an over priced flawed product. It is made in China so I guess I shouldn't be too surprised. This replaced an old Oster that never failed so we are going back to a $39 Oster and I bet it will be far more reliable than this terrible product. Wake up Breville-you must know by now this is a bad product-but greed trumps integrity I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"DESIGN FLAW - DO NOT BUY","review":"As other reviews have already mentioned. This blender has a design flaw and will eventually fail. Unless you like burnt rubber and bearing grease in your smoothies then stay away from this one and save yourself $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the price","review":"I had to replace a trusty old $40 blender that finally gave out after 4 years and my fried had just bought one of these and gave it high praises. I was concerned about the similar design to the cheap model - i.e. the little rubber gasket that eventually leads to leaks but we \\"decided\\" that certainly since the price was so high the rubber ring would surely be some special kind that would last much longer :-)Anyway long story short, the Breville started leaking within 6 months whereas it took 4 years before I had problems with my cheap model. We managed to get it tightened so hard that now I can't loosen it any more o the whole thing goes in the dish-washer fully assembled. The good news is that it works for now, but I can't wait until it totally breaks so I can replace it. Definitely NOT worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad engineering - cool design","review":"We used this blender occasionally. After the bearings seized up on the blades the second time (seller replaced the whole blender the first time)and sparks flew out of the base that went dead, it is time to get a real blender.

My wife used it about 10 times. In October 2009, there was no power - it wouldn't turn on. The troubleshooting section of the accompanying guide does not address the problem adequately,and Breville's tlephone/web site is no help. The blender failed for no apparent reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"We spent a lot of money on this blender thinking that it would be worth it, but it was NOT. It leaked all the time, the rubber gasket got moldy (no matter how much we washed it), and eventually the leak corroded the outside bottom part of the unit and rusted the bottom part of the blade assembly. Because the unit is out of warranty Breville was no help. I emailed them and they referred me to their customer service number and warned me that it would be quite a long wait on hold. Gee, I wonder why. Don't buy this blender it will self destruct right after the warranty is up. All of the positive review here are no doubt posted by happy Breville employees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak blender","review":"I was very disappointed with this blender. On its highest setting- there are only 5 of them - it just whirrs a bit. Sounds like a car that might not make it up a hill and you just want to give it a push and hear it kick into gear. But it doesn't. I blended a ripe banana shake and it came out with large chunks of banana. I got it for Christmas so I think I'm pass the return period, otherwise I would. Also, the glass pitcher is very heavy and not so easy to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"never again","review":"I purchased a refurbished blender from abes of maine,it stopped working after 2 weeks and 3 uses.no one wants to take responsibility to help to get it to work again.This was agreat lesson for me.

It performed great while it lasted until the cheap mechanism that transfers the motor power to the blades broke. Contact Breville for support, very difficult to get through. Since it was out of warranty it was going to cost $75 for this part. Instead of spending that I decided just to buy a cheap store bought blender, which has performed very well for over a year. When it breaks I will just replace. For any appliance that is going to cost $$$ consider the warranty from the manufacturer and the reputation of the company. A one warranty is not enough when spending this much on a blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a leaky one folks","review":"I thought this blender would solve all the issues I've had with previous blenders; dying for no apparent reason, difficult to clean, gears becoming stripped, etc. It's a nice looking blender and very quiet. However, no matter how much I try to secure the blade component to the base of the jar, it ALWAYS leaks from underneath. Sometimes when I pour my juice or milk into the jar, it literally comes pouring out from the bottom and all over the countertop. I have to quickly pour the liquid into another container and attempt to tighten the blade some more. This leakage makes cleanup a hassle because I have clean the base and under the gears every time. Additionally, I have to pour my smoothies into a glass over the sink. I'm going to be returning this product and looking at a Vitamix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied client","review":"The blender is excellent. My family is using it every day to make healthy smoothies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"This seemed like a good blender as it is very quiet and does a great job. However, there is a huge design flaw with the base that requires a lot of torque to remove and replace. Even after tightening it down with the special tool it often leaked until I \\"really\\" tightened it. My wife struggled and complained constantly with this aspect and even chipped the pitcher while trying to remove the base.Then after about 14 months, the motor quit and it only has a flashing red light when powered on. We emailed Breville and they responded that the unit was out of warranty and it needed to be sent to one of their repair shops at my cost. Sorry, but I expect more from a $200 blender and will not be purchasing any Breville products moving forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been a Great Blender","review":"In July 2007 I bought a Breville BBL600XL blender after it had been recommended by Popular Mechanics magazine.

It leaked and the bearing siezed up just as described. I bought a new jar unit and after several months it did the same thing.

To make long story short, in the last two years since I bought it, I've got a new glass jug, replaced each the rubber seal/ring and the bottom piece (the blade) twice...all for the same two reasons: leak and stinky smell. I miss my old blender!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutting corners in quality","review":"I've had this blender for a couple of years now. When it's new, it's impressive. Looks solid, nice design, glass and steel.Here's the problem:1) If it isn't cranked tight, it leaks. Everywhere. Some people will not be strong enough to crank it tight enough.2) After two years, the 'stainless steel' is flaking off in large amounts.Companies like Breville that have a retail price around $200 for a blender need to make sure their Chinese supply chain isn't cutting corners, which obviously theirs is. Breville can't keep charging Grade A prices for cheap junk from grade C factories. I suspect the rest of their gear is likely of the same quality.Do yourself a favor. Invest in a Kitchenaid http://www.amazon.ca/KitchenAid-KSB565OB-5-Speed-Blender-Glass/dp/B002R59ZQ6 or similar quality unit and look forward to handing it down to your kids 20 years later.Now I have to go buy a new blender. Grumble..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most frustrating appliance I've ever used...","review":"This blender looks like a great machine and, every once in awhile it will prove to do a fantastic job. However, about 80% of the time there is a air cavity around the blades (which I thought the \\"hemisphere\\" design was supposed to eliminate), when you are trying to blend anything thicker than tomato soup consistency. About the only thing I use it for is fruit smoothies, and I usually do more to make the smoothie by hand than what the blender does; as I usually have to have the lid off and am constantly scraping, pushing, and stirring until it actually decides to start the mixture into the even blending motion it's supposed to have. Would absolutely NOT recommend this product. I used to really enjoy making smoothies in the mornings but now am usually ready to throw the thing out the window by the time I'm done. Next time I'll try a $20 generic blender."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Great Product!","review":"When I decided to purchase this blender, it was after much research. I had originally thought I wanted a juicer. After reading many reviews, it seemed that all to often the much sought after juicer ends up rarely used by many people after a few months. I decided to go with a blender for now, and if I really liked making smoothies (and Margaritas!)after a few months, I'd take the plunge and get a juicer as well. So, that being said, this is a great blender! I like the solid and weighty glass pitcher. I love that it crushes ice with ease and leaves no little chunks in my drink. It is as quiet as possible when crushing ice, and very powerful. I've also begun to use it for chopping veggies up super small for hiding in meatloaf, sauce etc. The kids hardly even know it's there! This is the one you want...buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but Unreliable","review":"I just repackaged my second Ikon 600XL. I'm taking it back. It doesn't work reliably. Sometimes it works great. Other times it would not turn off unless I pulled the plug from the wall. The second one had a strange habit of pulsing everything, so there was no \\"constant on\\" for any of the settings. One other thing: this baby is XL tall. My cabinets are higher off the counter than in most kitchens, so check your clearance before buying this blender.I liked the glass container, the style, and the small footprint. The buttons sure were pretty. It looked as good on my counter as my KitchenAid mixer, too. But, what good is pretty when it doesn't work properly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID - Leaking, display broken, smells after 2 weeks","review":"The blender LOOKS great but...it started leaking after the 3rd use. I figured it must be \\"user error\\". Read the instructions, assembled everything by the book. But it happened the 4th, 6th, 8th, etc. time too. It just does not seal.Then the digital display stopped working. I'm guessing due to constantly leaking and getting moisture in the components.And it has started to smell. Even though I disassemble and clean the entire thing, it seems like liquids get stuck somewhere you can't get to and it's starting to smell.A big disappointment from Breville. I actually have every other Breville appliance (juicer, coffee grinder, coffee maker, kettle) and am happy with them.But I would NOT recommend this belnder! Even my old cheap Cuisinart is much better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Tough Blender","review":"A great product.

When putting it back together it seems to have issues. I think the problem is the gasket is very flimsy and needs to be in the perfect position, other wise it leaks.The base is suppose to be stainless steel, which I question because it is corroding on two sides. It is now out of warranty and the lip of the blender chipped and there are not any replacement parts available.This was a real waste of money, I will not be purchasing this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power button did not shut off on 2nd use","review":"I'll give this blender a higher rating when the company provides me with a replacement. It's a sleek, sexy machine that is fast and it worked beautifully, but on the second use the power button would not shut off the power supply.I am in the process of sending it back with a shipping label that the company provided over the net, but not having saved the packaging, this is going to be a hassle for me, as I hate schlepping, including hang-time on the phone and getting no sympathy from a rep when they finally called back.For $200.00 for a blender I would have expected better results, and I'll be bleeped as to why a button would be inoperable to shut down the power supply. Lastly, I would not recommend this blender to anyone with weak forearms or wrists as with its wide diameter and heavy glass, it takes two hands for an older person, especially with a full volume of soothies in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breville BBL 600XL Blender not recommended","review":"Received this as a gift less than two years ago and it stopped working after no more than 12 uses.

I tried using every feature and button on the blender, I removed half of the ice so that it was only filled up 1/3 with ice, I even had two friends try it to see if I was doing something wrong. Still no crushed ice. Breville claims that this blender can be used to chop or puree vegetables, but after the experience that I had with the ice, I can be sure that it won't be an effective kitchen appliance for anything other than blending liquids.It's too bad....I really hoped and expected this to be an exceptional kitchen appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an outstanding kitchen appliance","review":"After you use one of these, you'll never go back to a whimpy blender. It's relatively QUIET, but most importantly, its POWERFUL. I bought this becasue Porular Mechanics rated it the best, and I'm convinced they were correct. It will start right up under a heavy load of solid friut or vegetables. Try that with the standard blenders most folks use. This feature is important if you're making healthy shakes or smooties. Lesser blenders will wear out out soon with steady use of these heavy loads. When it's done the smoothies are truly smooth. That's also a great feature this unit offers over most of the competition. The ability of the Ikon 750 to crush ice is almost beyond belief. You get what you pay for with this high priced blender.

Breville acts like they are going to let us return it but I have now made 5 phone calls and sent 3 emails and I still have the broken blender though in conversation they say we will get a replacement. (We can't get that until they receive the broken one. They are suppose to send us a FEDEX shipping label via email. Once they receive the broken unit they will send us the new one. We can't get them to send us the shipping label. Therefore, we can't get a new one)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice blender until...","review":"This is a great blender that I enjoyed very much for the first six months until some liquid got into the NON-REMOVABLE rubber seal on the inside of the container and started to smell...Unappealing.That said, it was a great blender while it lasted.

At first this blender is AMAZING, however give it some time of real use and it's a nightmare. The blade frequently sticks and doesn't perform like it use to. There is a burning rubber smell and sometimes you see pieces of the rubber from below sprayed around the base. DON'T waste your money!

But as I read on, I began to form the impression that I should be feeling bad about who I am (a Caucasian woman from Minnesota with everything *apparently* handed to me on a golden platter.) To tell you the truth, I found the book quite offensive. I am sick and tired of having to feel bad for every Tom Dick and Harry African American who has had something bad happen in his/her life and who wishes to use white people as the scapegoat.

My first thought was \\"this is exactly what I need.\\" I often have to scramble from one city to another, often at the last minute and it's easy to miss important meetings.If the software worked with Meeting Maker, I'd be happy, but it doesn't and for some reason when I convert from Meeting Maker to Outlook, the software hangs during the Outlook import.

It breaks up e-text articles into chunks equal to the memo size limitation of Rex. This allows even huge novels to be downloaded to the Rex. I recently downloaded Maugham's \\"Moon and the Sixpence\\" on to the Rex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful because it's small enough to take everywhere","review":"I had been using an Apple Newton for a few years and wanted to upgrade to another personal organizer. The Rex is nice because it's incredibly small size makes it so easy to take with you. I keep in with me almost whereever I go and it's a great comfort to know that I have contact information with me everywhere. The memo storage feature is also nice: I use it to store various tidbits of information and it has replaced stacks of Post-It(tm) Notes all over my desk. I have a Toshiba Libretto that I mainly use to program the Rex. I also bought the docking station but it doesn't get much use because my main computer is short of serial ports. Two drawbacks: There is no input capability whatsoever; it must be programmed from software on a PC. The proprietary software that comes with it is the only way to program it without spending more money.

Her instrument wasn't perfect. There was a very wide vibrato and shrillness and limitation at the top which increased with time. Yet, when I saw this singer on stage as Fidelio, there was no doubt about her strength of character. Still, this is an exciting CD.Once again, the Decca folks were a little stingy with this reissue.

Especially convincing were his arguments on the true identity of the mummy found in KV55, and the evidence pointing to Akhenaten's co-regency with Queen Nefertiti as Smenkhare.

Which was for the better, I'd add. The author has done deep research, and reported every word of it. He rambles into mostly irrelevant and fairly menaingless anecdotes that do nothing to help us understand the inner Jimmy.This is a demanding book. You almost need a notepad to keep track of the awkward leaps forward and back through history, along with unpredictable changes in narrator, tense and setting.

You may be wondering what the difference is between this, the 679, and another model a lot like it, the 680. I have both and I much prefer the 679. The 680's main feature is that its minimum length (i.e. fully collapsed) is less than the 679. However, you give up something for this increased portability - the 680 is fatter and heavier than the 679, and the extra section makes it slower to deploy. For most uses, it really doesn't matter how long the monopod is when it's collapsed, so unless you need it to fit in a travel bag or backpack, you are better off with the 679.I'd also recommend getting the Manfrotto 234RC Monopod Head for use with any monopod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and useful","review":"I've had a really cheap, junky tripod for years.

It appears that to cut the cost, they only made the bottom thick with that triple layer of metal. Normally that wouldn't be a problem, but the bonding of the bottom to the sides leaves a lip where food can catch and get burnt into the pan. (difficult to clean)If you need a big pot, keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful CD","review":"Dennis happens to be my flamenco guitar teacher. I don't agree at all with the previous reviewer's comments. I think the guitar sound is fine. But, actually seeing Dennis play in person is something to be experienced. He's such an amazing teacher. He's extremely articulate, very personable, but firm, and so amusing. He studied with Sabicas himself for many years and his stories about him are so fascinating. I hope he puts out more cd's because the whole world should know about Dennis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful technique - bad instrument - bad sound","review":"Mr. Koster's mastery of the instrument is wonderful. However, he sounds as though he's playing his flamenco music on a classical guitar - not an instrument made for playing flamenco music.

The book is logical and simple to follow. I have worked with other 3D software, but I needed a quick start in Max animation, so this book was basic enough. So I was able to jump into this project without much troubleI came back and dropped my rating to 4 stars, because I did find a couple of small mistakes in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginners","review":"This book is great for someone who is starting out with MAX. This book is best used to learn some basic tools of MAX while creating a character. This book should not be used for learning how to create a character that you may be using in a demo reel. The character is too basic and lacks in detail. The clothes are just extrusions of the body, the legs and arms are just cylinders with little to no depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent layout, abundant illustrations","review":"It's very well laid-out graphically, which makes it easy to pick up and find appropriate content.

If you prefer a medium-point pen I hihgly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimi & Me","review":"Jimi and Me is about a young boy Keith, who through the magic music of Jimi Hendrix, overcomes the challenges,lies,struggles, and secrets of his family. Keith's family changes in many ways throughout the book, and he holds on through the love of music that both he and his father have.The format of the book is interesting, written as if in song lyrics. Because of this, it can sometimes be hard to understand exactly where, when, or who is in the scene. This makes it hard to choose a specific scene that was my favorite, but the whole book because of the format, keeps you reading, and it is enjoyable.I definetly recommend this book. It is a quick read, and pages are very short, due to the \\"songs\\" they are written in. The more you read into the book, the more Jimi Hendrix lyrics you will find. A great choice for any Hendrix fan. The story of Keith can easily be linked to many other people's personal stories as well, so all around, this is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cleaner and protectant!","review":"I purchased this 303 Fabric after reading the reviews but was hesitant on the price. It was worth the money. I used the cleaner with a small fabric brush on my convertible beetle and it cleaned really well.

It was pretty amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for a Mini Cooper Convertible.","review":"I cleaned the top as directed. Let it dry. Used this product as directed placing a few light coatings on. Then, it repelled water until the car was washed.

I will be trying another product now for our Mini's convertible top."},{"rating":"1","title":"303 Fabric Convertable Top Kit","review":"Cleaner works very well. Top treatment........not as well as I hoped. Water beads off only with light rain, if it rains all day, or HARD - it really doesn't seem to be any better than when it was untreated. I will try a different brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Applied properly, Water Beading not Consistent","review":"Bought this because I wanted to get my car \\"winter\\" ready meaning the rag top has to be water repellent.I applied this as a last step in the car washing process. After rinsing and deep cleaning the top with the rag top cleaner, I waited until the top got a little dry per the instructions. I then liberally applied the sealer product to the top and waited for the product to get soaked in and set. I then applied another layer of sealer to add further protection and added double the needed amount along the seams.Once it was done, the top glistened with the product and I was sure it would repel 100% of water. Not so much when it rained. The water would bead in some areas and not in others, and even the water beading in some areas would then soak in over time. It was not 100% repellent as I had hoped and came no where close to how water beads when you first buy the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"303 Convertible top kit","review":"LOVED the water repellent treatement - water beads up like on fresh wax. Cleaner was fine but not clear that it worked any better than just a regular wash. I treated a small cay (Sky) and almost used the whole bottle of treatement.

To be fair though, I did apply it fairly liberally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Used this pair to clean & waterproof/renew convertible top on a '97 BMW.Once dried, the top shed water as if it hated the stuff!It was as-if I'd used the equivalent of RainX on the fabric.Also, somewhat faded color was renewed (!)NOTE: The bottle of CLEANER is unnecessary.MFG or 303 Protectant -on bottle- calls for use of any 100% soap, including a solution of Ivory soap you can make for maybe 60 cents.If not for this would rate 5 Stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product!","review":"Im not a big \\"reviewer\\", but had to quickly comment on this product.

Don't purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copper washed off","review":"This product claims to have an aluminum and copper bottom. However, the copper part of the pan washed off after about 2 months of use. So the product basically just has an aluminum bottom and stainless steel sides which is no better than cookware that is less expensive. I have a set of All Clad and would spend the extra money to get better cookware. The heating on this pan is so uneven and burns everything very quickly unlike the all clad. The two are not even in the same ballpark. I can't believe that Emeril would put his name on such an awful product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised Emeril fan-very poor product","review":"I purchased the 10 pc set. I am so surprised the Emeril would allow his name on this cookware. It is so poorly balanced, bottom heavy it takes two hands to pour from even the smaller pans. The glass lids with the steel band are very hard to clean. On two of my pans the bottom copper and aluminum layers separated rendering them useless not to mention dangerous.

Great professional cooking set, heats quickly and evenly and you only need to use half the amount of flame as with other lighter pots/pans. The only negative remark I can give is the handles could use some better heat proofing. If you watch Emeril, just do as he always does and use your towel or hotpads!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality for the Price","review":"My mother in law gave us the set because she is a fan of Emeril. Being a gourmet cook myself, I can say that the Emeril cookwares are not for serious cooking. They don't heat evenly, and very hard to clean. There are permanent discoloring spots everywhere after first use. Since I hang all my cookwares on a pot rack, I find Emeril cookwares too dirty looking to present, even though they were cleaned with much effort. Eventually I tossed them out, rather facing my displeased mother in law than eating bad food.Like the old saying, you get what you pay for. Emeril cookwares are cheaper than all clad or other big brands because they are not as well made. Since you can use a set of cookwares for many years, I recommend buying a good quality set. Otherwise you might buy twice and wind up paying more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap!! Pot Melted, ruined our kitchen floor","review":"These pots are not actually made by All-Clad. They are made out of country and All-Clad puts their name on them. Be very careful with this cookware. While steaming some broccolli, the water boiled out within 1.5 minutes. The pot then started squirting molten aluminum out of the copper band on the pot. This metal burned our floor badly. Luckily no one was hurt. Check out this website for pictures. http://home.earthlink.net/~stevens/id4.htmlSo far All-Clad would not pay to replace our floor. It looks as though we will have to get a lawyer and sue."},{"rating":"1","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"I love this cookware.

I expected more out of these pans. They are beautiful but not usable."},{"rating":"1","title":"HMMMMMMMMMMM.......","review":"Well, we got our set,and being the scientifically minded family we are, we put our magnets all over our stainless steel pans. Oddly, the handles are barely made of stainless steel, (we wanted a lot of stainless steel there so that we could hold the handles without them getting too hot too fast) the sides are not made of stainless steel at all (we wanted steel there, it is not good to eat too much aluminum) and the bottoms were heavily made of stainless steel. (Don't want that much stainless steel there, too much stainless reflects heat and causes poor conduction!) So our pans were totally not what we hoped for in the way of construction. Going to find another maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cookware Ive seen","review":"Emrilware is the worst cookware on the market. We bought it and hate to cook with it.

I've sent 2 emails to the selling vendor (not Amazon directly) and have not received a reply to either as yet (the second email has been less than 3 days).

I've had no problems whatsoever with this set. Everything cooks like a dream and I have washed them repeatedly in the dishwasher and they come out just as shiny as when I purchased them. I highly recommend this set for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I just want to say how extremely disappointed I got when my food started sticking to bottom of the large frying pan. I'm unable to even fry eggs in a morning, they stick to the bottom!!!!! Who would've though that Emeryl's product would be such a poor quality! I'm even more disappointed because I threw away my old frying pans right after I got this set, without even testing it first, so now I have to buy more pans. Not at all recommend this product! Not sure how people can be satisfied with this set, maybe they never owned a nice set of pans before and don't know what a $200 pan set should be like."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERYTHING sticks to these pans!!!!","review":"I'm an experienced cook so I can assure you I'm using low heat and various things like butter, Pam, and olive oil to keep the pan lubricated.

My crappy old T-Fal pans work better than this. Good thing I kept them on hand because I'm going to use those instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything sticks and hard to clean","review":"Almost everything sticks to these pans, unless boiling. I have to soad and use coarse scrubber to clean...and they still never become 100 percent clean. They always look dirty.

Nothing cooks right and everything sticks to the bottom of the pans - if your boiling it seems okay but that is all. Plus when cleaning you risk the chance of cutting yourself on the pans which I have done many times and I just cut my thumb just a few minutes ago washing the edges clean. These pans are horrible and if I could have given them a negative I would have. Emeril you put your name on these pans - you are nothing but a money hungry sloth. Careful thought should be given when making a purchase. Keep it in the good old USA - BUY USA MADE PRODUCTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice...","review":"Recieved these pots and pans from my husband for Christmas. I am very excited to use them. They are beautiful and very solid. Well made. My only complaint is when you first get them they all have a large sticker in the bottom of each that comes off easily with soap and water, however it leaves a residue which you can't feel, but you can see on the bottom of the pans. I'd like to know if anyone else has seen this and what can be done to remove it. I'm afraid to heat them up yet because I don't know if that residue is going to get darker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful","review":"The melting of the Emeril pan happened when the pan was completely supervised. Say maybe standing 7 inches from the pan. My intention was to put people on notice about a potentially dangerous situation, nothing more. Keep in mind anyone can write a review, even people obviously associated with the company who disclose information that was only contained in correspondence with that company. I have far more important things to do then sit and write reviews, but I felt that this situation was extremely dangerous. Just be careful, thats all."},{"rating":"2","title":"missing documentation?","review":"I ordered and received my set today, however, I noticed there is no documentation included. That is, no directions/instructions (care tips, how to use these pots, etc), and no warrenty card--or anything else except the pots and pans all wrapped up. Shouldn't there be some paperwork?The box says lifetime warrenty, but shouldn't there be a warrenty card inside? From reading all these reviews I got the impression that there is a directions/instructions paper that is included. Can someone confirm for me that I am indeed missing something here? Does the lifetime warranty not need any card or paper?"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My wife and I received this set as a wedding gift. The pots are great because of the glass lids. The pans on the other hand are just terrible. It is difficult if not impossible to brown anything. Food sticks to the pans and they stain easily and are difficult to clean. I had better luck with the $5 pans I purchased as a bachelor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookware","review":"This cookware is nice and heavy and sturdy. It heats much faster than the cheaper cookware we had before. It also heats very evenly. The only negative thing I have to say is that the food sticks to these pans quite a bit more than it would in teflon. However I think that one negative is greatly outweighed by the positive and a little oil or Pam fixes the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My! Quality control.","review":"After about 6 weeks of infrequent use the glass lid to the shallow pan shattered while cooking lima beans. Heat level was low and nothing unusual until \\"Pow\\" the lid shattered. After cooling we tried to lift the lid off when the handle fell off and glass fell into the beans. After checking some other review sites (Consumer Reports) we found that this is not an isolated incident. It appears that these pans were manufactured in China and the quality is not what it used to be. Can not recommend this set to anyone unless you just want to display it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER!!! I CUT MY FINGER WASHING A PAN","review":"I just want to warn everyone that these pots and pans have very sharp edges and I just cut my finger on an edge while washing a pan. I want to return the set as I consider them too dangerous to use. I spent about $150 on the set and think it was pretty much a waste of money. My advice is to check the edges of cookware before buying...I just went by the pictures on the box and couldn't tell how sharp the edges were...I'm surprised there isn't a recall....this is a safety issue!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wedding Gift Ever!","review":"Ok...my husband and I got married on the spur. So as a wedding present, my family pitched in and bought us this cookware set. I've not really cooked with any other products, except farberware. And this is soooo much better! I love everything about this set! It's so easy to cook with, clean up, and store! I truly love cooking with this set! My mom purchased the Wolf Gang collection, and it's just not the same! His are so light and uneven when cooking. Emeril's cookware is heavy, and consistant! It feels like I'm cooking in a real kitchen with these! This was definately a dream set, and am so grateful that my family bought these for us!

I have been using this set for over a month. The key is in heat control. Start at a low to medium flame and then let it build from there. The set is sturdy with a copper inlay near the bottom, insuring even heat distribution. Although dishwasher safe, hand-washing is recommended - although I have put in the dishwasher with no problems. The handles stay cool, which is also a big plus. However the lids do get hot, so use a mit for the lids.

I agree with all of the other reviewers here in that the sound quality is terrible (even a few feet away I was having conversations garbled and cut off), the design is poor, and worst of all the answering machine cuts off and loses messages. Almost all messages that are recorded are cut off half way and the machine also fails to record messages at all.

I only use the answering machine part now and have to use a traditional corded phone until I get another cordless because of the lack of quality workmanship in this hunk o' junk.

Security bypass tips for pre-schoolers !!","review":"Save your money !! I am in the security business and was looking for some possible ways to test our systems against burglars, etc. NOT with this book ! Almost throughout the book the author assumes that the person (read employee) trying to circumvent the alarm system is ALREADY INSIDE the building and can wait for a quiet moment to cut & splice some wires.... right! Most alarm systems are installed to keep STRANGERS out !!

There is absolutely no information in this book on how to circumvent an alarm system. His circumvention techique can be summed up in two steps: if the alarm system is disabled and you are already inside the house(hello!) twist the wires together which are connected to the transmitter. Otherwise cut the phone line. Gee thanks for the insight.

Then this book is very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book Tells of The Most Fatal Flaw in Security","review":"I read the other reveiws and wanted to leave one also. If one reads the book it tells of the single most vulnerable part of any security system. It is easily circumvented from the exterior of the building. If the communications link goes down then it's over. The system becomes useless and will not summon the police. After reading the book I have corrected the problem and can't believe the company never told me about the flaw. Apparently they almost all have it.

Glad I bought the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice con to get peoples money.","review":"I am a certified and licensed alarm tech for 28 years and in the business for 16. While these statements are somewhat true, they are known by quite a few. But what is not known is the proper way of setting up the circuits which was never explained and most installers never do right because everyone else does their installs that way. I won't get all technical or go into detail here but proper placement of eol is the strongest link to any system. If the system is done the proper way you can't defeat the devices easily within the time delay. And further more some manufacturers make their systems to respond to such attacks and warn of such at command centers and the monitoring station. Only the phone line can easliy be defeated if left the way the phone company installs them which has been known for years as one of the weakest link. And you can also back the system up with long range one or two way radios."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Security System Had Holes But No More","review":"I am a Security Manager for a large firm in CA and found this book very valuable.

They left a lot of stuff that was not necessary and deleted some very important scenes. It seems like they added a lot in the beginning, then heavily edited at the end of the Novela.What also angered me is that the last disc is also double sided, but only one has video.

So, Marimar, who lives in a coastal town, falls in love with Sergio, Eduardo Capetillo's character. Sergio marries her (kinda in a whim) but later falls in love with her. Yet, his stepmother hates Marimar and sets her up to go to jail, kills her grandparents and makes her believe Sergio doesn't love her. This sets Marimar in a path for revenge. She becomes a new and improved Marimar and assumes the identity of Bella. And of course everyone believes that she is not Marimar, cause this is a telenovela after all. The story then revolves about how these two characters fight aasint all the odds to be together.The telenovela is not as edited down as other ones. So, you get a pretty good picture of what the full series was like.Overall, this is a pretty good telenovela.

I went to Davis and was a pretty big fan, they got me started on the indie thing. However, the band seemed to gradually fall apart after lead singer Mark left, between \\"Each Sold Separately\\" and this CD. His songs were great, and even though I liked Mindy's songs and vocals, I think she was better used in a supporting role. There's only a few good original songs on this CD, they should have just released an EP.CRH is inconsistent, but \\"CIA Chick\\" and \\"Swetty Betty\\" are two of my favorite ska songs ever! ESS is more consistent and a lot of fun. I'd definitely recommend those albums ahead of this one.While I'm at it, it's a Homer Simpson sample (I'm guessing, having only a pre-release copy), and \\"Pervert\\" is the previously used song.

So far so good. One is all the more dissapointed then when it turns out that the book simply isn't that good. It covers the calculus from the Greeks and stops after Newton (it seems that there was meant to be a second volume). The topics are the usual ones. Certainly one could learn a lot of calculus from this book, and certainly there are many interesting historical remarks, but the unity of the two does not reach the great heights we had hoped. One can achieve pretty much the same effect by simply pasting together a calculus history book with any old calculus textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"A relic in another language","review":"Even when translated into English, this book is nearly incomprehensible to the modern reader.

It also works great for cooking 2-3 ears of corn. It is skinny enough that even a few asparagus pieces will stand in the pot and then of course cook perfectly---allowing the tougher bottoms to get a little more heat. I honestly used it almost as much for sweet corn as I did for asparagus---just add a little water in the bottom and the corn steams done in just a few minutes and tastes wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice narrow pot","review":"The pot is narrow and the asparagus fits nicely.

The three-line readout on the backlit LCD display is so small and so weakly displayed, so as to make it almost impossible to read. This was most annoying when checking out a caller and when trying to recall a memory location and information.

When I pick it up, ALL the beads cascade to the bottom and leave the top half completely bead-free. The pictures don't really show the product you get. It's great as a LIMP beanbag. Nothing more.

That's what I did the first time I used it and my daughter wasn't too happy ;) If used correctly- I would say the best investment I've made!

Granted, this is just our experience, but I will say that I think part of the issue was she couldn't splash in it. As others have said, despite the manufacturers image, this tub doesn't really fill up with water - it pretty much soaks back through to the main tub.

After this I won't be buying any more of Holt's books.The \\"hero\\" was an insensitive, cruel, callous bastard, and as if this is not enough, a pimp. He seduces rich woman to swindle money out of them. Sorry, but after reading so many novels, that feature such wonderful heroes, I can't respect or like this one.The heroine I think I could have liked, in a different book. In this one, all I could feel for her was pity.Cheryl Holt has a very dislikable tendency to create male characters that behave in a completely and utterly dispicable way, but in the end, it is always the woman who comes back to him and seeks a reconciliation.If you like books where the female characters are week and abused, and where women are treated like garbage, read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I've enjoyed other Cheryl Holt novels, but this one was not worth my time or money. The hero is thoroughly unlikeable. The plot was non-existent. Holt wasted too many pages on sex scenes. What was the point of this book? To show that sex with love is always better than without it? We're romance readers. We know that already! Her heroine was exactly like all the women that the hero duped before he meets her, so to accept that he falls for her as opposed to his previous conquests, is unsupportable and unbelieveable. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No substance","review":"I couldn't wait to finish this book - just so I could put it away. The characters had no substance, just physical attraction to each other. Even that seemed forced for the sake of having something to write about. The plot was too contrived, with appearances by outside characters thrown in an effort to move things along.I didn't understand why these characters got together or why I should care about them. I just didn't see the point of Ms Holt writing this book.I have not read anything else by Cheryl Holt, so I don't have other experiences to compare it with. I'm sure there are better books on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown language alert!","review":"If you're at all sensitive to language that is trying WAY WAY too hard to impress, avoid this book at all costs.

An expressive work which requires great passions, Clayderman has often been too loud, breaking the melodious balance between the orchestra and the piano.

However, the remastering is awful. I have compared this cd with an earlier cd issue from the library and this new remastering has removed the power and fullness of the music. Some new detail emerges in this remastering but the price is too high. I have found the same problem with other RCA \\"Living Sterio\\" discs like the Reiner/CSO recording of Also Sprach Zarathustra or the Pines of Rome.

All of the familiar themes are there, but with a lot of bombastic percussive inflictions. There's some tinkering with some of the themes, and where you expect to hear them, but it's all part of the surprise of the recording. This is a fun CD for driving down the highway. There are a lot of bells and whistles, all in the Fiedlerian tradition. If that's what you like, you shant be disappointed. I also recommend the recording of \\"The Rite of Spring\\" (with Seiji Ozawa), and the Mahler CD. Each are part of the High Performance series and are very thrilling.

I put my boxed sets on end, since the labels are on the ends as well.I only wish this company made taller ones. If a shelf isn't at least 70 inches, there is wasted space on the wall not being used.

He was as close to a star-director (think Spielberg today) in the late silent era as there was, after Chaplin. This collection of four of his first sound films are superb- especially The Love Parade (premiered two weeks after Wall St. laid an egg in 1929) and One Hour With You, which he did just before his most acknowledged masterpiece, Trouble in Paradise. Even the mediocre Monte Carlo has its great moments- such as Jeanette MacDonald introducing 'Beyond the Blue Horizon' on her train ride to that same city. And The Smiling Lieutenant is done with those Lubitsch touches to rescue what could be a real downer of a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four Lubitsch films.","review":"\\"Smiling lieutenant\\" is a masterwork (10/10),a film at the same level than \\"Trouble in paradise\\", \\"Heaven can wait\\" or \\"Cluny Brown\\".

But Mr. Riley could go to any city in the United States and find an RC church and worship as he pleased. How many Protestant churches I wonder did he see in Mexico? Did he know that American emigrants to Texas were required by Mexican law to convert? Some of my ancestors were Huguenots.

The love triangle is passionless. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent flick, but not worth buying","review":"I watched this movie on the satellite dish one day when I had nothing else to do. It was a decent enough action yarn, but not worth buying or renting. As said before, the dramatic license taken was excessive, even by Hollywood standards. The love interest was unnecessary, and the history was skewed at times. Although the unit was named The San Patricio Battalion, not quite half the soldier's were Irish. Close to another half were German Catholics and the remainder were a small mix of native born Americans or other immigrant Catholics. This is the first treatment the cinema has given the Mexican War in a long time, if ever, and I was disappointed they did not do better. The plot was stretched thin at times and overly romanticized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time","review":"It is hard to believe that reviewers are complaining about the overuse of cliché in this film. Geez, its Hollywood for goodness sake! There was just as much cliché in the Patriot and for that matter just as much artistic license. All in all, this film is very worthwhile and takes no more liberty with the facts then any good historical novel. And, the facts are that the US was the aggressor in the Mexican American War (Lincoln even brought impeachment charges), that the US executed the San Patricios over world protest, that Irish Catholics where an oppressed group.Granted the film could have benefited by a bit more editing. It was jumpy and the love interest never really blended well. Still it is well worth the purchase price and the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Poor Effort","review":"Poor research and a stingie budget has resulted in a rather average collection. Not much detail on each character, facts are wrong for example Jason's from Friday the 13th true passion is not chainsaws, in fact I don't remember him ever using one and the blurb does not mention his mum watched him drown in Camp Crystal Lake. Another example of poor research is Homer Simpson. He does not say Hmmmm, he says Mmmmmm. Obviously Seth has not watched a lot of TV or rented a movie in his life.The layout of this book is boring. Paying a bit to copyright owners would allow a few more pictures other than the seldom black and white photograph but usual third blank column.

You may also want to go to the book \\"Thank you, Tony Robbins\\" and read the negative review of that otherwise well reviewed book and notice that the author of the bad review is the author of \\"The Life Story of Anthony Robbins\\".The author doesn't strike me as the brightest spark in the fire, but hey - if Robbin's theories can work for morons maybe they will work for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me your money, or credit card","review":"In my opinion this is sadly a missed oppurtunity to educate the public, but not a missed oppurtunity to cash in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPLETE RUBBISH !","review":"I am forced to agree with the negative reviews below.All the 5 star reviews seem to be written by the same person !Except the one below !

The book starts abrubtly with unsubtatiated facts. I think the author lost focused when he was writing the book. It seems he concentrated so much on how much money and glory he will get by writing the book. Do not buy it. Rather buy books by Mr Robbins himself, and you can find them right here cheaper.This book reminds me of William Shakespeare's potent quote; \\"It is a tale told by an idiot... full of hype BUT signifying nothing\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Robbins should disassociate himself from this trash","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I like Tony Robbins' books and tapes and thought this would be a chance to learn more about him. Well, I learned nothing new and wasted my money. Although I expected the book to be positive about Tony Robbins, I was surprised that it was written in such a sycophantic manner. It was also very poorly written and had all the elements of a rush job. Mr Bolduc would benefit from a basic writing course and some research skills. It looked to me that he was wondering how he could profit from his association with Tony Robbins and figured that writing a book was the only way possible. The problem is that he's not any good at it. Do yourself a favour and spend the money on something by Robbins himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece Of Garbage!!!","review":"This was the first book I ever bought from Amazon.com, and the only one I have ever returned. It is a total waste of money. All the author has done is piece together bits of information Tony mentions himself in his own books and tapes. Bolduc couldn't even do that right, as the book is filled with poor spelling, incomprehensible grammar, and annoying chronological back and forth jumps. Although still not doing justice to Tony, the A&E Biography was infinitely better than this worthless piece of trash. And watch out! Bolduc may have watched that show and decide to write a follow-up. Don't let him or any of the 5-star reviews fool you."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"the car-adapter would not work it's the wrong one.I e-mailed the customer service. but unfortunately they sent me another box. still it has the wrong car charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"same problem as everyone else","review":"They must have gotten a deal on the car adapter for the 6000 model and are substituting it in the 7000 kit.

It's tragic that his career was so short. He was executed at the age of 33 for refusing to convert from his faith to the king's religion. He was one of the greatest recusanyt writers, & this book offers work from both his prose output & his poetry. This is a very recommendable book to read for 3 reasons:1 -- the historical period it embodies2 -- his writing echoes through other people's even today, one example being eminent avant-garde poet Michael Palmer3 -- it's interesting & enjoyable just for its own sake"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you guessing and wanting more after each episode","review":"I watched Jericho last year on CBS and loved every episode. After the way it ended I was downright mad when it was originally canceled. Because of the fan base the show was brought back for 7 new episodes set to start up in February. I bought the first season on DVD so my wife could catch up and see why I was go glued to Jericho when it was on CBS. After watching it just a few days we are almost done with the whole thing. After each show she wants to continue.Bottom line if your looking for a show that keeps you guessing and wanting more. A good show that teaches good humanity. A show that you can watch with your wife this is it. Buy a copy and get caught up before the new episodes hit the air in February. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greate Show","review":"Its a great great show. Definitely the best TV show I have ever watched.

Subtitled in english, spanish and portugese.There's deleted scenes on each disc and 2 extras on the last disc. The Making of Jericho and What If which shows some higher ups saying how unprepared we all are if this nightmare scenario or something akin to it actually happened, which after the fiasco of Katrina should get us all thinking.I had never seen this show on tv but took a chance after all the good reviews I had read and am glad I bought it.It's a smartly written show with a good blend of action and relationships unfolding in Kansas during and after a Nuclear event.These 22 episodes are well worth the money imo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly excellent!!","review":"I didn't start watching Jericho, till the season was half over. I was flipping channels and stopped on CBS for a moment and started watching the last 20 minutes of an episode. Just that little bit hooked me. I was intrigued, had to know more. I went to the CBS website and watched the season from the beginning. It took me a couple of nights, but I was compelled to watch them and get all caught up. I was so upset when I finished, it was on a Thursday night and I had to wait for the next week, to see the next episode. I am so looking forward to purchasing this set and to the new season. I am hoping that Jericho will be around for many more seasons. Not only is Jericho entertaining, it makes you think. I am soooo sick of \\"reality\\" based programing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show gets progressively worse","review":"Some good actors, but each episode just got worse and worse as they only revealed miniscule pieces of info about the explosions. No wonder it got cancelled. No one can watch TV for so long and remain insterested or intrigued. Should have revealed the deal with the nukes in 2 or 3 episodes and then get on with the aftermath. I mean, that's what its about, isn't it? Spoiler: then to kill of April and her unborn baby so the cheating husband can mourn and eventually get with the bar owner, home wrecker? Come on! That's when I gave up on it. And it was over halfway through the season, so that gives a show plenty of time to make you like some characters. But to make the cheating husband sympathetic to 2 women? Nope. No more for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farfetched","review":"Ok this show started off suspenseful. But as it gets further and further into the story, it just becomes ridiculous. Is this dude Jesus? He comes back from military school or wherever the hell he was, and suddenly he knows how to do EVERYTHING. In a city crisis like this, I don't think a random guy is just gonna take charge and fix everything. I mean if it was Macguyver, i could understand. I really did like it, but everything that was going on was just too hard for me to believe. This dude can practically walk on water, then u got some black dude in his basement creating some kinda time machine or something, who knows what hes doing. The idea of the show is respectful, but i think its a little too much. If the directors are reading this, just chill man, ur trying to do too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't as impressed...","review":"The concept of Jericho is interesting but contrary to what most people are writing, the charcters are mostly uninspiring and interact with each other somewhat unrealistically.

The series is kinda like 24, but with an all-American cast of villains. Conservatives, Karl Rove, Halliburton and Blackwater - all are caricatured. If you want to see a live action version of the conspiracies detailed in Mother Jones, the Nation and In These Times, this is your mini-series."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was this garbage?","review":"I have no idea what this garbage was, and the real tradgey is that CBS kept it on as long as it did.

Unfortunately, same goes for the five-star ones. Most fans of this show are blind zealots. Non-fans don't buy and don't rate this show--it is truly unremarkable. 2.5 stars, strictly for fascinating concept and wretched ability to sustain \\"interest\\" by stringing viewer along.

At first, I was thinking it was going to be similar to the many other post-nuclear movies (i.e. \\"Damnation Alley\\" with George Peppard). I was quite pleased with the attention to detail as it was related to the science of the main theme as well as the social consequences of that type of attack."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Simply Amazing Show!!!","review":"When I first saw the previews for Jericho I thought how depressing - Nucular Destruction. I decided to watch anyway and was I wrong. This amazing story has everything - suspense, intrigue, love, humor, compassion, drama. The episodes just got better and better I planned my Wednesday nights around this show. When it was canceled I was one of the \\"nuts\\" that helped save it. Now I am planning my Friday night around the reruns. I have never watched reruns before Jericho. Yes, it's that good!!! I have preordered my DVD and I can't wait for Season 2!!

Then I rented the complete first season. I didn't like the first 2 or 3 episodes a lot (they weren't bad but not great) but I stuck with the show. Now I am really happy that I did. I've watched all the way through to the end, and it is a highly entertaining show with a great overarching plot. It may not be the most highly intellectual show, but it was definitely entertaining and worth watching. It is interesting to think about the psychology of what people would do in that situation. I have a very stressful and demanding job that I think about while at work and outside of work, but Jericho made me completely forget about everything else except for the plot. I found myself looking forward to watching an episode every day and really enjoying the plot. For that reason, I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ashame that the series is now gone","review":"When I first starting watching the series I thought \\"Okay, you have my attention, what's the catch?\\" but as I continued to watch I started getting more and more intrigued. I was slowing beginning to be addicted to the show that I started watching it twice!! It brought up some issues that got me to thinking that \\"Hey, the possibility of this actually happening could be true!!!\\" It was a wonderful series and I was so hoping to see a 3rd season. I was truly heart broken to find out that it was dropped. I totally recommend buying this series and if anything it's definitley going to be a great classic or maybe they will bring it back!!!Hopefully!!! I totally would recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This tv series was awesome!!!","review":"Jericho is awesome. Now I would not put this tv series next to LOST, but Jericho is awesome. Just rent DVD #1 and you will be hooked from Day one. Just do it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So annoyed that only the first episode was available to stream!","review":"The show was only okay. I recently watched \\"Threads\\" and sort of expected something similarly gritty. Watching this show was like looking at a J Crew catalog. The characters are pretty flat, but none of the houses were flattened. There was no blast after the mushroom cloud. And the characters were all parading around like they weren't the least bit worried about fall out. The looting and rioting took an unrealistic amount of time to get started. I'm not completely sold on this show. If I could stream the whole season I'd be able to find out if the show fleshes out more realistically, but now I might never know."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I think Jericho has some great actors. Unfortunately the story really isn't as great or as accurate as the writers want you to believe.All these cities have just been destroyed, and yet, more often than not, the people are remaining extremely calm in the small town, and actually having unrealistic conversations about what their future would be like involved in relationships and whatnot.If over 20 cities had been destroyed, setting my sights on my future would be the *last* thing I would be thinking about- just trying to survive should be important enough. There should be more confusion and uncertainty going on in that small town more than anything else. Not these emotional scenes that in real life would never happen.There's some nice twists from some of the main characters, but it is pretty hard keeping up with everything, and understanding what's going on can be a difficult enough task. Still, it's not a bad show, but it's not the best, and it's kind of overrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"a favorite","review":"We love watching these old movies and TV shows.

I highly recommend this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jericho fans will love it but season 2 will let you down","review":"Ok, this is a great series but season two jerks the rug out from under you. If only CSB would have completed the series for DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"With all the garbage teen drama and \\"reality\\" tv that networks shove in our face, it is more than refreshing to finally be able to sit down and watch a show and not feel as though my brain is being turned to mush. Jericho shows you how quickly your world can come tumbling down, and how the ridiculous things we consider important now become so trivial in the wake of disaster.It shows us that the world can change in an instant and that you have to learn to cope. But most of all it is simply darn good television."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...Jericho on DVD","review":"I am so glad that they are giving this show another chance. I have been waiting for the DVD format, so I could share it with friends and family. I tried to get them to watch towards the end of the season, but they couldn't get into it without the background. I understand, because the character development has so much to do with the greatness of the show. It would be difficult to come into it late, and get the full effect. I am disappointed that the DVD is so expensive. I won't be able to purchase it until it comes down in price,or I can buy it used at a more reasonable price. Hopefully, it will be available at the video stores. I think rental is the only way that newbies will be willing to give it a chance.Love this show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuclear holocaust in America","review":"Follow the lives of the survivors of a widespread nuclear attack after their mid-western U.S. town of Jericho is spared.

However every time I call i get a voicemail (no returned call) and both of there contact email addresses info@titanheater.com and support@titanheater.com both bounce back saying the mailbox is full.

The company is impossible to deal with unless you are from Mexico or Spain. It blew out 2 elements and you have to buy them from the company not at any home improvement store. Finally one day we were filling our tub and the water was literally boiling, heard a lot of noise in the utility room then....explosion. It blew out the hot water line going to the tub under the house, flooded and had to have the line replaced. Do not buy these pieces of total crap.

Why the there are then certified installers when you buy the unit? We tried to call the original installer/distributor company, AVB to take care of the process, not for free(!) and I have never seen such a rude and obnoxious business.

Why this 'special installation item' was not mentioned WITH the unit, or included with, or even OFFERED or SUGGESTED, is academic. They didn't know.Contacting the company is a pain, they seem like a fly-by-night outfit. Oh, and they want you to send $75.00 to have it serviced now.

The only thing that I don't like is that I noticed the newer pieces from the last six months or so is made overseas. I don't recall that they were before. The heavy bottom is great for even cooking.

While most of the features would normally be useful they are very difficult to use.Programming the machine with multiple greetings using the greeting file was a difficult task thanks to the poorly worded and often confusing instructions. Switching from one greeting to another is even much more difficult. Switching the greetings evolves several steps and its actually easier to just record a new one each time the greeting needs to be changed. Furthermore, the greetings sound quality is very poor.One could find many of the same features as in this machine without the useless greetings file for much less.

The battery cover is removable with a Phillips screwdriver and the three button batteries are readily available from Target. After replacing the noisemaker it was easy to stitch things back up (and I don't even sew!) and there you have it, a working toy again.

This, despite the lengthy (but apparently pro-forma) description about All-Clad's craftsmanship being suitable for inductions.

It is made in China, feels like it is made in China. The stainless steel discolored the first time I used it getting that bluish tinge of cheap Chinese stainless steel. The inserts are a joke, they are thin stainless, and the steamer insert even worse. I would rather have a better built no-name one. I have about 10 All Clad pots now which I love.

I put this pot on my biggest burner (electric cooktop), on the highest setting, and 30 minutes later the pot is still cool enough to touch!! In many cases, a thick, heavy pot is ideal - it takes longer to heat up but it holds the heat better. But for a pot whose main purpose is to boil water?

The book as a whole is pretty marginal, it just seems like the guy put in every sci-fi and fantasy creature he had ever heard of and tried to blend them into one world.

There were 2 sequels, Time's Dark Laughter, and Timefall.

I looked at some of the systems that already had the folding base in place but they are not as compact as this system is when it is folded up and the monopod leg retracted.

It was interesting enough that I read the whole series but I honestly regret that decision.The plot was shallow. The characters were shallow and repetitive. Most had no personality or, worse, identical personalities and mannerisms. Many scenes were repeated two or more times from different character's perspectives with only subtle differences. This could have been interesting but it played out as ridiculously boring filler instead.*spoiler alert*The series ends with something similar to the classic \\"and then I woke up and it was all just a dream\\".

The next series was okay. The characters did not change but the story was good. This series sucks on many levels. The witty banter is present but the characters are one dimensional and almost all the same. There is no plot to speak of. They all gather, set up a fort and a natural disaster (1 of four can you guess??earth, air, water, and fire) saves the day. They spend most of the time discussing how the bug people evolve over and over and over again. Okay I get it already!!! There was no intrigue, no trying to figure things out, no quests, no fear that they might lose or that any of the characters were in danger. In short these books had nothing interesting. I had to force my way through the first three books and I have no intention of reading the fourth as I'm pretty sure of what is going to happen and I can probably fill in the dialogue too.

I felt like I was reading dialogue of little children repeating conversations overheard from their parents (the parents in this case being Silk, and Barak, Polgara, etc.) I love the Eddings, and of course I'll buy the second, third, and fourth, despite this book, but I won't rush to put them at the top of my reading pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"At last - a bad book by the Eddings'","review":"I am a David (& Leigh) Eddings fan, having read just about all their work for about 20 years. But (relatively speaking) I found The Elder Gods......dull. The characters lack depth, and I had no emotional attachment to them. The fairly predictable storyline spends 80% preparing for battle - far too long. As usual the good guys fatality rate is far too low.Sadly, after so many books, the typical Eddings writing style is starting to become predictable and annoying. Instead of writing about a collection of people (mostly adults) with exceptional ability, I wish the Eddings' would include more vunerable, naive characters (e.g. a young Garion) - they can be so much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to Agree ------ Major Letdown","review":"I have been an Eddings fan since i read the Belgariad.

They are among my most favorite books and I can get lost in them over and over.That being said, however, The Elder Gods; the first in a projected four book series is so lame and tiresome that I've had to put it away for good. I've tried several times to find something in it that sparks an interest in continuing, but it's just not there. I can not grasp the plot, nor can I find a character to even care about.

It was repetitive (as above) to the point I skipped over whole conversations. The story contained only single dimensional characters for which I did not develope any type of feelings...like 'em?, hate 'em?....nope, just not interested enough to care.

I grew up on this stuff and that is why the \\"trend-of-similarities\\" that actually developed with the two Sparhawk series infuriates me. Every reader has biased expectations, that is to be expected - the Belgariad and even the Mallorean were very good. But its obviously not just me, everone seems to realize that all of these characters have been created on some quickie assembly line.I just want to ask the Eddings' a few questions: Why do your characters all act and sound the same in every book? Why is there always that same magic jewel? Why do all your characters have the same annoying speeches and retorts going back to the original series? Why Gods in every book? You should start writing only for Harry Potter fans - if they can stand something so patronizing and childish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give this one a chance","review":"This is more an arguemnt for giving the book a try than it is a review.After reading all the negative reviews I was reluctant to buy this book, but did anyway because David Eddings is one of my favorite authors.I find the negative reviews short-sighted and look at the \\"Elder Gods\\" as a stepping stone to something great!

Definitely and without hesitation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor story, poory told","review":"I was a great fan of Eddings and the Belgariad series, and was excited to pick this up a few weeks ago. Usually, I can get through an science fantasy book in a day or two, but, after almost a month, this is still a struggle. By far the worst aspect of the book is the manner in which it is written. At first I thought that maybe it was because, as I grew older, my reading style had changed and become more \\"grown-up\\", but no, after re-scanning the Belgariad I discovered the incredible difference between the styles. Belgariad is well-written, whereas the Elder Gods reads like a book for the challenged: much repetition, as if we've forgotten descriptions given in the previous chapters, language so simple that it's difficult not to shudder. The book is almost condescending. Maybe it's time for David to ditch Leigh and write solo again?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Dreck!","review":"Like others here, I had to simply give up. I made the mistake of thinking that since there was more than one book in the series already published, there must be some good material in there.WRONG!Inane phrases and expressions (e.g., when a character says something \\"...with no trace of a smile...\\") are repeated incessantly. And a character who \\"never learned how to miss\\" with his bow? Puh-leeeeze! Plus, the romantic ambiguity between characters led me to wonder how this world ever became populated in the first place, as no one ever seems to get past the kissing stage --- and most of that occurs between adults and pre-adolescent Younger Gods.In summary, the three words that best describe it are as follows, and I quote:\\"Stink. Stank. Stunk.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a sad disappointment for a big fan","review":"What a sad day, I never thought I would give anything by David Eddings such a low rating.

For example, Longbow is strongly reminisent of Hettar, Rabbit of Silk, Eleria of Flute, etc etc etc.Coupled with this lack of characterization, is an overall lack of oomf. The story just does not motivate one to keep reading - i only stuck with it becuase I kept hoping that the plot would shift up a gear. it didnt.This book offers nothing that earlier Eddings doesnt provide in abundance, and furthermore, it just isnt an entertaining read. The style is strained and unnatural, and seems forced.Save yourself some time and money: avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, worn-out concept","review":"It is regrettable that David and Leigh Eddings, authors of the remarkable \\"Belgariad\\" and \\"Mallorean\\" series, have chosen to ride the diminishing wave of this creative concept for so long. What was brilliant, witty and vastly entertaining for the first 10 books was still usable for the 2-part, 6 book series that began with \\"The Diamond Throne.\\" It was passable for the stand-alone \\"The Redemption of Althalus.\\" By the time we reach a *fourth* series using the same, barely disguised characters, concepts, and plot line, it is obvious to a dissapointed reader that the authors are just phoning in their performance. This type of copy-cat writing does more to anger long-time fans than it does to spark new enthusiasm for the authors' offerings.If you enjoyed any of the previous Eddings' works, do yourself a favor: go re-read the books you already own and save yourself the waste of twenty-odd dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Think it could get worse after Athalas Book","review":"David Eddings has sunk even further. I really enjoyed reading the belgariad and Mallorean as well as the two Sparhawk series. I have been waiting for him to release another good series. This one is not it. The characters are bland, the story line is restated over and over. There are even chapters that have actually no point and should not have been included. You know nothing of the bad guy, the heros sail to an unknown land for \\"promised\\" gold to fight a war. How convient that a couple of 100,000 people will just go fight a war for an unkown people in an unknown land for \\"promised\\" money.

The characters of past books may have had similarities to characters in even earlier works, but at least they were still distinct from their predecesors. At least they were still characters a reader could get involved with.The characters in this book are flat and lifeless. There's another little girl goddess type who likes hugs and kisses, and another stern yet warm motherly character who calls everyone \\"dear\\" and another set of coarse and brash warriors with hearts of gold. Unfortunately, none of them is interesting.I was very excited when I saw this book for the first time.

The most annoying thing about this book (and their last several) is that they are slowly grinding their earlier works of genius into insignificance.

Please.POSTSCRIPT: Rest in peace, David.

It actually makes me want to cry that he would put out something that seems so sloppily constructed. I have always had a great respect for his characters but the ones featured in this book are, as everyone before me has pointed out, copies of his other characters. I did finish this book but it was with no sense of joy or desire for the next series to come out. I would almost rather Eddings ressurect my beloved Sparhawk than put out a book like this. My hope is that word of our discontent will reach Eddings' ears and he will be beholden to create a better work than has recently reached us. I beg of you, my favorite writer!!

Alas, past performance does not guarantee future success.The intial focal point of 'evil' in this series is called the Vlagh. Sadly, the Vlagh never sparked any emotions in me. Neither did the good guys. The battles, if you want to call them that were ho hum. The storyline provides not tension what-so-ever.

I would have expected something much better from David Eddings, but I think he hit his peak with the Belgariad. Ever since he's been sliding down hill.The dialog is quaint and contrived at times, and while the idea of the Dreamers is really good, he could been much better at engaging the readers. I really didn't have much suspense for the entire book, and about the only time I was really interested in what was happening was at the end of the book...I wanted to know if it would be over yet.I really expected better from David Eddings, and probably won't be reading much more of his stuff in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Latest eddings book","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviewer.

His earlier works were great, but eddings keeps playing the same theme over and over, using the same characters from previous books, but different names.If you must read it because it is Eddings, borrow it from the library, or friend. You won't want to pay money for this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"Very good book! I usually read very rarely, because of my work, but when I read, I need a cool book and this is one. It is just like a faerie tale, told by your close friend...Brilliant!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small story repeated over and over and over and over","review":"This is the first book i have read by this author and it frustrated me enough to write this. (Deep breath) The characters are too simple and are poorly developed. They all think, talk and act same regardless of whether they are a pirate or a god. Events that happen in this book are retold by the characters over and over. It is enough to say \\"Rabbit told Red-Beard about the harrowing night time fight aboard the ship.\\" We don't need a play-by-play description of what we just read 3 pages ago. What is worse is that these events were not all that impressive to begin with. Nearly everything turns out as the character expects and when it doesn't turn out just as the character expects, it is all solved rather easily anyways. I realise that i myself couldn't have done any better and that i'm just ranting but how could someone who has sooo many books write sooooo poorly.Chris"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Edding's best","review":"Most people ... complained that the book is unlike previous book by David Eddings (i.e the belgariad series). I found this book to be a very good read, and that the differences from past series actually made it more interesting. But there are definately parts where the story did lag. The characters are all great as usual for Eddings, but the story all centers around one battle, that maybe lasts 10 percent of the book, while the rest is preparing for it. The battle scenes dont have much detail and seem sloppily put together. But I am hoping book two will b better as 4 part stories usually get more entertaining. Id suggest the Belgariad and Mallorean series to readers first getting into Eddings, but anyone who has read those books already and like them should pick up this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defintely a flop for Eddings!","review":"Defintely a flop for Eddings! His previous series' promised a great future! I am just confused as to why he ran with this book, it is very second rate, with such incredible success from Belgarion and Sparhawk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a huge fan of the Belgeriad (and a lesser fan of the Mallorean--too much of a rip off of the first series), it pains me to write this review. But it certainly seems like the author was tired of writing this stuff or had become cynical and knew that his fans would read anything he wrote.The entire Dreamers series seems quickly written, sparse, minimally editted and without much purpose for its existance. The dialog is stilted to the point of humor. Maybe the author was attempting an affectation that I somehow missed. But the 'gods', who are the main charcters are incredibly pretentious and dull.Why two stars, you might ask? I gave the second star out of respect for his prior works. I felt that if I did less, Belgarath and Polgara may be watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Elder Gods","review":"This book was so bad that I actually gave up 35 pages from the end because I simply couldn't care any less. As I read I kept waiting for something to happen, anything, I wasn't even picky! But even when it seems like something is in fact happening, still nothing even remotely compelling occurs! This book was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your typical Eddings","review":"I have been a huge fan of David Eddings for over 25 years. I have read all of his other books so many times I have lost track. They are books that I can read over and over.I am only about half way through this book and I am growing really disappointed. Something is off and I am having my doubts that David was all that involved with writing this book. What is really frustrating is it seems to me like there is a lot of similarities pulled from his other books. It seems to me Eleria is a lot like Aphrael from The Elenium and The Tamuli.I will finish this book and after I am done I may decide to give it a better rating but so far it not near the quality of previous books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writen only by David Eddings","review":"This series was actually only written by David Eddings, though Leigh Eddings name is listed. David started it after Leigh had taken ill, and she had very little input in the writing of this series at all.David himself was not a very good author, his wife having helped write all the other novels. She was the one whom created the main characters for The Belgariad series, plus all the following series. She was the real creative mind behind the stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book, get the Belgariad instead.","review":"If you haven't read David Eddings, read the BelgariadThe Belgariad, Vol. 1 (Books 1-3)andThe Belgariad, Vol. 2 (Books 4 & 5). They are excellent. If you read those and liked them, please please don't start this series. It looks like someone else took a fairly interesting 1-page outline and padded it to 400 pages. It's not the worst book I ever read: That would be volume 2 of this same series, which is worse. Whole paragraphs are cut and pasted. I recycled these books rather than put them on the bookshelf at work for somebody else to read. Supposedly volumes 3 and 4 are worse still, but I'm not planning to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Eddings' Best Work","review":"I was very disappointed with this series. It's not the typical David Eddings fare I am used to. Maybe I was expecting something along the lines of the Belgariad series.

I can hardly wait for the next one, thank you, Eddings team!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be better if he hadn't written this 12 times already","review":"There is quite a bit to like about this book...if you haven't read his other books first. Longbow, Red-Beard, and Rabbit are all excellent characters. The way the Gods transport themselves over long distances is kinda cool, andAll of his female characters...Belgariad, Mallorean, Elenium, Tamuli, and now the Dreamers are the exact same. His theme about all things being cyclical is wearing thin. He also seems to be losing his knack for writing good dialogue. Almost all of his characters talk in the same folksy way. I don't know anything about why he's with Aspect instead of Del Rey now, but I'd say this book isn't up to Del Rey standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last book is a nightmare","review":"Don't buy it, except perhaps to send back to the publishers for a refund like I did after reading it. I was never so dissapointed in my life, the ending of the book and the series was a slap in the face to all loyal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddings should write something new","review":"As the Elder Gods are portrayed in this book, Eddings too is suffering from senility. Lord this is by far the most boring, predictible and rehashed of his books. IF you are a long time Eddings fan and over the age of 18, SKip this series. He offers nothing new, and is just a rehashing of his older masterpieces. This series isnt even worthy of 4 books... the whole series could have and should have been written down to 2 or 3. The characters are all the same, and the same old 'witty sardonic' humor Eddings is famous for is over used here. EVERYCHARACTER thinks they are funny and GOD the dialogue is just repeated over and over and over. These books are such fluff and a waste of a read. Read the Belgariad, the Mallorian, the Sparhawk books, but skip this series"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Look, Colored Rocks","review":"After 17+ books, he's still doing the exact same thing and much worse than usual. I love the Eddings' writings. I put up with four series of blue and red rocks in two different worlds because they were excellent in writing even if the plot and characters resembled each other. But don't go for this series, just don't. Pick any of his other ones and you'll love them. But not this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, entirely","review":"I have been a huge David Eddings fan from the Elenium, Belgariad, Malloreon, The Redemption of Althalus and was looking forward to a new series from him. So it was with excitement that I picked up this book.I couldn't even finish it, I felt like I was reading written by a 13 year old from the pink dolphins to the pet lightning, ugh! I was bored almost to the point of dying from it. I was heartbroken too, David Eddings was a beacon of light in the fantasy genre, I loved Sparhawk from the opening paragraph of Diamond Throne through to the end, and Silk and all of the rest from those storylines, and Althalus. But this, this is too much and he will be needing to redeem himself if I am to be a reader again. I was sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really...just not good","review":"Like many, I have enjoyed Eddings series in the past. I have read and re-read all of his books. So I figured I would pick this one up and it should entertaining at the very least. How wrong I was. Simply put, this book was so poorly written that I struggled to finish it. And no, I won't be continuing the series. The characters were poorly fashioned and nothing seems to go wrong for the \\"good guys.\\" They hardly describe who the enemy is, just telling the reader that they are evil and insect like. One of the things that was my biggest pet peeve was that the characters kept repeating the same story over and over. It's like they ran out of things to write about! This book was one of the worst fantasy books I have ever read and I hope to God this isn't what is in store for all the Eddings lovers out there in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"I am a huge fan of fantasy literature and am always looking for new, fresh authors. I had seen that David Eddings was a popular fantasy author and, while I hadn't gotten around to reading him yet, was excited to have a new vein of writing to try.When I read this book I was sorely disappointed to not have found another much-loved author. This book was one of the most mundane pieces of writing I have ever been subjected to. The characters are one-dimensional & unlikeable, the dialogue unbelievable, the storyline nonsensical, the actions rash & confusing, and the overall writing style was more suitable for (or written by) a child.Reading the other reviews on here, it looks like some of Eddings' most avid fans also found this book to a giant disappointment, so I still have an inkling of hope for some of his earlier series...but I will definitely be testing the waters by borrowing from the library, not purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mood Music CD!","review":"Gary Taylor should be played more often on radio with such a smooth sound such as this.

The acting and writing is splendid, and I love the presentation of Allison Dubois life in a very non-sensational yet totally riveting manner.For me, watching Medium on TV is not enough, because so many of the shows are meaningful.

It had been fully charged and the directions were followed to the letter. It was embarassing and very disappointing, it never has worked properly.

If you're looking for an easily-portable unit that's battery-powered, rugged and puts out good vocal audio, this is probably for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for small venues","review":"I bought this for use as a magician for magic shows and as a pastor for church functions where I need to speak to a small crowd and don't want to strain my voice. This works very well for crowds up to about 100. This has a hole in the bottom that can screw onto a standard sized microphone stand, which I use to elevate this. I also usually use a microphone stand to hold the attached mic, because the 3 foot cord is pretty short and it helps to keep things stationary. This can be used simply by holding the fender passport in one hand and holding the mic in the other, but I usually like to have my hands free so when I can I use the mic stands with it. The unit is lightweight and very portable, and has served me very well in smaller venues. Please note that the picture shown here is for the P10W, which has a wireless mic. The P10 has a corded mic, which I have noted above."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable speaker for use outdoors","review":"I purchased the Fender P-10 for speaking to intermediate audiences (50-70 people) out on the farm for farm tours.

The late-60s styles were comical, and the young days of \\"Christine\\" from \\"Coach\\" and Bill Bixby from \\"The Hulk\\" were amusing. However, the obvious closed sets, corny acting and oddball music interludes kept me asking why was this movie even produced.The final insult to injury... Elvis and his girl drive into the Florida sunset... with mountains in the background!?? The only mountains in Miami are trash dumps so this was obviously shot in California and poorly passed off as Miami Beach.So I give it 2 stars: one for Elvis and one for the real Florida."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clambake","review":"Clambake was a great movie.

Paid the $10 and still waiting for the replacement.I had previously owned a ScrewPull and it worked great for about 8 years.

It removed a cork with far less effort.In summary, we offer a rating of 5 stars for our Amazon.com buying experience and a rating of 1 star for the Metrokane Rabbit corkpuller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous product","review":"I bought this corkscrew for my mom after I read some reviews of how revolutionary it was. She opened it and loved it right off the bat. Then, after less than a month, it stopped working. What happens is the little cap that covers the top of metal screw itself pops off as soon as you push down on the handle so the corkscrew just pops out of the top instead of going into the cork. It happens with all types of corks and with any pressure. So this ridiculous $50 corkscrew (at the time i bought it) is completely useless! (unless you want to pay an additional $10 for a replacement. Thanks but no thanks!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"matte black coating turns sticky after about 4 years","review":"The device works well mechanically. You should know that there is a coating on it that gives it a nice matte black finish & rubbery texture that feels good to hold for about 3 years. Then at about four to five years of age it turns sticky and will leave a black gunk on your hands; not cool.I think a $50 corkscrew should last longer than four years; so I spent about an hour with adhesive remover & alcohol and was able to remove the coating. The hard plastic that is under the coating is now blotchy, but at least my hands stay clean. It still works well mechanically, but it is no longer the pretty party tool. Buy a Screwpull or an all-metal corkscrew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!","review":"Yes, when new this works like a dream...then, slowly, it gets harder and harder until it literally takes two people to get the cork out!

So you go to their web-site to find out what's wrong and it's not there so you e-mail their customer service dept. and ask them what to do. They don't answer your e-mail so a week or so later you e-mail them again and AGAIN they don't answer you, SO WHAT YOU DO NEXT IS WRITE THIS REVIEW!!!

(At least the second new one did -- the first one we bought didn't work at all, and the company replaced it.) But the mechanism that actually pulls the cork is made of plastic, and when you open as many bottles a week as we do, it didn't take long for them to wear out. It's now useless, and is going into the trash. For the price, it should be sturdier. I've gone back to using the $2 corkscrew I bought at the supermarket years ago and still works just fine, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rabbit Cork Pusher","review":"I received the Rabbit corkscrew as a present. I have opened about 30 bottles of wine with it. When the cork is dry, it pushes the cork into the bottle more often than it pulls it out. This is disappointing, at best. It is now in a drawer.I emailed Metrokane several weeks ago and received no response. I called recently have not received a response. Had I purchased this item; I would have returned it. I suspect that it needs a new worm, and needed it since it was new.I can not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"wine fan","review":"This is a product that disappoints. You get what you pay for in this corckscrew. It may be cheaper than others but is incredibly tough to remove the cork from the corkscrew after it is taken out of the bottle- you just exchange one problem for another. I have one of the original corkscrews from another company and will buy that brand over this product.Anyone want a used rabbit corkscrew?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as a Screwpull","review":"I have used a screwpull on several occassions and always found it a pleasure. I bought a Rabbit because it was cheaper and got good reviews. The rabbit has several drawbacks. First, the handle is not long enough and I have many times pinched my fingers between the handle and bottle when I swing the handle back to pull the cork. Second, the Rabbit does not work well on plastic corks. It's hard to get into the cork, but it can be impossible to get the cork off the screw. This sometimes happens with conventional corks as well. (In fairness I've never used a screwpull on a plastic cork.) Finally, I just don't think it's as easy to use as a screwpull. Consumer Reports rated this below the Screwpull and some other cork-pullers and this is one time I agree with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is no dumb bunny!","review":"Love this corkscrew!

Metrokane cashed my check within a day or two, but 2 1/2 months later I have still not received the part. Numerous calls and emails to customer service, the COO and the president have all been ignored, and my corkscrew is still completely useless.

I have had this corkscrew since last December (I gave it to my boyfriend as a gift), and it has never had any problems. I will admit that the screw became dull after almost a year of use, but that is why another screw is included in the set. I also found that you can buy the attachment for $5 at most stores if you bring in your rabbit.For the $50 that you pay for it, it is a great investment. The only reason I can see other people saying it gets more difficult as time goes by is becasue they are opening 10 bottles of wine a day! (OK...exaggerating a bit!) But if you are an avid wine drinker of 2 to 3 bottles a week, this is absoltely PERFECT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacable \\"worm\\"","review":"I E-mailed Metrokane prior to buying this corkscrew out of concern about the above review which wondered if the worm was replaceable or not.

Needless to say, I bought this corkscrew and it works great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Engineered and it shows in the long run","review":"My Rabbit worked well on the first couple dozen bottles of wine. My only complaint was (just as the manual said it might) that it was rarely able to grip the cork for easy removal from the drill. Apparently, bottles of wine under [money]uses slightly less fat corks so the Rabbit can't grip it. The design makes it very difficult to remove the pulled cork from the drill by hand. Very frustrating.Lately, the Rabbit works when it wants to. When it doesn't, it instead pushes the cork into the bottle.I've since gone back to my good old standy manual puller. It doesn't look as neat, but at least it works everytime."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Product","review":"I know what some of you are thinking...\\"man, that's a lot of money for a freakin' corkscrew\\". Indeed, it is an expensive corkscrew, but it is worth the money. From out of the box this thing worked flawlessly for me. It is very simple to use and does not require very much strength. It is a four step motion that seamlessly inserts the screw, extracts the cork, and deposit's the unmamed cork in your hand. I don't know about you, but the wine-steward's cork screw I had before is a piece of junk compared to this thing. The foilcutter also works well and is a neat addition. I bought mine with the included vin vac, and it is also very handy as we usually don't finish a bottle of wine at one sitting. Bottom line...at these prices if you enjoy wine (even just a couple times a month) pick up this item. I would be suprised if you were dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the hare, but the tortoise","review":"This ridiculous item is difficult to use and counterintuitive.

I've contacted them 5 times by phone, the last call to the company president and never a call back. Even my email questions go unanswered. My Rabbit has \\"biodegraded\\", the rubber coating has disolved which makes the handles sticky and the product unusable.

You begin operating it in reverse but it does not release the cork, it only seems to bend and distort the screw.Perhaps Metrokane should have replaced the mechanism when first sent in for repair. I had some doubts at that time that the two ends of the tool were still properly aligned; but Metrokane chose to send it back to me with 2 new screws, both of which now are ruined.I don't think I did anything to abuse or misuse it.I think Metrokane should rework the design of the mechanism or actually repair it when returned by customers.I no longer recommend it.

No twisted or broken corks; in fact, the only word of caution I would share with you is NOT to use the Rabbit to punch through wax seals on corks. The wax seal (often found on less expensive American chardonnays) will \\"gum up\\" the corkscrew, slow down the removal process, and shorten the life of your Rabbit's corkscrew (which is replaceable). Keep a regular corkscrew handy for those bottles.

It worked well for a while and then one day, poof! three bottles in a row, (figured operator error at first) during a party, get the cork stuffed in! After some examination, a plastic fitting on the beast had cracked. I used it maybe 30 times and since it was now off warranty timewise I chucked it.Months later I purchased the new and improved metal model. Well here it is maybe 2 years and only about as many uses as before and the thing pushes the cork into a lovely bottle of Shiraz. I don't even attempt to use it thing usually, thus the low mileage, because it makes me nervous. I much prefer my old trusty wing model or even my waiters screw.

This one is far and away the best. It moves old corks better than my waiter's corkscrew because it tears up the cork less as it passes through and goes nearly to the bottom.I haven't encountered the problems cited in other reviews with getting the pulled cork off the contraption. I simply followed the manufacturer's instructions. With the screw fully extended (handle fully forward into the \\"insert\\" position), clamp the two clamping handles shut so that the cork is completely below them, and then work the action as if extracting a cork.

I have never struggled this much to read a book! I also hate the female character, I mean come-on she is selfish and stubborn! She is better off dead! The neighbor in the leotard sounds more interesting:) Sorry, this will have to go on my top ten books of worst book every read!BORINNNNGGGG!

This heroine, Taylor was unbelievably selfish, argumentive, with no sense. She places people in danger because she thinks \\"she's right\\" and \\"what could possibly be wrong?\\". People were trying to \\"protect her\\" and all she could think of was herself. I liked Jack, no only was he a hunky SEAL- but had patience of a saint to put up with her.The plot was good, but had inconsistencies as described in other reviews. I would have rated this book 5 stars if it had a sharper heroine, more insight in \\"Jack's mind\\" and a smoother and snappy writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was pretty good","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Makes me wish I needed my own US born, All American hero 24/7. Namely a US Navy SEAl. Taylor is terrific. Full of hangups and not afraid to admit them. I loved Uncle Vinnie. Taylor and Jack seemed unafraid to admit the attraction between them, but unwilling to do anything about it. Thankfully, they overcame that major flaw!!! If you haven't read any of her other SEAl stories, find the first one. And by the way, I hope I can say, Look out Izzy, there's bound to be a story coming for you.

Too many threads of the story line are introduced, but never followed up, such as Jack's culinary skills, which could have been used to humanize him, or the fact that Taylor finds out she is adopted. My biggest complaint is that there is very little about Taylor that is likeable. Her selfish, irresponsible behavior gets others killed and she doesn't seem to ever learn anything from it. I guess this is suppose to show how head-strong and loyal her character is, but I almost couldn't finish the book because of it. We never get inside Jack's head at all, so there isn't much appealing about him either, except that he is physically a hunk.I enjoyed Skye's Draycott Abbey series, so it is too bad this series has been such a disappointment (2000 Kisses was terrible also)."},{"rating":"2","title":"English Music","review":"A superb collection of the kin dof impressionist music that feeds my soul.I heard The Cumbrian Rhapsody for the first time, as a teenager, and was entranced by \\"Tarn Haws.\\" It has a special place in my collection.I \\"saw\\" the place as the composer had and when, many years later, I visited Tarn Haws for the first time, it was exactly as I'd imagined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sumamente Aburrido","review":"Los premios Julio CortazarHe estado leyendo o tratando de leer este libro de manera infructuosa por casi 20 días y me he dormido en 5 ocasiones, me he atorado en otras tantas y al final de la pagina 216 en el primer día de navegación del barco he decidido lanzarme por la borda y dejar la tripulación aburrida a su suerte para.

If you place them with the bullets up, the tip of the bullets are too smooth to be gripped easily. The only way to get the rounds out is to flip the entire content on the table and sort out the mess.Also, the case doesn't hold the bullets securely when placed base up.Manufactured ammo comes in plastic trays that are a bit bigger, and the bottom of each slot is a bit narrow. This way the rounds are held securely in place with the base up. There is enough room to grip the base of the round with your fingers to take them out.

It covers all the basics of which hull designs are the most stable and best fishing platforms, the pros and cons of fiberglass vs. aluminum, etc. It is a very good starting point if you are a boating novice, or in my case, have been away from boats for a period of time.If you have been knocking around in fishing boats your whole life, you may not get a lot out of this book, however, if you are the shore fisherman who is ready to make a first leap into owning a fishing boat... get this and read it cover to cover...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice solution when you want to listen to Music on your computer with headphones.","review":"This is a nice solution when you want to listen to Music on your computer with headphones.

It's a great workout, but I don't see a really long life for this toy. My complaint is more about the product's construction. The foam around the bungee cord started to tear within a few days, and she is 35 lbs, WELL under the 250-lb. weight limit. The company did send a replacement promptly after my complaint so we'll see how that holds up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not live up to the hype","review":"From the description, one would think this is a bouncy jumper.

I tried jumping on it, but the foam base seemed to absorb my weight rather than rebound it. So I looked it up online, and was surprised to easily find it listed for kids as an alternative to a pogo stick! What a surprise!

The difference in video quality between these cables and the composite A/V cables that came with the PS2 was amazing- at first.The cables work just fine for video games, but every time I tried to play a DVD through the PS2, the signal blanked out after about three minutes of viewing, and the only way to get video back was to reset the PS2.A 45 minute phone call with Sony tech support traced the problem to these cables, which did not meet Sony's testing standards. Additionally, the Sony rep I spoke with informed me that if my PS2 hadn't already passed its warranty period long ago, using these cables would have voided my warranty.Do not buy these cables.

I didn't really like Vere that much. He was so overdone that I really couldn't warm up to him at all. I know he suffered a lot of personal tradgey but he needed to get over it already.In the beginning the verbal foreplay between Lydia and Vere was great. When the finally did have sex, the scenes were disappointing. They didn't have any of the passion that I expected and they were pretty boring.At about page 252 this book seemed never ending.

Not only was the relationship between the two characters very moving, the passion was hot and the story an adventure. Ms. Chase has developed well rounded characters filled with grief and joy as well as lust. I loved Ainswood, as he is only unlikelable to himself and his Lydia is a powerful, yet naive heroine. Very rich in detail.The back drop of Regency England was also well described and we can easily get a whiff of the Thames as well as a feel for the 'ton'. However, this novel isn't set in the backdrop of evening balls and teas as much as it is smack in the 'real' side of Regency England: gaming hells, brothels, prisons, markets and a slice of how society lives in that period.

It is hard not to compare this book to Lord of Scoundrels, especially when it contains references to that book and its characters - Dain, Jess and Bertram.

The manufacturer's skimped on the pants material (I've not figured out what the exact material *is*...it isn't cloth) to the point where if a child bends the doll (as in a bow to his princess), he moons the world.

I'm not saying shouldn't get higher quality cables like S-Video or Component they're great, in fact I would recommend if you have both the S-Video and the Red, Blue, Green holes on your TV to go straight to the Component (The Red, Blue, Green) cause it makes the scanlines less noticable making the image even clearer even if it's not a HDTV plus if you do get one you'll have the right cables to get the best quality.

(jurors)There will be a new trial in a nuetral venue and Scott will be exonerated.This books just lays bare how a lazy, prejudiced, mean spirited and deeply flawed bunch of people subverted justice. They had no concept of \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" or \\"beyond a reasonable doubt\\" They convicted on absolutely zero forensic evidence. I honestly believe some of the jury thought they were on a soap opera or one of the Nancy Graceless type shows and that a real mans life was not at stake. Our system is broken.

The acting and special effects were great and I think it was cast just right. However, instead of letting us get to know the characters or expanding on the plot they wasted valuable minuets on crude humor and ridiculous scenarios. I'm not sure what the difference between the unrated and the rated versions are but Netflix sent us the unrated. I hope some of the scenes were taken out for the PG13 version otherwise it is to inappropriate for kids under 17. It could have been a great movie with a little more effort put into the plot.

Though not Will Smith's best performance, it returned us to his sarcastic and dry humored character.

It's not perfect, sure, but I loved it. There are some suprising expletives in the first couple of scenes, and a few plots holes if you pick it apart, but COME ON it's a super-hero movie! I had heard mixed reviews about it before I watched it, so I didn't go in expecting it to be amazing, and maybe that's the key. It's not the movie you would expect from the trailers, but that enhanced my enjoyment of it in this case. Yeah, it's not Batman, but I'm still buying it and I probably buy one movie every two years. Best advice, watch it without pre-conceptions and just enjoy the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite superhero movie......for now.","review":"This has to be my favorite superhero movie i've seen so far.

That all changes in the film though but im not gonna ruin it for ya. Alot of twists and turn's in this one though. Overall pretty nice movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hancock","review":"A great suprise story. Will Smith plays Hancock with a realism often seen in all his movies. He really believes he is Hancock and that makes the movie more believable and realistic. Charleze Theron is wonderful as his opposite and provides a touching complement to the story. Jason Bateman is the glue of this story and provides his usual upbeat personality to help Hancock become the hero he needs to be. Peter Berg has shown he can direct just as good as the big boys. I am looking forward to Berg's next film. An all in all great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to the hype!","review":"This movie didn't even come close to living up to the hype for me.

Insulting.Will Smith is strange, or rather his career choices are strange. He'll star in a good film like I Am Legend, then do this mess. Just when I start liking him as an actor, this ode to odium comes out. And the jokes in the film are so stupid, Austin Powers quality jokes (hyuck,hyuck).The DVD itself has plenty of special features, but no apology (I was hoping that one was on the DVD).

Not to wallow in teen angst, or larger philosophical issues. 'Hancock' delivers 90 minutes of entertainment.I had pretty low expectations of this movie - I hadn't heard much good about it, and in general I've come to really loathe action movies made in Hollywood that spend more time and effort on explosions than dialogue. To my genuine surprise, I quite liked 'Hancock.'If you want uncomplicated, unangsty, undark, *entertaining* superhero action, I recommend this movie. It's brain candy in the best sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost good, almost that is.","review":"HANCOCK has intriguing ideas, a very appealing lead, great special effects and like just about all Will Smith movies, it manages to come up short. I also wanted to like I AM LEGEND, I ROBOT, the MEN IN BLACK movies, HITCH, etc., etc. and in all of these cases, something somehow ruined it for me. In the case of Hancock I thought the plot twist was way too much to accept and represented the first time ever I hated seeing Charlize Theron in a movie (aside from MONSTER that is).Nothing against Will Smith, I just hope someday he'll break this almost-good jinx."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Hancock wound up being a Huge disappointment, mainly due to the weird story line, if you can call it a story line. It was very far fetched and pretty dumb, to put it mildly. Jason Bateman was excellent in his role of the loving, trusting husband and friend to Will Smith's character. Waste your money if you want, but if you MUST see this movie, take my advice and just rent it. You will be very glad you didn't waste your hard earned money as I did.

I never bothered to pay attention to it when it first came out. After all, Will Smith an action super hero? Men in Black, okay; I Robot, okay; I am Legend, okay too; but super hero? However, my wife's sister rented it for us to watch during the Christmas holiday. I was amazed at the great job Smith and Theron did in this movie. This is a great super hero acton movie with an intelligent plot. Yes, you heard me, an intelligent plot. Not just a bunch of gratuitous action thrown together, but a well thought out and creative story. A crime fighting super hero with strange super powers and a twist. In addition, let's just say he is challenged by a bottle with a cork. It is not my intention to summarize the plot of this movie and I will not do it here. Many reviewers have already done so. Suffice it to say, it is well worth watching, and adding to one's DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Fluff","review":"Hancock is a movie about a man with superhuman powers. Will Smith plays that man, who incidentally is a dirtbag, but Smith is such a likable actor you barely notice. I'm pleased to say I also barely noticed the CGI manipulation behind the visually spectacular special effects. The movie's rated PG-13 because Will Smith swears, screws, and drinks, but these bits are so overwhelmed by the movie's happy fantasy premise they matter not at all.

And why did Hancock have no memory of her but she remembers everything and understands their existence better than he does. The very most important thing to know about these two, wasn't explained very well at all.

Will Smith is terrible, his acting was totally bland and as though he forgot how to act or simply didn't even like his part. Parts of the movie just drag on like they wanted to save money instead of creating action. And in the end the movie contradicts its own premises on the characters. And definitely no funny parts either. Worst part is no good explanation of how things got to where they were, the few explanations that were provided were very weak.Overall a boring movie and not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wavy Camera Made Watching Difficult","review":"I think I would have liked this movie, but it was difficult for me to truly see it. It was filmed with a constantly moving camera, much like the old-time home movies that no one could watch. Now it's become common in movies and tv, but it's doing a disservice to people like me with motion sickness.And, it does a disservice to the acting. With the camera constantly moving, you can't read the expressions on the actor's faces and feel the emotion. They might as well be players off the streets with no talent whatsoever.I'm very disappointed. Please, when filming movies, keep that camera still! Let the drama come from the story and the acting, not by contrived action garnered by waving the camera around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, No \\"Superhero\\" Here!","review":"The point of Hancocks origin has been missed by it seems all who have reviewed here. His female \\"co-angel\\" says that they were called \\"gods\\" or \\"angels\\" in times past. There is nothing \\"superhero\\" here at all, but an adapted story of the fallen angels in Genesis chapter six who have sexual relations with women, then they lose their ability (or so it appears) to return to a \\"spirit form\\", which allows God to kill them thru the flood (Genesis 7).Realize that all mythology has at its beginning some element of truth.

Leonard Maltin's quote is accurate -- he says\\"It's bad enough that the material stinks, but director Berg shoots it in nausea-inducing handheld style,with pointless macro-closeups of the actors.\\" A waste of talent in a dumb movie. One star for some of theOK special effects. I'm glad I saw it, recorded from TV. I skimmed towards the end just to see how it ended.Happily, it did finally end.

A romantic movie? Serious and depressing commentary on the human condition?Hancock tries to be all three, and pretty much fails at all of them. The trailer makes it look like an action comedy, but that's only the first part of the movie. The rest of the movie feels tacked on, and just doesn't work.If you are in the mood for the movie the trailer leads you to expect, you'll be severely disappointed.

Special effects look like they are straight out of TV's 'Heroes', and poorly staged fight scenes really mar this movie. The premise could be an interesting one (unwilling superhero is really just a drunken bum), but it's all surface and no depth. And the \\"twist\\" that comes halfway into the movie was obvious from the first ten minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor and skip it.","review":"If you have an eye for discerning good action and special effects, you may want to stay away from this movie. Compared to say, Jon Favreau's Iron Man, Hancock's CG effects and action sequences leave a lot to be desired. It's not just the poor visual quality but also execution. Far too many cuts in rapid succession screams bad editing instead of speed and energy. Even the long shots aren't good. They're supposed to be over the top but end up looking cartoony."},{"rating":"1","title":"was not a blu ray essentials","review":"It was not what i was expecting it was hancock from 2008 i was expecting the blu ray essentials but you get what you pay for i think it was only $6"},{"rating":"1","title":"First Half was good","review":"The first half of the movie was good and frankly hilarious even though its mostly crude humor its when Miss AEON FLUX starts to get more screen time where it all goes downhill. It's almost as if the script were cut in half (it did have an original writer and then a re-writer) the first half an outsider story studded with crude/gross-out humor and the second an unrequitted love story with a cop-out ending. Frankly the extended dramatic scenes drug on too long and a particular humorous scene was horribly misplaced in the second half (the second hand chopping scene) buried in a high-drama ultra-serious segment. The origin of the \\"heroes\\" was just stupid, oh they're beings that have been referred to as angels or gods and there are only two left who by the way lose their powers and become mortal when together, super-lame.In summation 2 stars for the first half, the rest stinks don't bother; try to see this movie without having to pay for another Smith-Disaster co-starring Aeon Flux."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Unexpected","review":"Before I watched this movie all I had heard were bad reviews but I was curious anyways. Upon watching it I kept trying to predict what will happen and found myself changing my predictions the entire time. Hancock has so many surprises and plot twists that I was completely immersed in the storyline for the duration of the movie (and a little bit after too).If you are looking for a movie that will be like every other movie then look elsewhere. This movie is nothing like your average superhero movie. If you love those cheesy, predictable movies then put it down. Hancock is funny, charismatic and imperfect. I loved it and all the wonderful surprises. Try watching it with an open mind and appreciate the details of the story, you might be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"rent don't buy","review":"This movie was a disappointment. The original premise of a super hero who has human emotional faults had hope but that is where the good news ends. I'm trying to be positive but if it wasn't for the whale scene and maybe at the most, 3 other moments of humor the overriding weakness of plot sinks this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underated and Unappreciated","review":"In the many years of big budget super hero movies there are a few that stand out as being the absolute best of the best. Since I cannot seriously say that any movie licensed from Marvel or DC Comics is better than this movie, then this movie is the best super hero movie of all time. This movie tells the story of a man who is down on his luck, nobody likes him and he does not even know who he is. A man in public relations takes notice of him after he is saved by the hero and changes his image into something the public can get behind. And that is just the surface of the deep and engaging story. I would happily recommend this movie over any of the Xmen, Spiderman, Batman, Iron Man, Superman and Hulk Film films if you want to really understand the mythology that goes into actual comic books and be entertained with a genuine story. Any real comic book fan should see this movie before they see any of the licensed crap movies for the masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Finaly we get to see will smith as a superhero. this movie is awesome, the cast are great the special effects are great and so is the story. this is a diffrent kind of superhero movie but is still a great film.

The movie is just bad, its not even Smith's fault. Its just bad. Replace Smith with anyone and it would still be bad.I will say Will Smith sounds very unnatural swearing a lot. Every now and then when he is being sarcastic its funny. But he's not a very good jerk. The climax towards the end is good when he is actually showing sorrowful emotion, but other than that his emotions just seem forced.I'm guessing this movie sounded a lot better on paper. I wouldn't say don't watch it - because to each his own. But this is probably his worst movie to date. Yes worse than Wild Wild West...and I liked that movie :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"would order again without hesitation","review":"when i was looking for this movie as a christmas gift, i never thought that i would find a new release movie at such a great price. it was delivered pretty quickly to my home and in great condition. i would order again without hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny + Lots of sentences with \\"a..hole\\" + incoherent story line","review":"This movie has very few funny scenes.

The Even Stevens movie was better than this, and that movie tanked for adult audiences. The plot was very thin. The \\"super-her0\\" was a drunk and caused more damage than the criminals.

He'd take it out for thanksgiving and easter and then hand wash and dry it and put it away in it's case. He was a meat cutter so he knew knives.These knives are cast, not stamped, so they feel solid without a lot of flex. They are heavier than low quality knives but not too heavy. The rosewood handle is thick enough that the handles feel more square than cheaper knives (which tend to be flatter). This makes them very easy to hold. They cut through things like a warm knife would cut through butter. Even my wife is impressed by their ease of use.These are expensive but over the past 25 years we have bought and thrown away dozens of knives. In the long run these should be practical and we'll pass them onto our kids. The factory offers to replace any that become worn or damaged, and to resharpen them for free so there will be no reason to ever throw them away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong choice","review":"I researched and purchased the calphalon knife set. It is nicely weighted, however, I do not know how to hone knives. If I had puchased these, I could have sent them back to be honed. Will be replacing my knives with the Lamson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knives Made in the USA","review":"I was looking for a good set of knives and preferably made in the USA. The LamsonSharp 10 piece set arrived on time and the knives so far are very sharp and seem to hold a good sharp edge. I bought the kitchen shears separately and this was an excellent buy. The Rosewood handles are beautiful, particularly after I applied mineral oil. I didn't give this a 5-star rating because the block that comes with the set is a bit front heavy or light heavy in the back which allow the set in the block to tip forward if you are not careful. This has not been a problem, however and I would buy the set again. I did contact the manufacturer three weeks ago about the block, but have not heard back yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst gaming accessory EVER!","review":"This company should pay people to take this garbage off of their hands, not have people by it thinking they are getting a quality product.This product captures the reflection of the images from your PSP and converts that reflected image into digital signal that is displayed on your TV.

Even if you're not a strategy game fan or puzzle game fan, it's hard not to get addicted to this game (I'll let you read the other reviews that talk about the intricacies of the game). The levels are challenging (but fair), the multiplayer is awesome, and there's actually a story to go along with the game! Trust me, you will not regret buying this game because it's one of those games you can play for weeks and still want to play over and over again. Also, if you're looking for a good reason to buy a GBA, this game is the perfect reason. Even my girlfriend, who isn't a gamer, was impressed by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strategy game with great depth!","review":"For once, someone writes a military strategy game that worth playing on a portable console. This game has wonderful depth. There are lots of nuances out how specific fighting or support units work, how they interact with terrain, and lastly effectiveness agains other units. Replayablity is great. You can play the same maps more than once. Some strategy games increase the difficulty by simply giving your opponent more resources. That's not particularly good game design. Advance wars doesn't do that, and apparently the developers of this game took great care in balancing the units, and thus, increasing difficulty is requires more cleverness. Wonderful game. I highly recoommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tops of the GBA Titles","review":"I have learned to read the reviews before buying GBA games now. I have been burned before. Everyone loved this games in the reviews and there is good reason.This game is simply great. Fun and challenging. The game ramps you up to teach you the whole game and then slides you into the campaign. The final battle of the Campaign blew me away.The replay value on this game is a 5 as well. You can purchase maps in game with coins earned by battle.Don't bother renting, just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST","review":"This is probrably one of the games for gameboy advance out today.

YOU BET!!","review":"I reviewed this literally hours after I bought it and gave it raves. I was still in the (exhaustive) training mode and having a blast. Several dozen missions (and three sets of AA batteries) later I'm still playing but now it's about revenge. The Computer player always has more bases, more vehicles and more aircraft than you ever have. I've switched the game off mid-mission out of sheer frustration at the imbalances in this game, but ultimately I have to encourage anyone who enjoys a challenge to buy this game immediately. It's worth it for those times when you've finally got the computer on the run and are beating it's brains out and you'll love every minute of that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wars","review":"This is a strategic game.

Advance Wars is phenomenal because it does everything a great videogame is suppose to do. It does not have the astonishing graphics of a Dreamcast, PS2, or XBox game but that does not matter. Graphics do not make a game great. Advance Wars is easy to get into, has great gameplay, is extraordinarily addictive, and is 'just plain fun'.A lot of people write reviews and say, \\"Just go buy the game\\". In the case of Advance Wars I can not offer any better advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"An advance game for advance gamers","review":"WOW! This is a game that everyone needs to get thier hands on.

This is the first strategy game I've bought for the console, and I am not disappointed. It boasts an excellent tutorial that walks you through the functioning of each unit and various strategies for success. The game, though intricate, is not very difficult to learn/play. My only complaint, which is slight, is that there is no way to adjust the difficulty in a Campaign game.Great game, which I imagine would only be more fun with two players. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A can't miss game for GBA","review":"This game is a great game. The gameplay is deep and complex but you get eased into it so you aren't lost. The idea itself is simple: destroy your opponent's army and take their headquarters while protecting your own. You go through all kinds of terrain and situations as you continue to defend the Orange Star nation. The are all kinds of other options too, such as multi-player with 1 cartridge for up to 4 people by link, make yor own battle fields, and even multi-player on one Gameboy Advance. ... this is definitely a must-have game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily one of the worst games ever created!!!","review":"This game was terrible.

If you like action games stay away from this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"No WAR= No fun","review":"I recently bought this game after having read the reviews posted ont his site. Take my word for it, this game is a huge let down. I turned ont he game and was greeted by a flash start up intro that promised a great game, little did I know that upon playing even the training missions I found how dull and poorly made it is. It has awful graphics,among the worst on GBA. It ahs a poor plot and is reinforced by badly drawn anime and cinematics.

It is by far the best game ever on the game boy advance system. It features dozens of levels each witch are insanly fun and challenging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game so far....","review":"With over a hundred levels and Map Design, it's replay value is unlimited. You can battle through ground, seas and air with 3 of your friends or computers. What i thought was cool was you can ally computers to your side so it can be me and one computer vs my friend with his computer. The only downfall to this game is that it eats batteries too fast. The game should come with its own battery charger. And later in the game, the computer starts to get impossible, but good challenege for chess players right? well Other than that, the game is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE TIGHTEST GAME EVER .","review":"I have been playing games for a while now and this is one of thetightest games for real.If you like war you should buy this gameit has vicious graphics and different modes that you could play.The good thing about this game is wants you start playing you won't stop until your batteries run out if, to avoid this keep an eyeon the green light on the gba when it turns red and it's flashingsave i real fast. so when you start playing again you will be atthe same spot you left off. BUY THIS GAME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All Around Gamer","review":"A very cool term base, RPG, great look for GBA, easy to learn for beginners, and a overall wonderful \\"thinking\\" game for anyone who's interested in games such as FFX, C&C, AOE II, etc.Played it all way on the plane from Newark to LAX. Tons of fun to keep you glued, forget the on-flight movie or the mindless mags.

Over 100 maps plus you can create your own.Multiplayer heaven too with endless battles. Probably the biggest problem is the battles can last a little too long. Especially if your enemy has bases. You get air, ground and naval units to wage the ultimate war.Great game and I wouldnt hesitate getting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME EVER!!","review":"When I first played on this game, I thought I'd gone to heaven, the graphics are astonishing, there are so many different game styles and extras, but the Multiplayer has to be the best. It allows you to challenge your friends in battle, with just one cartridge and one GBA, and the action is frantic, fun and furious. I've had the game for about 3 months and I'm still constantly playing this game. This is definately the best game and a must have for any GBA owner. BUY THIS GAME, EVEN IF YOU NEED TO SELL YOUR HOUSE!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GBA GAME YET!!","review":"Mario will always be my favorite plumber, but this game is by far the most intense, addicting and challenging game yet for the GBA. I had real reservations about buying this game at first. The graphics and animation looked cool, but that's usually as far as it goes for me and the game ends up ... big-time. But, I thought I'd give it a chance as I heard it has been real big in Japan for the last decade. Plus it was only 30 bucks! ANYWAY, after playing it for I can't even fathom how many hours, I finished the campaign, but there is sooo much more to play and to have fun with. Even more challenging missions follow, and even more after that and so on. Is there no end??? It's the most addicting game I have ever played on any platform, and just ask my wife how much I play video games if you don't believe me. Yeah that's right... I'm married with a kid and I still play video games a lot... got a problem???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stradegy at its best!","review":"OK listen up. I got this game 2 days ago and it is as good as the other reviews say about it.Its so awesome.Its just the feeling of watching your anti air squadran(cant spell that) lift up their 50cals and rip the jet fighters to pieces that makes this game great.You have to use lots of srategy for this game. Lets take a look at this games great features:1.Cool looking anime graphics.2.Very easy controls but complicated enough to make it fun.3.Lots of units including Land,Air,Sea.4Very well done plot5.good music that is not annoying6.Great training missions to ease you into the game7.Lots and Lots of missions!!There is a ton more but i cant list them all! I highly reccommend this game to anybody that owns a GBA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"I think this game is the best one out for the GBA. It has kept me occupied for months and i still can't stop playing. There are tons of things to do other than Campaign mode like the War Room, Vs. Mode, and Design Maps mode. But all this comes after you complete Field training. The campaign mode is pretty tough if you do not use your troops carefully. Though the battles become increasingly harder as you advance through them, it still ends up to be an amazing game in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY Favorite GBA GAME!!","review":"What can I say This is my favorite game on gba it has great grapics when you go to thew battle screen and the guns sound really good this is like a cross of final fantasy 7 (turn based fighting) and warcraft war stratigy type games this game involves a lot of stratigy to win for instance if you have soldiers attack from the mountains they'll do more damage then they would from the ground and there will be less deaths because the eviorment is also something you must know about to win the war i this game is so great i can't begin to explain SO GO BUY IT AND MAKE IT NUMBER 1 ON THE LIST!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitious","review":"All I have heard are good things about this game but that is not what I thought. If you really like war this will probably be one of your favorites, but if not it will get really repetitious. All you do is fight war after war after war. It got very boring very quick for me. The good point is that you can build your own maps to fight wars on but you can only store up to three."},{"rating":"1","title":"this one fades out like a summer romance","review":"Yo, I heard some really solid reviews for this game, so I went ahead and picked it up.

C & C deserve each other. I hope they are sent off into Royal exile if Her Majesty should pre-decease these two boring, old sinners. Bring on King William V!This book is a waste of time and money.

Each cat helps the people around them deal with life's trials. It was easy to visualize the characters, including the cats, as they each learned a lesson from the cats. Each story was compelling and I couldn't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a dud.","review":"This project looks so promising. Get together some fine instrumentalists, invite some famous singers, work over some classic tunes. Well, the instrumental tracks are fine (Anger plays well throughout). Everything else -- with the exception of Willie Nelson's affecting reading of 'Hard Times Come Again No More' -- is rotten. Jane Sibbery makes an utter mess of 'Shenandoah' -- hard to do, as anyone who can hold a tune can make this song work. The reprise, which features Sibbery teaching the tune to an infant, is embarrassingly awful. And Tim O'Brien should buy Sheila Jordan's 'Lost and Found' -- he might get some ideas on how to sing 'The Water is Wide'. Those unfamiliar with these beautiful tunes will get the wrong impression; those who love them should steer well clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timely mystery that captures the essence of Cleveland.","review":"Les Roberts books about the adventures of PI Milan Jocovich are like a window to an old familiar place for me. I was raised in Shaker Heights, part Milan's city (Cleveland). I haven't been back in twenty years and I am pleased to still be able to reconize almost all his localities. I especially enjoyed the chase scene that took him around Cain Park to Taylor Rd., where I used to sled ride. His trips to restaurants on Kelly Hill, Little Italy, were so familiar. I wonder if a beer joint named \\"The Library\\", is still there?The Mystery of who killed the Serbian immigrant is all too timely. Age old hatreds don't die, even in a free country.I really enjoyed this book as well as all of Mr. Robert's Milan Mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connection times two or three","review":"I really enjoyed the Cleveland Connection. Roberts knows the city, the area, and the people well. Born and raised in NE Ohio, I really appreciated his descriptions and how true to life the characters are. My heritage is close to that of Milan and I understood the thinking of those from the old country and how they adapted to their new home. As another reviewer stated - old hates and secrets take a long time to heal - often generations.The book is fast paced and the mystery carefully plotted.

It's mostly reprints of Henderson's columns from Runner's World and other periodicals. As such, it's a good picture of his outlook, warts and all. Unfortunately, it's not as cohesive a perspective as it would be if it were a complete work. Henderson contradicts himself several times, and gives some genuinely bad advice, like training for marathons by running no more than half the distance (even he admits to barely finishing with this approach -- imagine what it would do to a novice!), and drinking soda or sugar water during endurance runs (this can be downright dangerous).What good information there is to be had here is mostly quoted from Sheehan, Galloway, and others. This gives a good overview of some of the primary sources, but it's marred by Henderson's inconsistency and his obvious ego."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Competitive Running Book","review":"Like the other reviewers, I loved this book. It will keep you interested in running for a long time to come. Henderson makes sense.But I want to make sure that serious runners know what the book is really about. It's not a book about developing a competitive edge--at least not in the normal sense. It's not about living on the edge--in terms of high mileage training. It's about not falling off the edge--that is, staying healthy and interested in running over the long haul.As much as I loved the book, I couldn't give it 5 stars because right now I'm in the competitive mode, determined to qualify and run the Boston Marathon. I need more tough training right now than Henderson promotes.Once I run Boston, I'll come back to this book and love it more than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful story of family, love, and lies.","review":"I enjoyed this tenderly told story of several generations of a close-knit Irish American family. The novel chronicles ways in which their lives are shaped by familiar forces -- war, death, love, and religion -- and just as significantly, by lies. Billy, the flawed but endearing central character, is first introduced by members of his family who are gathered for his funeral. Through them, we learn of Billy's painful past. I loved McDermott's polished prose and the way it is used to describe the thoughts of the characters. The novel examines, through the lives of ordinary people, the complex question of how be become who we are."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Weddings and Wakes was superior","review":"The award for this book, perhaps, works better if I think of it as a way to reward Alice McDermott for her overall achievements. But At Weddings and Wakes was far superior. And I can't recall when the subject of That Night has been done better. I think the awards committee missed the better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected Disappointment","review":"After reading the first chapter at this web site I purchased the book. I was disappointed with what followed. The character development of Billy was poor, as was the author's explaination of why he was obsessed with a woman he barley knew. Are we to believe that the loss from a short-lived superficial relationship, is supposed to burden us the rest of our lives? How absurd!! As for the narrative style, the author needs to study Somerset Maugham."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal grogg.","review":"Who are these people who give out these awards? National Book award???

But the prose is lyrical (by the way, those weren't dangling modifers) and the characterization moving. The narrator, who is revealed within the first few chapters, is trying to put Billy's story together; consequently we never quite get to the heart of Billy, any more than we do to the hearts of other people in real life. Ultimately, this is a book about Mystery,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Have we lost interest in great writing?","review":"Many of the reviews criticize the weak plot (when there is, in fact, a reasonable story line) and disappointment in the character development. But McDermott does a beautiful job of painting a picture of real people, many of whom have probably existed in your life at one time or another. Their weaknesses are real, bu they are not Greek tragedies. And the language the author uses to describe the comfort people find in death, the acceptance of alcoholism, the reality of tragedy is gripping but not pretentious. Try this book. It is not long, but every page is a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-crafted, but empty","review":"The emptiness of the characters spills over into the essence of the book. And I don't think this is intentional. When James Joyce, the ultimate exemplar of the Irish story, wanted us to feel the emotional chill of his characters' situations, as in \\"The Dead,\\" the chill was exquisite. I grew up in this territory. And while the characters are realistic, they are no more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to stay focused","review":"This book did an excellent job of capturing the Irish experience in the U.S. during the 20th century. I appreciate the eloquent way the author framed an otherwise dull story against an exemplary backdrop. However, accuracy isn't everything, and the plot just never took off. The problem was not so much the story, but the writing was cyclical and tangential. At times, the reader can't tell who the narrator is. My friends of an Irish-Catholic background loved it. I can only appreciate McDermott's ability to paint the picture. I just wish that picture had managed to capture me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"I obtained the complete audio book on six cassettes in less than a week for less than a dollar from Amazon's 3rd party vendor.

Billy is not charming, but a user of people. His friends and relations are not forgiving, but co-dependents in his alcoholic stagger through life. Alice McDermott's prose, while occasionally pretty, is never deep. It's time to leave our fascination with the Irish and move on to another nationality."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Charm In Billy","review":"This book was a major disappointment for me. I felt suffocated by its characters and story and had little sympathy for Billy, who seemed to be totally self-indulgent and self-destructive. Even though the book was short, it felt like War and Peace as I tried to plow through it because I was enticed by the raving reviews and its National Book Award status. But it was tedious, annoying, and, ultimately, unrewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I purchased Charming Billy because I was under the impression that a book had to be good in order to get an award. That is definetely not the case with this book. The story has no plot and goes no where.

It was a pleasure to look into these familiar character's lives. It is a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book reads the way life feels","review":"Alice McDermott has a genius for capturing the telling detail in every scene she describes, so that everything seems both recognizable and seen for the first time. The novel is masterful in conveying the quality of memory and of the mysteries that exist in all families - mysteries that everyone has an opinion on but that can never be finally resolved. How wonderful to read a book in which there are no heroes or villains - just people like the ones we know, occasionally elevated by their dreams or their loyalties or their sense of humor, then sunk by their weaknesses; and what a pleasure to read a book in which relationships within family and neighborhood are central without being the crux of some hideous abuse that explains everything. In life, and in Charming Billy, no one thing explains everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think this deserved the National Book Award","review":"I'm sorry, but I don't think this novel deserved the National Book Award. I loved Cold Mountain (last year's winner), but I think there are far better books that could have won this award. The story did not move me in any way. I don't care how good the writing may be, if the story does not change my view of the world in some way or stir emotion in me, or even entertain in some way, then what's the purpose of reading it? I know this author is talented, but I wanted more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite charming,...","review":"The book is good. That's what I have to say. It contains a very light story for light reading and a historical sense into the Irish families. The plot set in such well mannered it was depicting a soft dying day where Maeve is hard on finding her future. When Billy died, she was so devastated and the loomy days where described in up-miost excellence, as beautiful and as mundane as a dying day.What I feel in this book is a sense of belonging. The narration really put me there, just like a person beside with much to listen on their little conversations. The book show the courage and the pain and the lost. But it ends well, with new hope. THANK YOU Alice."},{"rating":"1","title":"poetic language, weak characterization & plot","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I share the northeast, Irish American background described in the novel, but didn't find the characterizations especially compelling. The plot would have been ok for a short story but just doesn't hold up in a novel. Also, there is a tradeoff between this modern, \\"in\\" style and simple clarity -- I suppose I generally prefer clarity! Some of the passages are very poetic, however.

My attention span could not last while reading the endless pages of boring babble. The plot to this book was on the right track and it had potential to be a classic novel. Yet, there was no action to attract me, and my mind started to wonder. Not only was it very boring, I found that the introduction of so many characters that had insignificant roles to the plot was overall confusing. Maybe my dislike for this book was due in part to my age.

Billy was anything but charming. He was a self-centered and self-absorbed alcoholic. The characters were all one-dimensional. I had a difficult time empathizing with any of them. I would have liked to know more about Billy and Mauve's relationship, more about what Billy thought and felt. The non-linear time frame, in my opinion, did not enhance the story, it made it more difficult to follow. All in all, this book did not resonate with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Charming Billy","review":"At first I really cared about the main character, Billy, but as the book plodded along I found myself caring less and less about this stereotype of an Irish-American.

I do not see what people like about this book. I found it to be rather boring and uneventful, not to mention confusing. This entire book is based off of Billy, a drunk who passed away. The narrarator is Billy's cousin's daughter. Her purpose is to relay Billy's life to the readers. I saw no moral or lesson in Charming Billy and was rather disspointed. I would have much rather put my time and energy into reading a more interesting book with a lesson that would have some impact on my life.

I sat down to read Charming Billy and just couldn't get into it as much as I'd hope. I love to read and figured this book would be a good one. Maybe, just maybe, my mind is preoccupied with Christmas frenzy stuff? I thought the book more or less predictable. It is hard for me learn to love a character that is a drunk.

Books without plots and action can be interesting if the characters are fun, eccentric or weird enough, but there was no one in this novel like that. Billy was not charming. Maybe it would have gotten better but I just couldn't stick it out. I'm starting to get very suspicious of books that have won awards. I've found that a lot of the Oprah Club picks are depressing. Maybe this is the new requisite for literary awards: Boring and depressing.

Interesting use of narrator to create a patchwork quilt of a story which jumps around quite a bit, going off on tangents and then looping back to pick up threads left hanging. I would imagine that this novel may deeply affect those who can recognize some of themselves or their family here, but for those who do not come from this background the motivations are difficult to follow, much less understand. Some great psychological insights but they do not weave together into a cohesive whole, but rather seem like little gems sparkling in the muck.

This is one of the worst book-on-tape I have listened too! It ranks up there with \\"The Pilots Wife\\", which was also very long and about nothing. There are to many characters to keep up with. The story is about everybody but Billy!!. And to top it all off, the narrator was horrible!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Nothing about this book would make me recommend it. The basic storyline is shallow, based on a false premise - that a man who learns that his fiancee has died overseas never recovers from his sorrow and uses that disappointment as an excuse to wallow for the next 40 years in an alcoholic fantasy about her. His story is told through a number of characters' accounts of the trials and trivia of his pathetic life.

I was disappointed with the theme, the death of an alcoholic. The life of the protagonist (if you can call him such) was a dreary life in a bottle. Why he was called \\"charming\\" is beyond me. The book is well written, which helps since the story is highly repetitive. The poor characters loved a man who did not love himself. Did he really drown his life in alcohol because of a broken heart? It seems highly unlikely yet little is known about the character.

Waste of my money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel is a mockery of itself","review":"This novel incorporates in its characters nearly every Irish stereotype imaginable! (surely the author is aware of this, but why this vulgarity?) No doubt, there is something aesthetically pleasing in the prose, but this is quickly sapped by its poorly devised characters who become an inescapable weight of incredulity that deafens the novel. As for the 'love' in this romance- it is quite strong, because alcohol is probably the most 'charming' thing Billy comes to find as a true love. Yet, another drag on our poor reader is that Billy isn't a even a 'fun' drinker; so it seems like more desperate measures would have been taken sooner to intervene. Surprisingly, friends and family continue supporting this deadbeat . . . because they love him! But does he love them? Does he care? And more to the point, does the reader care after this painful journey to reach the last page? At this point the novel has lost any perceived charm (if there ever really even was)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"Although on the surface a book about unpleasant subjects (death, alcoholism, lost loves, and the impact of war), Charming Billy is really about friendships, love, and caring. It touches on the subjects of the Irish and Catholicism in a non offensive way. Although the author's style of inserting quotes in the middle of sentences without proper punctuation was a bit difficult at times, this aggravation was far outweighed with writing which at times is nothing short of brilliant. Pick this book up and you'll not be able to put it down until you are finished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad to see all of these one-star ratings","review":"I think that the majority of these negative reviews come from readers who can't appreciate a novel from a truly artistic point of view. The characters (especially Billy, who had a very limited voice) were very well developed, and the plot was well thought out. Many negative reviews focused on the \\"lack of action.\\" Does a novel need to be action packed to be good? If you think so, then stick to your MTV culture. CB is full of wonderful detail and exquisite storytelling. This novel deals with many issues that affect nearly all of us and should be read carefully. As far as those who criticize having to re-read passages, do you really want a book that doesn't make you stop to think once in a while? Definately worthwhile, and deserving of a second reading by those who felt it 'boring.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"A charming, poignant story of interwoven family characters, each with their own viewpoint regarding one specific family member. They discuss his impact on their lives and in the process let us see into each of their lives, as well.Particularly moving if you understand big city neighborhoods and the ethnic groups that evolved there, especially those established during the last century.Not a lot of action, but real insight into the bonds of family and friend comraderies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much pathos, not enough charm","review":"This book tried to do what \\"Angela'a Ashes\\" actually did. There were too many characters with too much pain in their lives to allow the reader to identify with any single one. The strange choice of narrator futher clouded the novel. McDermott does a fine job of placing a word on a page; her prose is melodic and rich to read. But when those words try to become a story, they fall short. I found very little believable threads in this book and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Artistry in language and story telling","review":"Alice McDermott takes the reader on a guided tour of a man's life through the eyes of his family and friends. It's a thoughtful story of the fortitude of the heart, the aching of love lost and wasted and the power of family. McDermott writes with a warmth that quietly pulled me in. I became attached to the characters, and grieved for what could have been. A truly charming book in its story and in the charm of its language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once you get over the hurdle...","review":"Ms. McDermott writes beautiful prose. She knows how to capture a character at a vulnerable moment; and this is reason enough to read all the way through. Having said that, the clinically terminal problem with this skimpy book is that its central premise is patently unbelievable! Thirty years and we're supposed to believe that no one--not even the Irish relatives--give bugwit Billy a clue as to what really happened? Perhaps Ms. McDermott lavishes so much effort on her prose because she knows her plot is idiotic. Add to this gaping defect the author's oh-so-subtle insistence that nothing makes any difference in life anyway (so, why not be stupid??) and you find Ms. McDermott's book is a cheat in the end, and rather a cowardly one. So many better authors and stories affirm the opposite, i.e, William Trevor, Maeve Bunchy, Alice Munroe. Here's hoping the author got this nonsense out of her system and will deliver something major soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped redeem my faith in contemporary fiction!","review":"I can only imagine that those who found this book \\"boring\\" are accostomed to something with more plot. By that standard it's true: not much happens. Just life. This book spoke to me on so many levels: as an Irish-American, as a wife, as a daughter, as a mother, as an American! To me, it is a true mark of talent when a writer can take a story in which not much happens in the way of drama and make it impossible to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"In the past, I have used award winners as a guide to read some outstanding modern fiction such as \\"All The Pretty Horses\\", \\"Cold Mountain\\" and \\"Snow Falling on Cedars\\".

I was so bored that I really wondered what the author was trying to accomplish in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this book win such a major award?","review":"Imagine someone writes 243 pages and then drops the manuscript on the floor. The order gets all jumbled but instead of putting them back in order the publisher produces the book as is. Well, that's what you get with Charming Billy. I know some people are so vain as to consider great literare something that is difficult to follow (like Faulkner). But McDermott is no Faulkner and this is certainly not the quality of book that should win the National Book Award. The story wasn't bad but it was poorly presented. Our reading group read this book and every member just labored through this book, griping all the way. If this truly was the best that American authors had to offer in 1998, then perhaps the publishing houses should simply shut down for a year or so until authors get the filth and bile out of their systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read, depressing, boring book.","review":"The writer tells you the outcome first then drags you through hundreds of pages of run on, awkwardly written sentences.

Don't waste your time on Billy."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the audio version...","review":"I rented the tape to fill the hours of a car trip. I struggled through two tapes of five then put them away. The reader has the most awful voice and the worst phony Irish accent.

I have not been grabbed by the this book; I really don't much care what happens to anyone I have been introduced to so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, but a bit confusing.","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. It was an intimate look at the closeness and caring of the typical Irish-American Catholic family.

I began this book with a very open mind, but mid-way could not go any further. One of the few 'wish I had never purchased' books I have obtained. May appeal to some, but I had a very hard time becoming interested. Characters hard to follow; a lot of skipping around without explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Book Award? Why?","review":"I looked forward to reading \\"Charming Billy\\" because I like McDermott, and I was delighted that she'd won the National Book Award. Perhaps I began with too positive an attitude because it wasn't long before I was thinking \\"Why the award? What is fresh about this story?\\" The most compelling part of the book occurs when Billy returns to Ireland and unexpectedly meets his 60-year-old love, a scenario that McDermott never really develops. Did I think Billy was charming? No! He was an unpleasant, self-centered alcoholic. I can't imagine why all these people felt such a stupendous loss when he died. (And maybe that's the point: he fooled them all.) My monthly book club met as I was finishing the book, and several of us had read it. No one felt the book was worth recommeding to those who hadn't. Still, the question remains, what have we missed that the National Book Award Committee saw?"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull story about ordinary people","review":"I looked forward to reading this book because it got the National Book award. What a disappointment! For some reason the author made it difficult to figure out relationships between and among the different characters. That puts an unnecessary burden on the reader. Once again in a work of fiction the Irish are made to look bad. Here the girl who left Billy, never to return, turns out to be a selfish person who keeps the money he sent for her return and uses it for her own purposes. At least this book has a happy ending. But I could not recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich introspective of pain and acceptance","review":"Dialogue-based and retrospectively told, Charming Billy unfolds in a delicate and yet spell-binding manner. A warm, heartfelt novel, the story is oddly not one that one would choose to read for an emotional lift. Rather, it evokes the reader to survey relationships with family and friends, and ponder death with reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointingly over-rated","review":"Well, I finished it. The reviewers say that this novel cannot be relegated to plot. That's for sure, I found it hard to follow and boring. The reviewers say the emotional content is restrained, subtle. I say that with a couple of notable exceptions, the emotional content is numbing.Imo, the only redeeming features of this book are the finely drawn characters and the realistic portrayal of the tedium of daily life. (No wonder it was boring.)I think that this novel would have made a terrific short story. I'm sorry I didn't get to read it in \\"The New Yorker.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"told from the inner minds of the Irish, in their words.","review":"A sheer but troubling delight!! I felt transported back to ny Brooklyn roots, hearing again the self-serving lies we all convinced ourselves were needed to survive. We accepted the lies of others so they would accept ours. The omnipresent alcohol pervaded every moment of our lives even during the short episodes of 'dryness'. Best of all, told in the Irish argot. Forget Hamill's 'A Drinking Life' - this is the Irish Manifesto!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like Harry Chapin's \\"Taxi\\"!","review":"No characterization. Who is Eva? and what makes him carry the torch for her all his life? We know that Billy is a pleasant drunk, and that's all we know about any character in this book. Billy drank himself to death. Near the end we find out a secret. Before that is 200 pages of obvious--why am I reading this?--filler. I'm NY Irish myself, but was frustrated by the paucity of culturalisms I could relate to. Notice not many reviews for this book? Speaks for itself; most people without anything nice to say don't say anything at all. I see why they call this an \\"upset winner\\" of the book award. It is on the slight, trite side"},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is as charming as Billy.","review":"Alice McDermott captures life marvelously as she uses dialog and description to depict the life of a very troubled man. But he was nevertheless a man of faith and conviction. The many characters simply showed life in an extended Irish family.The ending with \\"lives of the saints\\" is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most overrated books that I have ever read","review":"When I first saw this book in the store, I thought that it looked great....little did I know what was lurking inside of the cover. When I read Charming Billy, I did not find what I had hoped. What I found was a long-winded, depressing, confusing and highly uninteresting piece of literature. In short, I do not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Billy","review":"Like others, I read this novel because of the National Book Award accolades. McDermott's novel is entertaining and at times insightful, but it is rarely profound. I found myself skipping pages of text because I was not engaged in the plot or the characters' lives, and in the end, the story seemed to me like one-dimensional musings of life and life's unfulfilled dreams. \\"Charming Billy\\" is like a mediocre \\"Big Chill,\\" and one wonders how it merited the National Book Award for fiction. While McDermott's writing is polished and mature, she fails to transcend the reminiscences of her characters to afford the reader perceptive or discerning truths about life. In the end, the novel failed to involve me and was quickly forgetten. It was, in a word, charming."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One's a Snoozer","review":"I was sure this book would be engrossing since it received awards and has been listed on reading lists for several years. Boy was I wrong. The only reason I even finished it is because I kept thinking surely it would get better. The narrator kept alluding to relationships that never really materialized in the novel. My advice: pass on this one, there are too many great books in this world to spend your time here."},{"rating":"1","title":"It has stayed with me as the worst book ever after years.","review":"This one continues to ring out as most memorable worst book. It drags. It is deliberatley complicated and if there are points they are most definitely lost in the poor writing that does not flow. I enjoy reading different writing styles and though they do not all flow into a fast read all of the time, most books ebb and flow. This one just ebbed painfully. I am afraid it has made me cautious of grabbing just any National book award winner and expecting a good read. Someone missed the boat when voting on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed characters and plot.","review":"There are so many characters, none of which we get to know very well except the deceased Billy, and even he is only a casual acquaintance. The book takes many sidetrips, flashbacks, and the relationship between some of the characters is never really clear. All in all, an uninteresting book which takes too much effort to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a prize winner","review":"McDermott failed to portray the characters of the book in a way that held my interest. It was extremely difficult to latch on to the story or it's characters as McDermott failed to let us spend more than two pages on one character! I found the content and construct of the book excessively boring. I never fail to find pleasure in all books I read, however, Charming Billy was the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated, quiet read","review":"I was disappointed in the limited reach of the story. It would have been a good short story. The story line was redundant and repetitive. I had no feelings for any of the characters. I do not understand how this novel won such a prestigious award. There were some beautiful words written about what marriage really is on p.52, but otherwise, yawn, yawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Idea That Desperately Needed To Be Workshopped","review":"\\"Charming Billy\\" isn't the worst book I read all year, it's just the worst award-winning one. And that alone is worth an extra star. The writing is fine in places but, as many others have already said, is so hard to follow as to render it meaningless. Also, I had a major problem with how the narrator (Dennis' daughter) came upon some of the information she was now telling us. I won't give away the plot or any surprises but when reading it, ask yourself how she possibly could have known about certain events in the past? Unless I'm missing something, it was physically impossible for her to know some of what went on while Billy was away. It's hard to believe that such a fundamental mistake could have passed by an editor. Or, maybe it's not. And that's too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant bore that had a promising beginning.....","review":"This novel started out beautifully, with writing that made my heart ache. And then, boom, it bombed around page 80. This would have been a GREAT short story. MacDermott's character descriptions were SO repetitive, and the scene in the gas station in Ireland with the bullsh-t about the two sisters having an argument was absolutely ludicrous. After all that pining for Eva, Billy acts completely alien to his own character during this whole scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charming Billy is more chore than charm.","review":"I have just this moment finished reading Charming Billy. I am so relieved to shut the cover for the final time. Any one interested in reading this book needs to go to page 243 and read the sentence near the bottom that continues on to page 244. It consists of 180 words and 12 commas. This is but a small taste of the grueling style of writing this book contains. I did not shed one tear over any character in this book. A book that seemed to never end. There are so many better choices for the National Book Award Winner. So many better choices for reading material period. Think long and hard before purchasing this book. If you must read it look for it at your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good story but not well-told.","review":"Despite what could have been a cast of deeply romantic characters, McDermott failed to develop them to a level that drew me in. Having heard that the book had won the National Book Award, I forced myself to read on, hoping to be drawn in to the magic of the story. Unfortunately, it turned out to be nothing but an unsatisfying slog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe there was something I missed.","review":"I wanted to like this book. I had read the reviews and liked other books Alice McDermott has written. This book seemed to go nowhere. Billy was a drunk with a codependant wife. End of story. I wanted something more to happen when Billy met Eva again in Ireland. I stuck with it to the end but wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish-American drinks himself to death (how surprising).","review":"The story does not exactly break new ground, but it's well-written, rings true, and makes for a compelling read. Readers will recognize the familiar terrain, as most families have a \\"Billy\\" of their own. I just wish the reviewers wouldn't give away so much of the plot in their reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read -- Dont.","review":"This book is a waste of time. Boring, whinny and very choppy. I'd rather go the dentist for a deep tooth cleaning than read this book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"a family's kitchen-table talk","review":"The charm in _Billy_ is in its capacity to evoke the kitchen-table gossip families engage in on a quiet Sunday afternoon. Family legends are recalled, and each story-teller reveals as much about himself or herself as about the subject of the tales. A member from a new generation, who is trying to piece the story together, is alternately bored by the repetitiveness in the stories and intrigued by the secrets that are nonetheless regularly revealed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to follow, not very interesting","review":"Like many who have reviewed this book, I found this story hard to follow and even more difficult to get into. An alcoholic fool would have been a more accurate description of Billy than was \\"charming\\". I managed to finish the book in the vain hope that the story would get better but it did not. The story was just plain sad and not very redeeming. In fact, throw in some colorful language and a prostitute and you would have \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" with Irish people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the first novel I have read by Alice McDermott, but not the first \\"National Book Award\\" winner. At it's conclusion, I find myself wondering how this book ever won any award. It was a disappointment. The novel's premise is promising - reflection on a man's life from the vantage point of his wake - a love lost without closure because of a burdensome lie, and the emptiness of alcoholism. The promise of the story unfulfilled because not one of it's characters is described with enough dimension to enable the reader to identify with personality or plight. The reading laborsome due to ineffective description and frequent time jumping. Even when the reader is drawn into the present, a tale more compellingly told - it is short lived - leaving the reader flat, unsure if they want more or are just glad the confusion is over. Perhaps that is the metaphor (about life) the author was after, but this reader, unfortunately, was not made wiser. No recommendation here."},{"rating":"1","title":"found confusing and obivous","review":"I thought this book was hard to read and the closure was obvious after chapter two. Plus the requent use of the happenstance and other off beat language I found distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Weddings and Wakes was a better book...","review":"than Charming Billy. But neither is A-list reading; McDermott is not a must-read author. Thank goodness discriminating readers don't rely solely on award-nominees and -winners (or, for that matter, Oprah picks) or we would become the nation of illiterates everyone keeps predicting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures Irish Heartbreak and Struggle with \\"the Drink\\"","review":"A wonderfully sad, yet compelling story of an Irish family in America. McDermott knows her subject quite well and her ability to portray how alcohol becomes a living thing, especially in an Irish family, is moving. You feel your frustration build with Billy and the interaction the rest of the family has with him yet, you never stop rooting for him, all the while knowing your cheers are fruitless.This is not a light story about how strong character triumphs over adversity. It is about the pain and destruction of secrets, guilt and alcohol and their deleterious effect on everyone who is touched even slightly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book","review":"This was the most aweful book I have ever read. I would NEVER, EVER, EVER recommend it to anyone. Waste of money, waste of time and a waste of an award."},{"rating":"1","title":"And this kind of dreck wins book awards?","review":"What a yawner! I'm calling it quits halfway through this boooooring book. It jumps around way too much and repeats itself and I don't care one little bit about the people in it. I'm going to leave it in the lunch room at work for some other poor fool to take."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time. . .","review":"This book is over-rated. It was awful, not worth the pain and effort it takes to wind through the confusing and dragging plot. There are tons of better books in the world...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the charm?","review":"I love good literature, but I'm having a tough time finding anything about this book to praise. Its \\"plot\\", if you can call it that, is circular and self-defeating. I suppose being dead doesn't automatically disqualify a main character from being interesting, but in this case I didn't really care a fig about Billy or any of his numerous, ordinary relatives. A few ruminations in a book give one time to reflect along with the author. An entire book of ruminations is tedious in the extreme. If you are looking for recreational reading, I would suggest you pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gullible Billy","review":"There's artistry and perceptiveness in this tale of betrayal and deception, woven through the accounts of major and minor players. Unfortunately, so little of the story comes to us from the romantic hero himself, that there is virtually no emotional connection with tragic Billy. The story is mostly told by his cousin Dennis's daughter, who had little or no contact with Billy. Even at the climax of the story, when Billy unexpectedly meets his lost love Eva again after 30 years of believing she is dead, the scene fails to convey the shock, betrayal, amazement, or whatever it is he is feeling. There is a moving portrayal of the dismal lives endured by other characters, such as Billy's unfortunate wife Maeve. However, there is too much irrelevant detail about minor characters and places, seemingly there just to expand a very slim story line. Billy does not convince as a charmer, nor as a tragic hero, he is little more than a shadowy excuse for a wasted life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifully written BUT no place to go","review":"I give plaudits to Alice McDermott's writing style -- she works hard to describe the feelings, flashbacks, and memories of Dennis' daughter as she reflects on the life and death of the tragicomedic character Billy Lynch. But her prose got bogged down into a journey into somewhere and nowhere. After a while, I got a headache simply trying to figure out just who McDermott was talking about. At the end, the message of the book was unclear -- was it about the need for redemption for a 30-year-old lie? was it about family values? was it about....what? Sorry to say, but this is certainly not one of her best works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, skip this one","review":"How God-awful boring!!! I can appreciate a book that skips the traditional straight narrative, and I enjoy getting the perspective of different characters --WHEN I CAN TELL WHICH CHARACTERS THE PERSPECTIVE IS COMING FROM!! (or when I care enough to figure it out). Yes some books are worth \\"unpacking\\" to get to the heart of the story. This book was not. And my god, are all Catholics as tedious and lame as those in Charming Billy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring, plodding read","review":"I just didn't \\"get\\" this book. I had to force myself to finish it, and I'm sorry I wasted the time. The writing was confusing and it was hard to figure out whose thoughts were whose. I was three-quarters of the way through it before I realized it was Dennis' daughter who was the narrarator. Why was she the narrarator? I'll never buy an \\"award winning\\" book again because my tastes have nothing in common with the committee that chose this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt like I wasted my time reading this book.","review":"If the computer would let me give this book no stars I would have.

What a mistake! I had a hard time following the book with all the jumping around. I loaned it to a family member who also felt the book was greatly overrated. The prose was ok, but I've read many more books with better prose. I had a hard time understanding why the book was repetitive and jumped so much. Don't bother buying this. Borrow it from the library or a friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Charming?","review":"I'll start by saying that I bought this book because I read That Night by AM a few years back and I really liked it. She is a very good writer and she develops some good characters. But sadly this one sits on the shelf with the bookmark stuck on page 178...and that is where it will remain. I've put it down twice and read other books, but each time I picked this one back up for another try. I finally had to admit to myself that this is not a very good book. This would have made a decent essay or short story, but there is just not enough here for me for an entire book. AM seems to out of her way to knock the reader over the head with every Irish stereotype know to man. I would try another by this author because I think she is very skilled, but I give this book two stars only because of her prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duller than dull, didn't captivate me at all","review":"What a shame. I wanted to like this book but I'm struggling to finish it. How is it that Dennis' daughter possesses these deep insights and the rest of the family appears clueless? And I have no sympathy or empathy for any of these characters. This novel could be summed up this way: Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets drunk and dies. The rest of the content you could probably catch at an AA meeting. The prose is ponderous- Read Barbara Gowdy, E. Annie Proulx, or if you want to read another book about an Irish family, read Seamus Deane's fine novel \\"Reading in the Dark.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A best seller should be good...NOT","review":"I bought Charming Billy because it was on the best seller list. What a disapointment. It started off fairly well but never got better. I had to stop half way through because it was just so uninteresting.

Well, I read PLENTY (about 4 - 5 books a month) and I found this book to be a lot of tedious drivel. I don't see what the big deal is. I finished it only because I wanted to see if it would get any better. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charming Billy is the best sleeping pill around.","review":"It's rare that I read a book that I didn't grow to appreciate in some way by the time I finish. The only thing I appreciated about this was finally closing it. This novel doesn't \\"flow\\", it's difficult to follow from the start. The characters aren't developed well, I found myself not really caring about them. I wish I had listened to the bookseller when she struggled to find something positive on this one.I'd suggest Mercy Road, Dalia Pagani or Amy & Isabelle, Elizabeth Strout, both strong new writers, as more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must have missed the point","review":"This was a recommendation for our book club and all 6 of us were struggling with it. This beloved Billy was so underdeveloped as the central theme character and the other characters were weak and enabling to the point where you could not feel for any of them.

I did not feel secure with the end of the book, because they can't ever marry. You think that the author will find someway to get rid of his wife so he can marry Mirjana but it never happens and therefore leaves a lot of disspointed readers.

Richardson looks embarrassed, and Walken hams it up as his trademarked cliched \\"creepy guy\\", who's about as intriguing as a Chicken McNugget. He reminds me of the Euro seducer \\"The Continental\\" from SNL. Even the mood music is bad. The only mystery about this movie is why these horrible, stupid, and completely boring characters don't just pass out from ennui as they spout out their inane, stilted streams of dialogue.

I like to have a strong cup of 4 oz coffee with room for cream so the sizing is perfect for smaller portions (I don't like to fill up on liquids any way, and prefer to brew a fresh cup each time I want more, that's the point of single cup brewers).I also love the fact that these cups are sturdy. I don't like the thin dainty cups that you would find at most retailers. Although these are not commercial grade they do have a suprizingly pleaseant heft to them.

It does not tell you how to run the cables and hide the wires, but that's is covered very well in other books.I believe it would be an excellent resource for both the hobbiest and the professional.

This book would make a great reference for anyone already familiar with the concepts of computability but does little to accommodate readers that are new to the subject. There are some pretty good step by step explanations of more basic subjects like non-deterministic finite automata but the explanations that are given for more complicated topics are very flaky. Take the pumping lemma for example. The book gives a very brief overview, a more formal definition, and then (prematurely) jumps into examples.

Some of the devices used in the examples no longer existed (like some pre-historic tape machines).I later took the same class with another teacher who didn't use any books but instead used examples like soda machine that dispenses correct change, etc. Much more helpful.The book was very confusing.

For example, Greibach normal form of CFG is nowhere seen in the book, which makes Sipser's explaining of converting CFG to NPDA (lemma 2.13) very uninteresting. Compare with lecture 24 in Kozen's book, you'll see the difference. This book also lacks examples. Without seeing enough examples, you just won't grasp the concepts firmly. That's mainly the reason why the exercises and problems seem so difficult.I recommend Kozen's \\"Automata and Computability\\", Hopcroft and Ullman's \\"automata, languages, computation\\" and Papadimitriou's \\"computational complexity\\". but not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, Precise, Enjoyable reading. Great Stuff!","review":"One thing I really enjoy is how Sipser motivates every topic with real life examples, connects new topics with the already covered ones, in other words, makes it very easy to read and understand what is going on. This is in contrast to the Hopcroft and Ulman book which is very dry and dense, and in which a reader is not guided from topic to topic; topics are just covered, and the reader has a question \`\`why?'' (I may be wrong about this...) In any case, I think this is the only book to use both for a class and self-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Near Perfect Computer Theory Textbook","review":"This book is suitable for beginners and graduate students who want to explor the theory of computation .

It is not for the timid reader. I'm trying to get my hands on the original German edition, but whether it is the writing or the translation, Peukert's book reads as if it were authored by the illegitimate, illiterate love-child of James Joyce and Henry James. Contentwise, it has very little to do with the popular perception of \\"Weimar Culture;\\" for that, check out Peter Gay. This book deals primarily with social and economic conditions, and hardly ever mentions politics, and even more rarely, art. If you like charts and graphs and figures though, this is full of them. That said, this is the preeminent book on Weimar Germany. It helps to have a philosophy degree to read it, though. Anthony Heilbut's excellent Exiles in Paradise is more than worth checking out if you're interested in the mass emigration of German artists and intellectuals to the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good introduction","review":"I'm really disappointed in this book. I should have read the other reviews before I bought it. If you aren't doing your thesis on Weimar Germany, this book is not for you. It is not a good introduction to this period. It is filled with an amazingly large number of facts, but if you are looking for a primer on Germany between the world wars and the social policies that led to its own demise, this book is a bit hard to get that from, unless you are a historian, which I am not. Now, on to find a book that IS a good intro to this period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tough read...","review":"In my opinion, you have to be really in to this subject to enjoy this book.

And if you can't buy it, make sure you find a way to read it anyway. It is thin and expensive, but contains highly detailed technical information (techniques and pigments used). It is not at all richly illustrated either, but the small photos clearly demonstrate the concepts explained in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less Then Awesome","review":"I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie, as I am a big fan of the horror and suspence genre. But after seeing this movie I have to say it was a HUGE dissapointment.

The courtroom scenes were interesting but ridiculous, mostly because the filmmakers try to convince us by any means that this possession really happened. The exorcism sequence is scary (sort of) and thrilling yet too long in my opinion. Jennifer Carpenter does an okay job screaming and making idot funny faces, while Laura Linney's talent is once again waste in a movie that doesn't do her justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a terrible movie","review":"I'm no film critic, but this movie is so awful that I felt it necessary to write a review on how bad it is.

Not only was it boring, but they never showed what happened to her the night she died, they completely skipped over it. Not sure why it was unrated either, nothing in the movie was gory, no cursing, still can't figure it out. Yes it was a little creepy in certain parts; few and far between, but nothing that would make it \\"unrated\\". I think that the people that put the movie out on video thought that by calling it unrated that more people would be curious, like my self and my husband were. to be honest we laughed at a lot of the scenes when \\"Emily\\" was possessed.

Great scary scenes and I love court room drama. The thing that left me confused is why exactly the priest was on trial. I don't think that was fully explained. They were holding him responsible for Emily's death but wasn't it her family that put him in charge? He didn't ask for that position. And then he used his faith based methods to try and help her (DUH! He's a PRIEST!) and then they wanted to throw him in prison when it didn't work. That didn't make sense to me.I was very let down by the DVD extras. I really wanted to learn more about what REALLY happened. I know everything they showed happening to Emily was totally made up for the sake of the movie but how much of the trial was reality based? It left me frustrated that it didn't answer those questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say...","review":"Not being a fan of horror genre movies, I was skeptical of watching this movie. To my surprise this film turned out to be very good. Be warned, those of you that are looking for slasher, blood and guts kind of movie...this is not one for you. This movie deals with the trial of the actual case from the 1970's, there are some scenes detailing the exorcism, but this is does not overshadow the movie in anyway. I found this movie to be very interesting and I was engrossed in the story itself. Very good film, well executed, good direction. A movie that really should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional and rare movie - an intelligent horror","review":"Unlike formulaic horror movies such as Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer and all their hundreds of sequels, this movie both scares you and makes you think.First and foremost it's a movie of ideas but that also uses visceral effects to make you squirm. And that's the scariest combination of all.When all we're usually fed is a brainless diet of horror movies where you're never unnerved, simply bored, this movie should be cherished.It's a very imaginative mixing of genres (horror and courtroom). The clash between the scientific evidence and the beliefs of the church dramatized well and intelligently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly Scary","review":"This movie was really shocking. While I was watching it in the theatre I had my hand over my mouth the entire time and several times I wanted to get up and leave. What makes this movie scary is the fact that it deals with the devil which is something that many of us beieve exists and it can't get any more 'in your face' than having a demon in you. You definetly want to see this but honestly, I wouldn't watch it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, pity the rest is a mess","review":"The basic concept and structure of \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is sound -- a murder trial for an exorcist, intercut with flashbacks letting the audience see the events first-hand -- but they're buried under a mess of a movie.Strangely, this slapdash movie feels like the sort of original movie aired on Lifetime. If, you know, Lifetime aired stories about demonic possession.In this case, the terrible dialogue, written by someone I can only assume has never actually spoken to an actual person before, almost totally distracts from the wooden acting. What sort of drugs were given to a cast that includes some fairly dependable actors to turn them into listless zombies, I can't guess.Absolutely skippable, especially if, like me, you think the premise and structure sound really intriguing. The reality of the final film just proves all the more frustrating, in that case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waaay Creepy!","review":"This is a great movie that will give you the creeps and keep you on the edge of your seat. I usually like those movies that aren't all hyped up and this was one of them.This freaked me out more than the original Exorcist and I never thought another movie would. It doesn't steal any ideas from the Exorcist and has a pretty good ending, I thought. If you like horror movies that are more true to life and not the typical slasher movie, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"Movies that state that they are based on true stories always intrigue me. Especially when their subjects are similar to that of The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Being Christian, I believe in God, the Devil, spirits and demons, etc. I believe it is possible for people to become possessed by demons.That said, I'll continue on with my review of this movie. I'm not familiar with the true story on which this movie is based, so I don't know what of the movie is fact and what of the movie has been exaggerated in typical Hollywood style. Regardless of this, I found the whole movie to be very believable and when I'm able, I plan to do some research to find out just what the facts are surround this case.If you have an open mind about things such as this, you should see the movie. It's not a movie that keeps you guessing, as everything is revealed exactly when it should be. There are moments when I got the tingles, but that's probably only because I believe in the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Based on a true story...","review":"I'll start by saying that this is one of the best movies to come out on DVD in some time. The reviews here give enough detail, however, the most important point to make is that this is based on a true story. It is not really a horror movie in the true sense, although there are some very frightening moments. It is a movie that will make you think. If you want a horror movie full of special effects that will make you sleep with the light on for days...this is not it. If you want something unique and intellectual that will make you ask \\"what if?\\", then you will enjoy this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Scary!","review":"It is d*mn near impossible to scare me, but this movie temporarily crossed the threshold! A deep inside look into the spiritual realm! Laura Linney was great. A very funny part when the camera shot an eyesview of the priest running down the steps to get outside of his house! i'm smiling as i type this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Exorcist is nothing.....","review":"I was born and raised Catholic so to say I believe in what this movie is about is an understatement. The first time I saw The Exorcist was in the theater when it was rereleased, and I laughed, at almost the whole movie except for the part with the crucifix, which I still think is uncalled for. But Emily Rose, oh no there was no laughing. This movie scares the crap out of me. I have seen it twice and it still scares me, especially the climax in the barn, don't worry I won't spoil it. Enjoy, this movie is scarey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily one of the years best films.","review":"This is a great film from start to finish. But be warned it's not a blood and guts splatter film, so if that's what you're looking for, don't bother watching it. On the other hand, if you're looking for an entertaining, intelligent, suspenseful and at times down right spooky movie, then I can't recommend this one enough. As I said in my title, it's one of the best movies of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your grandmothers movie!!!!","review":"The Exorcism Of Emily Rose is, in my opinion, a very excellent film!

I felt for Emily, although I would of liked more background on her, her family and her relationship with Father Moore. Yes, most of the movie is in a courtroom, which I thought was an interesting way to tell the story. The movie didn't use the old 'pea soup' and 'head spinning' routine. There were several times where the hair on my arms stood up. I did have a problem with the previews which did make it out to be a 'horror' movie, but I did my homework before watching it and searched the web to find out what the movie was about, so I knew what to expect. Overall, I enjoyed it and it did it's job: It made me think."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased on a true story","review":"Perhaps there is some truth hidden here among the lies. This movie is a prime example of revisionist history; it trivializes the hard facts of the case and imposes a strong bias in favor of the supernatural. Throughout the film, the priest explains that his only wish is for Emily's story to be told; too bad the filmmakers didn't share his conviction. The real Emily Rose, a young Bavarian woman named Anneliese Michel, was subjected to 67 exorcism rituals over a period several months! She eventually starved to death, under the care of her parents and priests who were subsequently found guilty of negligent homicide. SeeRequiemfor a more objective dramatization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking horror/court room procedural hybrid","review":"The Exorcism of Emily Rose evokes the best of a psychological horror movie in the format of a court room drama. At war are two sides of America (though the events on which this tragic story is very loosely based occurred in Germany) - The fundamentalist Christian America sincerely believes in demon possession as described in the Bible, versus the scientifically minded America that looks to natural explanations for mental disorders. Beyond that this is a great story with excellent acting and spooky cinematography without resorting to shock and gore. Highly recommended as long as you aren't expecting another Exorcist sequel.In a way, this is a very scary movie, though not in the same way as the Exorcist or a slash film.(It's interesting to notice that different reviewers do not agree on whether the movie favors the scientific interpretation of events or the spiritual interpretation. I believe the film makers have left it up to the viewer.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware The 'Devil's Hour'","review":"This is a very special movie, probably the first film ever to deal honestly with the subject of demonic possession from a purely Christian perspective without all the usual special effects. Based on a true 20th century account, 'The Exorcism of Emily Rose' chronicles the unfortunate tale of a young college girl who had the misfortune of being too sensitive and caring. Traits that apparently attract spiritual evil and can leave one vulnerable and susceptible to demonic attack and ultimately possession.Are demons real and can one become possessed by the spirits of evil? The makers of this film think so. So do I.Excellent performances by Laura Linney, Scott Campbell and of course Jennifer Carpenter as Emily Rose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't watch this at 3.00 a.m.","review":"This is an unusual mix of courtroom drama and old-school horror. As the former it's reasonably, though not notably, successful, but where this film does score is in its depiction of the torment and fear suffered by the eponymous teenage girl who believes herself possessed by demons. This is a movie that provides shudders through the things glimpsed in the dark rather than those that leap out at you dripping gore. Creeping dread is created with little more than suggestion, and, although the exorcism itself is dealt with more explicitly, this is where the film is at its most effective.However much of this is faithful to the real story (which involved a poor Bavarian girl), and whether you side with the scientific or the spiritual explanation of these tragic events, this still a gripping story that is let down only by poor pacing and structure. It deserves four stars, however, for the way it handles the fear of the unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"not really what i was expecting for an exorcism movie. still a good movie out of that context, but i wasnt to happy watchin it expecting something gruesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addresses what many numismatic works don't","review":"This volume is the only one I have come across to satisfactorily treat the question of economic context and actual usage patterns of Roman coins.

The speakers came in a nice box and included wires, grills, and hardware to install them. I did not like the grills but I was not going to use them. The speakers are heavy and have a huge tweeter that has it's own crossover. The speakers looked quality built and were impresive. I am running the speakers off a MPR-F240 Alpine amp. The amp is clean but does not put out a lot of power, about 25 true RMS in my opinion. The speakers suond amazing. They put out some nice mids, heavy lows if you want that and the highs need to be toned down on the head unit because they are so loud. I thouhgt I was going to have to install a set of tweeters but you do not need them with these speakers. I think you can get a little more out of the speakers but pushing a little more RMS. I wouldn't recomend more than 50 true RMS per channel. On a budget or not, you can't go wrong with these speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought out plan of murder by amateurs","review":"This book took me a while to get into it.

This beauty and brains set out to murder her sister's husband at no cost and manipulated everyone she came in contact with along the way. My only puzzle is that \\"Kim\\" the wife of Buzz Clinton was a huge part of the book and then disappeared in the writings once the trial got underway.

I have gotten all the cups but can't master 2 of the tests for the last license. In Mario Kart, it didn't take me long to get the special cup in the 50cc category using either Peach or Toad. I spent a lot more time playing Krazy Racers than I did Mario Kart. Both have good graphics and good control."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game TOTALLY ROCKS!!!!!!!!","review":"I got this game 4 Xmas 2003, and it is still one of my all-time favorites. There is a good variety of charachters and an extremely wide range of tracks and circuit races to choose from. Plus, if you beat all of the circuits, you get to play the tracks from SNES. (In my opinion, these games aren't as good as the ones on GBA).The multiplayer is REALLY cool. The best part on the multiplayer feature on this is BATTLE MODE. This part is where you have 3 balloons and if they are all popped by your opponent, you lose. I did find time trials on this game to be a little tough. Nintendo did a really good job with transferring this game from the SNES to the GBA. I'm sorta dissapointed, though, because the tracks lack hills and other geographic factors that are on the N64 version.This game is well worth the price and is perfect for a car, bus, or long plane ride.

But sadly, to every great thing there is a down side. It is so addicting that it is quickly beat. It only took me personaly about 3 days.

I was thrilled to learn that it was available on Gameboy Advance.The game has great grahics with beautiful color. The boards are better than the old system, but more difficult too. Of course without a challenge, we would probably soon be bored with it. I think it is interesting how your completion of a cup (e.g. Flower Cup) is rated to show how well you completed it (e.g. E, D). This adds an extra challenge to return to the cups you've already beaten to finish them even better.With a small portable system like Gameboy Advance I can carry it around everywhere.The only drawback for ME is that I loved the battle mode on the old system and of course with this one you have to have someone else with a GBA and a gamelink to play it.Overall, it's a great game to play and a great stress reliever."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

The problem is that the mic has knobs on it, and nobody at MXL thought about that when designing a shockmount that blocks access to the knobs. So, you end up having to have the mic barely being held at one end. I worry that it might fall out one day.That's what I get for buying their best usb mic, I guess..."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this","review":"This is such a risky mic mount to use and I'll tell you why.The way this works is you put your mic into it and force it in so it grabs it. It's just by force and nothing holds it in.Eventually one day your mic will slip out of it because that's the law of gravity. Your mic will break or be messed up.There is nothing to secure your mic into it to keep it from slipping or falling out one day.I have my mic in it now and I'm actually scared that it could drop any minute. It's not that tightly in there and if anything it gets loser ever second.This mount reminds me of a car GPS mount for the front window, eventually the mount always falls no matter what if you leave it on long enough.Do you want your mic falling one day? Is that a feeling you want to have? Don't chance it! Stay away from this!This is fairly cheaply made and insanely overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manfrotto 394","review":"Hard to unlease.

Turns out, we were doing it right but the release mechanism is so difficult to move that I finally had to tap it with a hammer to get it to work. At this point, I just thought it needed some break-in time so I kept it with that hope. 1 year later, although I don't need a hammer, I still have to exert such force that a small slip could cause injury.

Like others, I lament the old days when we had good strong characterization and plots that not only made sense but hung together. I'm afraid this book isn't one of them. It isn't the worst in the series, but sadly it is lacking. The basic plot is Ok, but wouldn't Kristy look over the cliff and see Ryan? Without this major error there is no reason for the plot. Also \\"the little ones\\" what the heck is that about? Some psychic rats who heal Ryan for no apparent reason? A little Deux de machina, if you ask me--the sure sign of the author not knowing how to get himself out of a hole he put himself into. It would have been a more interesting book to watch Ryan deal with his fate by himself. The other companions are presented fairly well, but the characterization of Ryan and THE STUPID LINES given to him in dialog is painful to read.

I would suggest that listeners stick to the original catalogs of both Beck and the participating guitarists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solos Phoned In","review":"Jeff Beck deserves more credit for his work as an instrumental rock-fusion guitarist than the recordings on this album suggest. While the performances of both the rhythm section and featured soloists are technically superb, a review of the liner notes reveals that the basic tracks were recorded at a single location, with each of the soloists recording their part at a different studio, presumably to make the project more feasible from a logistic perspective. However, what this results in is a lack of energy and interaction between the soloist and rhythm section, and ends up sounding like a who's who of guitar performing with \\"music minus one\\" backing tracks.

While still having Peckinpah's caricature style of sideline characters, which is engaging, this cut is terrific in giving what I imagine is a more in depth unvarnished look at the turn of the century rural West. While in real life most accounts depict Billy the Kid as unequivocally evil, this film takes license and uses him as a set up for the moral ambivilance of conflict---class, race, wealth, old vs. new.

The ugly little sociopath is transformed into a good-looking likable Robin Hood. Penkinpah's version will not change the trend by casting Kris Kristofferson as Billy. James Coburn as Sheriff Pat Garrett is the star of this film producing his best acting as a man trapped but determined to get ahead.Penkinpah always had good casting and this film is no exception. Each actor is right for his role and always believable. This is the fully restored version of the film the way we were to see it not the edited fit into a time format that the Studio released. All of his films are better restored on DVD, the way he planned them, this is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, violent, western/Greek tragedy.","review":"This beautiful, sad film is quintissential Peckinpah, and for my money is better than even WILD BUNCH (which is generally regarded as Peckinpah's masterpiece). Once an outlaw, Pat Garrett (James Coburn) is now a bought-and-paid for lawman assigned to hunt down and kill his former cohort Billy the Kid (Krisstoffersen). Though he eventually succeeds, Garrett ironically sews the seeds of his own destruction, while ensuring that The Kid's name will live on forever. The fascinating, horrifying slow-motion violence and operatic pace that made Peckinpah a legend are here in spades, along with a great supporting cast and haunting score by Bob Dylan.

And I was right -- there are a lot of exact repeats, plus a lot of repeats with chocolate or cocoa added (or using a chocolate cake mix instead of the original yellow, white, spice, etc). In some instances the recipes don't sound very appetizing -- I mean, Chocolate Pumpkin Cake? Chocolate Spice Cake?For me, there are more than enough chocolate recipes in the first book. Frankly, I wish she would do a lower-fat book. But probably the cakes would taste even more like cake mix if they weren't loaded up with extra butter, chocolate, sour cream, etc.However, I did try the \\"Darn Good Chocolate Cake\\" with low-fat sour cream and no chocolate chips, and it still turned out very well. (I did use the full amount of eggs and oil.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the First Book","review":"I agree with the reviewers who said not to bother getting this book if you have the first one. I was really looking forward to this book and it was a real let-down. The best recipe in this book, darn good chocolate cake (excellent, by the way), is available in the first book. I get the feeling the author was desperate to try to create enough recipes to fill this book, and it shows. Like another reviewer pointed out, the combinations are odd and often very unappetizing. Why on earth would she include not one, but TWO versions of chocolate lime cheesecake and not even one basic chocolate or chocolate chip cheesecake recipe? I can't comprehend that one. Stick to the first book, which is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Tripod Head","review":"I knew what I wanted, so I went looking through all tripod heads I could find. The Bogen - Manfrotto 3275 / 410 Compact Geared Head fit my needs perfectly. The quick release made attaching and detaching a snap. The adjustment knobs worked very intuitively. Gross movements with a quick twist of one of three release levers. Very fine tuned adjustments with one of three knobs positioned next to the levers. And a bubble level. And black. And very sturdy. And machined well. And there's a matching black Bogen - Manfrotto tripod available for under $200 to go with it. Perfect, and I don't often say that."},{"rating":"2","title":"near perfect!","review":"I've been exceedingly pleased with this geared head. I shoot architecture professionally and these things are a must. This head is simply wonderful to use with either liveview (canon) or a tethered lcd monitor. I find I use it in perfect harmony with my tilt shift lenses...tweaking the head, then the lens and then the head again; it is precise and very stable. My only gripe, and it is a real one is that the darn thing cannot be set to look upward, even beyond likely a 30 degree angle without the lower knob hitting the base body. This has been VERY annoying on a number of jobs where non-paralax corrected shots were needed. I LOVE this head but I've had to bring an extra (non-geared) head along on shoots just incase I need to look up. This is clearly a design error. I've not tried the spendier version. Regardless, I would buy this again and again if needed - for conventional use it is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"amen to M.F. from Heaven's review.","review":"It must be hard to name your album Rock and Roll, it's too brash a statement with the potential for promising way more than average bands can handle. Not a problem for the Cynics. This masterpiece is the very Definition of Rock and Roll. This is hands down their best album, when I got this one home on vinyl I was SHAKING. Play side 2 (er, tracks 8 through 14) first,the CD plays like a garage band opera with MUCH more impact if you start with \\"Baby What's Wrong\\", put \\"The Room\\" in the middle, kick the tension back up with \\"You Got The Love\\" and let your whole world come crashing down in the dynamics of \\"Cry, Cry, Cry\\", which features the most blood-curdling rock scream EVER. Do not attempt to debate this with me, I will not be moved!

Incredibly tight playing, murderous sound, 14 intoxicating tunes and Michael's banshee wail make this record my favorite punk album of all times. This is the piece of recording that any garage, punk or trash band has to live up to, whether it existed during the sixties or hasn't been borne yet. This music will lift you way high when you're down and throw you into fits when it's time to party, and its effects are as wonderful as those of your drug of choice, illegal or not. Needless to say, the Cynics, like so many other great unknowns, such us the Scientists or the Original Sins, broke apart before they could inoculate the masses with their virulent and contagious brand of garage punk."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Encouraging!","review":"Jan's Book, More of Him, Less of Me, is for real people who are going through the trials of losing weight.

What I don't like about this game is that 90% of it is pure luck. This is okay on regular board games, but not on gamecube ones. I've also never encountered a game that makes me sooo mad (so mad that I considered breaking the disc more than once)! I think this is because there is no way to disperse your anger. For example, if another player hurts you bad, you can't walk up to them and smack them in the face. You have to wait for the too simple minigames. The orbs are cheap; some take you directly to the star. The computer puts the star in front of one player the whole time. The list of cons is endless. I would never reccomend this game. For multiplayer fun on the gamecube, try Super Smash Bros.

Unlike THE SUM OF ALL FEARS it has the same style as the movie. The graphics, the light, the enemies, the dialogues, even the music( though it is not from the movie) will remind you that awesome film!And after the 23 levels are over, the fun isn't over! You have a lot of things to unlock( if you want to). I have finished this game once, and I have only unlocked half of those. Reminds SPIDER-MAN: THE MOVIE, huh? Only this is more difficult.So, even you hated the movie( I can't see how could anyone hate this movie, but anyway...), you'll enjoy it. What? You don't have it? Run like the wind right now, and buy it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whay were they thinking?","review":"The Daredevil movie was good, but this game has little to do with it (other than the picture on the box). Forget the storyline, or the repetitive gameplay, or the boss battles, and even the radar sense...where's the save function on here? There is none! That's right! Instead of being able to save your game, you have to write down the \\"passcode\\" they give you to get you back to your place in the game. Not since the wonderful days of the SNES have we resulted to such an idiotic method of saving games! And don't tell me the capability isn't there, because they have it in virtually every other GBA game out there. The sound effects are fine, the graphics are pretty good, and the response is ok. If you're just a huge fan of DD, grab a pen and paper to remember your save code and go for it. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have just stayed with making the movie.","review":"About the only thing the DD GBA game has going for it is the fact that it doesn't star Ben Afleck (and in a game this bad it's a good thing). The Man Without Fear deserves better than this brain-dead side-scroller that takes players on a listless jaunt throught Hell's Kitchen to beat up people using feeble martial arts and acrobatics. Yawn-inducingly generic level design and lousy graphics might have been forgivable had they implemented this neat little invetion called COLLISION DETECTION that games use today, although using DD's radar sense to detect hidden items and boss weaknesses is kind of cool. Still, see the movie before you play this [game] so you'll get some thrill out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE; Proves Daredevil Game SHOULD NOT be Made!!!","review":"Feeling like like making a mistake? Buy this game,then! Made its bad graphics,impossible passwords, and lack of fun will convince you what a mistake you made. Enjoy fighting crappy unpopular bosses like the Sewer King, the Hand ninja klan thing,Echo (easiest boss), and the first boss (harder than Kingpin)Elektra, who has suddenly, without any explanation, has sprung back to life.

I always enjoy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was just too \\"perfect\\"","review":"I am a Christian and thought I would give some romantic fiction a try. I was dissapointed to say the least. The story was not bad, although predictable but the characters were just not fleshed out..not real. Everyone and everything was so cookie cutter perfect like the old sictoms from the 50's. Maybe in the world I came from I just could not relate. We as christians are flesh and bone with goodness and with FLAWS. I must say in Wick's defense I usually do not like fiction novels and her sentimentality was sweet but lacked realism in the characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it.","review":"This is Lori Wick's worst book to date. The characters seem to be made of cardboard. There's a total lack of plot going on. They just prance around living their happy little lives. They have no flaws, they don't struggle with anything. They all love each other and get along perfectly all the time, even the children. They never get irritated, lose their tempers, struggle with tempation, or do anything that remotely resembles human weakness. The beginning was ok, but once the main hero became a Christian, I just couldn't stomach the perfect perfectness of it all. In addition to this, I think Lori Wick must have a desire to be a preacher. Every single Sunday she wrote out the entire church sermon. The characters would then go on for pages having perfectly sound theological discussions about it. If I wanted to read theology, I would get a theology book. If I wanted to read a nice light Christian romance, I would get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort","review":"I have read and own several Lori Wick books. I quite like \\"Pretense\\" which I have read and recommended several times. I love gardens and England so I've been anxious to start this series, which I luckily checked out from the library. This book was just bad. There was no character development. The 'Englishy' part was totally missing, I felt more like it was all happening in Vermont than in England, no local slang, no period accents. It was totally predictable. I've never written a bad review on amazon before, as I love to encourage authors and readers, but I was compelled to share today. No conflict. The scenes of horses involve no horse knowledge. The scenes of gardening involve no garden knowlege. Hardly any dialogue except arranging elaborate meetings and parties, that require no effort. I will not read any more in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lori Wick isn't Jane Austen","review":"Unfortunately for Lori Wick, her latest effort seems too much like a Jane Austen knockoff than a real Lori Wick novel. Everything from plot lines, places to charachter names is taken from an Austen novel. Reading \\"The Propsal\\" was like reading a modernised comgination of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and sorry to say, Ms. Wick did not do either of them justice.The charachters are unbelieveable...enough of cliched children! The plot is predictable. I must say, a dissapointing effort from Lori Wick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay--but not great","review":"I really love Lori Wick's books and was expecting much more than this book gave.

I'm ordering book 3 now."},{"rating":"1","title":"45 pages and that was enough for me!","review":"Ughhh.. I couldn't believe this book. Supposedly it was set in the 1800's england, but if you didn't know that, you could easily assume that it was set in modern day America. Nothing in the book makes it uniquely English. The reading level is elementry at best. Don't even bother buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mix of Jane Austen","review":"This is the second Lori Wick book I have read. I loved the first! This book was somewhat a disappointment because I felt like characters and situations were ripped right from the pages of Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice...The relationship between Marianne and Jennings mirrowed Darcy and Elizabeth...Marianne even twists her ankle (and thus meets Jennings). Jennings is a mix of Darcy and Edward Ferris, while Marianne is Elizabeth and Jane rolled into one. Lori Wick even used names straight from Jane Austen!Other than these similarities, I liked this book. It was slow at first, but soon picked up. I agree that the romance was rushed, but I don't think that it was the point of the story. I think Jennings conversion was the point...and this led to a romance.If you like Lori Wick you will like this too. It is a light and easy read and leaves you satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"After reading a few of the reviews for this book I was hesitant to pick it up, but in the end I'm glad I did. It wasn't as good as the rest of the series but I enjoyed it.Jennings has \\"inherited\\" three children and isn't quite sure how to handle it and has some trouble getting started. He decides that a trip to his estranged sister's home is in order.There he meets a woman who he thinks will be a wonderful mother for his children and tells her so, but Marianne won't consent to a marriage of convenience. When Jennings actually does fall for her, she won't believe his proposal genuine, so he sets out to prove her wrong.You can see Jennings slowly growing in his faith through-out the book, not one of her best, but still very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT her best!","review":"I enjoy Lori Wick books but not this one. There was no part of the story that was interesting. And kids cannot be that good!I expected more from a Lori Wick book."},{"rating":"1","title":"could not finish","review":"I have only read this one of Lori Wick's books, but I must say I will never read another. I was horrified by the lack of originality. I never read the end of a book before I've read the whole thing, but in this case I already knew what was going to happen. The dialogue was weak, and in some cases painful to read. Ms. Wick also seemed to take all her character's names from Jane Austen. Having read many Austen novels, this greatly annoyed me. Maybe I've stumbled on an exception to her normally excellent writing, but I was wholly disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Lori's Best...","review":"I do have to admit that this is certainly not my favorite series at all! Lori Wick does a good job of creating a small, close, and loving community within all of her books. But, recently I must admit that Lori Wick's book are not believable. They contain characters who are flawless and seem to all be Christian. But, this book is my least favorite of all of Lori's books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Life Application of Grace","review":"Lori Wick has a gift for weaving God's grace in her writing through examples of real people facing real issues.

Thank you Lori Wick for being used of God!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Despite some of the reviews I read, I decided to give it a try and I found it very good. From the beginning you slowly see the changes coming over Jennings as he deals with becoming a parent of three. I enjoyed watching Jennings find his faith and trying to show Marianne his love was genuine.Lori Wick must be a hopeless romantic, as am I, and I truely enjoy reading these romances. I can read them over and over again and never tire of them. I only hope she keeps delighting me as I keep exploring her collections."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Having read all of Lori Wick's books and looking for something new, I was extremely excited when I picked up a copy of \\"The Proposal.\\" However, this book was a total disappointment.

(Kind of reminds me of misterrockobscurity - a no-talent nutburger who assassinates with a computer keyboard rather than a gun.)

It was also a strategically placed ALF doll before he switched over to using the plunger. Hector, the drummer, wore a Yosemite Sam \\"Back Off\\" mud flap. Stinky was the most clothed, Western style, with the back cut out of the pants, and a raccoon tail hanging down the back.Their shows were VERY high energy. They were hard workin' and havin' a blast, and the crowds always went completely bananas for them. Inhibitions dropped around them like pears in a hurricane.

In Vol 7, we learn of the origins of NERV, the truth about Rei(finally), more insight on both Shinji's and Ritsuko's mother and more on the Human Instrmentality Project.

This toy is not educational, it does not even conform to the Shadow Cat's actual specifications, but it does teach building and motor skills. This toy is surprisingly durable, but not when dropped, slammed or banged against something. Also, the paper 'cockpit' and vents fall off or become displaced if the torso is moved or pressed. This was my first Knex model, and I built it in two sittings, before and after dinner. It's fun for the whole family, but it is a little off balance and the pieces are not quite symmetrical.

I have very dry skin and long curly hair so I don't wash it every day with shampoo, just rinse it, condition, and gently smooth on the oil after squeezing the water out of my hair with a towel. For skin, I spray on my hands and press into my face, shoulders and neck. Smells so so so good. Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luxury at an affordable price","review":"I bought this product recently and I'm in love with it.

Bank's is a scholar. You will find in this book a man who loves God, loves people, and teaches the truth of Scripture clearly. If you have read books on house churches and have walked away with a bit of skepticism (as I have at times) than buy this book and you will find that Bank's is truly a brother in Christ who only desires to be like Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all actors, apiring or working!","review":"This is an excellent book!!

I only did the toning portion. I felt silly doing the dance portion and I really don't care for the music. Other than that, I recommend this video for toning. I have also tried \\"Optimizer\\" and \\"Strength and Grace\\" which are also very good and there is no dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"As an intermediate exerciser, there is no workout here!

I was so bored I couldn't wait for it to be over the first time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Cardio Segment","review":"The first 30 minutes is a salsa inspired cardio segment that was choreographed so poorly that I was actually embarrassed to see myself do it! There is way too much hip swinging and general grooving for a rhythm challenged exerciser like myself. I like my moves a little more athletic, and preferably ones that actually will break me out in a sweat!!The toning segment, on the other hand, was interesting and a little more challenging. If you do a different cardio tape, then switch to the toning segment on this one, you would be a lot better off. It's a good thing I really don't have anything I need to get in shape for in 6 weeks, or using this dvd I would be doomed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DANCEY - mambo, chacha","review":"I have Minna's Optimizer Blend, and I love it! So I bought this one thinking it would be as good. Its AWFUL! You need to know how to do the Mambo and Chacha, there's poor camera coverage, and no instruction on how to do these dances... I HATED IT! It went about 90mph too so I couldn't pick up the moves AT ALL! Try Minna's Blend, but FORGET THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minna does it again...","review":"Minna includes a program to follow in this workout along with the days that you should do only the cardio, only the toning, or both. This is a really fun workout and I even find myself doing them from time to time (at work, etc.). Definitely a keeper! I combine this with some of Minna's other workouts, weight training, and more for a well rounded exercise regime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"Minna proves again that she knows how to put together a great workout! It's really nice because it combines cardio and fitness exercises that you can alternate through the week. The cardio dance moves take a little learning and practice, but definatly burns calories. There's also extra info on the dvd about nutrition, etc.And it arrived quickly in the mail!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Salsa or Exercise?","review":"I didn't buy this video with the intention of learning the salsa, I got it to excercise!!! I love Minna's other videos, but this one is too much dancing and not enough of just exercising. I have been doing aerobics for years and I had a hard time with this one!!! They should call it a dance video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toning workout is a keeper","review":"Buy this DVD for the toning workout. The cardio portion is okay, but you will need to do it on a bare floor, since there is a lot of pivoting and turning around with all the dancing, which is not difficult, but unsafe to do on carpet. Lessig is very good about cueing and reminding you of proper form.The toning workout is one you can use for a while, starting with lower weights and increasing as you go. Plenty of variety in the exercises to keep you from getting bored, but long enough to feel like you're getting some kind of a workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this video as something to throw in with my regular routine so I wouldn't get stuck in a plateau from not enough variation. Unfortunately, the routines were confusing and difficult to follow. It also consisted of a lot of standing in one place and shimmying your body as opposed to really getting a workout by moving. I was very disappointed, especially after reading all the other great reviews. 10 minutes into the workout I turned it off because my heart rate wasn't what I wanted for a cardio workout. I would not suggest this as a good workout even for a beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency Workout works...","review":"This video is between easy and somewhat moderate activity level. I noticed a change in the shape of my body after a week-- three times a week works well, and they split it up into one half hour for cardio and one half hour for toning. I reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Minna-Emerggency Workout","review":"I think that this a tape that focuses on the two most essential elements of physical fitness: cardio and strength training. Minna really does a great job of making sure that you are incorporating both of these elements into a well-ballanced fitness program."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper","review":"I recently purchased this video, because I have her Strength & Grace and Fat Eliminator. I did it for the first time yesterday and really enjoyed it. It's not very difficult, but is perfect for the days I want some cardio and light toning (not a 'killer' workout). I usually use heavier weights, and probably will the next time, but I did feel that I got in a satisfactory workout. The ab section was very weak, I would have liked something longer and more intense, but all-in-all, I found it a fun video and the time flew by. Minna is a very good instructor, easy to follow and not at all what I had expected (cheerleader type)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful workout!","review":"I was looking for something to get me excited about working out. (I fell into a slump of no working out after abdominal surgery). This was just what I needed. I find myself doing the tape sometimes twice a day b/c the cardio is almost like mini dance routines. Very Fun!Minna is fun to watch and easy to understand. I don't feel like I am trying to \\"keep up\\" with her. If I do miss a step the workout is easy enough to jump right back in. I really like the toning part of the tape b/c I have never been into lifting weights, but I noticed results(especially upper body strength) after about 2 weeks of doing this tape, that was motivation enough for me.All the combinations flow really well with the music and help to keep me in step. It took about 2 weeks to get the tape down to where I was always in step, but it was fun learning. I will definatly buy another one of Minna's tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"makes you sweat","review":"I love this workout. It makes me sweat every time. You can also adjust your sweat level by amping up the moves or toning them down to a more dance style. Minna is easy to follow and she has a fun personality. I do this workout at least three times a week. There are 2 workouts on here and both are equally chanllenging. Do both in one session if you really want to sweat. This is currently my favorite along with my belly dance workouts. I highly recommend this dvd to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I bought the VHS tape of this one back in 2003 right at my 2nd pregnancy. I decided to try it after the baby. We'll I did and it's probably good for losing baby weight. However, if you are an avid workout individual, I would not suggest wasting your money. It took awhile getting used to the choregraphy (felt like I was in a video). The producers could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I generally like Minna's videos, and I looked forward to this. The dance moves are very very complicated, even for me, and I am advanced! The SALSA and the CHA CHA's are thrown in to an already too complicated video. I never even got to the second 30 minutes because I was so disappointed with the first half. Luckily, I bought it at another store and I can return it b/c I don't like it.

The verses are original, and some seem trivial in focus (Jesus loves me when I take a bath or eat my breakfast). But the original tune is addictive and this gives verses younger kids associate with more (versus the traditional song). Some nights my daughter brings this to me and wants it read.

Although they are good storage areas outside, improvement is needed by Suncast to better secure the lid on each box.

Wrong! Once I got it assembled I learned that the INSIDE of the box is only 17 x 19 x 37 inches. The box is really sturdy, though, because I was unable to disassemble it in order to return it. Suncast's customer service department confirms that once the box is assembled it's permanent. So I'm stuck with it. I'm sure I can find some use for the box but will have to store my chair cushions somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy assembly","review":"Quick to assemble; parts clearly marked; instructions easy to understand.Only drawback: bits of overhanging plastic (sometimes called \\"flash\\" or \\"flashing\\") left over from the manufacturing process were large enough to deform the hinges when the cover was snapped into place; we used scissors to trim the excess plastic, and the box now appears to work properly.After setting it on my deck, I realized that a storage box that one could also sit on might have been a better choice for me, but this deck box is very good for its intended use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Deck Storage","review":"This is quite a large and very attractive storage box for the price.

I loved the look of this deck box and the size was perfect. I wasn't so sure about the color--called taupe, I wasn't sure if it was going to be that sort of gray deck box that would only look good outside. It's actually a very nice tan brown. I could have lived with the color--but I had already bought a couple cans of Krylon spray paint--paint for plastic. I am thrilled with how it looks--just great. Someone who came over the other day told me they thought it was wood! Well, I wouldn't go that far, but it looks amazing, both before and after the painting. Definitely recommended. Perfect for the ton of toy that was taking over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great looking deck box","review":"My third purchase of this brand deck box. I use one for pool equipment, one for kids toys and one to store chair cushions. Before this purchase, all items were left outside or had to be carried to garage making a large mess at either place.

Whenever my cats kick litter out of their box, the deck box keeps it contained. My floors have never been less gritty. I just vacuum out the loose dry litter from the deck box, whenever I'm doing my regular scooping. It also helps to keep litter odor contained.Suncast should make a purpose-built litter box house! If they could lift it up off the floor, to make scooping easier on the lower back, they'd take the market by storm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed","review":"Hinge on one side of the lid failed after 3 weeks of use. Called the manufacturer (Suncast) for replacement lid, but was told they do not warranty deck boxes and a new lid would cost $40.The hinge is poorly designed (weak plastic) as it can't withstand the force of the gas pistons that keep the lid open. The replacement lid would have failed again without some kind of home remedy to fortify the hinge.Thank you to Amazon's excellent customer service for standing behind a product that even the manufacturer would not.I would not recommend purchase of the Suncast DB12000PB 127-gallon Deck Box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am disappointed with this product, but glad I didn't pay full price.

The \\"stay dry design\\" is partially true...the rain runs off the domed lid, however, the construction is not \\"air tight\\".

The box was easy to assemble and appears to lock together better Than my RubberMaid box. Cushions stay dry however the lid has blown open a couple of times. There is a finger hole for what appears to be for a latch or clip of some kind. It is beyond me how it is supposed to work however. I drilled a small hole in the lid above the finger hole and that should do the job. There is a piece of plastic web so there should be no water leaks. That should work better than the concrete block I was using. Dispute the latch mystery I prefer this box to the RubberMaid box but I don't regret either purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"50 Gallon Deck Box","review":"I am normally cautious about ordering online as far as size is concerned.

One year I stored the firewood on the back deck and for one reason or another it walked away. Last year I bought a truck load of it and stored it at my parents house right around the corner. I would fill the trunk of my car up and store it in the house by the back door. What a mess! I just remodeled my house and I am very picky with what stays inside and wood didn't make it. So instead I bought this item. It has the ability to be locked and to make sure the box doesn't walk off I also secured it to the deck. I am amazed at how much firewood it holds. I am thinking about getting another one for the outdoor toys to free up more room in the closet. This truly is a great buy! I also us it as a chair or table when cooking on the grill.

I highly recommend reading Bell's Men of Mathematics if you want to gain some insight into the great ideas of mathematics written by someone of a broad mind and sound judgement who happens to know how to write.

I now have a half-inch vertical slit on my top lip covered with a butterfly strip. It bled a lot. I still cannot figure out how to get to the O-ring to change it.

I have bought four of these units just to replace the reel assembly because it seems to be virtually impossible to get repair parts. Even though we do not use the hose that often because of the sprinkler system, the reel does not last much more than a year or so. At the time I bought these units, they were the only ones I could find that had at least a 200 foot capacity.Also, I have replaced the wheels and installed a metal axle because of the hose weight.This unit may be satisfactory if you use a lighter-weight or shorter rubber hose, but it definitely does not have the durability for 225 feet of rubber hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this item for god sake!","review":"I purchased this not too long ago.

The wheels are too small and the gauge of plastic for the overall cart is too thin to provide reasonable support for heavy hoses containing water.

The cart itself is ok but for some ungodly reason they use a cheap plastic elbow connection. Why not add a few dollars to the cost and use a brass connector. The instructions clearly state the need for caution when attaching a hose to this part. I was extremely careful and still could not get the hose attached without stripping the plastic threads. I was shocked to find this was an American made product and not some piece of crap from China. Needless to say I packed it up and returned it to the store where I purchased it.

My husband bought this hose reel which causes me to lose my pleasing personality everytime I use it. First of all, it wants to tip over at times as you pull out the hose. Secondly it is flimsy and you can actually rock it from side to side. The major complaint is when you are unreeling the hose, as you pull it, the hose will slip over the outside of the reel and become wedged between the outside of the reel and the stand. This happens constantly. The spacing could not have been made more perfect for this continual annoyance. Don't even get me started with reeling it in. Don't buy this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outtube not available at Suncast","review":"The outtube cracked on my Hosemobile HRC200 in the same place other reviewers mentioned.

I asked if there was any other option to repair the unit. She said NO! then abruptly said \\"GOODBYE\\" and hung up. Honestly, I had been upbeat with her during the entire (short) conversation.

Will the real version be released?","review":"Why is the second season released in full screen? The European version of Season One was released in the 16:9 wide version. Will there also be a release of the wide version of Season Two? Because I won't buy full screen. Full screen is the most idiotic idea: chop off both sides of the picture to make it fit on older TVs - less worth for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, addictive, character driven show","review":"A great, character driven show.

I think that Mandy Patinkin really makes the show. Somehow, his expressions and persona just fit the part that he plays. You really begin to believe that he is the person whom he is playing not just an actor playing the part. That to me is always the sign of a great actor. Mandy Patinkin makes the show and I am really sorry to hear that he will no longer be there. I'm not sure that it will be nearly as good sans Mandy. Too bad about Elle, she was the cutest one on the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fan, but at least someone else is","review":"I sporadically watched the first season like seven years ago, and never became a fan of the show.

The coating on this is quite nice, and the edges are rounded, just like in the picture. Yes, the metal is a bit flimsy, but effective for the task. I bought this as a wind guard for a camp stove, not a splatter guard. For a splatter guard, I actually prefer the screen lid types. My only complain is this is on the small side. I would have preferred the back piece be wider than the sides, but all 3 are the same. It unfortunately is too small too go around my stove, and believe it would be too small for larger fry pans as well. Double check your dimensions before ordering, otherwise you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great product.

Because it does not cover the pan, it does not require lifting each time to stir food while cooking, but still protects stove from splatter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a little help","review":"This product works reasonably well with my gas stove, although because it has to sit up on the burner grids, some spatters do go underneath. The real issue for me was its sharp edges, on which I cut myself right away. There is an easy fix - aluminum tape that I found in Home Depot in the ducting aisle. However, if you know someone who has some, see if you can pay for just what you need, as the whole roll is about $7.00, and I'll be surprised if I ever have a need for it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy construction","review":"This splatter guard is of flimsy construction.

Due to my kichen design the only place I could put the tv was next to the stove. I use this to contain the heat from cooking pots from damaging my tv & it works GREAT. I do find that it does prevent grease splatter as well. As far as the comments regarding it being \\"flimsy\\", I have found that if you treat it well (no dishwasher), dry it well before storing... it is more than adequate for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"Other than being a little flimsy, this does the job. It cleans up easily. A good deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rounded edge Design","review":"The product is exactly as described, now with a rounded edge so that it won't cut your fingers. The aluminum is pretty thin but the guard still can stand on the stove well. The only thing that I wished is that it can be slightly taller (like 11\\"-12\\") instead of 9\\" (that is stated in the spec - 10\\"x9\\", so, I knew before I decided to buy it, as it is still better than the aluminum foil type of Splatter guard)"},{"rating":"1","title":"S H A R P edges!

ZERO stars! Stay away from Suncast products.","review":"I bought this item to replace a broken Suncast hose real (one that rests on the ground .... I thought I would upgrade to the wall mount model).Everything mounted and installed fine. But after 3 months of light and infrequent use (maybe used it 8 times?), the sides warped outwards causing the reel to disconnect and drop down. Instead of being connected at both sides and sitting horizontal, the reel is now connected at only one end and hangs at a 45 degree angle. There's no way to fix it. (I posted a customer photo .... look right below the manufacturer's photo for the link. See for yourself.)Suncast ripped me off by selling cheap junk that promptly breaks under normal use. Lesson learned the hard way: don't by Suncast ANYTHING.ZERO STARS for this piece of crud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"Stay away from this one! It's of extremely poor quality and not very sturdy. The sides of the reel warped within 24 hours of exposure to the afternoon sun, and the hose guide split the first time I used the reel. One positive thing, though; the water supply tube doesn't leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"These hose reels don't appear to be very well made.

The hose guide has totally fallen apart and the guides simply fell out of the unit.

My current one is 4 years old and the water inlet tube just broke which is why I'm here checking the current price of new ones. If I was in a hurry I would go to Sears and pick one up for $30 but it seems they have a 5 year warranty so I went to the Suncast website and ordered a replacement part at no charge, not even for shipping. Most complaints are probably due to how the unit is assembled, mostly by snapping parts together without the need for hardware. Convenient design but not as sturdy as more expensive metal reels. I've anchored two short pieces of 2x4 studs to a brick wall and then mounted the unit to the studs which is why I keep buying this unit, my mounting points are already there and it would be a pain to install a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps keep the yard neater","review":"This hose reel does keep my large heavy duty hose off the ground.

After 6 months the rotating seal would pop out every time I turned on the water and then walked somewhere reeling out the hose and nozzle to sprinkle my plants. To not have the supply hose pop off and geyser water I had to first stretch out the hose to the location I wanted to water, then walk back and turn on the water faucet and then walk back to the nozzle and use it. A pain. The water pressure from the faucet isn't high at all. I tried screwing in the rotating seal plate, which kept it from blowing off, but then the entire hose reel would pop off the supply connector and squirt water everywhere.Conclusion: bad design, cheap plastic parts that warp and won't seal and operate under use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"This hose reel lasted about 1 month. After installing properly and attaching to a brick wall, the reel broke at the plastic holes where the bolts connect this product to the wall. Don't bother purchasing.

Not the sturdy quality of my other hose reel. AND - the directions must have been written by a jerk who never tried to execute them with a clear mind.

However, by page 63 I became turned off enough to say \\"enough\\" with her latest novel, Every Boy's Got One.By page 63, the e-mail format had worn thin, and the dialogue was just downright silly. Thirty-year old women conversing like they're a pair of 15-year olds is not attractive, nor realistic. And by page 63 Cabot has inserted two anti-America comments that did nothing for the plot or the dialogue. Very gauche for a successful author to bite the hand that feeds her.This novel may be appealing to the diehard Cabot fan, or the indiscriminate chick-lit fan. Better luck next time, Meg."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you are a die-hard Cabot fan, skip this book.","review":"I am an avid fan of Meg Cabot's books (both her adult books and her teen books) and I was not impressed with this latest edition. I've read both 'Boy Meets Girl' and 'The Boy Next Door' and enjoyed them alot so I was excited to read this book. I found the main character to be rather blah, and I did not like her love interest, Cal. I also found the ending to be abrupt and really unbelievable even in the fantasy-land of a make believe romance.Unless you are a major Meg Cabot fan I'd skip this book and re-read 'Boy Meets Girl' or 'Boy Next Door' as they are much better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not Cabot's Best","review":"Although I thoroughly enjoyed both The Boy Next Door and Boy Meets Girl, Every Boy's Got One just didn't cut it from me. I found the story exceedingly bland and I could not stand the character Jane. I couldn't see why Cabot put her in such a critical role in the book, when she was neither cordial, interesting, or, for that matter, all that educated. It got a little better in the end, but the ending was so unrealistic and not touching, I had to set the book down at once. I personally feel I cannot skip books in a series, but if you can, do yourself a favor and ignore Every Boy's Got One."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book -Angela","review":"Book was an easy read. Finished it in 2 days. Love the way she writes things with email basis. Predictable through out, but still love Meg Cabot."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I loved this book! It was funny and romantic. It was classic chick-lit about two people who hate each other and end up falling in love but it has a new twist to it. You know what's going to happen but it kept me very entertained along the way. It is a light read that flows easily. All in all a great book. Highly recommended! Next I'm going to read the Kitchen Witch by Annette Blair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you, Meg!","review":"This is a quick, fun read - a good beach book with some very funny moments. But - and it's a big but for me - every time Meg Cabot ventures into Italian, the book is littered with mistakes (at least in the UK edition. I'm assuming the US one is no better). The name of the airport in Rome is consistently referred to as \\"Fiumacino\\" (it should be Fiumicino) even on a boarding pass which is reproduced in the book. The menus are full of mistakes, she seems to be under the impression that the Italian for \\"No\\" is \\"Non\\" ... and so on. Doesn't it show a total lack of respect to her readers that she (and her publishers) couldn't even be bothered to get an Italian speaker to check this? Shame on you, Meg. The idea of reproducing menus and shop signs is fun - but there's a mistake in just about every one. You could have done a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had such high hopes.....sigh...","review":"I LOVE Meg Cabot's other books, especially the ones written in the email/journal style format. I was so excited to get this book to read on a long plane ride.UGH! It was all I could do to get through to the end. Although I found the male love interest funny, I really, really, detested the \\"heroine\\" of the book. The repeated references to her social ignorance and cat love seriously grated on my nerves. The romantic part of the plot was just beyond belief to me. I had promised a friend that I'd loan her the book when I was done, but now I've told her not to bother reading it.I did, however, enjoy the Afterword where Meg gave insights into how she came up with the story based on the paralells to her life and the story of her own elopment. That was truly the best part of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but not Cabot's Best...","review":"Like a few of the other reviewers, I found this to be less exciting and perhaps more predictable than Cabot's other 2 books of similar fashion: The Boy Next Door and Boy Meets Girl. I love the format of these novels; from the e-mails, to the menus the communication is so fun and very appropriate for the modern-day world we live in. But...while I liked this style, I can't say that I loved this book as much as the others. I think it did have to do with the plot being a little predictable. And it was funny, but definitely not as funny as her previous two. Something just seemed off; maybe it was because she was trying to force \\"real life\\" into fiction. I'm not quite sure. However, I'd still encourage fans of Cabot's work to read it and make their own decisions, because it was, as her books always are, a quick, light-hearted read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What does every boy have? You'll have to read to find out.","review":"This is just a cute story. I couldn't put it down. As is typical in a Meg Cabot story the whole thing takes place via, email, text messaging, pda journals, travel journals, website blogs etc, no direct conversations are actually had between any of the characters.Holly and Mark want to elope in Italy because their families are against their union, he's jewish she's catholic, so they bring their 2 best friends Jane and Cal to Italy to be their best man and maid of honor. This is the story of trying to get Holly and Mark to the altar. Cal's anti-marriage, and Jane just believes these 2 are meant to be, so what happens when the maid of honor and best man have to try to get along in order to make the wedding happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good...","review":"I enjoyed all of Meg Cabbots previous books, but this one was not as good as i excpected.

I would not reccommend this book, but stick with her other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Boy's Got One","review":"After a day of hiding the title of this book at school, I finished and I just have to say, the \\"Boy\\" books by Meg Cabot are entirely hilarious, and really fast reads, and if you like funny romance novels that you can very well finish in one or two sittings, go for this. It's not really \\"dirty\\" except for references, and it was so cute and the kind of thing that you would expect to read about. But that doesn't stop it from making my day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really!? Dreadful excuse","review":"As a fan of Meg Cabots work, I was sorely disappointed with this. The characterization was poor and so was the plot. Cal and Jane had the same way of writing and it drove me nuts. It was a chore to get through this book, and for some reason I was determined to finish. I can also guarantee that men don't talk the way that Cal does. If this is the height of chick lit- I'm out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"Every Boy's Got One was all around a pretty good read. It's absolutely worth the purchase price, at least, although it wasn't a perfect book. The relationship moved too quickly for me, and Cal wasn't all that likeable, however not to the point where it ruined the book. If you liked this one, you should read The Boy Next Door, which the best in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved this book","review":"i loved this book. actually i love the whole Boy Series by meg cabot! they get better everytime. i've been reading meg's work for a while (starting with the princess diaries & the All-American girl series too) but this is, because i'm older now, one of the funniest of the series. i like the format of all the series...but i especially like the Travel Diary vs PDA effect!!! lol. anyway, its a really good read for a really good series. meg cabot's an excellent writer anyway!

But in this one, the email format is grating on the nerves, and it's quite out of character for a man (Cal) to write so much in his supposed diary... really? Men think like that?? Hmm.. expected better from Meg Cabot.It is unbelievable that a cynic such as the character Cal can change his mind about \\"true love\\" based on some sloppy, childish acts by Jane.Not a book to buy, and even if you borrow it, not a book to read more than once (if you can get through the once that is!).

This book touches on the diversity of Japanese culture from pre-historic times to modern culture in Japan. This book gives an excellent overview of the culture and lifestyle of the typical, Japanese family. It covers tradition, ceremonies, and daily life. The pictures are entertaining, and the content is concise. Chapter headings are written in both English and Japanese.

The text is blah blah rah-rah America, than anything else. And since Handleman does not confine himself to WW I & II, but goes into the modern age, in which there is a lot of hyperbole and searching for some glorious instance in aerial combat. Unfortunately, that ended with World War II, and has not been translated to the modern era, since wars are not being fought by giant industrial powers whose existence is at stake. Although there is a long bio of R.G. Smith, there is only one of his works. Also, you will not find anything by Taylor, Trudigan, and Fellows. The redeeming features are the work of first tier artists Cohen, Dietz, and Kodera, and following them a bevy of tier 2 & 3 artists.

The book's format is clear, well-structured, fun and easy to move through. Each chapter includes concrete examples and exercises for practice.

Not only did it open up my mind to the possibilities of musical improv, but it explained the nuts and bolts of how to do it in a clear and simple way. This book has laid the foundations of how to approach musical improvisation, while igniting my passion for it!The CD is brilliant too, bringing to life the examples in the book and allowing you to put your skills into practice right away.If you're at all interested in musical improv, don't even question it: just buy it now!Jenny Wynter, Australia"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting Garbage","review":"Trying to watch the female actor in this mismash was unbearable.

To make matters worse, many of these people regularly assemble in a meeting hall to discuss the book at length - all the while exposing the children whose psychological health they ought to protect to a depiction of one of the most grotesque scenes of human suffering in all of literature - a crucifix.I would recommend this book only to *adults* who are interested in a more or less unabashed study of depravity, poorly imagined moral philosophy, and complete contempt for rational human beings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil.","review":"This book has caused more misery than all the wars ever.

It's a case of getting what you pay for I suppose.As far as customizing a 360 face plate, Decalgirl would be the way to go, with nice glossy vinyl coverings.

This is a waste of money - anything plastic is essentially junk. I have now replaced it with a full metal version from another maker that was about three times the price. It looks like it will work forever. Also, this reel BARELY is able to hold 100ft of 5/8\\" hose. It is probably more suited for 50 or 75ft.

You can't trust them to fill their order properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"The only positive thing I can say about this toy is that there was no messy stuffing to be spread all over the house and eaten. This toy was torn apart the first day. My dog tried to eat one of the legs she got free from the toy...yikes! I don't see why they give you replacement squeakers...this toy is torn up the first day and with all the holes your dog makes in the squirrel, the squeaker pouch won't stay in. All in all, don't bother with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy but sheds fur!","review":"My four-month-old Labrador Retriever simply loves this toy, but she manages to pull out (and sometimes swallow) tufts of fur from the squirrel's tail whenever she plays with it. I'm not sure if the culprit is poor manufacturing or the excessive zeal of a teething puppy! The toy washes extremely well in the washing machine, the velcro patch keeps the squeaker nicely concealed, and I especially like the fact that the toy came with four replacement squeakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The small version of this toy is about the size of a mouse.","review":"This toy has rav reviews, so I was all over. NOT! I received teeny tiny package in it a teeny tiny reddish thing on cardboard. No stuffing I could just feel the squeaker. Velcro, so your pup can take OUT the squeaker if they are clever enough. (Mine is). Now I have a 13lb playful pup, she makes up games with everything and cherishes her toys. I presented it to her and she just looked at me like WHAT IS THAT, MOM? That COULD NOT BE A TOY. Squeaking did not help it was limp and lifeless on the floor. I put the \\"xtra\\" squeaker in it to make it a little more interesting as there was not much too this tiny mouse size toy.... Don't get the buzz, waste of my hard earned cash!

So far, squeakers and body are holding up just fine, no rips, tears or wear on appendages. However, the eyes are now mysteriously gone. Not a huge deal, they seemed to have just fell off at some point in the past week or so, both of them. I'm sure due to slobber and not abuse as he only grabs the toy when he wants to go outside, not really a chew toy more just grab it and let us know it's time to go outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the better stuffed toys","review":"My black lab loves toys, especially stuffed ones that he can chew open. Most with a squeaker are chewed open in 5 - 10 minutes. This one lasted over 15 before I removed it myself. I like the fact that it has heavy velcro holding it closed so you can open it up remove the squeaker or put the inner lining back in. The fleece inner stuffing is a lot better than the polyfill that gets all over. He still loves the toy even though its pretty ragged. Its mostly in one piece. I wish it was even tougher but I haven't seen anything better."},{"rating":"2","title":"long-lasting squeaky toy for dogs","review":"There are several things I like about this toy:The KONG name = qualityReasonable priceThere are no plastic parts (eyes, nose) that can be pulled off and swallowedThe seams are double-stitchedThe toy has a velcro openingThe squeaker comes inside another fleece \\"pocket\\" with its own velcro openingThere is no stuffing that can be pulled out and make a messEach toy comes with an extra squeaker for when the original wears out!Note: Dogs should always be supervised with this type of toy;swallowing a squeaker can cause bowel blockage (that doesn't show up on an x-ray) and be fatal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hairy Mess","review":"Kong usually has great dog toys. This one does not make the grade. For over a week I was picking up squirrel hair fuzzies off the carpet, fishing it out of the dogs mouth, and generally annoyed with the mess it made everywhere.

The good thing is that there was a limited amount of stuffing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Months later, still going strong!!!","review":"When my corgi Sophie first got this toy, she went wild with it... months later it's still her favorite. She's tried to destuff a lot of her toys, but this one has baffled her, HAHAHAHA!!! Extremely well made. I love the way the squeakers go into separate plush and velcro-closed pouches. Sophie loves the three different textures -- plush, sheepy, and whatever the tail is. And of course the squeakers. Sophie loves faux sheepskin, squeakers, and she loves to shake and worry her toys. If your dog likes any one of these things, it'll like the toy a lot. If it likes two, this toy will be a huge hit. If, like Sophie, it's nuts for all three -- you'll have one very, very, very happy doggy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 10 minutes...","review":"My dog is an aggressive chewer. If you have a cute little destructive dog like mine this product will not last. Within 5 minutes she had the squeaker broken.

Perhaps there was some canning to get you through a long winter, but for the most part nature's schedule determined your diet. Only since the introduction of convenience and fast food in the last 50 or so years have our wastebands expanded beyond our genetics. More and more, we are plagued by depression, obesity, and fatigue. All of the preservatives and genetic altering of our foods to keep them on the shelf longer have only added to our \\"heaviness\\".

It takes place in different zoos in America. This is a nonfiction book but fun to read. Koko and Michel are playful gorillas that love to learn sign language. The gorillas have a hard time giving up their kitten after he died but it was an adventure getting new pets and moving. Koko is my favorite character because she loves to explore the world.Koko reminds me of my cousin because he bullies me when he becomes jealous. Michael reminds me of me because we both get bullied. My text-to-self connection is I got scared of moving, just like Koko.I like this book because I love gorillas. My favorite part is when Koko caught the frog. If I could change something I would change Koko's kitten dying.

If so, this movie is DEFINITELY NOT for you. That is a fact. I like escapist fiction, butvI also like films and literature filled with lush poetry, subtle verve, dreamy nostalgia, and serene visuals. This movie qualifies. No action. No slam, bang, pow. This movie instead focuses on the quiet aching that comes with unrequited love, haughty isolationism, passive acceptance and submission. The war, facism, the holocaust, all are covered to a degree without immersing themselves too deeply for the viewer to feel trapped. *sigh*All in all, this movie is very quiet. I have watched this movie dozens of times, and I have fallen asleep during this movie almost as many times as I watched it. In fact, this is a great cure for insomnia. Now that is not my way of saying it is boring and dead. It is my way of saying this movie is so quiet it will send you dreamily to sleep. *sigh*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is this so great?","review":"It is politically correct, perhaps, to call any work dealing with the Holocaust great just because it deals with the subject, maybe because one fears the charge of anti-Semitism. I suspect that's the major reason this film has built a reputation. But this is NOT a great film. Like many period pieces dealing with aristocrats, it's a stately bore. The plot and character development take forever to build any steam. Just when you begin to care about the characters -- the movie ends. Or, more accurately, just stops, dead in in tracks, not a single plotline resolved. Characters just disappear along the way, randomly, with no dramatic impact. I wondered if they chopped away the last third of the film by accident when I rented it. It is beautifully photographed, but way too detached from it's subject matter until it's too late. In the end, too frustrating to be entertaining or thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look at Mussolini's Italy & Jewish History in it","review":"I think this is not one of De Sica's best films, but it is a good one, nonetheless... The subject matter is vital to a modern viewer (Italian part of Jewish Holocaust History), but the film itself is somewhat lifeless at times. There are two many distractions from the main theme/plot/. It also lacks that special \\"De Sica dynamics\\", that is present in all of his films. Still, this film deserves to be remembered and viewed, at least once."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 30 years, it's still a remarkable film","review":"I saw this film in its initial release in the early 70s, when there were lots of outstanding, intelligent, and personal films around. It made a deep impression then, and it holds up. The haunting mise-en-scene, the interaction and personalities of the characters, the involvement of the writing all still exercise a strong pull on the viewer. But foremost is Dominique Sanda: she was beguiling and mysterious then and she continues to exercise this hold. And I'm finally able to see it in its original format. I'm sorry there's so little additional material on the DVD, but the quality of DeSica's vision of his country at an unhappy time is immensely powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of Age on the Brink of the Holocaust","review":"I hesitated to watch this film because I was afraid it would be one of many depressing WWII videos. While this is a dramatic movie, the horrors of the Holocaust are almost on the periphery for most of the movie. The drama begins with a group of young adults/teenagers as they struggle with the usual issues of self idenity. while they are not looking, the reality of Mussolini's fascism creeps in.Without revealing any more plot details, I want to say that it is a very enjoyable, though serious, movie. It is neither Shoa (a great movie) nor The Sound of Music (another great movie) but on an emotional scale it is somewhere in between."},{"rating":"1","title":"Japanese point of view","review":"In the list of ingredients there are Japanese names that are not used by Korean people. Besides, explanations of ingredients include too many references to Japanese influence.

The recipes are not exactly authentic, they are filtered through the Japanese worldview of what Westerners want. And it clearly needed to be run through an editor, as some sentences make no sense at all and some of the instructions are far from clear.It's hard to recommend this book for the idiosyncratic recipes, unless you are interested in making Korean food like a Japanese housewife from the 80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent publication for beginning cooks...","review":"This whole series of books is so well illustrated and written that anyone can follow them. As a culinary student and personal chef I love the fact that there is a picture of what everything is suppose to look like along the way.

The wheels spun just fine before the end pieces were attached but when assembled they wouldn't roll at all. We tried cutting away the parts of the joining tabs that slide into place against the wheels but it didn't help. None of the 3 deck boxes' wheels roll.

I'd say that although it doesn't erase this stage in a toddler, it does help her alertness. She's still very energetic but she is a tad more cooperative.

This did not work, so I tried 1.5 dosage because another customer said she tried to increase the dose. Big mistake! He had a really bad reaction to this. His eyes glazed over like he was high on drugs(looked like he had gel-like tears in his eyes that would not fall), and he was screaming that he had a headache while walking around holding his head. An increase of such a small amount should not have had that effect. Parents if you try this, do not try to increase the dosage under any circumstances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has no effect at all","review":"This product had no effect at all on my 8 year old child who had a sudden onset of severe generalized anxiety. Did not make him sleepy nor calm him, not even a hair.

Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing help for *very* active boy","review":"My 5-year-old does not have an official diagnosis of ADHD, but he is very hyperactive. He also has great difficulty concentrating. I purchased this product about one month ago. We are also using another product called Focus Attention Powder. These two products have helped us immensely. We mix the liquid Calm Child with the powder F.A.P., and mix all of it into an ounce or so of juice. It is a bit gritty, yes, but our son takes it with no complaints. We mix it well, stick a straw in it, and he drinks it very quickly. Believe me, if it was gross he wouldn't take it - he pukes at the slightest provocation.Anyway, the difference in his behavior is astounding. He is still active, still energetic, and still excited about life. However, he can sit still for his home-school lessons and is learning to \\"follow directions.\\" This is such a huge step for him. I plan to continue using the combination of these two products for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Child Calm works!","review":"I am a skeptic about herbs and think that they are EXTREMELY over rated. But when ADHD drugs were prescribed for my 8 year old son I HAD to at least give herbs a try before putting him on a stimulant. While I used Child Calm in conjunction with some other herbal formulas, I discovered that it made a difference and actually \\"took the edge\\" off of his hyperactivity. He is able to sit still and play Lego's and actually watch t.v. or read a book. He concentrates a little better on nearly everything. He sleeps well and pretty much through the night. I don't know. I'm still waiting on something to happen to show me that these herbs aren't making a difference. But so far, so good. Rather or not Calm Child works well by itself is not determined...but I am not willing to take him off of them to see if it's the Calm Child or the other herbs. But either way ----- it's working!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brings 'em down a \\"notch\\".","review":"My 5 year old son is an all over the place kind of boy. Very fidgety.

Since taking calm child I'd say he's about a 6.5While he is still quite himself, I've noticed he's come down a notch.It's not the miracle cure I was hoping for, but it sure has helped.[edit/jan2011] - Three months have passed and well, he's regressed and the syrup doesn't seem to be working anymore.

I guess other people had commented as well because the innkeeper actually sold sheet sets - she got them from some innkeeper supply place - but they were very expensive. So I did an online search and found these sheets at a much better price - and bought them as a Christmas present for my wife.They are nice - they feel very smooth, are fairly heavy fabric, and when we washed and dried them before using they came out of the dryer really close to wrinkle free - a world of difference from some 400 count cotton sheets we have (though those aren't wrinkle free). We have a fairly deep mattress - and they fit just fine - plus the pillow cases are very generous - no jamming your pillow into these cases! We've only used them once, and so we can't say anything about longevity, etc. - but so far we're very pleased. We may never use our old sheets again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A large hole after only three months","review":"After only three months we have a large hole that was worn in the threading.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice feel; bad fit","review":"It is true, these sheets do not wrinkle and they feel nice; but the fit is terrible. The sheets are so oversized you cannot get a good fit on the bottom sheet. We have a pillow top mattress that is 19 inches thick and still the sheets did not fit. Two of our pillows would fit in one of the pillowcases. When the sheets arrived, there were several dark blue stains on the bottom sheet. This did not interfere with their use, but it indicates that the manufacturer's quality control program needs upgrading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfortable but fragile","review":"These sheets are very soft, comfortable and wrinkle-free, but after 6 months, they just shredded apart where out feet rest.

I don't know what these readers are thinking, but it seems to me like they either haven't read 'Musca Domestica' or simply lack the faculties to read it fairly.In any case, potential buyers, don't be discouraged by these nonsensical reviews. 'Musca Domestica' is an incredibly rewarding book: the poems are only difficult in the way that the most intriguing and beautiful puzzles are difficult. These poems reward in every way: Ms. Hume manages to be funny and poignant and provoactive and weird all at once, and the more time you spend with this book the more delightful it becomes.Give 'Musca Domestica' a try -- the poems have earned it, and the book will richly repay your attention!And to you 'readers' in the one-star crowd: snap out of it, kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Musca Domestica\\"","review":"This book is overly concerned with epistemology and as such comes across sounding too studied, too forced, with very little poetic attraction at all. It is forced-sounding with a repetitive housefly imagery throughout the poetry. WHY HOUSEFLIES? The housefly imagery completely takes over and leaves the author with very little room to explore. The poems sound forced and unnatural. The poetry has an identifiable agends that is NOT flexible enough to be important and accessible. This work is ONLY intended for poets or postmodern theorists concerned with not making any sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"They reckon they know poetry...","review":"Agreed, Hume's poems are not written in a common language. She shys away from religious feeling, and instead includes vulgarity. Her work is extreme nor does her poetry conform.When compared to Billy Collins this is obvious. At the next cocktail party, I will not be able to show off my erudition with Hume's poems, as I can with Collins. In fact, Hume has proven that vulgarity is still possible even today!Yes, as I sip my skim milk, nibble on my dry bland toast, revel in the next episode of \\"Friends,\\" I too am looking for a poet who aims for the middle ground, who shys away from extremes, and who conforms, especially a poet who isn't so engrossed with the world as to spend an entire book considering the wonders and the fantasies of houseflies."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPID AND BORING POETRY","review":"This is the worst book of poetry that I have ever read!! The poetry tries to be amusing and thought-provoking but is lacking in humor and feeling and ends up sounding like elementary school poetry. The poems are neither complex nor imaginative. These poems are just sloppy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD VERSE - Skip it","review":"I have nothing against accessible poetry, but bad poetry masquerading as something profound--that I have a problem with. There are some wonderful accessible poets out there--Stephen Dobyns and Stephen Dunn come to mind. Read them, and you'll be able to see the difference.I found this book of poetry to be insipid and ultimately meaningless. I can't help feeling that these poems are geared towards a fading generation and constipated stereotypes that have been \\"done\\" to death: the pseudo intellectual, the neglected middle-class housewives, etc.Hume's poems basically never do anything interesting, never take any risks, never live life - forever roaming around the lonely room of this mundane house and making asinine observations about a bizarre world no one understands."},{"rating":"1","title":"delusions of grandeur","review":"I found the poetry in this book to be unlogical and unemotional. I think the author was trying to convey heartfelt poetry that mellows the reader. Instead, the poetry is very cheesy and corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BE FOOLED - THIS BOOK STINKS!","review":"I bought this book of poetry and it was not even above average. So, I looked it up on Amazon.com and came across a reviewer who keeps defending this book and saying negitive things about the other reviewers. Do not listen to this lone reviewer! The poetry in this book is boring, disconnected in its content, and not at all \\"cutting-edge\\".

She loves them! They were shipped and received very quickly, less than two weeks. I was a little bummed that the color of the stones were a lighter blue than the photo. They are still gorgeous, but not the London blue color as shown. Very nice earrings, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great earrings!","review":"These are great earrings-the stones are great quality, although they are lighter than shown in the picture. I liked these earrings so much that I bought them in 4 other colors. I have purchased them for presents for others, and get compliments all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly enchanting....","review":"One of the best and most delightful books I've read this year (2006). Farrington has it just right and I was rather convinced that he was a religious, but evidently not. I did have a problem with the monk explaining in a letter to his former superior what the Bible related about Mary and Martha, I mean, REALLY! While I understand the device, it was pretty silly. I don't know how else he could have done it, but had I been his editor (of which I'm very capable), I'd'a called him on it. Moreover, he had a bride walking toward her groom to Mendelssohn, which is a recessional, brides marching TO Wagner. Not only that, but it wasn't so long ago that there was no music permitted in church that wasn't WRITTEN expressly for the church. No matter, NO ONE would walk up the aisle to the exhuberant strains of A Midsummer Night's Dream, really, one would have to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable cliche","review":"There's not much to this novel. From the get go, I knew that the two main characters would get together. I don't think the monk's motives for first joining the priesthood and later leaving it were fully explored. His letters to his fellow priest at the monestary were irritating and full of trivial musings. Overall, I found the book dull and predictable. There was no plot to speak of, and the characters felt flat and drawn, instead of complex and developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Isn't It Romantic?","review":"I loved this book with its realistic portrayal of a single mom finding love when she least expects it with a former monk who rents an apartment in her house. The author does a wonderful job of allowing the two main characters to slowly reveal themselves to each other.The family scenes that involve her young daughter and her mom are sweet. This is more than a love story; it's a story of how new families are made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a fun romance","review":"I really liked this book not only as a fun romance, but if you were willing to dig and search some, it was a fascinating examination of religion and, in the monk's case, finding how his religion could fit in the context of a \\"normal\\" life. He has lived as an \\"all or none.\\" Either I'm a monk, or I don't know if God exists because the monastery wasn't quite doing it for me. I loved the end and the benefits of having religion - even if you don't necessarily believe, the ability to hand some of your problems over to a higher being has a powerful effect on the psyche."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful gift","review":"This is a very special work. Characterization, dialogue, and setting are lapidary, providing great esthetic pleasure. There is an extra dimension, however, appreciated especially by those who have some knowledge of both the crucifixions and epiphanies of committed relationships and the Mystery found through the desert and beneath the darkness. This added dimension will be recognized by those who have been beaten up by life but still find a nameless hope in the kindness of strangers, the beauty of nature, the play of children, and the sacrament of intimacy. It also offers those unfamiliar or uncomfortable with what Andrew Greeley has called the Catholic sacramental vision of the world an engaging glimpse from a literarily gifted insider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While the characters were likable enough (albeit one-dimensional and sorely underdeveloped), the plot was so disappointingly unconventional that I am actually shocked this book received such high reviews. This was my first Tim Farrington novel, and I was so unimpressed with The Monk Downstairs that will not pick up another one of his books. Writing quality was unexceptional, situations seemed awkward and less than believable. Tim does a disservice to Catholicism and monastic life (failing miserably to examine what all is involved in switching vocations, having sex with a woman he barely knows and isn't married to.. it overall just leaves a bad taste). There is a proposal in the story, which was the only point I laughed- and because of the ridiculousness, not because of any intended humor on the author's part. Overall, Tim Farrington failed to separate himself from the rest- any writer who cranks out cheap dime-a-dozen romance novels could have written this predictable sub-par story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary","review":"I was surprised to see such high ratings for this book. i personally found it to be nothing too out of the ordinary. The book was not very insightful and the few shimerring pieces of writing seemed to peek from the letters that the monk wrote back ot the monastery. The biggest let down was that the 'monk' did not really have anything to add to the storyline. Had it been an average Joe living downstaairs, the story would have still remained the same. The story was not about a relationship with a monk but with a man who happened to be a monk. 2 similar but very distint lines of thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"As soon as I read the beginning of this book, when the ex-monk , Michael Christopher, moved into an apartment in the home of Rebecca, a single mother, I figured that it would be a predictable \\"boy meets girl\\" kind of book.Well, it was a \\"boy meets girl\\" book but it was anything but predictable. The quirky baggage-laiden characters and difficult situations reminded me of Anne Tyler's writing, which I love. The book was not overly detailed nor overwritten; the dialogue was realistic; and the characters were very appealing. The warm and honestly rendered story was full of hope and everyday spirituality, written in such lovely language.Michael and Rebecca, as well as her daughter Mary Martha, are delightful, real, and engaging characters - and so are the \\"minor\\" characters. Farrington's portrayal of their day-to-day life struggles will endear these folks to all who read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masonry exposed","review":"I found the book to be enlightening, as far as the rituals performed for initiating the new members.

Nancy MacCallion's number, \\"On We Go\\" is both spirited and dark, a wickedly pleasing combination here, while Mary Black's \\"Treasure Island\\" gives a melancholic yet hopeful view of life and love. Maire Bhreannan is always a joy to hear, and like with Capercaille we're blessed by a double helping.

Mine has a red light that goes off when the steaming is complete. The steamer comes with a basket that can be used in the dishwasher to hold small items. Here is a tip: when I first used my steamer, I had water spots on everything. I called the customer service, and they advised me to try distilled water. This worked like a charm. Apparently I had some ingredient in my well water that was causing the spots.

I take 3 nebulized drugs every other month and 1 nebulized drug in the other months. The sterilizer was meant to cut my time caring for the nebulizers. For about a week and a half, the sterilizer performed as the instructions stated. Then I started having trouble with the sterilizer keeping the nebulizers sterile for 6 hours as stated in the instructions. The sterilizer would go through the cycle, but then it would shut itself off way before the 6 hours were up. The first time it happened, I thought it was a fluke, but it happened again. I am not feeling that well and just don't have the energy to send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Sterilizer","review":"I've been using the IQ24 Sterilizer for 3 months & love it!

But he saw it for himself fought to let other people know that he knows it, but that doesnot make him a seer of truth nor the Columbus of new ideas. The worst thing I found in this book is he tried to prove something right at the cost of proving something wrong. In the process he showed his immaturity of thoughts and he cannibalized what he tried to show the world, the peaceful coexistence of ideas in a middle-path. He fought a crusade of the east vs. the west, \\"logical\\" science vs. fuzzy science completely ruling out the emergence of a synergical consciousness. I disliked the book and donot think I would jump to read his other publications.

I was looking for a book like this to integrate more philosophy and examples, rather than straight forward hard-core math equations and theory. Be careful what you wish for, it might come true! This book was a rambling diatribe with a lot of subjective views on many disjointed topics. I really had to wade through a lot of painful reading to get to some useful information, which was very few and far between. His analogies and comparisons between fuzzy logic and Aristotle vs. Buddha detract rather than add to the argument. The chapters get away from the chapter titles with haughty generalizations and distracting writing. A good editor and a more focused, less \\"fuzzy\\" style would have made this more appealing. Don't buy this if you are looking for a book on fuzzy logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent","review":"This book is written in a \\"stream of consciousness\\" style and that makes things incoherent.

I found this book a waste of time. I was reading this book trying to understand just what the author thought fuzzy logic was and came away with no clear picture. When the author was trying to explain Fuzzy Logic circuits, I thought, Hey wait a minute, aren't we talking about analog circuits here? So, he has put a new label on an old idea.I know, that is not all what FL is supposed to be about, but I think the author is making a cottage industry out of something that is not that big of a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will never work with this company again","review":"I ordered the product and they sent the wrong color.

For most people, it is bogged down in Sanskrit etymologies and contrived explanations of obscure sentence structures. It is very much a formal grammar, and does not seem to be designed with the casual learner in mind at all. In addition, the printing, especially the Devanagari, is difficult to read. In cases where there are two possibilities for how to write a Devanagari character, they are often both used indiscriminately, furthering the confusion for the learner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electronic Horn","review":"PROS: Installed easily.

The king sends Jonathan on a mission to learn what Elizabeth's father is searching for and Jonathan decides that he will seduce her if necessary and then marry her to find out her father's secret.The entire novel is just boring. There is nothing new here except the setting. Jonathan does not even do that good of a job at seducing her and she is naive enough as to be quite dumb. Granted, this was written in the early 90's which, in my opinion, is very much a hit or miss period for romance novels. They seem to be very good and among my favorites, or just painful to get through.All the charcters were flat as was their dialogue and their interactions with each other. I couldn't care less whether Elizabeth and Jonathan got together. Overall, I would not recomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conformity Can Be Bad For the Soul","review":"In this film, Jean-Louis Trintignant is a conflicted double agent caught between the old Italalian Fascists and his new left-wing bosses.

Please harass Paramount about it.It's a shame that such a classic and influential has been ignored for so long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Having now seen The Conformist again, in \\"restored\\" form, I've got to say I think it terribly overrated. Just for a start, one thing I find problematic is the equation of repressed or latent homosexuality, if that's what it is, with fascist tendencies, or guilt about some homosexual exeperience (as indicated at the end of the film) with whatever the central character's pathology. But then this is not sufficiently clearly sketched to make any real sense; it's the kind of thing that can only be taken seriously in the context of a particular kind of left-wing European machismo of the 1960s. Otherwise it's nonsense. Perhaps one's not meant to take it as \\"realism\\" but as \\"symbolism\\" all the way through the film, but even then it fails to join the dots; certainly, it doesn't work as \\"realism\\".

It has some interesting visuals and unique cinematography, but the story is just not interesting or engaging. I'm generally very easy to please when it comes to movies, but for the last half hour of this movie I was just waiting for it to end. The cheesy 70s dialog and hammy acting didn't help either.

Neo-noir with a hip gothic feel, the characters are hardened gangsters, criminals and killers, but you know, the good kind.

Along with the change of gears, they record the CD live at Tonic\`s, a club in NYC. This recording features amazing sound, a great song list, and a groove that at times harkens back to days of great jazz trio\`s on Blue Note.From the strains of free form, to the off beat measures, to even a cover of Hey Joe, this is an absolute treat. While the trio returns to their unique meat and potatoes sound, let\`s hope they slip in a few desserts with every now and then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a relief","review":"This is by far the best album MMW has released.

I have a buzz cut so it's not as though it is that difficult to get through.

They vibrate so much you could probably get a decent massage out of them if you could stand the noise. It comes with an adjustment screw, but no matter what you do, they are unbearably, abnoxiously loud! The seem to cut OK, except my wife has to squeeze the sap out of them when cutting to try and dampen the vibrations. The one nice thing is the extra small plastic spacer it comes with which helps fade military hair cuts better. Maybe I got one of the bad ones, but I will never buy Wahl again (or at least I will definately keep my receipt so I can return them as soon as I re-prove to myself that they suck.)

I often have to pinch the sides of the clippers (not sure why) to get them back to normal operation. Again, I don't know what causes it or why that helps, but it does. When not in \\"high gear,\\" though, the clippers work just fine. The color coding is nice, but some of the colors do not really match the color code on the clippers. The general color is there, but most are darker or lighter or a slightly different hue than the color code.

It takes over 20 minutes going over the same spot multiple times to get a haircut now, and there are always lots of long hairs left over.

What's worse, Terhorst assumes you'd be living off the interest generated by investing your assets in CDs earning a currently unheard of 8% interest.In addition, the book doesn't touch on health insurance. I'm guessing that when he wrote the book almost 15 years ago, health insurance was far more affordable than it is now. Either that, or he was assuming that you could self-insure if your assets were so high.I'd like to see this book updated for the 21st century--i.e. how to \\"live off your assets\\" when interests rates are 2% or less, and how to live on \\"$50 a day\\" (Terhorst's mantra) while still securing health care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upbeat, positive, and funny; You'll quit your job tomorrow.","review":"This book woke me up to the possibility of early retirement, and made me realize, at a time when my net worth was negative, that it could be possible in a relatively short time (about 8 years for me). It was very interesting to learn of the cheap cost-of-living in many of the Latin-American countries. Paul Terhorst's view of retirement is one of fun and adventure, while you're still young enough to really enjoy it. This book is a great motivator. But if you don't see any way in the world it could happen for you, I'd suggest also reading \\"Your Money or Your Life\\" by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin.

It also has useful text descriptions for increased clarity where pictures might not be enough (such as explaining the function of a muscle).It isn't a good book to learn anatomy from, but I recommend it whole-heartedly as a detailed anatomy <em>reference</em> for artists who already have a decent understanding of human anatomy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased with Book","review":"I recently got this book and really love it.

It shows you -- all on the same page -- every muscle, its origin and insertion on the skeleton, what it looks like alone, where it falls in the muscles surrounding it, and finally what it looks like on the surface of the living model (in a small photograph). I had been working with the Anatomy Coloring Book, which is a very good book also, but felt I needed to understand where each muscle is attached to the bone. I was looking up this information muscle by muscle from a medical dictionary -- but it was rough going. Goldfinger's book has it all already! And it is presented visually all on the same page so you can see it at a glance and really understand it.

I'm a 16 year old art student, and when I'm sketching human form and musculature, this is the go-to book. The models that are chosen are perfect because they're not bulky, they look like normal humans, and you can see some muscle through the skin. The images are side by side views of the photos of the model and the anatomical drawing, which is perfect for trying to understand how to draw the shape and build of people.

I love it and use it at least once a week when I'm taking a break from larger projects.The only issue I'd say I have with this book is the amount of text and blank space, because I use it to sketch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource.","review":"I haven't read through the whole book yet, but so far the illustrations and photo references are top notch. The cross-section illustrations of the muscles are particularly useful as well as the highlighting of each muscles' insertion and origin. I would highly recommend this book for anyone looking to draw or sculpt the human figure accurately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as in-depth as I'd have liked","review":"This book seems as if most parts of it have been directly quoted out of Mary Wilson's \\"Dreamgirl--My Life as a Supreme\\". I read Mary's book first, and the parts in the Diana Ross book pertaining to the Supremes, almost all matched Mary's quotes, exactly.I didn't feel like I learned too much, and since this is an \\"unauthorized\\" biography, I feel that one cannot tell what is true or untrue. Of course, out of the 3 original Supremes, Diana was my LEAST favorite, so it doesn't upset me to read anything negative. After all, we are all human, and anyone who can't have ANYTHING written about them, cannot be human! At any rate, I was not too satisfied with the information I received from this book in terms of completeness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gossip is not truth, if it were, we'd all be hiding...","review":"No one loves a good read about a celebrity more than me, but this book just bites the big one. It's such a rehash of old gossip and is quite tedious. There are testimonies to Miss Ross's kindness and philanthropy that I've read quite by accident (elsewhere), that don't get much play. I guess dirt, no matter how unreliable sells. Don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A BEHIND-THE-SCENE DISHFEST","review":"There's an ugly side to Diana Ross. We all know that by now. She's made enough front-page news to cover the bottom of many birdcages. Yet, J. Randy Taraborrelli was the first to expose her bad behavior. His 1989 CALL HER MISS ROSS is a no holds barred account of the Diva in action, from her humble beginnings in Detroit, Michigan to her sold out performances all over the world. This hit girl sure made a lot of people tremble in their boots, including her Supreme sister Mary Wilson who at the time kept quiet to keep peace. Taraborrelli spares no details in making sure his unauthorized biography is worth every penny: jealousy, backstabbing, manipulation of every sort. Ross' desperate need to control everything and everyone fits her over-the-top ego to a T while filling this bio with enough juicy details to keep every enquiring minds fully satisfied. A must.-----Martin Boucher"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best gaskets","review":"These improved gaskets are much better than the OEM garbage.

Seller here does not do their part to inspect this kit before it leaves their facility. Two of the most crucial gaskets were damaged in this kit. We were right in the middle of the repair with half of the engine tore down when we noticed the damaged done. We had to stop and go to a walk in NAPA parts store and fortunately they had the 2 gaskets we needed to finish the repair. Another additional $7.50 + tax to buy the parts that were damaged.

Use the Perfect Piecer to make paper templates, or to mark directly on the fabric. There are inch ruler tick marks along with tiny holes. Poke your mechanical pencil through the holes to mark tiny dots on your fabric; instead of drawing a line, you'll only be making a dot to suggest the location of the seam line.A must have, if you want to do \\"challenging\\" piecing.

I mentioned one time that I have the editor's version of White Christmas (the movie) and said that there were some great comments by Rosemary Clooney on it, including refreshingly cynical witticisms on the production and stories of the good, the bad and the purposely ugly of Bing Crosby. George mentioned that he liked her and of course what's not to like? I read a biography of her a long time ago that was very good and which wasn't the one that I bought but I figured this was passable for a man who's old enough to have if not every, then many things. Well, he's not that old but not materialistic so there you go. He's also a great singer/songwriter, NOT in the sappy, self-indulgent way but the witty also cynical way so this seemed like a good gift. I urge you to check him out, which I'm probably not supposed to do here but I'm such a rebel and if you believe that I have a bridge in Brooklyn that I'd like to sell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and not so indepth","review":"Why was this book written? Didn't she cover all this in her last book? I felt I knew less about her than when I started?

The world misses Rosemary Clooney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosemary Clooney","review":"I appreciated how frank Rosemary Clooney was about her breakdown, and how she pulled herself together afterwards. I'm always interested in turning points, and this was a significant one for her, leading to a sane, normal, intelligent life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"This book was absolutely remarkable! Anyone interested in Rosemary Clooney should read it. I read this book for a history project and I could not stop talking about it! This book is one of the few that have really ever had a major effect on me. Rosemary's life is like a fairytale: tough beginnings, with a heavenly ending. The book did an excellent job in explaining everything that happened in her life. It was also made better because it was an autobiography. I love it and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life and times of a very brave woman","review":"Rosemary Clooney is a very brave woman and I'm glad she survived to write her own book.

Steve Janowski is one of the best characters on television, and I won't spoil it but just watch him closely over the last couple episodes. Ashley Schaffer is outrageous on his return with a new dealership though it does get a bit weird, and of course the always on form Danny McBride brings Kenny Powers back to the USA to fight the communist threat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Powers Never Gets Old","review":"If you watched season 1 and season 2 than you have a pretty good idea what Eastbound & Down is about. Not giving away too much of the plot but season 3 sees Kenny Powers juggling his pitching career and the challenges of fatherhood. Seeing Kenny trying to raise his baby after April left would be worth watching the entire season but Kenny is also facing professional challenges as he is no longer the Alpha on the team and he will do anything to get that position back. If you liked the first two seasons season three is more of the same. Some reviewers claim there is a dropoff from season two to season 3 but I disagree I feel season 3 is as solid as the other two seasons if not bettet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scanner","review":"This scanner is one of the best scanners out there for this kind of price. Not only was it easy to set up, it is super fast and reliable. I usually scan 10-20 page documents, just black and white and have it save in PDF format.

If it seems like the price is cheap, its because you will get what you pay for in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"pay a little more for something else","review":"You get what you pay for. 25 years car audio experience, I wanted a budget system for a back up vehicle. Better off spending a little more on something else, like Kicker or Lanzar. These may perform fair off just head unit power, avoid these if your running an amp. Ran these off an amplifier low-level line outs, the cleanest power option and results are minimal. Tweeters simply sound cheap and distort easily, mids are a bit better but not much. I knew Pyle was nothing but restamped Pyramid junk, but decided to gamble anyway. Photo of the mid-bass in photos is misleading, not at all a beefy speaker. grade \\"D\\", giving them 2 stars at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Shipping was free and fairly quick. The component speakers work ok at lower volume, but cannot handle much with heavier music. They tend to distort easily with music such as Metallica, even at lower volume. The tweeters seem to do alright at any level. Mounts for the tweeters are cheap and break VERY easily. One was actually split when I opened the box. Crossovers do their job without a problem. Best application would be a set to buy your teenage son, explain how to take care of what you have and see how many days before he blows them, lol. Overall you get what you pay for, $37 for two entry level crossovers. Would suggest spending a little more money for a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality","review":"I know I shouldn't expect a lot since it is Pyle but mine blew in a month on 150 watts max.

I owned a $100 pair of Infinity 6x5 and currently own a set of polk audio 6x5 which were also $100 and the build qaulity is sooo much better. Just by picking them up in each hand can you tell the difference. For a quick very basic set up and small budget im sure these will do fine, what the long term of these speakers are remain to be seen. I personally did not like them and returned just on the buid quality alone. Essentially for the price your in the ball park - spend a little more get a little more, I guess its basic principle."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great...","review":"I would not recomend these, the tweeters are poorly constructed and quite easy to burn out, the crossovers are quite poor and the 6.5\\" drivers are very limited in range...i was running these on a cadence 4x50 Watt(rms) amp. (the Q4000) at a masured output of 41Watt RMS (as configured)... in only a few weeks i burned out all but one of the tweeters, and one of the crossovers... the crossovers are a 1st order LP 2nd order HP with a reistor in series with the tweeter... the LP inductor is a iron core wound with 22AWG wire, the hp inductor is at least an air core, but it's made with 26AWG wire... the tweeters mounts are all friction fit and fall apart very easy... the 6.5\\" drivers are ok for upper midbass to low midrange, outside of this range it's responce gets quite eratic, and any bass below about 180 HZ will cause distortion across the rest of it's range... all in all these were not worth even the low cost i paid for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Value priced, poor quality.","review":"I purchased these as a cheap upgrade for my stock speakers. I installed them and they installed pretty easy, however one of the crossovers was bad right out of the box. I emailed the company and after 2 weeks have had no response. If I call the 800 number in the book, it is busy. I ended up having to bypass the crossover to make the speakers work at all.

I recommended it to my friends, so I figured I'll recommend it to internet users as well. I've read some other books on memory improvement, but I think this book was more engaging. It includes most of the principles found in the other memory books I've read, but this book seemed to make it more cohesive. I think the other aspect I enjoyed was the emphasis on personal attitudes. It honestly left me with a new perspective on growing old. Also I felt the book spoke well to some of the sometimes-negative feelings I've had about growing old (to be honest I was surprised by just how many negative perceptions I had that this book revealed to me - and corrected, so to speak).

Paris is a \\"sad\\" character. It seems to me she forgives her unfaithful husband too easily. Maybe it's just me, but i was expecting to see more emotion then the \\"wanting him back\\" and \\"missing him\\". Being an independent woman, this book irrates me. I respect housewives, however there are so many other things to enjoy, why does a woman have to find her own self worth in raising kids and running a family, like Paris? There are p-l-e-n-t-y things she could do to make herself happy.... this book is kind of a set back for all the women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filler","review":"Years ago I was enthralled with Danielle Steel, after all, everyone dreams of a love story, even with the drama. However, I grew tired of the same descriptions of the characters, repeated storylines interwoven. I stopped reading her books. Then I saw this one, read the online reviews, and excitedly purchased it. I wish I could say I loved it. After being in the dating world forever, I certainly laughed at some of her awful dates, but it feels almost insulting to have every paragraph repeat the one before, or to repeat what the character is thinking a page later, only with different words. I wish I had loved it, I just was frustrated, and three-quarters of the way through, I jumped to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dating Game","review":"I did not like this audio book.Out of all of Danielle Steel audio books this one was the worse and most depressing story.In a world of finding a new job and starting to date again.It was a story of a women who was having a problem finding the right man.

I hope her next novel is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adoption irritated me","review":"First of all, as an adoptive mother, this book really gave me the creeps. It is not easy to adopt a child when you are a middle aged single parent--there are thousands of younger married couples competing with you. It was wayyy too easy and fast. Secondly, it didn't seem that Paris had a huge desire to be a mother again--it seemed more that she wanted companionship. Thirdly, it may be old fashioned but I think kids need fathers. The dating stuff was pretty funny and a welcome change from most of her books which deal only with perfect romances. I would not be surprised to see Ms. Steel turn up totin' an infant after reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored rich women of the world, get dogs!","review":"I must agree with the reader who just wanted to scream \\"Get a dog!\\" The first half of the book was good, and I sympathized with Paris.Then she moves to a new city and a great job falls in her lap. After a few bad dates and failing to make any real friends, she decides that she needs a baby. Never mind that it is mentioned over and over again that she works such loooooong hours, often getting home after 10:00 PM. Never mind that in real life, nobody gets to adopt a healthy infant within two weeks. Never mind that all Paris needed to do was *get a life*!All I got out of this book was the lesson that I really need to try reading something with more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"HANG IT UP, DANIELLE!","review":"DANIELLE STEEL DID HER BEST WORK YEARS AGO.

The story lines are interchangeble; just change the character names.The book is quick reading, but ultra-light in content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed, couldn't even finish it.","review":"My grandmother and my mother have read Danielle Steele for years, but I must admit I'd never picked one up. I was always more for historical romances. But I wanted something different, had heard good things about her, so while at the library, decided to give her a try. I have to say I'm extremely disappointed. Granted, I'm a fellow writer (a very picky reader by nature), and an unpublished one to boot, but the writing could've been better in my opinion. The first five pages are all backstory of Paris's marriage (no action, no excitement, told very \\"history lesson-ish\\") and what could have been an extremely powerful scene between Paris and her husband (the inciting incident in the first chapter) left me wondering, \\"So what?\\". Twenty five pages in, I could care less about these people. I honestly expected more from a bestselling author."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!","review":"I am a true romantic so I love almost all of Danielle Steel's books and this was no exception.

As I said in my title, LOVED IT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite of her books so far","review":"I wish I could give this a higher grade, but I just can't. This book is mediocre at best. I did finish it, but wasn't even happy that I did. I thought the characters were flat and uninteresting (with the exception of Bixby Mason), and couldn't help but smirk at some of their stupid names (i.e. Wim. I doubt I will ever meet a \\"Wim\\" in real life!). My favorite Danielle Steel novels are \\"The Gift\\" and \\"Safe Harbour\\".

I haven't used up much of the bottle, but I'm giving up on them and getting some encapsulated iron!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is \\"OK\\"","review":"I would have to say that the best part of the toy was building it. It took me 8 hours strait to build it, but I enjoyed every minute of it. I did find, though, that when I was done, the fun quickly died. All you can do is watch it go up and down, up and down.I recommend this product to a person who likes to build coasters (RCT game) or likes building K-Nex.

Good Luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screamin Fun~","review":"The set took 3 days to set up, and has been played with for many hours of fun~ it was a three person job to set up with loads of discussion.

My three boys built it entirely by themselves (ages 9,8,6). My only job was to cut the track at the very end so it was the right length. My middle son did a big project on rollercoasters for school and brought it in for a visual aid. Needless to say it was a big hit with the entire school! We disassembled it at school and as soon as we got home my 6 year old built the Serpent Junior model within the next 24 hours by himself. Now they've spent vacation making their own models (the trains don't usually make it through the track but they have fun designing!) If your kids are competent with K'Nex, they'll love this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Screamin' fun!","review":"Best toy ever!!!Took 10 hours to put together, but was worth it. Very attractive. Sound effects a nice touch.

Much to my amazement, it ran ALMOST perfectly. With one small adjustment to the battery operated motor and chain, I had it up and running. The cars ran effortlessly along the track and around the loop.A couple of points you may want to consider: This is not the kind of toy that you can just pull out of the box, snap together, and run. This is a project - the more you appreciate the process of putting it together, the more you will enjoy the finished product. Once you have it together, there is not much else to do other than to watch it go. The instruction booklet provides little in the way of written directions, so it is very important to pay attention to the diagrams all the way through.Also - be careful not to lose any pieces - you don't get many extras.This toy is excellent! Just make sure you have a large enough space to keep it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reinforcement for the budding engineer","review":"I never understood the lure of plain old plastic building toys, but I wanted my math-smart 13 year old to experience the challenge of building a model. The sheer size of the project was the source of some of the initial intrigue, but as my daughter built it, the anticipation of completion became stronger. As she was adorning it with the little flags and the serpent head, several kids in the neighborhood happened to come by. The little geniuses worked together to complete the finishing touches and turned on the motor with great expectations. It worked! Someone bumped something and it needed to be adjusted, so there was more intense discussion as they fixed it. I was thrilled that the entire project was done by a girl with no previous interest or experience with K'nex. I can't resist turning the thing on when no one is around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pieces","review":"This item was ordered with express delivery which meant more money for shipping.

I don't think my son could have put this together on his own. But he didn't have to. Thats were mom and dad came in. It took the entire family about 7 hours to get this together.If you want to save some time off that estimate you can put together a smaller rollercoaster. It won't have the loop though. It will still work just as well.The rollercoaster is heartily loved by my son. He loves the screams that emit from the passengers (a little box with a movement sensor) as the rollercoaster starts its downward drop. The sounds of it climbing up the chain are also high on his list!All in all this is a great toy. Sure it took a long time to put together. But think in terms of quality time spent together, instead of rushing to get on with it.Adults more than likely will get just as big a kick out of it as kids.Happy Screaming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too difficult","review":"My boys, age 7 and 9, found this waaaay too difficult to put together. Even dad got frustrated during the hours and hours it took him while the boys evenutally wandered off to do other things. Then it was just way too big to leave it set up anywhere for very long, so we had to take it all apart (left to mom, by herself, as the pieces were too difficult for the kids to get apart and dad had already paid his dues). Of course, it hasn't been touched since. Unless your kids are old enough, I'm thinking about 14, then steer clear would be my recommendation. Sorry to be a party pooper..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Buy It Yet","review":"I've owned this toy for two years and it hasn't let me down. I built it in four hours without eating or taking a break, and it works like a gem.

However, I just wanted to let you know that in August 2003, K'NEX is releasing a new roller coaster called the Rippin' Rocket Roller Coaster, with a complete zero degree vertical drop and speed boosters along the track, so if you're interested, save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun to build, boring to play with","review":"My son had great fun building this toy last year during Christmas break.

I bought it for myself (I'm 45), never used Knex, but am a huge rollercoaster fan. After a few minutes, I realized it would be easier to build if I divided the pieces into separate piles (I used bags, but small boxes might be better). Work went smoothly after that - best instructions and materials I've ever seen.By the time I finished, I had used parts of my brain that hadn't been used in years. Great for working on your spatial skills!

These interviewees are the great men and women who served in the Armed Services during World War II. Author Dr. Mary Robsman interviews each of these people, but allows them to tell their own story emphasizing what each feels is important about their experience. It is a wonderful, easy-to-read approach, and each person's story is as interesting as the next. This book is timely because so many World War II veterans have died, and so have their stories.

It's a very good book to share with young people and middle aged adults who want to better understand why their parents and grandparents feel the way they do about so many things.

If your heart and mind is open to seek UNDERSTANDING, you will be joyfully grateful for Pippin's knowledge. Hosea 4.14 A people without understanding will come to ruin. Pippin takes a postmodern view where the reader enters a fictional world to participate in feeling, seeing, hearing and touching through the narrative. This experience is cathartic. Anger, grief, guilt and joy is released in the midst of crisis. You will want to face your deep fears and detach from them because perfect LOVE casts out fear. Here's to confronting all fears and the knowing that when the light of love enters it will disappear.

The prose doesn't flow. The book simply can't stand alone the way the \\"counting Book\\" and Miss Spider's Mom, do.

But the story turned out to be disappointing. My son had zero interest in seeing Miss Spider and Holley shop for a car. He didn't understand the concept, and the words did not help. To him, there was no story, no plot. He was disappointed that none of Miss Spider's kids were in the book, and the illustrations were not clear enough to get him interested in the vehicles. I think we were both expecting a family adventure in a new car. At the end of the book he said, \\"Let's not read this one again.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Spider is the BEST","review":"My daughter and I first read Miss Spiders Tea Party when she was 6 yrs. old. then came Miss Spiders Wedding and now Miss Spiders New Car.

I cannot imagine what could have caused that, especially when it is supposed to be scratch resistant. The windowsill is not that cold to \\"crack\\" glass. The only probable culprit is zipper along the cuff of my winter coat, which I doubt is of material hard enough to penetrate the mineral crystal this watch was supposed to have...I also bought a similar eco-drive for my husband, and it seemed slow, he kept adjusting the time.

A little fade in the color, but otherwise no wear. Which I guess makes these pretty hardy.The main feature of this scooter is the three wheels.

Knuth asks you to solve exercises and tackle difficult passages marked with \\"dangerous bend\\" signs. He rewards you with witty epigraphs and in-jokes.

My first impression was that I had been mistakenly purchased the woman's version of the watch. It's... small. Timex specifies the housing as 34mm wide. That's 1.33 inches.Beyond the size issue, the only other cons for me are that the face picks up scratches easily, and that the ticking is quite pronounced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep it dry!","review":"I really liked this watch because it's so simple and unassuming. All I wanted was a watch that can be worn with anything and this one seemed to fit the bill. Whether dressed up or dressed down, the watch went well with any attire.My complaint about this watch is its water resistance, or lack thereof. I washed my hands vigorously (as we all should) and then the face got all foggy. I never wore the watch in the shower, never swam with it on and yet water got into it, that's weak! Sure, the watch still told the time but I had a hard time seeing the hands through the fog inside my watch. Timex has the audacity to label the watch as water resistant and it's even engraved as such on the third line on the back of the watch but that's bogus. I could've loved this watch because it's a functional accessory rather than a pretentious status symbol, but alas...p.s.

It's light, malleable, and conforms well to your wrist.The overall weight is a big plus. It feels like you're not wearing anything at all.My only complaint is that it's pretty loud.

The narrative goes from third person to first person, alternating chapters. While it was interesting to be inside Violette's head it also took me out of the flow of Christian's part in the story. At the same time I do see the sense in what Strobel did, and I appreciate it. It was interesting to see how two different people, with different levels of faith, handled their grief and moved on with their life.

Liane is a bit like Cugel, but a lot more cruel and a lot less funny.

Vance has a colourful eye; his vision of an Earth at the end of time is wistful, poignant, strange, memorable. However, when he moves his brush away from composition to the banal mechanics of narrative and character development, Vance loses interest. EYES OF THE OVERWORLD and CUGEL'S SAGA, for example, are basically the same novel lumbered with the same obnoxious hero and EXACTLY the same (slim) premise.A better buy would be a slim volume the \\"Tales\\"; the rest is just paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheesh","review":"I've read over 2000 fantasy titles, and this is indeed one of the worst. I like some of Jack Vance's other works, but not this one. The characters are foolish idiots, with no redeeming qualities, and the world is a mish-mash of loosely interconnected idiocy. Not even a map was provided to allow one to follow along with some of the characters travels. And the prose! The only other author I've ever read that made me cringe this badly with their prose was James Fenimore Cooper, and he gets the benefit of the doubt since he lived in a day when people often tried to impress us with their wordcraft to hide their lack of actual substance.Honestly, I've owned this book for over 14 years. I still have not managed to read it all the way through. I am stubborn though, and will finish it this time, so it can finally go where it belongs, on a shelf collecting dust. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"I absolutely *love* this book.","review":"Right up front I have to say that I am a big fan of Jack Vance. I was first introduced to Vance when I read his story titled \\"The Dragon Masters\\" in an anthology titled THE HUGO WINNERS 1955-1961 edited by Issac Asimov. This Anthology rarely sits in my bookshelf, as I love to pick it up and re-read any bit of any of the wonderful stories within. I was struck by Vance's originality and style of writing, and immediately looked for more of his titles. As most of Vance's books are out of print, Tales of the Dying Earth provides readers with an easily aquired introduction to this incredibly gifted author. As other reviewers have mentioned, the cover art has nothing to do with what's inside. This book has little continuity, rather it is a conglomeration of stories that will enchant and delight any fan of fantasy. I can easily say that this is one of my absolute favorite books in my collection, and I can happily recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quintessential!","review":"Quintessential reading for anyone with the slightest interest in sci-fi, fantasy or the surreal!

A mixture of terry pratchett, fritz leiber, robert e howard, michael moorcock with a little mark twain thrown in and perhaps exoticism like philip jose farmer. Jack Vance is VASTLY entertaining and his name should be mentioned far more often. I can't believe I am in my 30s and did not hear about vance growing up. A TRAVESTY lie Glen Cook a almsot unknown but unbeleivably great author. I can only be made somewhat content that he wrote a great many works which I can now devour, for his tales leave one hungering for more exotic adventure. Movies should be made of these tales! Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but my copy was missing pages","review":"I enjoyed what I could read of this book very much. The stories were imaginative and I was always wondering how Cugel was going to get out of his scrapes. Unfortunately, my copy of the book has a serious problem. After page 570 comes page 539 again. Then the pages go up to 570 again and the next page is 603. That means I missed the ending of \\"Cugel's Saga\\" and the beginning of \\"Rhialto the Marvellous\\". This ruins two out of four books in the volume. I would send it back but I live in Korea and it would probably be cheaper and less trouble to buy another copy of the book. Which I won't do because I am afraid of getting another faulty one. Still, I highly recommend this book but check the page numbers when you get it so you can return it quickly if there is a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped Hodgpodge","review":"I looked forward to a bunch of great stories about the future of earth and how mankind was dealing with it. Instead this was three or four books obviously done at different times that were were slapped together to form a somwhat continuous story for the most part. I liked the first couple of stories and then the repetitiveness of Cugel wore me out. Unrepentent, scurrilous Cugel was funny for the first 30 pages but after what seemed like 1000 pages I wanted to bump him off myself.Please beware of the other reviews. Unless you want a semi humorous fantasy novel telling a bunch of semi linked stories about a dying earth with lots of magic then stay the heck away from this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the worst fantasy I've ever read","review":"I have a very eclectic reading taste, and usually find something to enjoy in pretty much any book I pick up to read. And yet this work was impossible for me to enjoy. And I tried. What others call \\"purposely obscure prose\\" I call just plain lousy writing.The stories may actually have had some merit were the prose more pleasant...but then, I doubt it, which brings me to the next problem I found with this work. None of the characters were likeable and the world, though others have called it well designed, is just a collection of random whimsy and fancy. The two combined would make the stories difficult to enjoy even if the prose weren't so painful to read.All in all, out of the thousands of fantasy books that I have read, this is the worst of the bunch. It is the ONLY one I had to continually push myself not to toss in the trash without finishing...ever.

The terribly is because some people feel the author is deserving of a Nobel prize and would get it if his name were perhaps Hispanic and he from a different country (check Google for this). This book is (as far as I could stand to read it) a compendium of fantastical and (this is the difficulty) boring adventures. The second tale which finally made nauseous was a sort of reverse Candide where an definitely not innocent encounters all sorts of adventures with not very nice people and manages to out screw them all. Better authors include, J K Rowling, Ann Rice, and Dorris Lessing.

We don't connect the box directly to our house telco line (only to a phone and to the PC), so the trouble is not due to line disturbances (e.g., lightning).

It took my a little while to figure out why I could not hear the phone ringing when I called someone. They also couldn't hear me. After checking the SkypeMate forum, I adjusted the settings under Control Panel >>> Sound and Audio Device Properties >>> Voice. You want the Voice Playback and Voice Recording options to be set to USB.

Simple to install and the voice quality is pretty good.However, sharing the phone with a landline is a bit troublesome. The adapter switches between lines when asterisk (*) is pressed.

I now receive calls through my skype number on what I call my 'internet phone'.

Totally cool, and saves me minutes on the cell plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"USB Phone adapter","review":"This product works with Skype but the problem is that if you have several phone, like a 5 phone cordless system, it will ring the other phones while you are taking a call. If someone picks up that call, it will drop your call. If that wasn't an issue, I would likely have rave reviews for this item and sell it to most of our business client, FYI we are an IT Support company. We wanted a simple small business VOIP solution for Skype but this item failed at that, as most have unfortunately. It's said when something that is obvious doesn't work intuitively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"This product is listed as \\"Connects home phone to network\\". This is misleading. It should say, \\"Connects home phone to computer\\".I wanted a product that connected to the network directly. I can use Skype through my computer if I want, but I wanted something that didn't need my computer. This product isn't it. It plugs directly into your USB on your computer and nothing else.What's the point of this thing if I have to plug it into my computer? I still have to keep my computer up and running all the time if I want a home phone for skype. Therefore, this thing is useless for my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skype Mate","review":"This device takes control of the speakers, I cannot listen radio from internet when the device is connected.

This device has an issue with the current version of Skype that does not allow it to properly dial out.On the positive side, setup and configuration are pretty straightforward. Everything actually works well once you're dialed out, you just have to dial out directly from the Skype client itself instead of from a phone.The problem is that Skype doesn't 'reset' properly after a call is terminated and doesn't clear out the previous number dialed. As a result, when you go to dial the next time, the previous number is still there and gets dialed instead.Upon research, this is a common problem and the only solution seems to be to revert back to a very old version of Skype (not ideal)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced - Cheaply Made - Defective","review":"**My experience regarding this item was both frustrating and time consuming. I was optimistic when I purchased this item, but it quickly disappeared shortly after it arrived. This item not only was completely ineffective, it crashed and 'froze' my computer each of the many times I installed and uninstalled the software.The box itself is nothing more than a plastic container filled with frustration and cheaply produced electronics which fail to perform the simplest tasks.In my view, this item needs to left on the shelf in favor of a more productive adapter.**"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"When we first bought this device, everything worked fine for a few weeks. Then the phone stopped ringing and you could no longer dial out with the phone, only from the computer. You could make calls from the computer, but since the phone didn't ring, you couldn't receive calls. Now, about a year later, we can't even dial out. There's no dial tone at all. I haven't been able to fix it, so I will have to throw it out and start over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"I just wasted four hours of my life.SkyMate SW is obviously NOT working with Skype properly.1) When I set it up, selected USB port as default, than anytime I pressed Talk button it started sounding Alarm tone. No way to turn it off.2) When tried to dial, some digits were duplicated.3) Went on web trying to find solution, per recommendation upgraded SkyMate to newest version, downgraded Skype to 3.8 which turned out does not work with Win7 64-bit. It does not work with any Skype version for me.4) Apparently does not work without landline connection, which I do not have.5) Misleading information in manual, such as which website has latest driver.Nice idea, but extremely poor execution. Would buy when they fix this, which I doubt (Chinese mfg.)Don't waste your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"this item is worthless to me","review":"I need to return this item. The problem is that it must be plugged into a phone line as well as the computer USB connection. What is the point? I need something that does not require a phone line. Further, I am disappointed that there were no cables included with this item and no return or other information in the package. Driver was on a disk that does not install.

Unfortunately, on virtually every song I've heard by him, he goes flat on the last note of almost every line. If you have heard only one or two of his songs and are here to sample the rest of his catalog, this is a warning: if listening to someone go flat over and over and over again during an otherwise listenable tune makes you grit your teeth, then stay away from Dougie's live or studio albums. If, on the other hand, you can overlook the occasionally off-key singing, go for it.

So, don't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a must have for anyone who has a phonetical spelling issue. You are able to look up words according to how it sounds instead of trying to figure out what letter should be there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound-It-Out Speller","review":"Found the book very hard to understand and use, especially for someone who is learning disabled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot, hot, hot!","review":"Hot desert locale, hot scenes fraught with excitement, and lovemaking hot enough to warm my blood as I read. Spike is a delicious hero. An ultra-masculine operative of the SDDU Defense Unit, who puts his life on the line to keep America safe. Talk about high stakes--no less than the fate of the world rests on Spike's muscular shoulders. At first, he sees Abigail as an extra burden, but in her own way, she's as strong as he. She has sacrificed comfort and safety in order to teach life skills to the orphans of a small desert village.Sacrificing her singlehood is another matter, but she does it when she realizes it's the only way she can continue her life's work. The sudden marriage is just the start of a rollicking adventure yarn full of excitement and passion. Together, the couple fight the elements and terrorists, but they can't fight their attraction for each other.This one goes on the Keeper Shelf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Romantic Suspense","review":"I love Dana Marton's stories! This is an awesome and exciting story. The hero, Spike, is sexy, appealing and romantic. The heroine is smart and he definitely meets his match in her. Fast paced, unpredictable and filled with tension--from their adventure in the desert and their feelings for one another. Don't miss Dana Marton's Intrigues. They are wonderful and out of the ordinary novels that are sure to keep you reading until the last line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Pitched...","review":"This is cover/cosmetic plate for where your stovepipe/round chimney box meets a pitched ceiling. It intuitively installs in short amount of time. All necessary stuff included in packet with smooth, finished look when your done. Very nice and worth the price..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read It Slowly to Get All the Info","review":"I love this book. I fully concur with the other positive reviews here that praise the beauty, layout, and writing quality. Futher, what I love is that the book informs and intrigues on several levels -- you can read it very slowly and carefully to get a lot of insight from all the maps and legends. Or, you can browse through it very fast, like flipping through a magazine. Whatever your level of intensity, you'll learn something and enjoy the book. As such, it makes an excellent gift for those with a lot of knowledge of Celts or even an elementary school child whose curiosity you'd like to stimulate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good books","review":"The Watcher's Guides are good books, but you should know a few things before you buy volumes one and two as a set. (1) On Amazon, the books are cheaper separately. (2) The two volumes cover only the first four seasons of the show. There is now a third volume that covers seasons 5 thru 7. (3) There are other guides by different authors that cover more than four seasons in a single volume. (I think \\"Dusted\\" by Lawrence Miles and the newest Buffy guide from Keith Topping cover **all 7** seasons.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn About The Scooby Gang","review":"These are really great source books for Buffy fans. The Watcher's Guide books not only answer your questons, there are also some great photos and quotes from the Scooby gang. Christopher Golden, Nancy Holder, andKeith R.A. Decandido all did a wonderful job on these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I purchased this product while in school. Many of the questions were wrong and the point pictures were not in the actual place. It was so bad that many students at my school had to return it. I tried to return the product to the creator and he wanted me to go through the hundreds of questions to find out which one were incorrect. I even verified the question through the book he wrote and the required MSOM text. The 1st (CD)software that I purchased would not even download to my computer. I had to be sent the info via e-mail from the company for the initial download. For almost $200 and many incorrect answers this software was not worth it.I wasted alot of money and time on this product and was not effective in passing or studying for the boards. I would check out other test prep software. I took the BIOMED and none of the questions were on the boards or close to it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wicked Smile","review":"What a wonderful read. Officer Johathan Harding makes a deal with a Mr. Sol Berner that allows him to extent an investigation forty years into the past. Hardings is motivated to find out why his father, a chemical engineer, was murdered. But, while in the past, Harding uncovers a family secret linking his parents to the mob. DiChiara's tongue-in-cheek writing style gives the reader a delightfully wicked romp in 1949."},{"rating":"1","title":"inapropriate front cover","review":"The inappropriate front page illustration would probably stop most people from looking further into the contents of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"well-documented account of one beach volleyball team's trial","review":"Karbo does an excellent job documenting Team Nike's trials and tribulations both on the sand and off. The style of writing is rather straigh-forward making the book hard to put down. I especially like the way Karbo has intermittently slid in chapters in which Reece describes herself, her feelings, emotions, etc. regarding both her abilities as an athlete in an up-and-coming sport and as a model. The most enjoyable parts of the book are the chapters in which Reece is giving the blow-by-blows of herself and her perspectives on life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gabby Reece's book Rocks!","review":"I loved reading BIg Girl in the Middle! I was amazed to find that Gabrielle Reece was more fascinating than I thought she'd be. The girl is witty, beautiful, and she has some pretty deep thoughts on a lot of things-and a great deal of insight to back it all up! I think she should seriously be considered as a good example of a role model for girls, and some people out there would probably be better off if they acted more like her!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome to Gabby's ego-trip","review":"\\"People are already pissed off at me because I'm athetic AND beautiful; to be smart in addition to that...it's like, too much.\\" And that quote sums up this book in a nutshell: the breathtakingly beautiful Reece telling us how hard she works and how smart she is. Interspersed througout is co-author Karen Karbo clucking in agreement (for example, detailing a Nike PR session where Gabby makes snappy insults at questioners). For the first half of the book its unabashed unhumbleness is refreshing, but by the end you ask yourself if the world really needs any more athletes/supermodels/intellectuals with \\"attitude.&quot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Santana Compilation","review":"This is probably the best available Santana compilation.

It's one of the most entertaining tunes I've groove to in a long time. Toss in classic Carlos and this turns out to be an amazing two disk set.

Some live tracksappear on other releases as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best live albums ever","review":"This is one of my favourite live albums. It really captures the energy and passion of Santana's concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abbreviated to say the least","review":"The problem with this soundtrack is the same with others I've purchased: You don't get all the songs on the soundtrack that you heard on the movie. There were at least two songs I heard on the movie that I bought this soundtrack for. There aren't on it. What a waste. The song playing while the bikers were in the bar and pulled a gun on the waitress was great and also wasn't on the CD. Since I didn't know the name of the song or the artist I couldn't know whether it was on the soundtrack or not. Now this soundtrack sets on the shelf. I will eventually sell it, if I can find anyone willing to pay good money for this joke of a soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"My opinion: this shampoo is majorly overpriced.","review":"I gave this shampoo 2 stars because it does clean hair as advertised.

An elaborate and logically tight outline of the act of self-consciousness. Fichte is attempting to identify the proposition 'I am I' as the absolute ground of all knowledge. There are amazing developments to critical philosophy in this dense material, though the status of the 'not-I' remains logically obscure. Fichte also takes on all his interlocutors in typically belligerent fashion; although the logical form of his argumentation is precise, he is unable to circumvent the ontological problems that Holderlin would later pose. Still this is more than a transitional footnote between Kant and Hegel-it is an extraordinary tour de force of thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to the standards of this series","review":"The \\"you wouldn't want to ...\\" series is great to teach children history, because it shows what life was like. How gladiators trained, how knights fought, and so on. This is very interesting for children.This book only mentions a few details of daily life. Instead, it is a list of battles with their dates and a few details. That makes it boring and irrelevant to the target audience.Save your money for something really good, such asYou Wouldn't Want to Live in a Wild West Town! (You Wouldn't Want to...)orYou Wouldn't Want to Be an American Pioneer! (You Wouldn't Want to...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling book","review":"This is one of the worst books for kids I have ever seen. The text is OK, but the illustrations are terrible. It is done in a cartoon manner, but it makes the soldiers of the Civil War look like a bunch of buffoons. I know the idea is to appeal to young boys--but this book goes too far. On one page dead soldiers are laying in a battlefield--their butts are up in the air and they look more drunk than dead. Scenes depicting amputations are made to look humerous. This is no way to present history. Kids are already de-sensitized to violence, and this book makes it look funny. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, but very Opinionated","review":"I can hardly believe that Edward Tufte, the great guru of design wrote this one. It's great to raise issues, act negative, and point out problems. Let me be frank, today everyone needs to create PowerPoint presentations in so many ways including webcasts. How does Edward Tufte plan to tackle that? Rather than explain how to work around limitations and accept PowerPoint as just another medium, this book goes into a directionless tirade against Microsoft's program.Incidentally, I just read another book and can't resist adding this note here. I love the way color theory for presentations is explained in another book. I always thought Dummies books were for dummies. Now I've changed my opinion. Maybe, it's time Edward Tufte should accept presentations as part of business and industry and use his design ideas to help us create better presentations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Criticism, Few Alternatives","review":"Tufte's criticism of PowerPoint is excellent. He points out its worst failings: low information density, forcing all thought into \\"bullets\\", etc. However, he does not provide suggestions for alternative ways to present quantitative information beyond \\"use other graphical forms\\".Also, potential buyers should note that this essay is included as a chapter in _Beautiful Evidence_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Terribly useful","review":"Not a particularly useful product, I gave it to my boss who does nothing but bitch about the evils of Powerpoint presentations..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhead slides critique","review":"There are now countless aritcles and conversations criticizing PPT.

Tufte Violates His Own Rules.","review":"I'm a big fan of Mr. Tufte.However... this book violates his own rules of presentation.* There is no useful information in the book* It's a rehashing of information everyone else has written* The text is small and dense, with no white space. It's impossible to read* The illustrative charts and graphs have few explanations* I can't tell which illustrations are Tufte's, and which are the source illustrations that he is criticizing* There is no comparison of \\"Good\\" images vs. \\"Bad\\" images* Sorry, Mr. Tufte. I want my $7 back"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the goal?","review":"If your goal is to learn about improving your presentation style, with or without powerpoint, then this book is not for you.IF, however, you are interested in reasons and times not to use powerpoint, this might be OK.If you are looking for a rant on why powerpoint is not an effective presentation tool for complex presentations, this most certainly is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Transformed my view of presentations...","review":"This is a powerful little booklet which completely transformed the way I think about presentations. Unfortunately, it's also highly repetitive, and stunningly arrogant. The same exact point is made over, and over, and over, and over again. Why? And the arrogance displayed by the author is shocking and unnecessary. For example, the many jabs at Microsoft and other software companies. Tufte should stick to the areas he knows about, and share that knowledge, without venturing into areas he knows nothing about, such as his wide ranging tirade against software companies. It's easy to find plenty of areas in which Tufte could use some education from those very software companies - just try to book a seminar on his web site. It's the worst e-commerce flow I've ever seen. All of that notwithstanding, the booklet has still had a significant and highly positive change in the way I will think about and prepare presentations, and for that, I give it four stars."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],N={key:0},C={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",C,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-6e7fc3ef"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/11.md","filePath":"people/11.md"}'),j={name:"people/11.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
