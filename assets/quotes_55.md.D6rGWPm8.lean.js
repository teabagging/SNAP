Then the elevator does move, but not upward. It falls,picking up speed by the minute. You're nearing the ground. Then-The Hotel is now closed. It is supposedly haunted now.

I dont want distortion on every signal sent to it. If i wanted distortion, i would get a distortion box.

I spent more time rereading Greene's sentences than any other book I can remember with little to show for it. Apparently, Greene feels that filling her book with long rambling quotes, endless lists of examples, arcane terminology, unnecessary adjectives, and run on sentences gives it some gravitas.

Apparently Brecht did not understand that by selling the screen rights to the script, he was also giving the producers liscence to do whatever the wanted with it - and he had no power over it. The endind is notably changed from any translation you are likely to find in print, and few of the best songs remain - as a matter of fact, i recall only about four or five songs in the film verison. Mr. And Mrs. Peachum, while wonderfully portrayed, are far from the middle-class underlords we love them to be - they were a mismatched pair, Mrs. Peachum in a fabulous dress, and drop earings, and Peachum looking like one of his beggars.

That said, the formula approach to Christianity in this book, I found, was very shallow. She may have overcome much in her life, but the implication in this book is to take Bible promises which are only intended for Heaven and apply them to here and now. We live in a fallen world and this book implies that God is responsible for solving all our problems here and now. Holding God to promises only intended for Heaven leads to frustration and anger at God when he seemingly does not come through.

What I liked about the book was that it showed not only the cars but a lot of the advertisements in the the industry's \\"golden age\\" of the 1950's.With all the down-turns in the economy as of the writing of this review, and GM, Ford, and Chrysler, all in trouble, and the fact that the age of innocence is long gone, it is fun to get into this book every once in a while and look at cars when they had personality, when they didn't all look alike, and when the new model year in September was something exciting to look forward to.This is more of a \\"memory book\\" and it chronicles the emergence of the automobile in all its different shapes, sizes, and colors. If you are a 'car junkie' like me, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book if you are just beginning Trigonometry.","review":"This book is good for one thing, a Quick Review. I suppose I can't blame CliffsNotes, since that is given in the title of the book. I bought this book when I was beginning to learn Trigonometry, along with another textbook. I found that a lot of the things the textbook went over was not even mentioned in this Quick Review book. If you have taken Trigonometry in the past and want to refresh some of the basic trigonometry concepts, then this book is for you. However, if you know nothing about Trigonometry and want to learn about it, this book will do nothing but CONFUSE you.Most people that will look into these books are people who want to learn the subject for their first time, so take my advice: instead of buying this book, save that money towards a better, complete basic trigonometry textbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid conclusion to Lycia's legacy","review":"After this seventh album, Lycia closed shop. Somehow, they manage to blend the guitar haze of \\"Ionia,\\" the dream-synth of \\"The Burning Circle and Then Dust,\\" and the upbeat drum tracks of \\"Wake.\\" The vocals are the same as always; Tara's the maiden, Mike is the ghost hovering nearby. Might as well go out strong.\\"Estrella\\" continues Lycia's tradition of using sound to create a season. The opening track sets the scene: you're lying face-up in a grassy field at 7 pm. It's about 65 degrees. Slowly, you realize the atmosphere has peeled away, and you can see every single star. These songs get as close to a \\"summer\\" theme as anything in Lycia's past. After years of making music to beat the Arizona heat, it was time.This is a soothing, hypnotic closing chapter for Lycia. After the autumn leaves have blown away and the snow has melted, \\"Estrella\\" invites the listener to look up and hear the stars dragging themselves across the sky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lycia does it again...","review":"After the departure of sideman instrumentalist David Galas, who contributed significantly to their previous two albums _Cold_ and _The Burning Circle And Then Dust_, Lycia are now just Mike and Tara. Tara has taken up some of the slack, although not in the same capacity; her swooning, blissful lyrics and vocals lead more than half of the songs, up from 3 on _Cold_ and just 2 on _Burning Circle_. They also demonstrate an increased stylistic range and clarity, as on the Dead Can Dance-ish \\"Tongues\\" and stark \\"El Diablo\\". Meanwhile, Mike returns with his bare, unique single-string guitar parts, thoughtful instrumentals (\\"Clouds In The Southern Sky\\", \\"Distant Fading Star\\"), and haunting, whispered vocals, as well as bringing back the simpler rhythmic forms of the earliest Lycia material. All in all, enrapturing and very satisfying, as only Lycia can be. Count yourself lucky, as I do, if you know and love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another hit in the emptiness of space.","review":"Epic. Truly incredible. A mesmerizing journey into the outer regions of space-time with threads extending back to the nether ages. Lycia have done it again. A distant shining star indeed.

This album, filled with stellar imagery (Lycia tend to have themes on their albums - Estrella means 'star'), is certainly one to be enjoyed at night. The best tracks are filled with brooding, trippy atmospherics, with Tara's voice blending in and out, making for one of those listening experiences after which you wonder why it went by so quickly, feeling like for a little while you were at a place just a bit more magical than this one, longing for more. Best enjoyed with a skylight, away from light pollution, in full view of the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"These blades are great.

I have a sharp jawline and I must say these blades do not conform to it at all. Several strokes in different directions and techniques trying to get the blade to cut, only left my face sore and far from smooth.

I was missing out.These blades are head & shoulders over the lame ones you'll get at your local discount store. I've cut myself twice while shaving with these blades, but only because I was trying to rush myself. The blade seems sharper and it seems to hold it's edge much longer than the ones I was using previously. I've definitely noticed less tugging on the hairs.Aside from the blade upgrade, the next best thing I did was buying grapeseed oil to replace my expensive art of shaving pre-shave, and buying some poraso shaving cream to replace my expensive art of shaving cream.I've been shaving for almost 15 years and I'm just NOW getting the best (and cheapest) shaves of my life.

However, pretty much any RTS on a videogame system is bound to have control problems and C&C3; is no exception. This game is very fast paced for an RTS, and when there's a horde of bad guys attacking your base, you dont want to be fumbling around with a control stick trying to select your soldiers.For me anyway, this game is just to fast paced for an RTS, but usually awesome battle scenes and graphics make this game at least somwhat enjoyable.

Most of the work suggestions are irrelevant to the self-employed who aren't part of an organization or anyone who doesn't have co-workers. And the time-management advice was just a rehash of some of the principles from other books, such as Stephen Covey's. This book might be valuable to people who've never taken a step toward clarifying priorities or time management, and who work in an organization in which they're continually negotiating work issues with others, but I didn't gain any insight whatsoever from it, and found it a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accessible Translation","review":"First off, this is the N.K.

And there's a reason why it has endured for so long.This translation is accessible to all levels of students. The language is easily negotiated without losing the overall intent of the original Sumerian. Not that I actually read cuneiform, but I've read enough translations of Gilgamesh, not to mention critical writing on the subject, to know what a good translation sounds like.Unless you've read anything in ancient Sanskrit, this will most likely be the oldest thing you will ever read, and that includes the Old Testament.

I read what he recommended:Gilgamesh: A New English Version by Stephen MitchellandGilgamesh by John Gardner and John MaierThese two translations were very enjoyable and read like true epics.

You use it to sweep like a broom, and when done you push a button and the broom head turns into a vacuum to clean up the mess. However, there are some big problems stemming from the design of this product. First, the broom bristles are surrounded by a very thick plastic collar that holds the vacuum mechanism. The size of this collar makes it impossible to sweep under furniture because if you place the broom at the normal angle you would use to sweep under a chair then the plastic will be hitting the floor instead of the broom bristles. Second, the vacuum is very weak. I swept up a pile of dust bunnies and found that after several passes with the vacuum the pile had not been picked up just smeared around.

The conclusion...this \\"toy\\" is worthless and we returned it! Let us begin this review by stating we have VERY smooth painted walls and tested this item for an entire battery charge. The fact is that it will only run on very smooth floors (i.e., wood & some tile), is loud just driving it normally...but when it attempts to climb and the fans kick in...WOW! During our test we attempted to run it across our wood floors (it did fine), into a wall without any trim (it slowly began to tilt upward), and this is where it stayed! It was unable to climb without assistance. Once it got going, it could not sustain itself and continually kept sliding back down the wall. This was in a straight line! Anytime you attempted to make any turn it slid drastically or fell off the wall. Great idea for a toy, but horribly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"not worth the dough at ALL","review":"its fun but falls off the wall quite a bit and honestly does not DO much. especially for this amount of money. it goes along the rug and then up the wall WHOOPY. Plus we have mouldings so it cannot go over those- we have to get it started OR put a ramp (piece of wood or even a book works)its cute, its fun but honestly - my twins got it for christmas and have played with it three times. they just don't ask for it. they are playing with everything else a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing","review":"This is a very dissappointing toy. Yes it does climb walls and that part was very fun to my son but the charge on the battery lasted 15 minutes at best then had to be charged overnight to get the full 15 minutes of use again. After a couple times of that, he lost interest. The bottom side ripped very easy and it was only used on carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"ZERO disipointment for ZERO gravity humvee","review":"This thing is sick. I honestly thought this would be a cheap toywhen I saw it on TV,but geuss I was wrong. When we where geting in our parking lot from the Mancister HYATT about 2 days ago itwas sitting right on my front porch. We diden't pay for it oranithing,yet it was siting right there on my front porch. You now what, it was my friend he gave his own toy to me. Plus I gotit for free.And geuss what,I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO stars for ZERO Gravity","review":"We had a very disappointed boy on Christmas Day. I was dubious about this product so I had a back up r/c gift on hand, thank goodness.The zero gravity r/c hummer is a piece of junk. We followed the charging and operating instructions to a T, and it is just an awful, overpriced toy. It does not move AT ALL on even low pile carpet. It did not climb our walls (there is a makeshift ramp included if your walls have baseboards) AT ALL. I took it back the very next day, as I am sure many will be doing. Shame on Air Hogs for selling this junk to kids. Come to think of it, I have never had an air hogs product that worked..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Trouble","review":"Read all the reviews.

Definitely not worth all the money spent on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be disappointed","review":"Purchased this wall climber for my niece and it worked (and I use the term worked very loosely) approximately twice before it lost suction due to a fan motor failure. Jumped through the hoops to get a replacement from SpinMaster, and that one didn't work much better. Could be a great toy with a little more attention to quality parts, but for the price, you don't get what you paid for by any means. Great concept, very poor product. My recommendation is to keep looking for a better toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Kids?","review":"I thought this toy was a joke! So it can climb walls. But the outside of the box fails to tell you that you can only use it indoors, not on carpet, only on a flat surface, and that if you have molding from your floor to your wall, it doesn't work either. When we purchased this for our son we assumed that you could use it like most R/C vehicles PLUS it would climb walls. Not that climbing walls is the ONLY thing it would do. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the motor is extremely loud for other small children in the house. For kids, this toy will be cool for about 2 mintues until they realize they can only use it under STRICT circumstances. We returned it the next day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lesson Learned","review":"All parents know that kids want everything they see on TV. I have to praise this Zero Gravity gadget for breaking my son of that habit. He has learned early that commercials embellish the truth.We tried every wall in our house. If we helped it get on the wall it would climb a little bit. Sadly it only worked on one floor of our house. It would not work on any carpet, tho they are all low pile. It would not work on the playroom vinal. It would work on the kithen floor, but did not make it over the baseboard. THey are generous enough to give you a card board ramp, that helps alittle as long as you tape it into place frequently.This item simply does not work as advertised. I am sure there are people who have a home with exactly the right conditions, ours was not one of them. Since we tried this item in a total of 6 rooms with a variety of floor and wall surfaces I can not imagine the home suitable for this product are in the majority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most exciting new toy technology in years!","review":"Well just when you thought they could not reinvent the wheel, someone comes along and suprises you! For years the only new thing in radio controlled cars were for them to make them \\"more extreme\\" which meant they made them larger, louder and uglier. This toy though is something else. It actually drives on the wall! I must have taken a lot of time and energy to get this right but it sure works great. I have found that the smoother the wall the better. And it Does Not mark up the walls. Just try to avoid running over items when it is on the wall as it will loose it \\"downforce\\". They toy is very durable so it should provide a lot of fun for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real dissappointment at the party","review":"My son saw this cool new toy on t.v. like all the others and wanted it for his 6th birthday. We got it and it was a hit opening up the package until we tried to use it. First of all, I don't know how many people live in a house without trim, so take that into big consideration when you do your research. The hummer was so loud like a leaf blower but would not go up anything. We tried to give it the benefit of the doublt and let it charge over night. The next day, we made sure the wheels were clean, found a good spot without trim on the walls, and gave it a go. It kept falling down, even with assistance, it struggled to go anywhere but on the floor. On the floor, the kids wanted us to turn it off because it was so loud. Another down fall was the remote. It was not easy to steer for my 6 year old or his 11 year old cousin. We had to take it back and I don't recommend it especially for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT DISAPOINT YOUR CHILD WITH THIS ONE!","review":"THIS IS A TERRIBLE TOY! IT NEEDS A 4 HOUR CHARGE TO RUN FOR 15 MINUTES - IT CANNOT CLIMB ANY WALL ON ITS OWN (YOU MUST PLACE IT ON THE WALL). IT'S JUST NO FUN. I AM SORRY FOR ALL THE KIDS THAT HAVE THIS AT THE TOP OF THEIR CHRISTMAS LIST - THEY WILL OPEN IT UP, WAIT HOURS TO PLAY WITH IT AND THEN BE SO DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but very loud.","review":"This is one of the best toys I've seen in years, I was so excited when I seen it, I ran out and got one the next day. I puchased this as a gift, but I had to try it myself first. I was immediatly disapointed to see the battery had died, as it was supposed to be charged and ready to go. I charged it for a few minutes, and was instantly impressed. It was very fragile, and noisey, as it uses vacuam power, but it really went up the wall.This is an amazing breakthrough for R.C. toys. Any kid or adult would be blown away to get this gift. I give it 4 Stars, losing only on the noise factor. ( It is REALLY loud!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"atrocious quality","review":"This is a great movie but the picture quality is atrocious and the running time is only 85min not the 105min advertised!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ripoff","review":"A shameless Italian-made ripoff of The Sting, even down to the pseudo-ragtime music. As other reviewers have mentioned, the colors in the transfer to DVD are terrible. Really only for those who are perversely interested in watching the downward spiral of Anthony Quinn's post-1960s career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"Simply not a book for beginners or even those with some basic physics knowledge which is what this book claims. This is due to the lack of context with which most of the equations are introduced. A beginner wouldn't even get past the first page!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the Cat?!","review":"This book is completely useless. It describes itself as basic enough for beginners yet complex enough for advanced students. I would consider myself somewhere in between this, but didn't find either of these claims to be valid.Equations are introduced with no context what-so-ever. I expected something that would be a gentle enough (re-)introduction to the subject. No, it's just straight in there with no explanation of anything. On the cover there is a nice cartoon of Schrodinger and his cat - which suggests the tone of book. Unfortunately, this is misleading (I know: books, covers, judging etc) - the cat never appears. Schrodingers equation appears - but I had to go elsewhere to find out its origins.I can't suggest an alternative - but stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many Mistakes!","review":"This book is so full of mistakes, it's hard to follow. The examples skip over a lot of the math, occasionally making it difficult to figure out how they got from point A to point B. This is made even worse by the fact that the answer they end up with might be full of typos. They do stupid stuff like using + instead of = or writing the wrong exponent on a variable, but they also skrew up important equations from time to time. I'm wasting a lot of time in my reading of this text trying to figure out when and where the book went wrong. I would definitely NOT recommend this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time.","review":"As commented on by many reviewers there are numerous typos and errors in the math. The author presents some ideas very clearly. It is a shame that the learning is then sabotaged by these errors. A new edition is clearly needed and the first edition should be withdrawn.

David McMahon's QMDm book is the most detailed and helpful review the mathematical structure of QM I could find. His very many, fully-worked out math examples are unique in published form. You cannot begin to get your head around QM without doing the math drills and getting familiar with bras, kets, eigenvectors, eigenvalues, operators, states, Pauli matrices, and so on. Yep, there are many typos, but discovering and fixing them became just some extra homework! It has been about forty years since I last studied this material. Struggling with the excellent Dirac \\"Principles of Quantum Mechanics\\" was too big a jump for me without McMahon's help. Understanding QM without the matrix math is like listening to a baseball game without understanding numbers. Learn the \\"numbers.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorably Inaccurate","review":"This book does strike awe and amazement in the reader, but only because of the sheer volume of inaccuracies and discrepancies riddled throughout it. I think the author should apologize for making a quick buck, correct the problems and send a free book to all of us who actually wanted to learn physics by working through problem sets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantum Mechanics Mystified Only Slightly Further","review":"The first time I read this book, I was shocked at the amount of mathematics without accompanying explanations. A person of college-level education is sure to know what an \\"outer product\\" is, but would it really have hurt to include a quick analogy or two to help the inexperienced mathematician get a grasp of the concept? Not only that, I noticed two glaring errors and one outright omission. Overall, not reccomended for anyone, especially the newbie to quantum mechanics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sufficient Book","review":"Early explanations are adequate but no so perfect, good guide to learn the basics of QM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor manufacturing","review":"We were excited about this product, it seemed like a great value, both a hitting T and batting practice for the price of just a hitting T, but were disappointed in the product. The first one arrived damaged (wouldn't hold water in base due to a small crack), so we ordered a replacement thinking it was just a manufacturing defect. The second broke (also in the base) with the first use by our 3 year old son, a huge double crack inside the base that gushed the water out (which, of course, it just falls over if there is no heavy water base). We returned it, and requested a refund (I love Amazon's easy returns!), won't be ordering from this manufacturer again! Instead, we will order a standard T, we're just disappointed this didn't work out: great idea, needs manufacturing work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in the way the product works.

The 2 hours of music presented here can be very emotionally draining when listened to in one sitting, and I think that's the point. Michael Plaster actually forces you to feel what he is going through using slow acoustic guitar and somewhat sparse production in addition to his beautifully honest vocals. This is an album that has the ability to move you to tears.While the album mostly works as a whole rather than seperate songs, there are a few standout tracks, mostly on disc 2..the best being \\"The Last Time I Left\\", one of the few tracks on the album with drums. Its simple piano and vocals truly express the sadness and denial within the lyrics.This is an album that shouldn't be overlooked. Stark, haunting, beautiful.."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is truly amazing....","review":"Soul Whirling Somewhere's Michael Plaster expresses views that have for sure been shared by everyone else on this planet and is bold enough to bring out these feelings.

The rest all sounds wish washy. There is no structure to most of thesongs and the muscianship is quite mediocre. The vocals however, are intriguing, soft, and emotional. You just wish it would reach some sort of peak, but the songs just never take off. Amazingly enough I will write this same review for Please Send Help. This project could really take off with a full band to accompany Plaster's ability as a songwriter/singer/guitar player. Save your self some cash and purchase this from projekt's website for only $[a bit o money]. It's really how much this album should be regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noah","review":"Well, what can I say? I love Tony Danza and all, but I really didn't think that highly of this movie. Mostly for religious reasons. He was a neglectful father, he didn't accept the offer, God tried to punish him for not taking the job, he was not approached by God, but by a mysterious stranger. His son wants the ark destroyed, and all he's interested in is himself. No where in the bible does it say anything about all those things. God's word is the truth, and this movie turned it in to almost a complete lie. I only watched this movie half way through, so I give it thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Largely dissapointing","review":"This could have been excellent, and does in fact include many very nice, albeit tasteful, photos of the Corrs.

It was right before the massive midwest blackout in the summer of '03. During the blackout, it became my constant companion. It was the only way to get a little news about what was happening and the progress (if any) to ending it. And it worked well.Its small proportions shouldn't fool you. The sound it generates is quite impressive. Of course, it doesn't have digital tuning so stations are a bit hard to find and lock onto but once you do, it hangs right in there. The antenna is quite long and maybe one drawback is that it nearly outweighs the radio. If you fully extend the antenna, it is hard to keep it upright but it also performs quite well on its back. I can get a couple of TV stations with it but that's not my main interest. The battery life is excellent in this model.If you're looking for a small, inexpensive portable that gets good AM/FM, this little guy is hard to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"JENSEN has gone down the tubes","review":"I bought this because of the Jensen name. Don't waste your money. It's just OK as an AM/FM. BUT I purchased it because of the TV audio capabilities. It's worthless for TV reception.

I'm VERY unhappy with this radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow ... Nice Sound ... So Small!","review":"I received the Jensen MR-400 today (15Nov02) and was pleasantly surprised. The first thing I did was put the batteries in wrong, so ensure that you do not do that, or they will ruin the unit ... luckily I took them out quickly.The reception is GREAT and the TV works amazingly well ... uses only two AA size batteries ... better reception than my much larger and more expensive Sony AM/FM/TV radio.Wow ... it is so small ... you will be amazed at its size. After using it today at the river listening to my favorite TV program, I am impressed because I was 25 miles from the station out in the boonies.I will update this later if it should prove warranted.Good Luck,John GSan Antonio"},{"rating":"1","title":"God awful","review":"It is an embarrassment to social psychology to call this a textbook.

With the choices of grade C guest actors such as Rose O'Donnell, Paula Abdul (whom I do like), Kim Kardashian, and in last nights preview clip,the Good Ole Southern Backwoods Bottom Feeder, Nancy Grace, leads one to think, Good God, who's in charge of the casting?

She is a great sparse, world-weary, singer-songwriter (she penned or collaborated on 8 out of these 10 songs).

The slower pace that's been blown in the dust by our typical routines and life's moments. And for the most part, her tales are solemn and deep.

I dislike the twangy voice, which she could discard and greatly improve her singing, if not her songs.That so many people really dig this singer is a very, very sad commentary on the listeners ability to discriminate between genuine worth and bogus pretensions. Comparing her to John Prine is disgraceful--he has written his share of poor songs, but he has also written quite a few good to excellent ones.By the way, too many people get turned on by what they consider to be poetry in songs. Please... Lyrics are not poetry, and calling them poetic degrades poetry as well as songs. If you want poetic, read poetry.

It is my opinion that authors who attempt to use history as their stage for fiction must be held accountable for their veracity and lack thereof. Historical accuracy is the glue that holds a story such as this together. And in my view, it falls apart in too many places. I freely admit that this novel is listed as a \\"Fantasy\\" and I accept it as such. And the historical settings chosen are of an interesting variety. The first several chapters are very captivating and well conceived. However, just as the story begins with great promise it ends like the last swallow of a flat beer.

The story was very well developed and thought out. I loved the way the author integrates the characters into the progression of history. Even though the book jumps from time period to time period, each incarnation of the characters leaves off where the previous incarnation stopped; this created one continuous story line with the more or less same basic characters.

Listening to his gypsie goth music I was delighted in his sound, it was a nice change from the standard of goth/industrial that I usually listen to. In live performance, Voltair is both humourious and whitty. I can only wish he had more out. As a DJ I have made the song Alchemy Monday from his forthcoming cd Almost Human my opening song for Monday morning goth radio show. This is definately a guy to check out. Buy his record or else some loser in lack denim with glow in the dark fangs who thinks he is 520 years old yet he is in the 8th grade and lives in his \\"lair\\" which is his mother's attic will come and beat you with Voltaire's OhMyGoth comic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voltaire is Projekt's best release","review":"Projekt records owner Sam Rosenthal was definately on tosomething when he decided to sign Voltaire to their roster. Unlikeother Projekt bands who tend to be a bit keyboard heavy and tragically romantic, Voltaire comes out swinging. Incredibly witty and devilishly accurate, Voltaire dwells on subjects that we choose not to speak of. On my favorite track \\"Because I'm Evil\\", Voltaire plays devil's advocate and doesn't seem too concerned with the consequences of his actions. The shortest song \\"Owee\\", Voltaire dedicates the song to every man who's heart has been broken by singing. \\"you hurt me and now I can never forgive you\\". The rest of the album falls under the same violin driven Gothic-rhumba pace (you don't believe me?) and will keep you entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"the thrill of the bris","review":"this is an outrageously spectaular album. a must have for any gothic youth.

I was going to purchase a new regulator, but, in order to do this, I would have to buy a complete manifold at a cost of around $80 including shipping. This is almost as much as I paid for the compressor, so I have decided to try another brand this time--and a new one rather than a reconditioned item. The lack of individual, inexpensive parts, and the difficulty in finding the parts, prompted my decision to buy another brand. I can't afford to buy or repair a compressor every two years, particularly when it has had very limited use and has been treated with care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regulator busted after minimal use over two years time.","review":"I have owned this compressor four a little over two years. I am a home owner that used to work doing finish carpentry. I used this compressor to trim out my house inside, some windows outside and build a deck. During hurricane sandy I needed it to quickly build a leantwo for my generator after the power went and the regulator failed on me after firing two nails. I geuss you get what you pay for. It took weeks for the new part to arrive, they were backordered across the web. I clearly am not the only one to have this problem and it is not a warranty item. The part cost $55 plus $10 for shipping. Ouch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A new piece of equipment needs repair","review":"The tank pressure gauge did not work. I called Porter Cable and they told me to take it to their local service center which was The Tool Store in Green Bay. They told me that they were very busy and it would take two weeks for the repair. It disappoints me to be required to wait two weeks to use a NEW piece of equipment to be repaired, plus, the inconvenience of travelling 60 miles round trip twice(once to drop it off and then to pick it up two weeks later. Not a happy customer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for reptile keepers !","review":"IMO this video is a 'must have' for anyone that keeps reptiles. Its great for those just starting to keep reptiles because it opens up a whole new world the the Herping hobby/passion. For those that have been Herpers for a while its fun to watch and may even show you some things you didn't know or didn't realize the scope of some of the aspects of the Herping community. This is not an instructional or a 'how to' for keeping reptiles. This video takes you out in the field \\"Herping\\", to a major reptile show, talks with some of the breeders of reptiles, shows you what some of us do for fun ( Herpetological Society and Ren Fest ) and many other things. Get this video, you won't regret it. Thanks to Dav and his crew for making this film !! And check out Herpers 2 !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent compendium of the Cistercian tradition.","review":"This book forms part of a series on the exploration of Christian traditions. It served my purposes beautifully since I was curious at probing the development and the differences between the various RC orders. Esther De Waal is quite an expert on the Cistercian tradition, being an erudite Merton scholar. In this book, she writes an easy to read synopsis of the Cistercian Order and what makes it unique. I find the book informative and invitng to read. It also introdued me to some greats such as St. Bernard and Aelred. An excellent addition to a religious library."},{"rating":"2","title":"ATLANTA","review":"Atlanta is a fantastic case study, its pro business stance, it's racial past and present, it makes a great southern story, worthy of Faulkner, Williams, and Whelty. Alanta's black political elite decided to work with the white business elite, it was either that or become Memphis or New Orleans. The other reviewer makes Atlanta's story sound like a black thing, but it could have never happened without the white buckhead business elite, get real, money makes the world go round. One of the biggest contriversies today is the demographics of Atlanta, which is becoming more and more caucasion persuasion, and the black mayor of atlanta says, if they pay tax's and are making the city richer, so be it..now there is a politician and a perfect example of why Atlanta is so successful. As for this book, it's well researched, but definitely has an agenda, but i highly recommend it, but it's not the last word on Atlanta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written Overview of tax heavens","review":"I expected to get advice on the legality of establishing an offshore corporation. In particular, how to legally retain earnings inside the corporation.Instead I got a very general review of many World Tax Heavens, a kind of information I could read on the internet for free.The book is strewn over with useless bits of information.

I am extremely pleased with the clarity and ease of adjustment on this scope. The 4-inch eye relief is a good feature for rifles with a fair amount of recoil. This would be a great slug gun scope. I have owned many brands of scopes and I am as happier with this purchase, based on quality and cost, than any other scope I have purchased. I would certainly buy another Mueller scope. While I have not used the red dot illumination for shooting, I have verified it works. The red dot should be a big help in low light situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Even though several others have slammed this book in the reader feedback section, I want to add my note of caution. There are too many characters, and all of them are lacking in depth. It's more like the first few episodes of the show, but it goes downhill very quickly. The book is lacking in charm. I kept turning the pages in the hopes that something would develop, but in the end it was a convulted mess that only made me laugh twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of my time!","review":"This book is plane terrible! I can understand that it doesn't resemble the TV show or the movies. I was actually expecting that and I was curious about it. I wasn't a super big fan of the show anyway, though I liked the episodes I watched. I didn't like the movies, I found them childish. Now, the book is horrible! I kept wishing for Carry to break up with Mr Big! I hated them both and I hated their relationship! I was expecting a book portraying strong, independent, intelligent women, but what I actually found was a bunch of seemingly poor women who didn't have enough money to pay the rent, spending their money on expensive bags and coats and sleeping with rich guys just to get ahead. Oh, and of course! How can I forget about the drugs! They are high all the time! If you haven't read this book: don't read it! Don't buy it! Run while you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Series but still entertaining","review":"I have to admit when I first got the book I expected something similar to the series. Even though this was not the case, I was not dissapointed. A lot of the stories made me laugh out loud to myself. I saw truths in the stories. This book and the series makes one enjoy being a girl!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cynical as hell...be sure you know what you're buying","review":"Despite the several warnings in reviews here about confusing the book with the HBO series, it's easy to confuse the two. After all, the typeface and star of the series is featured on the book's cover. Be aware, though, that the book is nothing like the series. The tone, like Bushnell's other fiction, is bitter and empty. The female characters have shallow lives--they are desperate to get or keep their looks, status, or money by any means possible. The friendships which are fundamental to the series are not part of this world. The male characters are no more interesting or realistic. Bushnell can write, but her characters are unrecognizable to me (thank God!) and her cynical point of view makes you feel sorry for her rather than feeling a connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show was much, much better","review":"I agree with the last reviewer. This was an irritating read, because it portrayed men as losers, and women as desperate. Give us a break! This is filled with stuff that makes you want to stop dating all together. It's not the least bit funny or interesting, like the show is. This could of been a great book. What the heck happened?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The show outshines the book","review":"Considering the popularity and entertainment of the show, Sex and the City, the book, did not bring me nearly as much pleasure. Although easy to read, I had to actually dispose of the book after reading it. I thought the author's descriptions were boring, and stale, and the way the book jumped around without direction was hopeless! HBO- YES, Candace- NO"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, and it sounds realistic!","review":"This book is very well written, witty and entertaining; in my limited experience, it also sounds realistic. The reader shouldn't expect a sociological or psychological study, since the book concentrates on a very small group of women which is hardly representative of any significant female group; on the other hand, the anecdotes are recounted with understanding, wit and sympathy and they do offer interesting insights. Most of the main characters seem fairly insecure but substantially nice - I wonder how realistic THAT is! I recommend this book, very nice read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Apple has worms!","review":"I enjoyed the easy read of this book. I must admit I bought the book after seeing the Showtime series. Although the book details a very small substrata of New York, it presents an insiders view to something you always knew existed. Insecure people with too much money! It is like a literary Los Angeles scene. Instead of movie stars you have writers, brokers, journalists, and eurotrash. It was a nice escape."},{"rating":"1","title":"a collection of some fragmented articles","review":"If you're after Carrie & Mr Big's story, probably you'll be disappointed - instead of a complete storyline, the book is a collection of some fragmented articles (originally appeared on a newspaper). I think the TV drama, which was based on & inspired by this book, is far more entertaining.But I must say Ms Bushnell has made some interesting & remarkable observation of relationship pattern in big cities. Quite impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very different from the beloved show","review":"While this book undoubtedly made a wonderful column, it transalted differently onto the big screen. It is very entertaining, although the cast of characters varies, and the ending differs from SITC's.Bushnell is a great writer, but her fiction feels vastly removed from column work such as this collection.If you can approach this book with an open mind, you may very well enjoy it. If Carrie-mania alone inspires you to read it--you may be starkly let-down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The age of Un-innocence indeed!","review":"'Sex and the City' is fun to read and entertaining. The characters' lives are so outrageous that your life seems dull and predictable in comparison. I love the topics: the toxic bachelors; the guys who date models; threesomes; and the four city girls, including \\"Carrie\\", visiting married women in Conneticut and enjoying themselves, to their surprise.The book is mainly focused on Carrie and her boyfriend, \\"Mr. Big.\\" I love the HBO series based on this book, but the book tells us a different story of love and dating in New York. The book is as fun and as outrageous as the HBO series. A fun read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOVE THE SHOW; HATED THE BOOK","review":"I love sex in the city, the show, but the book just wasn't enough for me; it really lacked something. It didn't give enough details about Big and Carrie or anybody; it was more like a bang bang and your done book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Like other customer reviewers, I bought the book because I enjoy the HBO series. It's amazing that someone read this, though, and thought it would work on screen, because the book is exceptionally slight. No character development, no plot, and no real content. At least it was a fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"What men wish they knew about women and vice versa.","review":"This book is just so bad, don't misunderstand me though, I mean bad in a good way, confused? well stick around then and I shall explain. What I mean is, it is quite an insight to people's bad sides, both women's and men's. It is like reading one long gossipcolumn but less tiresom and ten times funnier. Candace has a wonderful way of completely 'undressing' people so we really feel we know then intimately and know things about them that we don't even know about our closest friends. And might I add, don't really wanna know either. But at the same time she has a way of portraying people so superficially that we really get a taste of the NY facade. The book is very catching, it has that can't-put-it-down-until-it's-finished-quality, it's AB FAB and absolutely worth a read. What doesn't hurt that book either is that it is now a TV show with Sarah Jessica Parker in the leading role as Carrie and the show is definitely watchworthy as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"I didn't expect the book to mirror the TV series, but I did expect Bushnell's writing to be of a higher caliber. I was surprised to see how careless and ordinary her writing is, considering her accolades; this book might have been scribbled slap-dash while commuting on the subway. Disjointed scenes, dull writing style, and you find yourself waiting for the point of each story, only to have it dribble off lamely. The style of this book is that of a conversation with the author, but if you met someone at a party who told such pointless rambling stories, you'd walk away yawning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was hoping for","review":"Very Very dissapointing, I am in love with the series on HBO, so I figured I would equally enjoy the book, but was very dissapointed when I began to read. It is not written in novel format, it is a series of short articles ranging from 1/2 page to 3-4 pages, not in any sort of particular order. Not at all like the short stories in the series. Did not hold my interest for more than 5 pages, I have forced myself to read more, but it is definatley a book most could do without."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is to show what fast food is to haute cuisine","review":"On the show, the characters are well developed and multifaceted. They are good friends, and Carrie (the main character) is likeable and generally admirable. If she were a real person, I'd want her as a friend.In the book, the characters are only sketched. They are merely acquaintances. Carrie is a spoiled brat. If she were a real person, I'd avoid her!I finished reading the book only because I was on the treadmill at the gym with no other entertainment options. But I LOVE the series! That is, I love what I have seen of the series -- the first season, which is on video. I don't have HBO. I eagerly await the next season's videos!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not very good","review":"No plot, weak characters, pointless lives... this book just left a bad taste in my mouth. Random chapters about interviews with perverts interspersed with little tidbits about Carrie and Mr. Big. Who cares? I certainly don't. Bushnell's other books are so much better! Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely disaponted","review":"I was very disaponted with the book. It seemed like the characters were hopping around so much that I couldnt figure out what was going on. I love the movie and I own every season, the book was just disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal and depressive","review":"This book gives a voice to all the jerks out there, but with on irony. This was the first book to imiatate \\"The Wild Girls Club\\" by Anka Radakovich. (A great book.) In fact, two chapters were copyed from Anka's articles in Details Magazine which were published six months before this book came out. How embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got nothing out of this book","review":"Maybe people that socialize in a certain circle can appreciate this book more than I can. I didn't even laugh once while reading it. It seems to me that the fabric of a dating scene has to do with who are in it. Can one expect deep relationships to be formed between shallow people? Maybe that's why the author could write up such a book just based on people in her life?"},{"rating":"1","title":"19th Century Sex (or Sex and the Shtetl)","review":"What was the point of female liberation and emancipation, when all women want is to define themselves through their (missing) halves? Is the modern girl, really not more than a walking incubator? Why did our mothers and grandmothers, burn their bras? Just to make way for Miracle bras with water inlays? Why did woman want to have the option to fend for herself, when really all she wants is to be dependant? Why are we brainwashed into thinking, that singles are social lepers? If all woman wants, is to sit in the boudoir and weave tapestry, we needn't have bothered with women's rights. Girls go out after work, get drunk, have one night stands, hope it's Mr. Right (or Big, for that matter), and to add insult to injury, feel like they have just auditioned for a part in Sex and the City.If the Four Ladies would have lived at the turn of the Century in Poland, they would have been married by now and would have longed for a career.Arranged Marriage anyone??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I do not get HBO but did buy the DVD series of this TV show (the first season).

The writing in the book was dull and un-interesting. Don't waste your time or money -- ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Summer Read.","review":"Good summer read. Not exactly like the TV show so it was fun seeing the differences in characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didnt care for this book.","review":"I am big fan of the HBO series Sex and the City. I waited years to read this book. I could have waited a few more! None of the characters in the TV series are hardly in the book, and if they are they are either 100% different from what is portrayed in the series or are vaguely mentioned. The book is a series of short stories/essays about single women and men in NYC looking for love in all the wrong places. I could not relate one bit. The men are basically losers and the women are portrayed as desperate to find mates, but since the men are losers, well.... you get the point. If you find yourself wanting to buy this book, watch the series instead. At least those characters are more \\"human\\" and real than the winers in this book. What a waste of time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Depressing Book!","review":"I used to wonder why \\"entertainment\\" people found \\"American Beauty\\" to be such an accurate portrayal of life in the suburbs. If the characters in this book are even only half-way based on reality, they lead some hopelessly pathetic lives, and I would imagine they assume we are all hopeless. I watch the show, and at least those women show a little backbone and spunk. The women in the book regularly berate the other women whom they see as being spineless, when the reality is that NO self-respecting woman would put up with any of the men and vice versa. A sad commentary on life in the \\"Big Apple\\" - looks like a lot of worms in there to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Your Time","review":"This book is not like the TV series. It is full of useless characters. It jumps from one story line to the next without developing the characters. Carrie is in the book but she is totally different than her TV character. In the book she is shallow and uses drugs a lot. Her relationship with Big is also much different. I was diappointed in this book. It was a waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS SOMETHING BETTER!","review":"Look. Seriously, now. If you like the show or the book even a little bit, you realllllly need to investigate books by Cynthia Heimel. Heimel was the original and she remains the best. She's smarter and funnier and a thousand times more interesting than Candace Bushnell or Carrie Bradshaw. Heimel is a little grittier than SATC. She's weak for shoes and designer clothes but she lives strictly in the real world. Please, please PLEASE read \\"Sex Tip For Girls\\" or \\"But Enough About You\\" or \\"If You Can't Live Without Me, Why Aren't You Dead Yet\\" if you want to see what Candace Bushnell is DESPERATELY TRYING to do!

Personally i'd stick to the TV series unless you want to be disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the Show","review":"Alright, so I love the series. I thought, hey the book should be awesome. I understand the book came out first, but I don't know how the show was \\"based on the book by Candace Bushnell\\" because it's not really. There are some stories similar.. Big calls her \\"Kid\\", but her friends are different, the characters are not the same at all, they don't even do the same things. Carrie is \\"some journalist\\". It was hard to read beacause there were so many names to remember, so many stories that weren't related, then it jumped to real life, past, present... everything. I got through half the book and i'm debating whether to continue. So far, it's awful. Stick to the show! Find a differeny author to get life and love advice from."},{"rating":"1","title":"If People in New York Were Really Like This, I'd Move","review":"While the HBO series \\"Sex and the City is, as mentioned in a previous review, bright and funny, the book was a sad attempt to titillate the reader with boorish tales of the supposedly glamorous lives of pathetic, conceited nobodies languishing in their own misery. Bushnell's writing style is disjointed and elementary. The characters are patently obnoxious and predictable. A real yawn - I couldn't get through it. Very disappointing considering I was hoping for a fun vacation read. I would normally never promote TV over reading, but in this case - watch the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly superficial \\"people\\"","review":"Personally I found this book awful... I didn't even finish it. The book lacks the humor and sweetness of the show, which was already pretty far outside my life experience. I never wanted to be those women, but they were fun to watch.

I just found this book really boring - it seemed as though Bushnell couldn't really be bothered writing it... maybe that was to convey the superficiality and heartlessness of the people, but how can you care about people like that?Give me the show over this any day - in the end it was the friendships between Carrie, Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha that gave it its zsa zsa zsou - and the superb acting.Some chapters are insightful but overall, it's bland. I'm just glad that it spawned the series though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Show, Don't love the Book","review":"I was so disappointed by this book.

The TV series bears almost no resemblance to the book. A few character names are the same and the \\"Carrie\\" and \\"Mr. Big\\" characters are drawn roughly the same as the TV characters. All I can say is that the TV scriptwriters did an outstanding job at developing the series' well-rounded characters from this mess of a \\"book.\\" There is virtually no plot or character development. The book is a collection of seemingly unconnected short essays in interview format. Bushnell owes a debt of gratitude to the screenplay writer who was genius enough to take her twisted mess of words and turn them into the scintillating story that we know from the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time reading this...............","review":"If there was a 0 choice in the rating above that is what I would have selected.

It was worst read in my entire life! I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!! None of the stories made any sense at all, Carrie is an alcoholic, drug taking whore, Miranda well there is no explanatin for her, Sam Jones, and Charlotte ( where was Charlotte by the way? )The TV show is so different then this poor excuse for a book, I mean I dont know what to really say excpet to waste my money and time on a Candace Bushnell book again will never happen in this lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"show or book?","review":"My favorite show is Sex and the City on HBO.

It is the equivalent of watching soap operas while devouring a carton of Ben & Jerry's, or lying on your belly with your ear pressed against the heating vent trying to overhear your neighbors sordid affair with her brother-in-law. It leaves you with a (simultaneous) feeling of both horror (you can't believe you're still reading the thing), and of real self worth (thankful that you succesfully graduated high school - mentally - when you were supposed to...). Yet for some reason (read: train wreck - for example) you can't keep your eyes off of it. I kept waiting for a moment of self revelation (from anyone) up until the abrupt and unconclusive ending. Although, I'm sad to admit, in some sick way, it did cause me to giggle a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different from the show","review":"If you liked the TV show you will love the book.

But I don't know if it's my Midwestern sensibility or my \\"fashionista\\" membership expiring, but I found the book to be snobbish and shallow.In other books exploring the fab lives of the girls in Manhattan, I got a voyueristic thrill reading about their exploits at work, shopping, at the clubs, and in bed. The HBO series fufilled those same joys.But reading SITC I was annoyed and dismissive of the characters little problems made into molehills, a la NYC neurosis.

Okay, a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.. not like the HBO show","review":"ZzzzzZzzzz....(yarn)...Now that I'm awake.. This book wasn't good to me at all. I'm SOOOOO glad that someone else liked it enough to create the HBO show. I loved the show so much and now that HBO is not making any new shows.. I missed them NY girls Samatha, Charolotte, Miranda and Carrie. So like a good fan.. I wanted to read the book where it all started. Big Mistake.. even though it's my all time favorite show in the whole wide world.... I will NEVER try listening to the audio version or even read the book version again. EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"learning US","review":"Only bought it to teach bad English. Anyone who buys this will already be well aware of the \\"quality\\" and adjust their expectations accordingly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"I'm way behind in reading this book, considering it has been out for such a long time and even the series is over. It was a fun read, it was quick. My only issue was that some times there would be snippets that were a little too random, and a little too vague, but overall the writing was witty, entertaining and I did laugh out loud quite a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"The show is soooo much better!","review":"I was very disappointed when I read this book. I had already seen a couple of the seasons of the TV show and was hoping to get an idea of how it got started. This author is awful! Her writing just doesn't flow well and it's not as engaging as the book. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"I purchased this book because I liked the HBO series. To say that the series is \\"loosely based\\" on the book in an understatement. The characters are vacuous and two dimensional, the dialogue is forced and unrealistic, the stories are flat and incomplete. There is no connection between the reader and the characters, and by the end of the book you don't care what happens to these shallow people. I also was looking forward to the humor of the series, only to find out that nothing funny happens in this book. Truly awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing someone else writes the scripts for the show!!","review":"I love Sex and the City, the show that is, the book is another matter entirely. I know the series is \\"loosely\\" based on the novel which is just as well. If it was written like this poor excuse for a book it would have been cancelled after it's pilot episode. The show is ripe with raunch and wit, along with characters we truly care about. This book is grim and dark, poorly written, and ripe with people I would never want to meet. What we have here is a rare example of the show being far better than the book. I never thought I would advocate TV over the written word, but in this case, turn on HBO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the series.....","review":"After reading previous reviews, I was not expecting a novelization of the series. The book was the ionspiration for the series, after all. Nothing translates to TV in the same way. But I have to say that while the writing itself was excellent, I was disappointed. The characters were extremely shallow, and not as well developed. You can see where the story lines for the first season of the series came from, even some quotes line for line, but that's the only connection between the two. This book lacks the hope the series gave. You don't like any of the characters when you finish, and don't care one or another if they live or die or ever get married or whatever. Maybe that was Ms. Bushnell's plan, but I really didn't care for it. There is nothing loveable about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid money for this?","review":"Being an avid fan of the series, I decided I had to have the book. What a disappointment. The characters are not even remotely similar to the series and all the witty reparatee is nowhere to be found. When I felt as though I couldn't read another word, I would think to myself, \\"go on, turn the page, you paid for this book...it's got to get better.\\" It didn't and I took it in the short$$$. This was by far the worst book I've ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I had to give up on this book. I found it boring and poorly written. I have enjoyed some of Candace Bushnell's other books (especially One Fifth Avenue) so I had high hopes for this one. It almost felt like it was written by a different author from some of her other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst book in my opinion","review":"I have read a few of Bushnell's books now. SATC was the worst one. The storyline jumps all over the place, and certain pieces are included simply for the sake of writing more. Some dialogue and exchanges in the book were pointless, added no value to any storyline, and could have been skipped.Parts of this book were interesting and at times funny or witty. If you are expecting anything like the HBO series, turn back now because you won't get much that remotely resembles what you have seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"The show is really something amazing, the book is just plain awful. I honestly couldn't bring myself to finish it, I am so sorry I actually paid money for this book. Do not buy this if you love the show as it will sorely dissappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but...","review":"I read it the whole way through and it kept me interested I can give it that--largely because it was funny, juicy and I reckon most or all of the characters in the book are from real-life, in Candaces' drug induced New York life, but puh-lease, 'waaa poor me, so rich, so neurotic, so beautiful.' In the end this book is about mean, selfish, pig-headed men and women who rule New York society and I am so glad I think life is more than going to a cool bar, having sex with hundreds of men, taking copius amounts of drugs and stressing over which bag goes with my new Manolo Blahink shoes. Woe is me, woe is ...!Chalk it down to a funny social commentary with no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like the TV show","review":"I'm a big fan of the TV series, but this book is pretty bad. The characters are different from the television series characters. The stories are disconnected. The book didn't flow at all. There wasn't anything about the characters that I liked. I kept thinking that a television producer could have come up with a TV series about New York single girls without ever having referenced this book.If you wish to be entertained, watch reruns of the show and skip this book.Just my opinion! :-)No Child Left Behind? The True Story of a Teacher's Quest"},{"rating":"1","title":"lucky candace is not responsible for the tv show","review":"If you love the show, don't buy this book! It's good Candace gave the idea for the TV series but that's all. The book is very badly written, incoherent and not at all like the TV series. There are none of the characters that you find in the series and except for the first episode you won't find a lot of similarities. In short: a waste of time & money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezes my kindle","review":"Can't open the book it freezes my kindle. Not sure what the problem is. . . . . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV was actually better than the book","review":"Over 1/2 way through this book you still don't know the name of the narrator. This was quite possibly the worst read ever. I can always find a redeeming quality in every book, but this was the first time that I couldn't. I couldn't even gather up the strength to finish this. It's amazing that HBO saw something good enough in this book to create such an amazing series! This is the first time that I have ever found TV, or the movie, to be better than the book. Unless you want to read vague and boring conversation about the rules of threesomes (yes, vague and boring: it wouldn't even turn on a nymphomaniac) DO NOT BUY, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME READING!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...and it all began here","review":"I bought this book because I'm a fan of the series. However, that was probably that biggest mistake, you should not approach this book as an addition to your SNTC experience or a rendition of the series. Although, most of the characters are somewhat the same there is a lot of difference (Don't picture Kristin Davis as Charlotte, because those characters are different).The book is very entertaining, and funny and I recommend it, however you have to approach it with a blank slate of a mind.The series is based on the book and some of the characters in it, but there are a lot of big differences (Magda is not Miranda's cleaning lady in the book)The book is a nice way to see where the show got its flavor, but basically it ends there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining!!!","review":"Well, if you just love the show and have to read the book - or whatever it is - I would definately recommend this book. I read this before they came out with the show and have read it again after faithfully watching it on HBO. The book is very similar to the first season of the show (I also highly recommend buying the complete first & complete second season on DVD). The only thing is, if you are an avid watcher of Sex and the city on HBO the book is a little confusing because a few names and details are switched around between the two. Other than that this is a very good book to read anytime!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its true","review":"Candice Bushnell captures the voice of New York singles - lonely, tired and somewhat desperate. A group of people so ambitious they jump from one scene to the next, always looking for a better fix. The book describes Carrie walking home, she sees a prettier woman in a white shirt ahead of her. Carrie imagines being a shark and viciously eating the woman. When Carrie gets back to her apartment, she smiles at her doorman and shows the doorman all of her teeth. Now THAT is New York City. Not the show on HBO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly boring drivel","review":"This is a quick read - about the length of two Vanity Fair articles. There were a smattering of amusing vignettes and trenchant one-liners, but it was mostly boring and flat. Bushnell tries for shock value in an era when very little shocks any more. The same material works on TV because the HBO series was a sensual experience: the pleasure of the actresses' beauty and sexuality, their voices, scenes of New York, a glimpse into a world few of us see. On the printed page, the same scenarios are dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read if you don't know the series","review":"I'm a Candace Bushnell fan (Trading Up and 4 Blondes), but I've never seen Sex and the City the TV series. I found this book impossible to get into. It was a bunch of disjointed paragraphs and bold headings that jumped through past and present time and seemed to change narrators. I was never sure who was talking or what was going on, but reviewers who love the show seemed to be able to recognize the inspiration for certain espisodes, so it appears to only make sense as a companion to the TV series.I recommend this book only to people who are looking for more as fans of the TV show. If you are a book lover or a fan of Bushnell as an author, stick with her latest works or other great books about Manhattan life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like the show","review":"What a bummer this novel turned out to be! I felt as though I was being strung along only to find there to be no purpose. Absolutely none of the stories had any kind of ending whatsoever, even if there was no solution. The book is divided and subdivided into little stories that make absolutely no sense other than to somewhat sound dismal about relationships in general. I really did not get the point of the book in any way shape or form. It wasn't even free flow writing. I really would not know how to describe this to others. The only thing I can express is to wait until you can check it out at your local library. I really don't know how they made such a fabulous show out of such a nonsense book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have my money back?","review":"I watched the series, read part of the book and kicked myself in the a** for buying the book.

I'm glad you don't write for the HBO show."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the buzz about?","review":"Typical of a New York Observer writer to pen a cynical, exaggerated account of wealthy Manhattanites. But the series of vignettes didn't convincingly hold together as a book--just a series of romantic foibles between a stable of two-dimensional characters. I've heard a lot of hype about the HBO series. My only hope is that the characters on the show are a little less shallow and self-serving than these women seem to be. Given the material Bushnell has culled here, I'm shocked she portrayed those people in a positive light.Despite all this, there are some incredibly funny and even sweet moments in the book. I'm just glad it's not MY life...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the HBO series","review":"Yes, I read this book after becoming addicted to the HBO series.

Careful consideration would have revealed clues to the book's contents. The book is edited by the proprieter of a \\"sex toy\\" business. Several of the stories are obvious endorsements of her business and the products she sells. All appear to be written or heavily edited by the same person. Nothing wrong with men and women enjoying love and sex into their late years. However the older people I know are able to talk about it in grown up language instead of four letter words.

A series that is written, acted and dressed in 1960 may not be everyone's cup of tea. But if you let yourself be transported back to that time, you'll enjoy this show tremendously. The characters are written with enough complexity to keep you interested, especially key mad man Don Draper, played with disturbing confidence by Jon Hamm. His enigmatic character touches the dark side in all of us, that little corner where secrets are kept and new realities are woven to accomodate them. Toss in institutionalized sexism, the relentless smoking of cigarettes and a sense of entitlement nurtured by television and you've got an edgy, completely original series that's deliciously dark and dangerous.

We live in an age where the standards for television are higher than the standards for feature film are, and as such, I can't go along with all the rave reviews here.

There are elements here that remind me of Rod Serling's \\"walking distance\\" (twilight zone) and \\"they are tearing down tim o'reilly's bar\\" (night gallery). In those episodes you find disillusioned middle-aged executives of the early 1960s who feel the passaage of time, sense that the next generation is on their heels and who are hoping for an exit. Add in some Serling-esque chain smoking, which is era appropriate of course. It might just be convergent story evolution. I mean why write about happy middle aged executives in the early 60s, right? But it could be that he's a Serling fan.Worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite Period ART","review":"The 60's are often hailed as an amazing era of change and excitement. Our parents were young men and women during these times. The series is impeccably stylized, so true to its Era down to the very last detail & idiom. Social and work norms are captured artfully and at times disturbingly so.When watching it , I feel like I'm voyuering through a time machine and peeking into deep intimate life details.I become so captivatingly immersed in its \\"aura of ERA\\" , the very way you would respond if it were a priceless piece of ART!The enigmatic reality of people's personalities, at a time in history when people did not show you their cards and bare all on TV, but kept a stoic facade up to show strength, resolve and sexual charisma....Wow!!Yes, plot lines are not always very engaging and neither is character empathy present much either. Its the craftfully woven mystery of art that keeps you coming back, time after time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Mad Men","review":"One of the best TV series ever created - nostalgic, beautiful, sophisticated - entertaining.

Imagine my excitement, then, when I found Amazon selling a new copy of season 1 for only $9.99- I was thrilled, but also cautious- there had to be a catch. I researched to make sure the packaging pictured on Amazon was the actual packaging for the dvd set- it was, so I placed my order. It just arrived yesterday, but instead of a boxed set with an episode guide, it's a black dvd case with 2 plastic trays inside to hold all 4 dvds. No episode guide, just the season 1 slipcover. It looks like someone put this together out of their home. I recognize I got a great deal, but if Amazon is not actually selling me the boxed set, then that information should be specified somewhere- I would have paid a little more to get the actual product instead of a homemade knock-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready for Season 2","review":"Around episode 4 I was ready to stop watching.

I was bored from the get go, but decided I would give it a season to be fair. After watching season 1, all I've discovered is that I've found a cure to my insomnia.The show is slow, horribly acted by stiff and uninteresting characters, and absolutely nothing of consequence happened during the entire first season. I will not be wasting my time or money on any future seasons. How the Emmy awards can give nominations and awards for drivel like this and completely ignore the far superior \\"Friday Night Lights\\" is baffling.

In this version all housewives are depressed and seeing shrinks, all husbands cheat, everybody drinks, smokes and slaps their kids around. The critics like to call this show intelligent, they don't say why and I'm not sure either. Maybe it's because of the liberal and gratuitous references to the holocaust and nazi's (which are completely out of place in a conference room in an advertising agency in the 1960's). If you like shows that are anti-christian you'll like this. After all if you write the script you control the content, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks!!","review":"This is the dumbest show ever.

The best writing, the best set, the best attention to detail, and the best actors. Makes me want to get in advertising (or go back to the 60s), but I know neither is as exciting as it comes across here. Would certainly be nice to have the carefree lifestyle portrayed here though.I have really enjoyed this show as well as another AMC show, Breaking Bad. I am looking forward to seeing more from this network!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A hell of a work of art","review":"Mad Men is one of those rare shows that just stands up and slaps you in the face. The sets are amazing. The costuming is very well done. The dialogue and character interaction is stunning. You are always left wanting for more. The show is damn near perfect.The blu-ray experience just enhances the viewing. The only draw back to watching on blu-ray vs. regular old school dvd would be the load time. These do take a few extra minutes over other blu-rays to load. Well worth the wait for this end product though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I watched this first episode of the series this past weekend. I did not watch Mad Men when it premiered in 2007, I'm a couple of years behind! In any event I've heard it has gotten rave reviews and I can understand why! It is great! I then went ahead and rented and viewed episode 2 as well. The same result. Now I'm addicted.

An original concept delivered with consummate skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I can only guess at the reasons this dull show has gotten so much critical acclaim. My best guess is this: since most series feature everyone overacting to the nth degree and ham-handed cues telling us when to laugh or be emotionally effected, critics have begun to equate boring characters, long silences, and meandering conversations with \\"good acting\\" and \\"subtlety\\". There's a difference, people. Every episode is like a game of \\"guess what I'm thinking\\". Characters say and do seemingly random things, often wildly out of character--but we don't get to know why, we can only watch as the camera zooms in on them contorting their faces, not saying anything because \\"that's how it was back then\\". Yeah, yeah, whatever, the critics tell us that this is award-worthy work, but I'm not buying it. I'll stick to something that's actually interesting and compelling, thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! really, really, really boring.","review":"Four hours of my life I wish I could have back. Great acting, amazing costumes and sets; unfortunately not one remotely interesting thing happened the entire time I watched (well half watched- I kept falling asleep).

Terrible for America!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding show, but normal packaging please.","review":"Mad Men is an outstanding show, one of the high points of the 2007 season and the one I'm most looking forward to returning in 2008.I had planned to buy the DVD set, but I'm having second thoughts because of the box. It looksl ike it's going to be one of those odd-shaped boxes that looks like an old fashioned lighter. I get the joke, but I'd much rather have a normal box that fits on the shelf with the rest of my collection.I wish that when companies made these novelty DVD boxes that they also sold a traditional shape.

Two excellent scenes out of the whole season, the rest dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Emmy and strong reviews must reflect how BAD (perhaps MAD) most TV shows are these days","review":"We watched 2/3rds of the first season. All of the episodes were slow paced. Often excruciatingly slow paced. The show seems to be (really IS) mostly about smoking (mainly at work), drinking (mainly at work), and extramarital sex (mainly at work). Oh yeah - each and every character (including the children) is unhappy and behaving in a way that will lead them and those around them to greater unhappiness. Unless you are somebody who worked in this kind of environment and are looking for some nostalgia (and even then...), this show will not appeal to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T GET IT","review":"I thought I needed a highly-rated TV series to sink my teeth into.

How many more episodes do I need to watch until I get it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless","review":"I began watching Mad Men hoping for an enjoyable experience, but, to my shock, found myself watching a story with a cast of actors that were dull and talentless and a script that was boring and inert. I can't understand why this show is so popular. Everything looks good, and Jon Hamm's handsome mug is always the center of attention, but there's nothing to get excited about. The third episode, with its cliched dialogue and clumsy performances, was where I had to stop.The only exception to the monotony is the woman who plays Peggy, the new girl at the office (and I'm sorry I don't know her name). Her acting seems effortless and she is brilliant, even when just standing still and looking around. She is the only gem in a sea of mediocrity. I'm done with Mad Men, and mad that it could have been so, so much better, but isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"great show","review":"Received as a gift-love this show.

I am not exactly who their target audience is but I do not think it will help a novice or experience builder.

It's difficult to follow, the tips come in the wrong order, and the examples often don't work. In addition, the book doesn't go into enough detail explaining terms and how and why things work. If you're not already a programmer, the book won't help you to learn anything about module creation. As a tool for getting started creating modules (which it purports to be), it's an utter failure. The authors often refer to their own module that they created, which you can allegedly download and use as an example, but as of December 2002, it still was unavailable. The section on monsters at the end is pointless filler that belonged in the adventure book if anywhere (even the tips the books gives are geared toward fighting the monsters, not using them in your adventures)...This book was a terrible waste of money..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Guide for World Builders","review":"If your looking for a guide to building new modules for Neverwinter Nights this book is definately not for you. The book is so disjointed and unorganized that it lacks any real cohesive instructional value whatsoever. The beginning module builder would be much better off using BioWares excellent online tutorials both for building and scripting. The only value that this book has for the aspiring builder is the small Monster reference section but even these materials are available in the toolset."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gun to your head...","review":"This book is poorly organized, filled with typographical and programing errors, but they have world builders over a barrel here.

A few days of work, and you'll understand it quite well.As for learning the scripting language, there are at least a half-dozen books out there that explain C programming in a better format. This book has no index, the so-called \\"Table of Contents\\" has exactly seven entries in it, sometimes covering 50-75 different topics.

But as soon as I put this dvd in,the music & the voice came back to me like some ghost from my childhood & I knew I heard these songs somewhere before,but then I never heard them again for the rest of my life up until a couple of hours ago. This documentary Is,absolutely one you need to see whether you ever heard of Rodriguez & his music or not,it doesn't really matter. it's stories like this that i can relate to & appreciate most of all since I've always loved the obscure,the forgotten,the underdogs, the cult bands & musicians that not a lot of people even heard of.

It still seems like a fairytale, it's so hard to believe that this is a documentary. Having been born in South Africa in the midst of apartheid, and emigrating to the states, this movie brings an incredible perspective to me on so many levels, most profoundly: class inequality, social justice, art and industry, and the cruel irony that life often brings. How many more artists are in our midst with such powerful messages we will never hear? Most of all, this movie portrays Sixto Rodriguez with such humility and soul. Inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story, almost unbelievable.","review":"One of the greatest documentaries I havr ever seen. A very inspiring story of greatness in a humble soul realizing the music he had poured from his soul touched a the very fabric of a nation a world away.

Simply unbelievably thrilling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER LATE THAN NEVER","review":"Its a very good story and told well, but too many questions remain. For example, why does this lifelong laborer seem so frail? Why always the dark glasses a la Jose Feliciano? Why is his Australian stint given no mention?Aside from that, this is a truly remarkable artist. Good music gets by the masses all the time so its not all that unbelievable he didnt make it here. People are catching on now and Rodriguez is alive to see it. Not a bad song here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended!!! Please don't miss this.","review":"I had never heard of Rodriguez. I'm only 15 minutes into viewing this film, I've already purchased both CD's and am looking to purchase this DVD... ALREADY!So far it is incredible!

Highly recommended!!!Post film update- Really, really beautiful; the story, the documentary, the people who created and participate in the film.. just wonderful on all fronts.

Generally, the content of the book seemed to be excellent, but the writing was, at times, laughable. Kim-Gibson includes comments about her own feelings during her interviews of former comfort women, such as \\"Relieved, I handed her a piece of Kleenex in silence.\\" Such irrelevant comments take away from the credibility of the book. They make it read almost like a cheap novel. If the writing had been cleaner, without having to listen to Kim-Gibson's experience (since this is, after all, supposed to be a book about the comfort women's experiences), it might have been a great contribution to the literature on comfort women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product Innovation; Look At Other Sizes","review":"For years, Crest was the toothpaste of choice. It had a dominating market share, due in large part to the fact that Crest was the first toohpaste to obtain the ADA (American Dental Association) seal of approval.The marketplace went through a seismic shift with the introduction of Colgate Total. Colgate proved once again that a market leader that grows complacent is vulnerable to an innovative competitor. The innovation: Triclosan, which actually makes your mouth fight bacteria longer and, more importantly, makes your mouth FEEL cleaner.You should look at the 7.8 ounce version, rather than this 6 ounce version, because of the value in the 7.8 ounce version. As to the \\"Plus Whitening\\", the Whitening element doesn't work as well as, say, Crest Whitening Strips; but it is better than nothing, and there is no significant price difference if you buy the version without \\"Plus Whitening.\\"This is a good product that shook the industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a GREAT movie and a wonderful cozy!!","review":"I love this movie.

Ricki Lake plays the post mistress of a small town with a pair of crime sleuthing pets. Yes, pets. The film doesn't show any dead bodies nor is the viewer treated to the gruesome sight of a murder. It's a cute little story you watch with the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, oh why . . .","review":"The fact that this movie has a nice cast just can't save it from the usual Hollywood stupidity. They started with a perfectly good story, written by Rita Mae Brown and as part of her Mrs. Murphy mystery series, and changed it almost beyond total recognition. These books are not great mysteries, but they are always charming, full of great character development, and quick to read. The changes made in translating the story from the book to the screen were totally unnecessary, and especially jolting when you consider how many people have actually read the books. Why the producers felt they had to change the story, change the characters and their backgrounds, and many other things is beyond comprehension. This sort of thing should not happen, but it does much too often. When will Hollywood learn to listen to people who watch their movies?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mrs. Murphy Mystery","review":"This was a very entertaining movie.

The story line is pretty close to the book, but I agree with a previous reviewer that the casting left a lot to be desired. Also Tucker in the book is a female and she was a male in the movie, using a voice actor ,whose name I can't remember, but he's been the voice for EVERYTHING.

Ricki Lake, while cute, is not at all like Harry is described in the book (tall, trim, and athletic--she works her own farm for gosh sake!). But what really made me mad was the fact that Tee Tucker was made into a male. Tucker is very much a female corgi! I did not understand this switch of gender or its purpose.

Suplex againts the ramp, an insane backdrop on the anounce table, barbwire 2x4!!, steps,tons of chairs and even a beer can is used!The third fall was a steel cage matchAs JR said, its a fitting conclusion to this awsome epic. Some nice cage spots like HH getting thrown off from the turnbuckle. 2X4 were used repeatedly. (The way they used it made me a bit sick).

The Tag Team Tables Match was ok, but I liked it because Undertaker was in it; he is one of the best. Rock/Angle was a very intense, dramatic match; really well done, plus I was happy the Rock won. Austin/HHH was more intense and entertaining. As good as Austin/HHH was, I really thought it sucked that Austin lost. He's my favorite and I thought it was lousy that he lost to the man who tried to end his career. Other than that, HHH was in for the fight of his life and he put on a good performance.Overall, this event delivered breathtaking matchups. Well done WWE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad ppv","review":"i saw it on ppv and i did not like it. raven vs big show was good and austin vs hhh was to long and boring angel vs the rock was also boring. the other mathes were short and not interesting this is not not a good ppv dont get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWF big event","review":"If you believe that the only step from wrestlemania was it only the royal rumble Whattt????For that in No way out The rock Vs angle For the WWF championshipthe winner would go to WWF wrestlemania X-7 to try retain the title against the winner of the royal rumble Stone Cold Steve Austin.Whaaattt??? do you think that this is the only greatest match but why hell no a 2 of 3 fall match Stone Cold vs HHH1st wrestling match, 2nd street fight and the botonline a # steel cage match.Many matches are too greats but this are the mo9s greatests so now try to buy your WWf no Way Out (2001) at amazon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great action","review":"Overall this was a great tape.

Hill (whose name is not given) and his recollection of the Atlanta Riot of 1906 as well as slavery. That's the beauty of this series. These accounts give you a lot of well-told firsthand information that the history books missed.

He already has two technical matches before his unforgettable street fight with the impressive Shane O Mac. King of the Ring 2001 is this years greatest WWF Event so far! Every match is fast-paced and entertaining and the crowd were fired up. The best match of the night was the Kurt Angle v Shane McMahon. We get to see Shane go through the staging glass (twice) and we get to see a shooting star press by Shane and an unbelivable Angle Slam from the top rope. The blood and carnage was galore in this entertaining event. I have all good things to say about 2001 wwf events. They have all been terrific and bloody. The OLYMPIC HERO Kurt Angle is the shine of this PPV. Unlike the night before, the crowd chanted his name and cheered him like mad.

It wasn't even a match and the way it ended left you thinking somthin else was goin ta happen. The King of the Ring tournament was alright. I think it would of been alot better if they had Kurt be the 1st to repeat the Crown. The 3-way match for the WWF title: Y2J, Benoit, & Stone Cold cannot wrestle 3:16 could of been better. The only reason why im gettin this DVD is for the Kurt Angle Vs Shane, Its a must see. I would have to say that this match is a classic and that it is one of or is the best match of the year.

The event would prove to be a big waste of $75.Most of the matches came off as very boring and dissapointing. The Taker/DDP was ok, and the Spike/Kane vs the dudleys was good, but for the most part it was really boring. The best match of course was the Shane vs Angle. I forget the outcome but when Angle tried to throw him through the glass windows that were the set for King of the ring, the first attempt failed and the glass didn't break and Shane hit the floor really hard. It's pretty dissapointing when the best match features a non wrestler! I was also dissapointed by the main event in which Jericho and Benoit basically 'swam' around the outside of the ring for like 10 minutes, way to kill time! The only thing that saved that match was a suprise run in.I'm not sure what's on the DVD, but hopefully it's not as boring as it was live."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is in the top ten for ppv's","review":"this is a good ppv the match that totaly sticks out is kurt angle vs shane mcmahon.This match is intense there is blood dripping from everyone.the best part is when shane gets thrown through a plate glass window twice! twice! i give that match five stars if you want to buy a ppv this one is the one you want to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst KORs","review":"KOF 2001 was pretty lame.

Kurt Angle and Shane Mcmahon stole the show with their epic \\"street fight\\", while Edge started his push to stardom, and the Undertaker confronts DDP to defend the honor of his wife, Sara. There were a few WCW surprises as well. The Triple Threat match speaks for itself...Austin, Jericho, and Benoit gave it their hearts and souls and Benoit gave a little more...a few vertebrate.

IF you buy this and you worship, you can worship at home without spending millions of dollars on a fourty -foot buddah statue(unless you really want to!).The statue is very realistic. with all the candle and incese, you got an authentic buddah statue. for $8 dollars, it can't be beat.

Instead of providing interesting insights and data on young adults (25-35), the author instead decides to talk about her own generation, the Baby Boomers. As a child of Baby Boomers, I'm quite aware of the impact their perceptions had on me; however, this book focuses too heavily on the my parent's generation and how they influenced my generation. In my opinion, the author has fallen into a problem many Boomers have - a tendency for self-absorption and selfishness. When she does get to talking about the subject we are all interested in, the talk becomes a familiar litany of divorce rate statistics, overexposure to television and my generation's supposed cynical outlook on life.

The entire event revolves around this particular storyline, and the anticipation for Austin to get his hands on Triple H is phenomenal.Leading up to this event, we find out it was Rikishi behind the wheel, and Triple H was the mastermind behind the conspiracy. Don't get me wrong, this is an amazing event, it's just that the WWF seem to only be concentrating on these rivalries, and I would like to have five minutes without hearing what Stone Cold is going to do to Triple H.

They will also be given pointers for better oral presentations and interview techniques. Ellen Guffey produces a similiar book called Essentials of Business Communications. It has a soft cover, basically the same information and teacher/student support, and sells for $45 less. It contains more reference to real company situations and humorus cartoons for increased reader interest. In my opinion, this book is the better option of the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Classroom!","review":"I am an instructor at a business college, and this textbook (along with the accompanying website for students) proved to be wonderful for use in the classroom. The chapters were lively (even for a four-hour lecture class!) and provided real-world details and examples. The website accompanying the textbook has plenty of extra information for classroom use, as well as activities that students can do to review chapters and test their grammar skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUDY GUIDE!

But the book essentially only offers standard introductory material. And it does a poor job at that. Despite starting out with the basics, the text tends to be dry and not particularly descriptive. There are too many examples - often verbose & repetitious - that simply give numbers for direct plug-n-churn into a preceding equation.Another big problem with the examples is that they are without exception about things like \\"stream erosion\\", \\"foundation settlement\\", or \\"water evaporation\\". Such unfamiliar and inherently \\"soft\\" notions just add extra unnecessary cognitive impedance to understanding the main object of an example. I'm sure this is true even for a 2-nd year Civil Eng student."},{"rating":"2","title":"My father got first page billing. Al Smiley","review":"I am reading everything published in the Mob category.

It's extremely disappointing to find out that in ironing roughly 10 shirts that it's irreparably stained two of them.We'll be getting a new iron sooner rather than later, but would have been better served by having not been given the opportunity to use this leaky and poorly made product.Unless you can get new clothes for free, factor in the cost of staining your clothes if you're considering purchasing this, and purchase something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk iron","review":"This iron, as well as the clones (probably) made by the same manufacturer in China perform abysmally. I know as we managed to end up with two of these units for some crazy reason.The cost of units are under $20.00 which is quite attractive, but they do not do the following:1. Get hot. Turning the heat dial does nothing. It stays the same temperature throughout the dial settings2. Weak steam. It never actually purges out steam from the vents and the only time it makes a hissing/steam noise is when you lift it off the garment you are ironing.Ironing a shirt with a Rowenta takes minutes. With this thing - you have to actually do it twice over the same area and it will still be wrinkled. This is due to the two factors above.All in all - you get what you pay for.X"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete product","review":"It comes with the noodle, but a very small package of flavoring.

Just garbled static and changing the settings does not change the voice effect.At least with the kids megaphone voice changers you can somewhat distinguish whats being spoken, this thing literally just puts out static and ground loop noise. Voice changer is useless ( and I like lo-fi sounds, this is NOT lo-fi it is useless.)And the \\"sound effects\\" sound even worse than one off those toy sound fx key chains.And its grotesquely noisy even when your not using it.Stay away from this and from what Ive read all GLI products.This is 99cent store toy disguised as DJ equipment.And I had to pay return shipping to get my money back.Just get one of those megaphone voice changers for $9 and tape a mic to it, thats what Im going back to doing, sounded way better than this crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch!","review":"Great watch, especially for the price.

The crinkle sounds attracts him and amused him for hours in the beginning. I like that it's made of fabric, easy on their little mouths, and its very well made since none of the seams has tore yet for us. Since the exterior is fabric our pup eventually ripped a hole into it but I just pulled out the exposed stuffing and gave the toy back to our pup. I haven't tried freezing this toy, which it suggests for teething puppies but our pup isn't too into frozen toys.Overall I have had a wonderful experience with Petstage dog/puppy toys. I love how colorful and whimsical their toys are and I do think it helps attract curious little pups. I would recommend most of their dog toys, just make sure to pick ones appropriate for your dog's size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy!","review":"This is a perfectly sized toy for a small puppy (a westie in my case).

A good sense (as can be felt through reading a book) of what the people experienced in the early 1900s.One caveat.

Usually they put on good action though despite the poor storylines, but Backlash failed.

I would recommend these glasses to anyone who drives, walks dogs, shops, rides bicycles, jogs, enjoys the beach, just about any possible use where eye protection from the sun is desired, but with glasses that you can see through very clearly. The fit is perfect, almost no adjustment was required, and very comfortable to wear. The glasses stay put on the nose and ears, do not move about or slide down, they are well constructed, yet light weight. I am going to purchase a second pair, and maybe even a third, I like them that much! These glasses are worth what you have to pay for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Described","review":"Purchased a pair of Ray-Ban all black 3025 aviators and I wear them frequently.

I completed the Amazon form to report the poor packaging and asked for a response but got none.The glasses themselves are poor quality. The lenses are slightly different sizes and the nose pieces are crooked, so they fit oddly. It appears the glasses I received are factory seconds, not high quality Ray Bans. The person I gave them to asked me if they were knockoffs.In any case they are being returned today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Service","review":"Took two weeks to get here, and nose pad broke in one week, reach customer service for help, very unkind and unhelpful.Overall sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Description","review":"I ordered the Ray Ban Aviator W3277.

Naturally, I immediately ordered another pair, at which time I noticed that they were no longer owned by Bausch and Lomb, nor domestically produced. Within a year, the metal frames had rust on them, something that never occurred with my previous sunglasses. Chalk it up to yet another sad example of selling the sizzle (the \\"brand\\") instead of the steak, now that the production and marketing rights are owned by people who have no pride beyond making a quick buck by substituting cr*p for what was formerly quality. You have to wonder how different these \\"legitimate\\" products are from the knock-offs sold from sidewalk tables, i.e., aren't they all from the same factory in China?

However the view of the polarized lenses seems a little strange to me, I don't know if this happens with all polarized lenses, but sometimes the view gets cromatic, specially when I look to a glass surface, like windshields and headlights.

Thought I should've ordered size 55 instead (which is what I do now). Because of Rayban's unique design and dimension (with no complete description of each), it's a bit hard to have the right model and dimension for every specific human face without trying them on in person. Trying them on in person may be difficult in my place as there is no Rayban outlet with really good collection here. Hopefully the new online order will fit me better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Currently Disappointed....","review":"Just received these Ray Bans for a Spring Break trip. They were shipped quickly, and were the correct item, but the right hinge was defective. It is so tight it feels like it might snap when you try and fold them up. The box also came fairly damaged even though it was within an Amazon box with bubble wrap. I am questioning if these glasses were really new when they were shipped or just heavily used display glasses.I'm hoping I can get these replaced or fixed before my trip. Usually don't have problems when I buy from Amazon but this is extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKEEEEEe","review":"I bought the Ray Ban Aviator RB3025. It arrived on time, but they are fake. It took me a lot of inspection to determine that they were fake (they're made almost identically), but I could tell because the logo on the nose-pad is not interlocking, a tell-tale sign that your ray bans are fake. Also, the box it came in is not the right box. The real box has a recycling logo on it, but the one I received does not. Furthermore, the sunglasses were very good fakes, but fake nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coating stripped, and no \\"RB\\" etching on the left eye lens??","review":"There seems two issues with my ray ban aviator sunglasses with gold frame and green lenses. First, a small strip on the right eye lens toward the bottom is not coated. Well I don't know if it is a coating or something else, but the small strip is clear, not the greenish color and is clearly different from the rest part of the lens. Second, there is no \\"RB\\" etching on the left lens (the one that does not have the white rayban printed logo). I read on various websites which all advise that authentic pairs should have the RB etching. So I do feel that the pair I received is fake. This is very suprising to me as I bought them directly from amazon, not from any 3rd party reseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have bought these sunglasses for my son.

Obviously, when you buy these kind of objects you must be pretty sure about sizing and colors and all that, so I went first to a shop and tried some sizes until I found the right one (my face is kinda small and narrow, so the 55 mm fitted perfectly). Colors of frames and lenses are entirely up to you and pictures here are quite helpful.Now, when I finally got them, I confirmed they were just appropriate form me, right size, right colors, excellent shape.

He tries to add drama, but he just can't seem to get it right; he just raises his voice at random, adding no drama whatsoever. But their concept is brilliant. This way, they don't need to actually write songs and they still make a lot of records that people buy for no apparent reason. Stay away from this crap!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good live album with a new line-up","review":"I heared Foreigner reformed with only Mick Jones as the original member. I had basically written them off as washed-up and over. How can it be Foreigner without Lou? Then I saw this CD. I actually laughed when I saw it and thought \\"This has gotta be bad, almost worth picking up bad\\". Well was I surprised at how good this band sounds! Kelly does not sound exactly like Lou Gramm but he sings in the same range and is a suitable replacement. The band also features former members of Dokken and Bonham. In fact, they also do a snippet of \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". Only hit missing here is \\"Double Vision\\". This is a pleasant listen for any classic rock fan.

Bhikkhu Bodhi, a wonderful scholar- practitioner, and a wonderful writer, has set forth in clear language the entire Buddhist path to enlightenment, and he has not merely done so in the abstract, but has pointed the way to the practical application of Buddhist techniques in our very lives.

I can't understand how any intelligent person who has had his/her taste of suffering and honestly examined it can disagree with the message and practice outlines of this book. The most startling revelation that this book had for me though was that all searches for God, Buddha-nature, the Tao, Brahma, etc. are all really just ploys to alleviate suffering, much like a young girl imagining a perfectly happy life in marriage, a house, and children. This book cuts past all of that straight to the heart of the matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"a concise introduction","review":"Bhikkhu Bodhi clearly lays out each of the eight parts of the Buddha's prescription for a happy life. He explains the traditional divisions of the eightfold path, and makes clear what the \\"right,\\" or correct, position for each step is. Thankfully it is not a philosophical dissertation but is instead a straightforward introduction to the Buddhist Way which is short enough for me to reread again & again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I had no problems with this purchase.

Suryavan Solar is quite clever when setting up his organization, pseudo esoteric school, where people get degrees in the hierarchy depending on how many books they have sold, or how many people they bring to their summer camp. Originally abusive. A book that needs that kind of \\"help\\" to be sold, seems to have little worth on its own to pass the test of the massive public acceptance.Fellow disciples have little possibilities of getting close to the \\"mystic\\", \\"chosen one\\", if they have not fulfilled certain goals inside the organization.

Other than this, I would have given it 5 stars.

The entrance to the city of Troy is especially dreadful. I remember watching Troy, seeing the wonderful enterance of Hector, Paris and Helen and thinking, \\"Did someone just step in an orchestra?\\" Scales, followed by overpowering misplaced notes, repeditive, a disaster. It makes me want to pay John Williams to try and at least make a score that fits the film, because I believe this movie drags as much as it does because of its horrid score... which is too bad, because it could've been a great one.

The only thing that was really true to the book was Achilles' love.

While his work during the 80's was still fresh and interesting, his recycling of those same elements today is tired and grating. Listening to the score I was constantly reminded of other films. \\"Oh yeah,\\" I'd think, \\"that's that horn he used in Red Heat. And in Willow. And in Aliens. And in every score he's written in the last 20 years.\\" With so many \\"borrowed\\" elements, Horner's score never finds its own voice (except for the 'wailing woman', and I can't believe anyone can enjoy her caterwauling) and remains a pedestrian, rushed, and utterly forgettable effort. Yared's score is far superior: haunting, uplifting, epic. Shame on Warner Brothers for forcing its removal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gladiator Lite","review":"Given that the film's poster uses the same colors as 'Gladiator,' I expected there to be some echoes of Hans Zimmer's influence--but not a total rip-off!

The Troy soundtrack is definitely disjointed, loud and \\"messy\\". Too many tracks have far too much brass, an awkward tempo and no sense of cohesivness.

I don't care if it was made in 13 days or 13 years...when you make a soundtrack for a movie, it's for A MOVIE, not a National Geographic special!! James Horner to his credit, has done great work in the past. But this was a low for him. Right now, I'd have to say that Hans Zimmer's work is awesome.

James Horner seems to favor the chime once again which reminds of the closing watertight chambers sequence in Titanic. Vocal sythesizers create the more ominous overtone alongside the haunting vocal work of Tanja Tzarovska. The atmosphere she creates, particularly in the opening \\"3200 Years Ago\\" echoes strongly from Lisa Guerrard in Gladiator.Unfortunately the honor of Troy is betrayed not only by Greeks but also by a cheesy French Horn/Trumpet theme, more hot air than anything else. Other than that the CD is a never-ending battle between percussion and brass, lacking theme and direction. Don't buy this album expecting it to sound like the trailer music. Horner did not write the original trailer music for the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Unoriginal and Boring","review":"Utterly unoriginal and a waste of time.

Stealing an entire 8-note theme from Shostakovich's Symphony No. 5 isn't fooling anyone, and elements of Star Trek II (an earlier Horner work) and Stargate are easily distinguishable. I haven't heard any of Gabriel Yared's work for this movie, but I'm tempted to say I'd prefer it to this pulseless \\"epic\\" score anyway. Better by far than anything on this soundtrack, sadly, is the music produced specially for the teaser trailer by Musikvergnuegen.

(Plus, she and Josh sound so great together!) One thing though, DON'T buy this CD before seeing the movie....a couple of the song titles give the plot away!

'Willow' et al.).With the exception of a couple of tracks, such as 'Hector's Death', this is bland and uninspiring - it even features the sub-Andrew Lloyd Webber puke fest 'Remember' that ruined the credits at the end of the movie.This is a terrible soundtrack, and not wasting your money on. Try 'Thin Red Line', 'The Mission', 'Blade Runner' or 'Being John Malkovich' for decent soundtracks. This is not going to do it for you, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"just crap","review":"just crap- man - so bad. I heard the tracks earlier and thought it was annoying.

Most of the music was reused from previous works and/or stolen from Hans Zimmer. When I first saw the movie I even expected to see Hans Zimmer's name in the credits but I was astounded to find that this was the work of James Horner. This music does not reflect Horner's style at all and is a poor imatation of the new master composer, Hans Zimmer.

It sounds like an effort from a first time composer who has basically slapped together something that we have all heard before. This is not even a C Grade effort and if I was Hans Zimmer I would sue."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your ears the agony","review":"I don't think Helen, Achilles or the Greeks caused the fall of Troy- it's the SOUNDTRACK!!! There is no depth, no nuance or feeling in this music. The soundtrack to Troy is a cut and paste job from a generic Hollywood playbook on \\"How to do BIG movie soundtracks 101.\\" It was a rare moment for me when the soundtrack to a movie made me dislike a film I otherwise would have liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"When I think of how great the score for this movie could have been -- tossing out Gabriel Yared's score at the last minute was sheer lunacy. Horner's score did nothing to enhance the film, and the film suffers for it. I just listened to parts of Yared's score for Troy that are available on his web site, and now I'm really disgusted. Yared's score is beautiful and haunting; I can't get it out of my head. I can't remember much at all about Horner's. Shame on the jerk who called Yared's score old-fashioned, and even more shame on the director whose knee-jerk reaction robbed the audience of Yared's score. I love soundtracks, but I won't be buying this one. The movie was much better than I had hoped and it deserved a better soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivable Treason","review":"Originally, the soundtrack was written by Gabriel Yared. His music was also used in the trailers. But one month before public screening this music was thrown out of the window on the negative comments of a couple of people from a non-professional sample audience on unmixed music being used against the composer's will and without giving him the chance to modify the music on specific requests. Instead there came James Horner and wrote this soundtrack in one month... Apart from the fact that I don't believe it was but that Horner simply negotiated behind Yared's back to get to a blockbuster after being missing from it for a number of years, this soundtrack is without heart and strongly based on Yared's original ideas, copying even the melody for Remember.My suggestion is to wait for Varese to negotiate with Sony on the release of Gabriel's soundtrack and get the real musical heart of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst scores of all time...","review":"It all started when Gabriel Yared's original score was rejected in the last minute and James Horner was called to the rescue,Horner,aka Mr.Recycle,is known for recycling all his scores in the last 20 years from his early great projects such as Star Trek 2,Aliens and Willow.Now,If Horner had time to do his usual recycle work for \\"Troy\\" it might have turned out to be okay in Horner scales(which still means crap)but since he had only a week and a half or something like that to score \\"Troy\\" he gives us the worst of the worst,When I saw \\"Troy\\" I couldn't believe how bad the music was and even worse how badly it was timed with the movie itself,Most of the score is a gladiator wannabe with some memorable cues from \\"Willow\\" which Horner recycled about 50 times for recent scores.It is amazing that the producers of this movie green-lighted this score since it is a joke.Stay away..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Horner score","review":"It's amazing Horner pulled this off in 13 short days! Horner delivers once again with yet another awesome score full of wonderful themes, heroic action, and emotion-packed strings. Sure he pulls off some of a bit of his older work, but with what he had to work with that is completely understandable. Can you write 120 minutes of music in 2 weeks?! Didn't think so!!! How about we just enjoy the music! BTW the Achilles theme is amazing, can't get it out of my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"great company and great cd","review":"the used cd came from library-by the-lake, and was exactly as discribed. it was in perfect condition and arrived quickly, without damage. the life action singers produce great music and this cd is one of their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any mother with a teen daughter.","review":"I am 70 years old and I adored this book. I have known people like Amy and Isabelle. I know women who with harsh words and not remembering their own youth have said harsh and cruel things to their children. We are often to quick to judge and be rightous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminded me of Peyton Place","review":"Amy and Isabelle was an engaging read. I devoured the book in 2 sittings. I'm struck by the similarity to the 1950's novel Peyton Place. Amy and Isabelle are remarkably like Constance and Allison McKenzie, the mother and daughter in Peyton Place. Another similarity is the many characters in the (New England!) town(s) that are interspersed through both novels. But Strout isn't as melodramatic as Metalious, and her characters have more warmth and humanity. I wish her continued success as a novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"My book group just read this book. Most of the members really enjoyed it, but I didn't. I agree with the reviewer who said the story line just never took off. I guess the focus of the book was meant to be the relationship between the mother and daughter, but I even found that a bit dull. I found the author very descriptive, but could have done a better job with character development."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but disappointing.","review":"After seeing this book recommended by the Today Show, I have to say I was more than slightly disappointed. For a first novel it had a lot of promise, but I could tell the author was more of a short story writer. I had hoped for a more powerful conclusion. What happened to the teacher? He seemed to be the murderer of the young girl. I wanted to see the loose ends tied up. It let me down."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a best seller??","review":"This book wore me out. I kept waiting for it to get somewhere with a plot of substance. I found myself skimming a lot of the text to get through the minutia of unrelated stuff. I got within a couple of chapters of the end, and just threw it aside. I didn't care how it ended because I was just tired of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fair first effort","review":"I agree with the customer comments by ustico@snte.net. Specifically, I got tired of reading about the gastroenterology of the characters. There must be more to these characters than their guts. Reading this book made me appreciate Jane Hamilton's books even more--they're flawless and the characters are so beautifully portrayed. Jane Hamilton is better at writing about disturbing events. On the plus side, some of the observations about mothers and daughters were insightful and worth reading. I was surprised to read the glowing book reviews in the NY Times, New Yorker, etc. It was the New Yorker review that promted me to read the book. I was heartened by some of the customer comments which brought out some of the things that bothered me or didn't occur to me. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I felt absolutely frustrated by this book. The style of writing drove me crazy! Strout's overuse of brackets was unbearably distracting. I kept hoping something interesting would happen in the story but it never did. Most of the characters were typical and the ending was way too contrived. I give the author credit for capturing Amy's teenage personality but not much else. Very disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life","review":"This book is wonderful and true to real life. All the little thoughts that a person has, and thinks that they are the only one that thinks them - are exactly the things that the characters in the book express. I found Ms. Strout's insight into relationships and situations to be extraordinally remarkable. The book was easy to get into and very hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mother and Daughter Both Discovering Themselves","review":"Amy and Isabelle is an excellent book which tells the complex nature of a mother/daughter relationship. Both Isabelle (mother) and Amy (daughter) are very well developed characters who are both searching for their own place and meaning in the world. They appear to have absolutely nothing in common, but eventually come to terms with their differences and discover the love they truly feel for each other. The characters in the small town of Shirley Falls are all involved in their own small dramas that make the book highly entertaining. I would like to read more by this author; it is a very well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent!","review":"I was very impressed with this book. It was beautifully written with vivid descriptions that really paint a picture. The book keeps you guessing and intrigued. And during the early part of the story, the answers the reader is seeking are not necessarily predictable, but when discovered are realistic. I am a sucker for endings and I loved this one. It was appropriate, realistic and very neatly ended the story. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"I didn't see any redeeming qualities. It started off with an awkward girl and her awkward mom, and it just got worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it","review":"Wow...all I can say is this was the slowest, most predictably bad book I've struggled thru in a long time. I kept waiting for something to happen. Strout's writing style is actually ok but the non-existant plot and troubling characterizations make for a really boring work. I really wanted to like this, as I enjoyed \\"Olive Kitteridge.\\" I wish I could say something positive but my honest review is don't bother, don't waste your time, in other words, forget about this one. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, well-written and engrossing","review":"As many of the earlier reviewers have commented, this is a wonderfully detailed honest portrayal of the tensions and love between an adolescent daughter and a mother. My favorite part, however, were the many minor characters -- who made the community seem all too familiar, and who became interesting in a few very brief scenes. These really show Strout's strength as a writer. In particular, the workplace dialogue among the women that Amy and Isabelle share an office with is truly wonderful -- the constant bickering, shifting alliances, yet underlying friendships -- everyone who has worked in close quarters with others has been there!This book is very well written -- my only complaints were that the \\"happy ending\\" seems a little contrived, as does the parallel between Amy's life and Isabelle's life -- there the realism breaks down. Also, there's a little too much detail about the natural world - sometimes it breaks the (quite compelling) narrative flow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters and a small world that draws you in","review":"This is the story of a single mother and teenage daughter in a small New England town in the 60's. The mother, Isabelle, has always told her daughter and the world that she is a widow. Isabelle's world is small and lonely while Amy begins to reach out the the world and rebel in her own lonely, awkward way. The mother and daughter both come very much alive in this book, with the secondary characters being so good as well. While the daughter Amy's relationship with a teacher is central to the story, the novel is about so much more. I do not give many five star ratings, but this deserves one. In some ways, this feels like an Anne Tyler novel, only better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Dull,disappointing and dreadful. I was quite surprised at the favorable jacket blurb from Alice Munro, one of my favorite authors, who does this sort of thing ever so much better. The author obviously sat down and wrote out a plot, then marched her cardboard characters through it -- it certainly does not develop naturally from their characters and conflicts between them. Also many red herrings and pointless diversions as other reviewers have noted. The author also has a tin ear for dialogue; some of the conversations between Amy and her best friend could have been better written by a seventh grader. Buy Alice Munro instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this book","review":"Although the author achieves some very nice things, ultimately Amy & Isabelle is a disappointment. The character of of Isabelle is written ridiculously shallow, and the happy ending is absurd.Still, the charater of Amy is written with uncommon depth -- capturing the troubling uncertainty of the teenage years with remarkable insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and repetitive","review":"I thought this book was slow and repetitive. How many times did the Amy's hair need to be mentioned? How many times did Fat Bev's stomach problems need to be mentioned? How many times was the terrible heat described? And how many chapters needed to start and end with a description of the flowers and plants surrounding their house or town? I felt really sorry for Isabelle by the way Amy acted towards her, but that's the way teens are. What a sad life Isabelle led...how, in the last chapter, did she suddenly make friends with the women she had worked with for MANY years, find a husband, become closer to her daughter and take a vacation? I can't say I enjoyed this book-but, I wanted to see how it ended, and I found that disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative","review":"Agree with those who were disappointed in this book. Too many unresolved issues and I lost interest in characters early on. There were too many sub-plots, ie, pregnant friend, her father, the mother's past. boss and co-workers at mill, death of girl, etc. Just seemed muddled."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was very disappointed in this book.","review":"I found the characters shallow and one dimensionable. This tired plot has been written many times and the outcome was too predictable. I found the end totally improbable. From all the hye, I thought it would be a better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring characters make for a boring read","review":"Sorry to contradict other readers but I found this book a chore to get through. The characters were one dimensional and when the secrets that ought to be transformational are revealed it turns out to be a non event. This book validates a reader's rule I've created that says you can't make a compelling book out of boring characters. You also can't show lives being lived out by repeating the same interactions 100 times. Maybe real life is like that but one purpose of fiction is to make real life more engaging. I did read the whole thing just to see if I could find what other's had seen in the book but it never got better. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two's the limit","review":"I give the author one star for Amy's sexual encounter with Mr. Robertson, which I'm surprised no one else has mentioned. It's sweetly erotic and well-written. The other star is for the scene in which Amy's hair is cut. This moment, though a bit too symbolic for my tastes (overt associations with Rapunzel), is genuinely gripping. The rest, I can't say much for at all. The endless nature descriptions are extraneous. The author has no faith in the reader's ability to discern her message and therefore bangs you over the head with it. No book can succeed when it attempts an over-the-shoulder narration of an entire town's population. Strout's narration of Isabelle attempting to read \\"Hamlet\\" is condescending. Finally, Amy's quoting of Edna St. Vincent Millay is not believable. I get the feeling that Strout is a fan of the poet and grafted her appreciation onto a character to whom it absolutely does not belong. Feh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misery Start to Finish","review":"This book is just thin, and it starts out depressing and gloomy and stays that way throughout the book. Bluk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it ZERO stars if I could!","review":"This is one of the more boring books I have ever read! I don't understand why people are giving it such good reviews! To me, it was like she was trying to see how long of a book she could write, by randomly sticking in people here and there, and always spending WAY too much time describing the weather, and the scenery along the road. The 'sex scene' between Amy and her math teacher went way too far in describing it. We all have an imagination, and didn't need her graphic description to get her point through.Luckily, I got this book from the library, so I didn't waste my money on it. And I would suggest that you don't waste your money either! It gets NO recommendation from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generation gap between mother and daughter","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It's a story of a daughter, Amy, who has a destuctive infatuation towards one of her high school teachers. It's also a story of a mother that learns to be more in tune with her daughter and realizing that Amy will make some mistakes and hopefully learn from them like Isabelle, the mother, has learned from hers.I liked the way the author would write in tidbits of happenings across town in someone else's life in the middle of the main scene in a chapter or paragraph.This book has a great storyline. I didn't see the TV movie but I can understand why it was such a hit.I believe any mother would enjoy this book and most probably a lot of fathers. This book is on the shelf with the other books in my collection of favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing characters; A must read!","review":"What I liked most about the book was the many emotional struggles between the mother and daughter. The volatile relationship between mother and daughter was not just because Amy had sex with her math teacher. It was Isabelle's inability to be honest about her own past. I beleive even in the best of circumstances the love/hate relationship of a mother and daughter is always there. In the case of Isabelle and Amy is was just more pronounced and harder for the characters to find a common ground. I do have to say that I think it was unnecessary to include Amy's friendship with Paul. I had no idea where the author was going. It was especially confusing to me why Amy and Paul had that \\"encounter\\" at his apartment after their \\"discovery.\\" I do not think any of that was pertinant. The author should have excluded that passage from her novel. I highly recommend this book. I enjoyed it and I hope to read something else of hers in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"reads like a supermarket novel","review":"Originally, when I read this book, I thought it was going to be a deep exploration of mother/daughter relationship and a \\"literary gem\\". It turns out to read like a little paperback, it's certainly not literary. I found the small town setting to be too stereotypical. I thought a lot of the side stories were undeveloped and the characters were one-dimensional. It was almost like the author needed some filling to keep the story from becoming just about mom and daughter. It felt like I was \\"reading\\" a soap opera and not a very good one. Because of its soap opera quality, the story line was totally predictable. Also, I found Isabelle and Amy to be very annoying people, especially Isabelle. It was hard to sympathize with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful prose & poignant characters","review":"BRAVO! to Elizabeth Strout. A touching and enjoyable book. The truth often really is stranger than fiction. Amy & Isabelle celebrates the beauty and nobility of the everyday life of ordinary people."},{"rating":"2","title":"delicious read","review":"with prose so tight it doesn't even squeek the storyline takes a backseat to this exquisite writing. strout calls up three dimensions recollections and feelings we all share but don't, or cannot, put into words. honest and real as isabelle comes to terms with her daughter, herself, her parenting and her past. watching isabelle grow as she is forced to recognize her daughter as a separate person and herself as a person with value was a real treat not soon to be forgotten. a coming of age for a middle aged woman, a heart bending experience for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost, but not quite","review":"Frankly, I was disappointed in this book. It got good reviews and I felt like it was a good story idea, but the characters were all so unlikeable. Amy, the daughter and one of the protaganists has no depth to her character. All we seem to know about her is she has pretty hair and hates her mom. Her relationship with her \\"best friend\\" Stacy is pointless and entirely based on cigarettes and relentlessly talking about their parents as assholes. Very tiring. I know it's been awhile since I was in High School, but I know I had more meaningful relationships with my friends than this stereotypical picture of teenage angst. Isabelle, the mother, is equally unlikeable, but at least provokes sympathy because her life is so pitiful. Although I ultimately found this novel very readable, it was so irritating that I sort of wanted to throw it away when I finished. I would recommend this to friends, but only so we could discuss how annoying Amy and Isabelle were."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was hopeful, but alas...","review":"A more appropriate title for this novel would have been \\"Amy and Her Neurotic Mother Who We Don't Care About.\\" The character of Amy was well done and I would have liked to get more into her head, see her as the storyteller, even. Skipping POV from Amy to Isabelle to the myriad of people in town (was anyone else lost trying to remember who was married to or the lover of whom?) was distracting and left little room to get into Isabelle's character. I really wanted to love this book, and in fact the prose was lovely, but ultimately I didn't like Isabelle at all, and cared little for anything she had to say or think. Having said that, however, I'm willing to try a second novel should one appear, just because I think she has potential as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad and depressing","review":"I found this book not at all interesting. I thought I was goingto like it but it seemed to wander off into the boring realm anddefinately depressing. I did not understand what the point of the book was to show how awful it can be to have no husband live in an awful little town have some really sad friends. I could also have done without the sex chapters I think she could have left that out and we still would have got the picture of a young girl being taken advantage of by her teacher. It did not add to the value of this book. It could have been a Jerry Springer show. It also reminded me of a novel made for magazines were the ending is all nicely wrapped up. I will not wait with anticipation for her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Debut Novel","review":"Elizabeth Strout has found the words to capture the essence of the complex relationship between and mother and daughter and put them into her first novel \\"Amy and Isabelle.\\" The descriptions were so well written that I could almost feel the heat from those hot summer days in the office of the mill. I loved the way the author provided us with little updates of the people in Shirley Falls and inserted them here and there throughout the book. The supporting character were strong and believable especially Fat Bev and Stacy. The UFO's and Debby's murder was unnecessary, but Isabelle reading Hamlet was extremely funny and the haircutting scene was very poignant. Ms. Strout has shown a lot of promise with her debut novel and I am eagerly waiting her second."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"This book takes a relatively simple idea - problems between a teenage girl and her mother - and shows the complexity and depth that actually exists. The story jumps from past to present, and the farther you get into the book, the more it makes sense, and the more interesting the whole plot gets.\\"Amy and Isabelle\\" deals with issues which many people can in some way relate to, and I found myself nodding in agreement to some of the feelings expressed by characters in this book. Read it - you'll love it, and will be wishing for more when you're done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"A realistic view of the depressing, dark, gloomy, dirty side of life. I'm so glad my life is not so pathetic. I, too, found the characters, such as Amy and Stacy too steoreotypical of teenagers to the negative side; smoking, cussing, hating their parents. I found the book slow moving and had a hard time getting through it. The descriptions were good, though, and I think the author can write well, but choose something less dark, gloomy, and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Predictable","review":"AMY & ISABELLE is the story of the classic conflict between a mother and her adolescent daughter taken to a fictional extreme...the novel is beautifully written. Still...the plot and, especially, the conclusion ultimately is predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This was a great book of a mother and daughter, with plenty of detail to make it more realistic. I did enjoy the extra minor characters, as they added a bit more to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quiet, Too Quiet","review":"I had read glowing reviews of this novel here and in the Times and decided to give it a go. It was billed as a quirky, quiet story which focused on the most difficult time of a mother/daughter relationship: adolescence. And although I did not enjoy this book at all, it did meet those above expectations. However, it is far more quiet than quirky, and throughout the novel I kept debating whether Strout was deliberately trying to prevent the reader from truly understanding and caring about these characters or if they were just simply that dull. The writing is fair, though nothing spectacular, and while the author has taken great pains to tie up all of the plot's threads by the novel's end, nothing really resolved itself to my satisfaction. The relationships described never rang true for me; I don't believe that a tale so lacking in humor and spirit can really be touted as \\"true to life\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT","review":"I was waiting for the story to begin.

If the movie in its original state was good enough for the folks at squeeky-clean Disney, then why wasn't it good enough for the company that released this DVD? Some of the cuts, as mentioned in the other review, were completely uncalled for and if I hadn't seen the uncut version I would have been lost.

A number of scenes have been cut in this version because they mention potty humor, or show what the trad vals group considers naughty behavior.

So now I am back to using a toothbrush and toothpaste, which he does not mind at all.

I cannot prove that this product caused the seizure but the dog has had no such episodes in his four years of life. He is healthy and full of life. I will not continue using this product on my dogs after reading the effects and dangers of essential oils, specifically rosemary oil, in dog treatments and food.

However, I guess the idea behind the new formula is that it will help freshen the breath.The ingredients are: Distilled water, grain alcohol, grapefruit seed extract, proprietary blend of herbs and natural oils.

Together, Berenstain and his wife, Jan, and eventually their two sons, created books featuring lovable but flawed characters who tackle just about every real issue that faces families.Going to the dentist is something that most kids (and adults!) fear. And why not? It's invasive, uncomfortable, and sometimes painful to have someone poking around in your mouth with metal objects. However, it's necessary, and having a healthy attitude about it will promote lifelong oral health. This book is a great place to start if you're looking to help alleviate your child's fear about going to the dentist.

In an empty world since his passing, his booming personality and wonderful character fills this book with not only who the man was as a young child, but how gifted he was and how success never changed the inner man.He loved his fans, his listeners, and until he died--he sang for them. Very seldom without a following of friends and co-singers surrounding him, he was a generous and kind individual, which echoes in every page of his book.This is the book to read, if you truly want to understand Luciano himself. Other books are out there, but with other opinions, stories, hate-filled sarcasm, or untruths.

I think the simple text and illustrations are actually what I have come to love about this book. It has an energy to it which you don't get tired of even after the 200th reading.

If one could only go back to the attitude of Hugh Walpole and Carl Van Vechten in the 1920s and see it as a classic of science-fiction, very well-written, and ignore the anti-Semitism, one would have an objective discussion.

Perricone asserts his academic qualifications, but any man of science worth his salt would have had his studies published in a scientific/medical journal.

As stated by other reviewers \\"when\\" it would write a disk \\"maybe and just maybe\\" it could read it. This goes for both of the machines. I upgraded the firmware three times all together and still no good they offer this online service. If they got it right before the sale maybe they would not have to upgrade so often. I gave up after 5 bad recordings and one good one on the 615. On the 80 I only lost 7 out of 15 DVD recorded. At about $2 per item or more DVDs don't come cheap but the troubles do. I will give Philips an A+ on their customer service, they are really helpful and do a great job they get a lot of practice. I just wish I had not gotten to know them almost by voice.

Boy, was I wrong. The machine turns itself on & off at will & the customer support was useless. I tried 3 times to record to DVD+RW, with no success. One of the disks showed a title, but when I tried to play, it said the disc was empty. I put the disk into my Cyberhome unit to see if it could read the disk. Now the disk is stuck in that machine (in perpetual \\"reading\\" mode).

Not one bad burn. Can't tell the difference between 2/2.5 hour and original material. 4 hour mode is excellent quality for stacking 8 30 minute shows. The 8 hour mode is great for archiving those old VHS tapes. Not a single problem. The instant 30 minute incremental record button is really handy...Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanting a refund","review":"I had great expectations for this recorder. I wanted to get away from the hassles of a VCR. After reviewing several brands I decided that the Philips had good features for a good price. After using it for 2 months I know why. It is not only unreliable (at this point it often won't read the disks it recorded) but the way the menus work is cumbersome. For example, resetting the clock (which loses a minute a week) requires negotiating 4 menus. There are many more problems I could mention but won't. Don't purchase this DVDR unless you are desperate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Brain is a Dummy!","review":"I purchased this product for my four daughters, myself, and my sister in law.

She is forced to take on and live out other dimensions of her person that allows her to survive. While it was foul in it's delivery, Rockin Robin puts what we shoo away on a silver platter.

It got off to a good start but soon descended to an unbelievable, uneventful, predictable waste of time once Rockin pronounced she was taken over the scene for good. Rockin is insanely ghetto, deranged & violent as she puts fear in almost everyone she encounters. Chanel seemed to be sensible with everything but her man. Todd & Eryca are both wasted lives. Nelson is a very unbelievable character as he shares his past experiences with his ex-wife, professional life and how he tranformed to the hit man that we came to know. Jiles is the creepiest, most foul,disgusting, heartless scum ever known. He continually raped and caused his only daughter to become the twisted person she is.

If you do not agree with the conservative right, then you are inherently evil and worth less as a person. His hypocrisy seems to have been overlooked by the many positive reviews of this book, and flew right over GWB's head. Democracy is fundamentally about the equality of all citizens, and freedom of speech without 'ifs' 'ands' or 'buts' is the thread that holds it together. Discussion of an educated populace is what makes a democracy work, and tolerance of those who hold conflicting views is of critical importance.

The US spent Trillions and thousands of casualties to create an Iraqui Democracy and the result is that they voted in Sharia - or at least a Sharia based constitution.Democracy in these situations - where **fish for brains Muslims** are concerned - is just a legitimization of their bizarre tyranny.BUSH was likewise deceived. He felt that if the Iraquis were FREE then they would get SMART. Not so. Free Iraquis jump into Islam's prison like lemmings.DEMOCRACY IS WASTED ON MUSLIMS.

The idea that democracy will lead to more peaceful outcomes is little more than a truism of modern times; the real quesiton is how to foment it.

This is an excellent chapter written with clarity, and with relevant examples, which should be lifted out of the book and given publicity to counter false protestations of moral equivalence of the acts of a free society vs. acts in a fear society. The rest of the book seems to be an expansion of King's LETTER FROM A BIRMINGHAM JAIL where the authors argue for strict moral requirements, mainly the institution of the democratic process, to be part of any relationships that we may have with what they call the \\"fear societies.\\" Half-hearted measures would do nothing but keep the status quo, as King argued in his letter.

The first of several dances covered is the simple slow dance. There were several tips that we never thought of (hand positioning, how to lead, etc). We practiced with the DVD only three times, but had it down pretty well for our first dance.We didn't exactly amaze our guests with our dancing ability, but it was much better than just swaying together out there.

So, we purchased the DVD. We found it very enjoyable and it was just what we needed to gain enough confidence to start dancing and to stick with it. We have purchased other Shawn Trautman DVDs and are enjoying those too. We also have taken free classes at a local country/western night club but sometimes found the classes went too fast for us -- the DVDs allow us to \\"rewind\\" and practice over and over until we get it right, before moving on to the next step.

This was my first Shawn/Joanna Trautman instructional DVD and I'll be buying more. Absolutely the best explanation/demonstration of how to lead (if you're the guy) and how to follow (if your the gal). This DVD was easier to understand and follow than the dance lessons we were taking with live instruction. Shawn and Joann'a explanations/demonstrations are just that good!

You can pick up a step in two minutes, but you'll forget it by the next day. Learning steps is simple. Even a child can do it.

The amount of typed errors in this book is appalling. One rather tame example: 19+15 does not equal 36, yet the answer key assumes so. In other instances, the typists forgot to superscript the exponents, so one doesn't know whether 2k means 2 times k or 2 raised to the k power.

They really sacrificed quality with this publication. I'll be waiting for what the Princeton Review puts forth later this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money buy Rocket Review Revolution instead","review":"Kaplan's essay tips were very general and not specific to the type of writing required on the new SAT I.

For instance some people in the Navy (like the submarine's new executive officer) do everything in their power to keep Commander Habley from proving that there really is a North Korean sub out there with stealth technology. Why do they go to such extreme lengths to keep this stealth sub a secret? Their actions are never explained.

Adrian Paul is a dream both visually and as an actor. However, the editing on this to convert the film from gay-themed to straight really ruined the movie in my opinion.

It comes in very handy for those 3AM what-is-going-on-and-is-it-normal questions that you'd like insight into before morning, but don't feel are urgent enough to wake your OB out of a deep sleep to answer (though it also lets you know when you should, in fact, do that!).The book navigates seamlessly between finding out you're expecting and actually delivering the baby --- covering topics ranging from how to select a doctor to oversee your pregnancy to how the baby's health is evaluated post-birth and how soon after delivery you can expect to return to the comfort of your own home.The concise yet informative answers are a welcome relief to women who want the facts --- just the facts --- in short order. I highly recommend this book to any expectant woman who thinks she might have even one question over the next nine months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing parts","review":"I'm sorry to say that this transaction was disappointing.

Several times I tried to call and couldn't even get through- got a busy signal or a recording saying the wait would be over 30 minutes!!

The fact is that it will only run on very smooth floors (i.e., wood & some tile), is loud just driving it normally...but when it attempts to climb and the fans kick in...WOW! During our test we attempted to run it across our wood floors (it did fine), into a wall without any trim (it slowly began to tilt upward), and this is where it stayed! It was unable to climb without assistance. Once it got going, it could not sustain itself and continually kept sliding back down the wall. This was in a straight line! Anytime you attempted to make any turn it slid drastically or fell off the wall. Great idea for a toy, but horribly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son had more fun waiting in line to return this flop.","review":"I purchased this for my son for Christmas because he really wanted it.

I have been excited about writing horror and upon purchasing this book I read it extremely quick. The book kept me reading even though I didn't agree with every writers opinion (especially that horror should have a deeper meaning or it is just teenage slasher entertainment).

The only song that doesn't exactly fit is \\"I Know,\\" but that song is still not a reason to not buy this. You should probably buy all of Bob's other studio albums first, and then you'll know whether or not this is right for you.

The vivid imagery and colorful characters will force you to leave an imprint on someone else's eardrum. If chicken soup is good for the soul, Any Kind of Luck is good for the heart. William Jack Sibley's book is a melting pot of small-town characters, puntuated with dysfunctional family members, coupled with gay relationships...not to mention a menagerie of Chihuahuas at foot. You will find yourself anxiously awaiting the next hilarious entry in each chapter. Witty, charming and heart warming. With William Jack Sibley, it has nothing to do with luck, but everything to do with talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a whirl!","review":"Oy!

His mother has cancer, but that doesn't stop the announcement of an impending marriage to a minister.

While small portions are devoted to the Buddhists of Kashmir, Nepal, and Sikkim, the majority of the book is about Bhutan, because it's the last remaining Buddhist monarchy of the Himalayan region. This is not a travel narrative; instead, the material is arranged by topic. It's comprehensive and pleasant to read. It's shortcoming is the author's unabashed bias in favor of the Bhutanese monarchy, despite its dubious record of human rights toward the Hindu minority. Crossette admits she received favored treatment from the king, and it shows. Likewise, she sides with the (now deposed) monarchy of Sikkim. The bias is so transparently obvious, I didn't feel I had been conned, but one expects greater balance from a correspondent of The New York Times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pushing her political agenda","review":"Barbara is pushing her political agenda in this book which detracts from its value."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Close to Heaven","review":"Worst book ever on the subject.

The phone battery is a metal hydride and can be recharged without memory problems like nickel cad. I really like this phone. The build quality is outstanding and most of the other cordless phones I've owned just feel flimsy. You can't hold this phone against your head while typing because of it's small size, this along with the battery life are the only reasons I can't rate it 5 stars.

I've been a Jeff Gordon fan for a few years now, and loved watching the on-track duels between these two drivers. The stories and pictures compliment each other very well, telling the story of two fierce competitors and their respect for one another. I am sad knowing that there will never be another last lap duel between 'Wonderboy' and the Intimidator, but this book helps keep the memories alive. Highly recommended for fans of either driver, or NASCAR fans in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for children","review":"Im sorry, the words in this book are so hard, so over the top and hard my kids sat there looking bored sick. I don't know what age group this is for: more like college level. the pictures do not go with the store. Its the original Phantom words with cat pictures. Why didn't they just draw regular people or use a cat adapted story?

GREAT BARGAIN!!","review":"The anime itself if fun and light-hearted enough where it doesn't get boring (and makes you laugh), but with enough action to keep you excited. The end of the series is especially touching, but what makes the series great is how the characters get to know each other from beginning to end.PLUS there are SEVEN EPISODES IN ONE DVD! That's the best bargain you'll get. About 3 1/2 hours of entertainment. you won't regret buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Girl Under","review":"If you can get past the unnecessary showing of Momiji's panties; you will really enjoy this. It is comic with a good plot. The dubbing is not nearly as bad as most."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immature and pedophilic","review":"I am a lover of Anime but the sexual themes are generally a bit off. This one is the epitome of what I hate about that aspect of Anime... EVERY SINGLE EPISODE (from the first disc at least) shows the main characters, a 15 year old school girl, underwear. Not only that but it generally makes a point of talking about it as well. I'm not against a little gratuitous sexuality/sensuality but showing a 15 year girl as such is wrong.I'm not into that whole little girl thing. Taking advantage of underaged children is sick... even cartoon ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is it?","review":"I cannot write a review on an item I never received.

I saw them in Austin years ago and they were a lot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Novel Ideas Badly Executed","review":"I read this because a reviewer commented that the heroine was trying to go to college. I thought the fact the heroine had goals might be an interesting change from the standard vampire romance (where the protagonist seems utterly devoid of ambition). Their are lots of novel ideas in this book that are things I have wished other authors would address. The idea of a middle aged women with kids who becomes a vampire and leaves her family is interesting, as is the idea of vampires meeting elves, and elves getting their mortal lover turned into a vampire to make them immortal. The problem is the protagonist turns into a \\"too perfect\\" Mary Sue loved by everyone. Near the end the book degenerates into a kind of preachy New Age goo, full of a badly handled argument for tolerance and a lot of \\"free love\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remedial writing and plotting","review":"This is garden variety urban fantasy genre - you know, the loner outcast protagonist realizes magic is real, makes magical friends, finds out she fits in after all, blah blah. It's all been done much better by others, particularly Charles de Lint and Neil Gaiman. I had bought this book on the initial gushing reviews and was sorry to learn later most of them were the \\"friends of the author/ free copy if you review\\" variety. Well, I paid full price and have never met the author. I wasn't able to get past the average writing, nominal characterization, and I won't even get into the glaring typos and continuity errors. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of trea","review":"Unfortunately I did not enjoy this book. I relied on the reviews on this page and went out and purchased all 3 books. I didn't make it through to the middle of this book. I am very broad minded but found this book to be out of my league. If you are in to monogamy then this book is not for you. I was really disappointed with the way the book was going - again maybe it was just me but I wasted a lot of money (as the prices of these books is very expensive). Sorry Amy Lane but I won't be buying any more books of yours. I am avid reader and have over 3,000 books in my library and I have to admit that this one was the worst I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry....couldn't do it....","review":"Based on the reviews, I purchased this book. I'm sorry to say, I could not even finish it. It was tedious and I was not sure exactly what the story was about or what it was leading towards (granted, I did not finish it, but had it held my attention, I may have found out what it was leading towards). I donated the book to the library, hopefully other readers will enjoy the book, I just cannot say I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am baffled","review":"I was really looking forward to this novel. Both the description and the reviews made it seem like this was a great first-time novel. I was terribly disappointed to find that not only does the author have very little grasp on how to properly use a comma, but the punctuation for the dialogue is also done wrong! Adding in the numerous typos and the switching of first-person POV from character to character totally threw me out of the book. I do not plan on finishing it and will return it as soon as I can. I hope the author gets a good editor before she self-publishes again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"I usually like books like these but this one was way to weird. The book is hard to understand and the author doesn't really know what she is trying to say. The characters don't stay true. It is quite disappointing. Then the one character that I actually liked the author decides to kill off! Don't waste your money or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, poorly edited","review":"I finished this one but only because I made myself. By the end, I was wishing I had never started it. To start with, the writing is very poor, almost as if written by a kid at times but then with the subject matter that'd be totally weird. What bothered me more than the writing were the characters. It's like the author had a checklist of personality types and traits. Not something I'd recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I had found these books sooner!! WONDERFUL!!","review":"Vulnerable and Wounded...what great books...I cried like a baby reading the first book. This author is wonderful. She is up close and personal and will take time to answer any questions :) I'm almost done with Bound and I will for sure be re-reading these books. Take a chance with these, it will be worth it, it was for me ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A facinating spin on preternatural romance","review":"I was completely engrossed in this book, captivated by the love story bonding the characters Cory, Aiden and Green. Each of these characters unfold the story through their own point of view, inviting you to \\"get inside their heads\\" and really understand their emotions, decisions, insecurities.There is never a dull moment. It will grip you from the first to the very last page. I look forward to the next 2 books in this Little Goddess series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...","review":"As others have said, this book needs better editing. However, from what I understand, this is a self-published book and I imagine it's very difficult to edit your own work.I loved the characters in this book. Cory, Adrian, and Green sucked me into their lives and I was wishing the book wouldn't end. The secondary characters were also likeable. Especially Bracken.I liked the basic storyline. I think the bad guy could have been done a little better, because he kind of came off as two dimensional, but Lane could have done that on purpose, as it seems that the story was really more about the romantic relationships than anything else. And that is fine.All in all, if you are a reader who isn't too easily distracted by some typos and missed/bad punctuation, you will probably enjoy this book. I think the author has done a really good job for her first time, and I will buy her books again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up the hype","review":"I was hesitant to get this book because of the price, but after reading all the great reviews by other readers, I was very excited and decided to purchase it. It was such a great disappointment. The switch between viewpoints is confusing, and I have a hard time following the story because the plot/action doesn't flow smoothly. Overall, not worth the money. Borrow the book from the library first if you can before deciding to put your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total emersion","review":"I adored this book. I was enraptured by Cory from the first moment. Her world with Green and Adrian became my world, rich with magical and erotic love, foolish bravery and redemption. Mainstream publishers flood the vampire genre with trite, idiotic repeats of the \\"same ole, same ole\\" . . . but Amy Lane's self-published first novel, Vulnerable, rises so far above the norm, that she has not been snapped up and signed to a multi-book contract is . . . astonishing. Her characters live and breathe; her descriptions draw vivid pictures in your mind and her \\"voice\\" is unique. I sucked down this novel in one sitting and suffered a 3 day \\"Vulnerable\\" hang-over . . . please, Ms. Lane, may I have some more????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.....","review":"I follow many of the threads regarding the various authors and their books. I love JR Ward, Moning, Singh, Gabaldon, Kenyon, Harris, Cole, Frost, Leigh. Generally, I order the first book in the series to see if I like the author and then order the rest of the books. The reviews on this book made it sound wonderful. So, I ordered \\"Vulnerable\\". I have never been disappointed until now. I thought the writing was horrible, so many spelling and word mistakes. I felt like a teenager wrote the book. It will be going in the trash and I won't be ordering the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful book","review":"I can't put into words how much I loved this book. I really got attached to the characters, especially Green, but also Cory, Adrian, Brack, and Arturo. The setting was beautiful, Green's paradise was definitely a place I wanted to crash and the plot had really good pacing. I'm dying for the next book to arrive, I didn't hesitate to buy the series and Bitter Moon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulerable: The first book in the \\"Little Goddess\\" series","review":"I was shocked at the gross sexual content as I browsed the pages of the book.To me \\"Little Goddess\\" infered a book suitable for younger readers.

But - the book was destroyed - thrown out - trashed.I wish the review had been more detailed regarding such content.So I can't say anything regarding the story line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Paranormal Book","review":"I am so pleased to have discovered Amy Lane!This book was recommended in an Amazon Paranormal Community blog in response to a question about good Fae books.The lyrical writing style reminds me a bit of Robin McKinley's book \\"Sunshine\\" but unequivacably more raw... The author's voice is an interesting dichotomy of edgey blunt dailogue and lyrical beauty. I love that Cory is a tough smart female character not the typical weak paranormal romance novel heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or time","review":"I was excited about this book when I read other reviews. However, I was very disappointed. While a creative concept, there were too many characters without much character development. There were frequent spelling and punctuation errors. This book had potential, but desperately needed an editor. The errors took away from the story. For example, one of the characters actually changed names through the book -- Mitchell Anderson (p. 45) became Mitch Reynolds (p.63) and then became Mitchell Hammond (p. 105). I struggled to finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't finish it.","review":"I ordered Vulnerable on a whim after reading The Twilight series. I didn't buy it because of the reviews. I bought it because it sounded interesting. Unfortunately, I gave up on it. I read almost half of it and realized I couldn't keep reading it -- I didn't want to keep reading it. I was under the impression that this was a vampire book, but there was too much focus on other creatures: elves, were-cats etc. It was just too much for me. Not my kind of thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks monkey balls","review":"This book was awful not only did the story jump around awkwardly. The author actually managed to create a main character who is ugly and throws up every time something bad happens.I mean man up. The author just had her calling herself bitchy all the time. I guess if you are a woman your first response to everything is bitchy. (IM ROLLING MY EYES NOW) I couldn't get behind the girl. The sex scenes were glossed over. So just as you got to the juicy part she breezed over it. No Build up no nothing!!! (except a lame 13 year old's idea of love.) I can't believe I paid 9.99 for this. Who published this? I mean honestly I couldn't even make it to then end it was so bad. So if you like casual gay sex bulimic 20 something's and a generic preternatural world then this book is for you, but take it from me when I sum up this book in Two words MONKEY BALLS. ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creative, three dimensional characters...","review":"I have never read any books by a self published author. I'm glad I decided to try this one. I have read the reviews and thought, well, it does sound interesting. It was. I was blown away. I loved Corrine, Adrian, Green. Bracken. All the characters really STOOD OUT to me. None of them were just on the page. They all had unique personality, backgrounds, etc. I felt as though I was uncovering treasure tidbits with each character.The plot itself, I thought, was great. I love paranormal anyway, but this was different from the usual vampire, fey, etc. that I usually read. I would classify it as more Urban Fantasy than romance per se, but there was definitely romance smoking enough to keep me turning pages. I loved the book and judge it five stars based on how it kept me engaged, my attention did not stray and it took me only one day to read it.I can honestly recommend this book to anyone who likes Paranormal romance and urban fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivial Book","review":"This book is too trivial.

This lets you finish shaving if the charge runs out before you are finished. The charge indicator is a nice feature as well as the fully charged indicator.The micro screen cover is not attached very well and continues to pop loose during shaving, and this model takes about twice as long to shave compared to my older shaver.Lastly, Remington does give a good shave but not as close as a blade as their ads state."},{"rating":"2","title":"An astoundingly comprehensive overview of the legal process.","review":"How better could an author examine the legal process than be a part of it?

Where's Jack when you need him?","review":"You know, this is a good album. It's just not a great album. Jorma plays well, though he's done it before. Falzarano assists ably, but doesn't inspire. Some cuts hit (Re-enlistment Blues, Dark Train), some miss (Judge I'm Not Sorry). The bassist spends all of his time attempting to sound like a Jack clone. If you are going to go to that length to sound like Cassady, you might as well play with him. Where Jorma has had some solid moments as a solo artist, he was at his best playing off of his friend Jack. Together they created inspired music. Even as recently as the Sweetater discs ('93) they still had magic. Unfortunately, this album wanted to sound like a Tuna album but forgot half the recipe. Stick with Tuna...Simon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"The X10 alarm system is a joke. Looks like a kids toy. My guess is any positive review was submitted by the manufacturer. Horns don't work, motion detectors don't work, the light module works every once in awhile. The \\"seller\\" does not supply a phone number and the manufacturer won't do anything except refer you back to the \\"seller\\" who has yet to respond to my emails. I'm boxing mine up to day and sending it straight to Amazon so they can see what kind of junk they are peddling on their site. This system was made in China...by the night crew. Totally a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd look for something better.","review":"Installed it without much trouble - however, since then, we've had problems with interference from my computer/monitor and the signal from the front door module. If my computer/monitor are on, the light at the control panel stays lit for the front door, preventing arming of the alarm.Second, the other day I had a box on the counter and unknowingly sat it on the control unit and bumped the selector switch from RUN1 to INSTALL. We walked around doing things for a couple minutes before I realized it, past the motion sensors. Now the system wont arm and will require an entire fresh install. That's just poor design.Overall the price was great, but in the end you get what you pay for.

I had netting from sod planted a few years back. What a nasty mess but the weed reducers worked. I wouldn't use my Mantis without them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Work OK","review":"These are pretty good at making it easier to get the roots and tangles out of the tines. They aren't as good at keeping them from getting there in the first place. I don't think there is a solution for that - it's just the nature of rotary tines and long, tough, fibrous roots. I think their main value is that they keep roots from becoming tightly wound around the tine shaft and seals that protect the transmission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be standard equipment","review":"Consider the reducers standard equipment and add their cost to the price of whatever unit you purchase. I tilled 2 identical sections of a raised bed with and without the reducers. Each section was covered with a tangled mat of 12\\" tall grassy weeds. With the reducers, I finished a section in 30 minutes and had to clear the tines 3 times; without the reducers, it took over an hour and I had to clear the tines 7 times. And it is much tougher to clear the tines without the reducers because the stringy stems bind like rope to the narrow shaft.Pop for the extra $15 up front - the time saved pays you back quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Necessary 'accessory'","review":"These reducers really work. Apparently the tangling of weeds and small roots in the area covered by these things is what causes enough strain on the electric motor to cause it to stall and the reset button to pop out. That won't happen if you install these things - at least mine has not stalled out since I put them on. I would not recommend using an electric Mantis tiller without these things. And don't use your electric tiller for long periods of time (15+ minutes) - set it up in the shade or in the wind on the kickstand and handles to let the motor cool down. Overheating is never good for an electric motor."},{"rating":"2","title":"saves time but you will still have to work at removing the weeds","review":"A definite buy if you consider tackling sod or new applications with the mantis. Saves time and reduces the amount of time you have to spend taking the tines off. You still have to pop off the tines but the weeds slide off with these reducers and you don't have to spend an additional 5 minutes picking it off the shaft."},{"rating":"2","title":"swampy Cajun fiddling","review":"This was a 1974 recording by the legendary Blues fiddle (Violin) player, but the emphasis on these songs was, as the album title suggests, the Bayou Cajun and Country sound. No city slicker licks on here, just pure down home fiddling and some songs that drift closer to traditional country. Gatemouth's singing may not set your world on fire, but his playing, and that by the other strong cast of musicians on here more than makes up for any vocal deficiencies. This CD edition also gives you 2 earlier recordings from 1972. My favorites are the songs with long instrumental passages such as \\"Gate's Express\\" (yes, he makes that fiddle hum like a train's a-comin') and \\"Cassoulet.\\" 49 minutes of music, although nearly two minutes of that is devoted to \\"studio verbiage and other appropriate banter.\\" Gotta like that sense of humor, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"This is well woth picking up if you are at all a Hot Tuna fan.

It also has an S-Video output, which allows you to get the finest picture quality. I could not find DVD-R in the manual but it does support DVD-R also. I havent tried all the DivX, but i am sure it will work. The only flaws i could visibly notice is blacker than black, it was better when i used S-Video though. And the other problem is that it makes a little noise while playing, it is only evident when you are watching a silent scene.

Both had quality issue (the TV's remote died once). I am convinced Philips has the WORST quality control. I'd never buy another philips again."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst dvd player i've ever had","review":"and i've had some cheap dvd players. this makes my apex and cyberhome dvd players seem like top of the line players. anyway it often pauses during playback, locks up completely, or mistakenly gives parental lockout--all just with store bought hollywood movies. have updated the player to the latest official firmware, but no improvement. turns out the warranty is just 90 days, which to my mind=buyer beware. i've only had it about six months and i guess it was exhibiting these flaws earlier, but didn't know the warranty was that bad. i've put it back in the box and was going to sell it, but wouldn't feel morally right about passing it on to anyone. don't know what the heck i'll do with it now. will be very hesitant to buy anything from philips again. good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"good only if does not die","review":"Mine died after 5 months.Don't bother calling Philips.

Worked for about a year and just died, wouldn't power up. Called Philips for an explanation and they wanted $15 just to talk to me!Just bought a new Panasonic recorder as a replacement (as well as a cheap Cyberhome to do the PAL stuff). The progressive picture on the new player is MUCH better than this Philips! I can't believe I was watching that muted picture for a year.

It seems that it will only play my DVDs for about 4min before loading the DVD over again, and starting all over again. I've talked to Philips Customer Service, who are \\"looking into it\\". I would recommend buying a more expensive and better DVD player, and not to trust Philips Customer Service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great, until the thing dies on you","review":"This player can play almost anything that is thrown at it - however I have had 2 die on me within the space of 1 year. Basically if you want something that will last, don't bother with this product. Pity, because it converts to PAL really well and even plays divx/xvid files. Philips only has a 90 warranty on this, so if you do purchase it, get an extended warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best, Cheap DVD Player there is","review":"This thing will play about everything you throw at it, so If you download a lot of movies and video clips, you can burn them to disk and chances are, this'll play it.The player itself is good quality too from what I can see, and has a full selection of audio and video outputs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work as Specified","review":"I was looking for Player which can run DIVX format... bought DVP642, found it CANNOT all DIVX CD's more over the sound is messedup.

After only 5 months I'm going to throw it away as it is incapable of reading most discs all the way through without bad hiccups. The remote sensor also seems terribly finicky about the remote angle.While it is region free and the playback quality is good, the short lifespan earns this player only 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke with very little use","review":"I played about 10 movies on the DVD player and then it broke.Poor quality.

I looked online and lots of people had the same issue! :(I liked the feature of being able to play DIVX movies. I have instead purchased AIVX Jukebox that is a portable USB harddrive that can be hooked up to the TV to play all the movies or mp3 that are stored on the disk. I found it to be a better replacment for the extra DVD player the DVP642 was supposed to be for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent product back","review":"I sent it back, because it was not what I had perceived to be true.

I have noticed that the price on this piece of $#!% has been going down steadily for weeks. The problem with mine was that the audio and the visual did not seem to want to be on the same page, and yeah, that's kind of not good. I used it with two different TVs and had the same problem; you get through about 50 minutes or so of a disc and you can clearly see that the mouths are moving but they aren't saying the things coming out of the speakers. Save your money and buy a better DVD player or wait until the high def war has come to an end because progressive scan doesn't mean $#%! anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as announced","review":"The review announces this item to be able to read US DVD as well as European.

If that is your reason for buying this player, I suggest looking elsewhere. Some divx files would play fine for a while and then freeze the player. Others wouldnt play at all. I realise some audio codecs aren't supported in these players and I confirmed that wasnt the issue here. All of these divx files played just fine on my PC so something isnt right with the Divx implementation on this player. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good with a great price","review":"I was looking for an affordable DVD player and found this one.

Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned Two: Both Died","review":"3 months after purchasing this Phillips DVD player it started acting funny. It would be temperamental about which discs it would play despite all of them being authentic USA DVD's purchased from Borders or wherever. More than half the time you put a disc in the DVD player now, it just freezes with the screen saying \\"loading\\". It wont respond to anything so you just have to unplug it. This has even been the case with brand new DVDs so it isn't due to scratches. As of yesterday, the screen will go blank and then turn to a green flashing screen sometimes when in the middle of a movie or it will slow down to slow-motion and stop responding. This is the 2nd Philips DVD player I've owned, the first was the exact same model and crapped out in the exact same with within 6 months.I would strongly suggest looking at other DVD players. This one is cheap, lightweight, thin and stylish, but it simply doesn't work.

Thanks to Philips DVP642 Progressive-Scan DVD Player this is not a problem. It can be easily re-programmed to accept DVDs from all zones (regions). The trick has been published on the internet. Philips DVP642 plays all video and audio formats. It reads all types of media (i.e. DVD+R, DVD-R, DVD+RW, DVD-RW). I have used it with both wide-screen and normal TVs. With a three-cable RGB connection to a wide-screen TV monitor the picture quality is just perfect. The sound quality is perfect in all cases, whether I use analog or digital sound output."},{"rating":"1","title":"JPEG WILL NOT DISPLAY","review":"This item is a pain. Despite what I had read here before I bought it. It will not play jpegs images, any size, different brands of CD-R and CD-RW. Both are supposed to work. I tried different file sizes/names/numbers etc. It simply spits disc out, indicates \\"no disc\\"!! The manual trouble shooter section, no help, email help..none, referred me to phone help number. They were also of no real help. They hardly knew what I was talking about, and didn't offer to research problem and get back to me. Finally they had me send it back for a replacement, at my cost, even though it's under warranty! The second one the same disappointment. Look elsewhere for a consistant product, one with a liberal return policy! It will play a DVD movie, wheee. I am done with Philips!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Region Free???","review":"The only reason I bought this DVD player was to be able to play PAL DVD's. Well, despite the misleading advertisement on Amazon.com that reads: \\"PAL-to-NTSC format conversion-PLAY REGION 1 2 3 4 5 6 0 any SYSTEM\\", and some reviews from others who had bought this unit, mine does not play region 5 PAL discs. I tried different ones but was only getting an error message: \\"Wrong Region\\". My player manual says that it will only play DVDs with Region 1 or ALL, but will not play any others. Any advise from people who said: \\"No codes needed - plays everything right out of the box\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Day of operation","review":"Died after one day. From then on, any DVD would spin up then give an error msg of \\"NO DVD\\".

I had to remove my DVD with force so that is the end of that.When I purchased this model there were reviews that said it would not work for very long and they were right. Hope all of you have better luck than I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Same problem as many other reviews. Flashing power/standby light. I've treated this thing like gold and it craps out for no reason. How can Phillips produce a product like this and not stand behind it, especially since this is such a widespread issue??? I know it has something to do with a bulging capacitor on the main board, but, I don't have any soldering irons or tech know-how to fix it myself. Going with a Sony next time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Player with a few hang-ups","review":"Used it for a while now and it's a pretty good player. The specs says DVD+R/RW but all my movies (be they dvd format or the divx files) are burnt on DVD-R or DVD-RWs and this unit played it without a problem!!! It does have problems playing some mpg and wmv files and that is understandable because it was not in the specs anyway. Physically thin compared to most budget dvd players out here.Cons: A real cheap crappy remote. Only 8X fast forward speed. No menu buttons on the player itself (so if you can't find your remote, and you want to perform most of the navigation functions on the unit itself then you are SOL)Overall a pretty good player for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst product","review":"Bought one Philips DVD player two years ago.It stopped working after several months.I bought another DVP 642 last Nov. in Circuit city, it stopped working again. the worst product I have ever used.Waste of time and money...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Annoying Ticking Sound","review":"A expected better from a brand like Philips.

We had to take the player apart just to get the DVD out before throwing the player away in the trash. Our previous DVD player lasted over 5 years before it started skipping.

To no avail. The DVDs played fine on my old player.I like to complement Amazon for its extended return period over the holiday season.

But the remote and interface are the most awful I've ever seen - it takes 4 button presses just to see how much time is left in a movie. Then, almost more unbelievably, it takes 3-4 more presses to CLEAR that from the display. There is no \\"return\\" button or anything like that. The fast and slow forward/reverse functions work great, but the buttons are laid out on the remote in a very unnatural way, the track skip buttons are where the FF and REW buttons should be, and during fast forward or rewind, you can't pause - you have to hit PLAY first, then you can pause.

But now our second one has failed after about 6months. So might just be a case of 'get what you pay for'. I suppose I should also say that I do sometimes fall asleep with the thing still playing so it goes all night, but my Mitsubishi player has taken this kind of abuse for years and is still humming along.In hindsight, I would have spent the extra money and gotten a player in the next price bracket up and will when I replace this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neat until it dies","review":"I bought this DVD player to replace my dying one, mostly because of how many formats it could play.

Burning the avi files as data and watching the movies on the tv. I encountered the flashing power light problem, and being a technician took a quick look at the interior to see if it was a mechanical problem that could be easily fixed or not (and to get my damn dvd back too). After a quick look, I figured it was pooched. Seeing as theres a Wal-Mart nearby, i bought the same unit again, and placed the non-working unit in the new box. Back to Walmart, and said it didn't work. They refunded my money. So in essence, I payed for the first original unit, and got my money refunded for the second unit. Philips may not have a decent support system, but Walmart does with its no questions asked policy for refunds. Only way I know of to beat the system of getting the unit again without any extra costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST DVD PLAYER EVER!","review":"I can sum it up in 25 words or less.

At least three DVD's that play on all other DVD players (and computers) in the house fail to load and play. The discs have no sign of damage and yet the player just sits there \\"Loading.\\" Th manual and on-line help were useless.It's ashame as the player has some nice features... but right now it's relegated to the kid's play room to play teletubbies on a 13\\" CRT tv"},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't last a year.","review":"Less than a year after I purchased this DVD player it has suffered a fatal error. Now the red stand-by light, which blinked constantly anyway, is the only part of the device functioning. While it is an inexpensive player, and worked admirably while it lasted, less than a year's use is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great features and price - but doesn't last long","review":"This is a great, inexpensive DVD player - especially when you buy foreign language DVDs (different region codes) and want to play those.Beware: I had two of the low-price Philips DVD units over the past 3 years. They both lasted no longer than 15 months. At first I was quite angry about it. In the meantime I look at it differently.Philips clearly chooses price over quality. I assume they figure that format changes happen frequently and by saving on quality they can provide consumers with affordable units and thus you can \\"update\\" by buying into the next, more feature-rich unit.It does require your willingness to change your buying habits, though. Gone are the days where you old on to your equipment for 5+ years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops working after 3 months","review":"This DVD player does play all types of DVDs no matter how you burn it. But like other reviews, it stopped working after 3-6 months. In my case, it was 3 months. It just doesn't turn on anymore. I unplugged everything and replugged it but it just went dead. I don't watch DVDs much, so it's not like I overused it. Go with another model. This one has problems. I thought mines would be the exception, but I guess not. And now I can't return it because it's been over 30 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD player in its price range.","review":"It plays all the DIVX or AVI movies I tried but for some reason it does not play the entire bootleg DVDs; especially when it gets hot. I'm really impressed with the easy to use remote control. This product makes an excellent gift for movie lovers who have movies on CDs in DIVX format at a competitive price. It plays JPEG CDs with no problems. I haven't had any problems yet other than it getting hot and not playing bootleg DVDs. Overall its worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD Player","review":"Ive had this dvd player for over year now and i have had no problems with it.

Half the time the DVD door would not open. The other half of the time the DVD player would freeze half way through the movie and then shut down and not come on for at least half an hour. This would also happen when i would turn on the DVDplayer 50% of the time. Do your self a favor and spend a little extra money to avoid total trash and irritation."},{"rating":"2","title":"DTS YES!","review":"I love this player. It's GREAT! I wasn't sure I wanted to buy this because it didn't play DTS. But I put in Gladiator with DTS and it worked. (i have a sony 5.1 dolby digital/dts receiver) One tip, when you burn to a CD-R use ISO. You can then FF and RW Divx files."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading advertising!","review":"The details about this product is a bold face lie. It says that this dvd player will play all regions, 1,2,3,4,5, & 6. So, I bought it so I could play a dvd that I purchased from the UK. When I opened the dvd player the manuel says that it in fact does not play all regions. Only dvd's marked region 1 and all region. Bold face liars. I am so upset! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for allowing misleading advertising on their website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy at your own peril...","review":"I bought this one in late Nov 2004, but didn't start using it until mid-Jan 2005. Early March 2005 it wouldn't play DVDs anymore, but CDs and the other formats still played well. Customer support wouldn't get me a new one since it was past the 90 day warranty, even though it had in actuality been used for less than 2 months.I went for the \\"Reduced cost exchange\\" that they offered, paying $30-something to have them ship me a new unit. Now, 88 days later, the same thing has happened again. I've sent them a message already and will call them tomorrow and see what they do now that it's within the 90 day warranty. I'm not going to shell out another $30-something for another piece of junk that dies after such short time.In all, a good price, it plays a lot of different formats but if you're planning on using it for watching DVDs for more than 2-3 months after you buy it then stay far away from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player but not perfect","review":"I don't want to repeat all the good things which have been said about this player. They are all true. I just want to mention 2 things which are probably minor flaws:1. The languages for subtitles on foreign DVD's are limited to English, French and Spanish2.

Sure, its loaded with plenty of features for the price. But, it doesn't come close in video quality to my 5-year old Sony unit it replaced. I've tried many various settings combinations, but I can't get rid of the period horizontal color shifts. Another very annoying \\"feature\\" is that when a movie is stopped mid-stream and you turn off the player, next time you start from the begining. Remote control layout is so weak that it becomes frustrating after awhile, not just a light annoyance. For the money, its great. As a cheapest way into progressive scan DVD, its great. As a great, or even average DVD player - not even close."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the money, not very reliable","review":"I purchased my first DVP642 1.5 years ago in Walmart.

They also said it would take approximately 15 days from when they receive it.

Right, just like a car that only starts every 3rd try.So unless you want to reset this \\"feature\\" every time you use it, don't bother with this player for HD TV.

It's unlikely that I will purchase another one of these machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic region-free format-converting player","review":"This was one of the earliest units to satisfy two basic needs for owners of DVDs purchased from multiple countries. It offers multi-region capabilities (not quite out-of-the-box, but easy to set up even though I notice that some reviewers failed to do it) and it converts PAL DVDs to NTSC and vice versa. I own about one hundred DVDs from Italy and they all play fine. I have a multi-system TV so I was able to compare the unconverted PAL output with the converted NTSC output and they are indistinguishable. I have owned the unit for a couple of years and it hasn't given me any problem, although it runs quite hot and will probably fare better with plenty of ventilation. In most other respects this is just your standard inexpensive DVD player.By now (1/2006) there are probably other units with similar features on the market, but I think that Philips deserves the credit for bringing multiregion and conversion at this price level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect this to last more than a year of serious usage","review":"I've bought a total of 4 various Philips DVD players including two of these.

But, DVD players aren't supposed to be disposable are they?By the way, just for more detail as to the specific problem, all 3 that have stopped working had problems with the DVD loading, unloading, and spinning system.

The picture is crisp and the progressive scan seems to be solid, but there is a bit of a drawback. On discs that are in mint condition, the set plays nice and quietly. However, any DVD with even minor scrathes will have an obscenely loud chirping eminating throughout the entire film. It's quite amazing how violently different two DVD's of only marginal different in condition can play on it.PAL conversion appears to be solid. A few jaggies at the edges of objects occasionally, but nothing to fret about. My main problem is with the set's inability to play DVD's that may not be mint without that incessant shill/chirping, as it renders any rentals nearly unwatchable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't perform basic functions","review":"No sooner did I start using this DVD player than it stopped working with DVDs. It still plays CDs, but it won't read a single DVD. I tried troubleshooting using information from Philips and online to no avail. I contacted Philips and they said that I will need to ship it in to have warranty work done and that I must pay for the shipping. While paying for the shipping is a standard clause of the warranty, I think it's BS to have to pay to fix a DVD player that stopped working within its first week of use. I will probably by a different brand rather than have this one fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you get it buy an extended warranty!","review":"This really is a nice player- it will play almost anything, and you can play DVD-R MPEG files using its built-in menu. BUT- like many other people, mine died 2 months after the 'standard' 90-day warranty expired. You would think that Philips would fix the capacitor problem (just Google it- you'll see what I mean). It may be OK if you get the extended warranty, but expect to replace it after about 6 to 9 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has trouble reading disks.","review":"I don't know if we got a lemon or what, but our player doesn't live up to other reviews. While most features work as advertised, we have problems just getting a DVD to play correctly.Just recently, we missed over ten minutes of a movie just trying to fast forward through spots where the DVD player freezes up. When it can't read a disk, it often becomes unresponsive to all commands and we physically have to walk up to the player and yank the power cord in order to restart it. This skipping problem happens with at least half of all DVDs making movie watching a chore rather than a hobby. All in all, the particular unit we have is a piece of crap and we will be replacing it before watching any more DVDs.We did buy it at Fred Meyer and not Amazon so maybe that's why we're having trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips 642/ 37 Region Free","review":"Player works great with all Divx formats I have tried so far.

It was also cheap and easy to unlock (make into a region-free player). After 3 months with this player, I have given up on it and will be returning it for something different. It continually freezes up, usually during the FBI warning. Other than this glitch, I have to say that the remote control unit is one of the worst pieces of plastic I have ever used.

Picture OK, about what you'd expect at this price. But picture started to flicker after 6 months, then player died completely. Called Philips, they told me warranty on 642/37 expires after 3 months, after that the only option you have is get a new unit at a 20% discount, and minus the region-free capability, which is dealer-installed. My advice: Skip this player, go for a brand with better product quality & customer service in the same price range, eg, Panasonic DVD-S47 or Panasonic DVD-S27."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke in 3 mos under warranty","review":"mine broke after 3 mos.

Called Philips and they say sorry but they wont warrenty it. They only have a 90 day warrenty. Pretty lame I think. They offered an exchange unit for $45 and I pay all shipping. I would look elsewhere for a player. I paid $75 when I bought it and only got 6 months out of it. That isnt very good reliabilty if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine, DEAD after only 4 MONTHS!","review":"We received ours at the beginning of december. It worked fine until the beginning of april until it died. Totally dead in only 4 MONTHS. Contacted Philips and their best offer is we pay to ship the broken one back and an extra $30+ and we can receive a refurbished replacement. We paid more for the name expecting it to outlast our cheapo Apex that lasted 3+ YEARS. Too bad we didn't get what we paid for. Now we'll just apply that \\"replacement cost\\" towards a (hopefully) better brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 727's Remarkable Successor","review":"Tell you what, Philips is a great company. I bought their 727 model and it malfunctioned within a few months (like many others I later found out.) I sent it back to Phillips (my return shipping cost $8.00)and gave them my credit card number for the $29.99 charge for a new 727 replacement. The weeks dragged on and no word from Philips. Then one day I receive--not the 727--but the new 624. And Philips never charged me for the 727 exchange. That is real customer service. The 624 is a great DVD player for a great price, and works perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, poor remote, picture only average","review":"I bought the DVP642 because I wanted to be able to play Divx movies as well as having good progressive output. While the system works as advertised with Divx files, other flaws hurt this device. There is a noticable clicking noise whenever a disc is playing. This comes from the drive tray itself, not the audio output. The remote lacks discrete on/off buttons which makes it harder to integrate into a home theatre environment. To switch from progressive mode to regular output, you have to go through a series of menus. Finally, the picture from the system is not very good, comparable to $30-40 units. In all, unless you MUST have Divx, give the Philips DVP642 a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great player, I am buying a 2nd one","review":"I love this player, it plays every DVD I have in my inventory. No problem with DVD+R/RW. I have a lot of DVD+R/RW so it is a must for me. My coworker recommended to me and I have not regret my decision since. So now I am buying a 2nd one to replace my Toshiba one which I paid more $$ for less capability many years ago.The picture quality is superb. On some movie I never realized that the smoke was there until I view on this DVD. Also, my coworker told me you have to burn Dvix with the right codec or the sounds won't come out right.Now I just need to figure out how to make this player region free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what it promised","review":"I had read that this model didn't play a few formats, even my computer does from time to time... but nine out of ten discs I tried worked with no problem.It was a snap to install, no setup needed, and it even came with the latest software already loaded. Philips offers software upgrades on their website and a manual for upgrading the software (firmware) - but after reading their manual and following the directions I knew I didn't need to update it.This is my first day with the unit and I've already watched 3 movies. Now all I need is a DVD+/-RW or more CDR's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"This DVD player actually keeps what it promises. I haven't had any problems with it yet.

My next one won't be made by Philips."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke almost immediately","review":"The player broke before playing through its first DVD.

It played one movie just fine. I even thought...how great for so cheap. I put in the next movie and after I finished watching the previews and started the movie it started making this awful noise.

Philips is supposed to do a reduced cost exchange and I'm still waiting in July 2005.Apparently, the quality of this player leaves a lot to be desired. And to top it off, try dealing with the customer service personnel in Manila who just don't seem to get anything done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multi Region?","review":"I bought this DVD Player under the assumption that it played any region and also PAL. I opened the manual and it said that it only plays dvds that say region 1 or ALL. Can someone please tell me if it actually plays region 2 - 6, or if I just wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent while it lasts...","review":"This Philips DVP642 is a decent DVD player for the money, while it lasts.I bought my first one in late 2004 and it died on me by mid 2005, and paid for a replacement from Philips then. My second one just died a few days ago.Same problem with each of them, all of the sudden it will just stop reading any DVD you put in there saying \\"No Disc\\" and the same response from Philips \\"It's out of warranty you'll have to pay another 50 dollars for us to send you a replacement.\\"There's a reason that this one is so cheap to pick up, you get what you pay for.While it worked it was a fine DVD player, but breaking after less than a year just seems unacceptable. If I knew then what I know now I'd have kept on shopping and shelled out an extra few bucks for something that wouldn't fall apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing dvd player","review":"I bought this DVD player to be able to watch movies in .avi (divx, xvid, etc.) format. Works well with most of these files, however some are not compatible, so you will have to discover by trial and error. Plays all regular store-bought DVDs. The remote is badly designed. The buttons are not laid out in an easy to recognize layout. Everyone in my family has pressed the scene back button instead of the rewind button numerous times, which gets pretty annoying fast. Finding the pause or play button also takes several moments, even if the room is lighted and you can see the remote. Also, I think it makes a lot more noise then my old DVD player. You shouldn't notice it though, unless you are specifically listening for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD player","review":"I bought this in 2005, and it is still one of the most feature rich player today - a good buy even at the originaly price!I just wish this had H.264 support and better anamorphic conversion, if you try to play anamorphic AVIs, you will get it letterboxed - still not a big show stopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed - poor picture quality.","review":"Maybe it was only the unit I had, but this unit had horrible color reproduction - specifically, black level and contrast. I tried the DVD player's adjustments and my TV and just could not get a good picture. Very disappointed. My prior 480i DVD player had much better picture quality and I actually went back to it. The menus on this player are also cheesy Atari 2600 quality blocky graphics. Otherwise, it had all functions expected of a DVD player and the DiVX stuff was nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"this dvd player sucks!","review":"I tried watching a brand new tv show boxset on this dvd player and it kept pausing.

DivX worked poorly, if at all, and MPEG4 did not work at all.

Mine \\"died\\" with a blinking power light problem and would not eject the disc. You can search for this online and see that it is a common problem. It is outside its warranty period and the manufacturer said I can purchase the same model for a reduced price, but considering its problems I would rather not do that. Overall it never consistently played my home-made dvd's and I would definitely not recommend it. I also own a Sony which I have had for 5 years and never had a problem, I think that brand is more reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"The controls are a bit clumsy, but otherwise it works really well.

Altogether happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with non-US dvd's","review":"Although the player can be made region-free, it has a tendency to reach buffer overruns when playing non-US dvd's (particularly from Asia).

I have no buffer/delay problems when playing US dvd's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 1.5 years","review":"This producted worked great for 1.5 years and suddenly died.

I bought the Philips DVP 642 in February 2006 because of its ability to read DivX format. It stopped functioning properly by August 2006!!! Problem was consistent regardless of which DVD was played (screen would randomly scramble, turn green, freeze, then player would turn off). No improvement with either cleaning or unplugging the player for 10min as the Philips support center suggested. THEN Philips wanted us to pay $40 for a replacement with an additional $10 shipping charge- for a DVD player we paid $70 for 6 months ago! Philips refused to budge on their policy so we gave up. Just got back from Best Buy with a new Toshiba DVD player.p.s. our 2y.o. Philips TV also just died on us and we paid $150 to get that one fixed (only 2 weeks before the DVD player went!) I sure won't buy anything made by Philips again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything went into Divx","review":"I bought a couple of these. I backed-up videos to CD after re-encoding them to Xvid format with ESS Standalone Support using AutoGK (Gordon Knot). The movies turned out fantastic.After that, this DVD player has much to be desired. The software is aweful and there's no support from Phillips. Controls are non-standard, so your learning a new system. I went from a 5 year old Panasonic to a new $40 Toshiba player and the controls were the same. Not this puppy. Also, the unit is cheaply made and prone to break quickly. One of the two I bought started making clicking sounds as it read disks. I took both of them back and went with the $40 Toshiba from Costco/BJs (got one at each for the same price). Although the Toshiba won't play Divx, I'm fine burning mpeg-2 DVDs for having a good, standard, reliable DVD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Failure after 1 year","review":"This is the fourth DVD player (second Philips brand) to fail after one year of use. It always happens within a month or two of the warranty expiration. This time, the unit just won't turn on. Other times, the players began to fail at reading discs, occasionally at first, then for most discs. I am really frustrated with buying a new unit every year. I tried to get Philips to honor the warranty since the player failed just one month out of warranty, but they wouldn't do it. They offered a refurbished replacement for $30 - with only a 90 day warranty - definiely not a good deal. I will boycott Philips products from now on, and I hope you do so, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle DVD-R poorly","review":"After read some good review, I decided to buy this dvd player. It is realy a nice looking player, it has all the feature I was looking for, component, digital audio. However, the good feeling ended as soon as I put in DVD I made of my kids.

Half of the DVD's I try to play freeze up, or I get disc error. It's a real hit or miss proposition everytime you try a new DVD. Even when the thing worked it was an annoying unit. The buttons on the remote are laid out in the most unintuitive manner, and when you try to use fast forward the speeds are 2X 4X 6X 8X, that's it. No 16X or 32X! I should have learned my lesson with the last Philips product I bought. A VHS player that ate my tapes after 3 months of use. At least this DVD player was only $60. I must give Philips credit though, they really seem to know how to engineer a product to fail after the warranty period. They must have done alot of R&D to get that right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Stupid product.

Besides I finally could enjoy some MP3 albums that were recorded on DVD medium that my friends gave me. However right from the start it had problems reading brand new DVDs. The unit was stumbling as if the disc was dirty. Only it wasn't and my old DVD player didn't have any trouble reading it. I'm on my way to take it back to Wal-Mart right now. I'm going to give Pioneer DV 588A-S a try. It is more money (MSRP $129) but you reach that point in life when you don't care if it is a hundred bucks more expensive as long as it is good quality.

Phillips promptly replaced it and told me to just throw the bad one away. An indicator of the disposability of the product. This one went to storage so I don't know how well it is holding up after a year.The other one lasted a year and one month before it decided to not eject or load DVDs any more.Bottom line is it works great, but you have to consider it disposable after a year or buy some kind of extended product replacement warranty if you can find it.My advice - look elsewhere. Maybe a brand that starts with an \\"A\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was fine until it DIED within a year!","review":"It as a perfectly fine DVD player until it wouldn't load discs any longer.

Now past warranty, the unit doesn't power up and the customer service people (my god, they are just as bad as the product) said that I had to pay to ship it back and pay $40 for another, likely refurbished one. I know it only costs $65, but I barely used the thing and it breaks.. I'd expect that from something branded \\"Goldstar\\" but I had always thought Philips was, I don't know, decent quality. So much for that. This one's a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great DVD Player...very bad reliability","review":"This DVD player will play just about anything...that's the good news...the bad news is the reliability is bad.This unit has only lasted 6 months and now the DVP642 component video outputs all my DVD movies in a deep blue tint! Unwatchable.I called Philips service department...this unit only has a 3 month warranty! I can choose to pay $47+shipping and they will swap my unit...the original price is only $53 at the store...I guess Philips business model is to make cheap garbage and not support their products...what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEAD after 8 months..!","review":"Avoid this unit at all cost. it simply died after 8 months of normal use. The standy button started blinking and the tray would not open. This DVD player unit has become useless. Disconnecting the unit from the power supply for a couple of hours does not solve the problem. The unit simply would not respond to the remote or the buttons on the unit.It's DEAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor","review":"After five months, my DVD player succumbed to the dreaded blinking red power light. I just got off the phone with Philips customer service. The woman was very nice, but that doesn't make up for the fact that to get a replacement unit I have to pay $40 plus shipping. Not much less than I paid for it initially.This product seemed like a great deal... and if you end up with one of the units that isn't defective, it *is* a great deal. But I've read too many reviews citing a product life of 6 months or less. Not worth the risk, if you ask me. Any price advantage evaporates very rapidly if you are buying a new unit several times a year. I'm going to pony up more cash for my next unit and read the Amazon reviews VERY carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Disappointment","review":"I bought 2 from Amazon in 2004 at $65 each. One died just before the 1-year warranty expired. Philips sent another free of charge and I didn't even have to send them the old one. When I got the replacement, I put it in storage.Shortly after the 1-year warranty on the second unit expired, it went dead as well.I pulled the replacement out of storage and put it into service only to have it quit after a couple of months.Bought 2 in 2004 and by December 2005 I had no working 642s.Brings shame to the Philips name brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect solution for PAL, DivX ,and Region freedom!","review":"I purchased this unit from North Star Electronics through Amazon. I had a problem with the first unit freezing up to the point where I had to unplug the unit to get it to power off. I called North Star and they gave me the RMA #, no hassle or fuss. The second unit they sent works flawlessly. Nothing additional needed! Plays PAL movies, NTSC movies and DivX files perfectly. I have DVD's from US, UK, and even Australia (Region 4 I believe) and everything plays without problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a short life!","review":"I, like Mr. Perry Cook from Denver, had the same luck as far as the power light blinking = death.Except I have had this happen to 3 of the 4 DVP642's I have bought.The people at Philips only wanted to sell you another one for a reduced price.You get what you pay for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after seven months","review":"Got it in December 2004 -- died at the end of June 2005. It's been in my bedroom armoire, never moved. Started not responding to remote commands and now won't load DVDs or stay 'on.' As with all, only 90 day warranty. This is my second DVD player in one year. I now know why they all have such short warranties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead (blinking red power light) after year in service","review":"This player worked o.k. for a year. It played most (but not all) DivX files I fed it -- say, about 90% of them. Occasionally audio would unsynchronize from video; or video would freeze; some files wouldn't play at all. I think the player's codek / firmware is pretty old; and/or the chip is too slow to decode fast video stream.After a year of this o.k. service the player suddenly decides to stop working. I, like many others, am left staring at a blinking red power light that doesn't go away unless you unplug it. The machine is dead. I searched the Internet for the string \\"philips dvp642 blinking\\" and found way too many hits. Sorry, Philips, I will shop for a different brand for the replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall good, but with some flaws","review":"I've been using the thing for 1 and half years and generally I like it.All strengths of this DVD player are listed by many other reviewers - region free, DivX support, crisp picture, nice look, custom picture settings (bightness, contast etc), so I will not concentrate on them.Here are some wicknesses.1) If you use subtitles in progressive scan mode, there is some snow-like noise surrounding letters. I tried upgrading firmware - no change.2) Remote control is somewhat inconvenient. Even after a year you will constantly confuse fast forward and rewind buttons with skip scene back and forth ones. Not too big deal, but annoyingAll this said, I haven't found a better player that serves all my needs yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD was great for 2 years","review":"I bought this DVD about 2 years ago. It was really easy to hook it up. I was watching movies from different regions - no problem. DVD was working perfectly until yesterday when it suddenly died. Sound was coming out, but no picture. I was disappointed. Tried to call support - and of couse because I was using it for more than year, my warranty expired and they wanted to charge me $15 just to talk to me. This time I'll try something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little player!","review":"I was very impressed with this DIVX DVD player. For the price, it just can't be beat! Works great! I would have given it a 5 star rating except for the following:you can only fast forward at a max speed of 8x and it does not have component in/out.On the other hand, it is very easy to make this player region free.

While playing original copy of DVD movies(Store's bought - without scratches or fingerprints), sometimes the picture will freeze and the only way to fix it is to eject the disc.

Then it started to take longer and longer to load a DVD, and eventually it would only report 'no disc'. I was confused as it continued to play CDs flawlessly.

Who knew?I returned it and exchanged it for a JVC, which has now passed the two week mark!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Progressive scan on this one not good enough for projectors","review":"The progressive scanning solution employed by this player is truly subpar. This DVD player is simply not suited for projectors or other large screen situations. In the past couple years I've used three different DVD players in progressive mode, projected on a large screen, and this was the first time I ever was stunned by the massive DROP in quality. I'd assumed that all DVD pictures looked about the same, but this player sadly proves that isn't true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 9 months Dont Buy","review":"This player was great until the dreaded flashing red power light appeared.

Watched about three DVDs a week until last night (September 14th, 2005), when the player died mid-movie. And I mean \\"died\\" as in \\"dead.\\"The Philips web troubleshooting site is useless, so we called customer service. The item is still covered by a product warranty, but Philips charges a $46 (USD) replacement fee for warranty returns, plus you have to pay to ship the item back. You do the math. To top things off, it took me twenty minutes to disassemble the unit and recover my DVD.Go click somewhere else -- this one's garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome DVD Player","review":"I've had this player since Dec '04 and it's been great. The player plays all my CDs with AVI, JPG, and MP3 content. Even slightly scratched DVDs work great. I had rented a DVD from Blockbuster that came scratched. I watched half of it on my PS2 and the rest was unreadable. I used other DVD players from computers and the data was still unreadable. I had almost given up but then I popped the DVD into this Philips player and I was able to read most of the data. Although the DVD skipped a bit, I was able to make out the rest of the story. Even my parents' foreign DVDs played fine when other generic players failed. My whole family is pleased with this purchase.My only discontent was over the controller's design. The buttons are all oval/circular and make it difficult to locate by touch alone. The player is slim but long unlike other players. I guess these are rather negligible factors compared to how much I enjoy having this player. I'd recommend this player to anyone so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing unit best investment ever","review":"I was looking for some type of player that could play direct divx, and this unit does that and a lot more, the only trouble that I noticed was that in some vcd's the audio kept crawling out of sinc, I downloaded a firmware update for it, and it not only correct it, it also modified my region codes so now it's multiregion and plays even more formats. So far I been using it daily for six months and I'm still amazed from all the potential that it has, just yesterday I learned that it can play a avi movie file with subtitles for it in a diffrent file side by side, I'm very happy with it and my father and brother got one for themselves and are equaly amazed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD Player EVER!","review":"Best DVD Player, at a great price.

In November I was playing a DVD and the unit stopped playing mid-movie. I eventually got the unit to respond to the 'eject' button - and the tray opened out without the DVD. I took the unit apart to retrieve the DVD, and of course haven't played it since. It's due to go to the recycling center.While it WAS working, all the functions seemed fine. However a big big negative is that there is no eject button on the remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible product--Philips should be ashamed","review":"Believe all the one and 2 star reviews you see. A product that does not work well is bad enough. But a product that damages another piece of property is the worst. This player eats dvds.

I called Phillips and their troubleshooting advice was to unplug it and then push the start button... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! And since the warranty is only 90 days they could not replace the unit. They could exchange the unit for $40 + tax. Plus I have to pay for the shipping to ship the original unit back.

No need to make an .avi-to-VCD or SVCD disc conversion....will play goth NTSC and PAL regions (there is a code), will play mp3s burned to CD, .jpg files viweable,audio CD, DVDs, etc.Very very happy with this unit and the price is incredible, great value.

A couple of days later, I sat there pressing the power button for a few minutes... sometimes it would come on, then turn itself back off after a few moments. I did eventually get it to turn on and stay on. A few more days went by, and then it wouldn't turn on at all.We had this unit hooked up to a very good APC battery backup and surge system, so I'm sure that the power source wasn't the problem.

They're ALL true. At $69 (CompUSA), I simply could NOT afford to pass up the chance to watch my Divx and Xvid movies on my 27\\" Wega. People aren't exaggerating when they say this thing plays everything you throw at it. My FujiFilm DVD+RWs all play flawlessly. On top of all that, the unit recognizes and displays SUBTITLE FILES! Currently supported extensions are .sub, .srt, and .smi. I believe this is a new feature, since it was added as an addendum sheet to the manual.If you're sick of watching medium sized movies on your monitor or laptop screen, pick up the Philips DVP642.

In those four months we have used it many times. From all the DVD's we have watched, only one had a problem playing in this DVD player, and I dont think it was the palyer's fault. The DVD was not in very good condition. It is a major improvement to the one in our TV, and all the others we had. It is sleek and looks really nice. Sometimes we can hear a whirr, but that is no biggy. It is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Philips DVP642 DivX-Certified Progressive-Scan DVD Player","review":"Only had it for a couple of months but no problems so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"After our old DVD player broke after three years of use, I was looking for a cheap replacement that would last until the new HD-DVD and Blue Ray DVD players start coming out and are affordable. And so far this DVD player works fine. DVD players don't vary much in what they are able to do and I don't yet know if this player will last so I can't give it five stars. If it keeps performing as well as it does though, I'll probably bump it up to five especially considering the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy reliability","review":"It worked as advertised for about 4 months.

It was highly rated by Consumer Reports and we love it. It's slim and lightweight, so easy to fit into your components.

And the pictures in the booklet alone are worth the price of this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanklessly resurrected,again","review":"This, TC's second Relix album, is slightly less devoted to the Dead but, rather, gives you a tour of his aural universe. It does include Alaric's Premonition (\\"A gothic fugue based on a theme by Jerome Garcia), which was originally commissioned by Kronos and played by a guitar quartet, and a splended Embryonic Journey with Jorma--the full set of takes is also available on Relix. This CD has less of the experimental side of TC than Nightfall of Diamonds, and more of the melodic, classical and downright arcane. A wonder for the ears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Violent, stupid and not sexy at all!","review":"Do not buy this movie at any price!!All that happens throughout the movie is the heroine gets accidentally hit, knocked down and otherwise injured.Unless you are a sadist, this movie will be, at best boring; at worst disturbing.It's not even funny at any time.Almost forgot, this movie is not the least bit sexy or even erotic, just dumb and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I am a great fan of Tangerine Dream's music from the 70's.This double CD is different, and like in previous cases in which vocal music is included, the results are less than expected.There are some nice TD electronic pieces, but in all it is disapointing.From the more recent albums, Mota Atma is much more in the classic TD spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for all TD fans","review":"Of two things you can be certain: 1.

The World Championship between Bret Hart & Diesel(Kevin Nash) was a solid,entertaining back-and-forth bout. The semi-final matches were nice back-and-forth bouts. The Tag Team Championship match between The Haedshrinkers & The Team of Crush and Yokozuna was a pretty much a power brawl but still a match to enjoy. The K.O.T.R finals was just as good as the rest of the matches in the tournament. The Jerry Lawler-Roddy Piper match was a sloppy,poor brawl. I give this event a 7 out of 10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego-driven nonsense","review":"This event is from mid-1994, when the WWF(now WWE) were rapidly going downhill. The 2 biggest egos of them all, Bret Hart and Diesel, clash for the World Title in a match that NOBODY ELSE wanted to see, Bret's brother Owen easily wins the Tournament to be crowned \\"King\\" of the Federation, The Headshrinkers face Yokozuna and Crush in a decent brawl for the Tag Titles, and Roddy Piper faces Jerry Lawler in a cartoonish veteran's brawl, that ended up being the Main Event.

The ring light on the phone and not even be seen unless you are looking straight down at it or in the dark.

The first one worked for a number of years, so I bought her this phone a second time. I was not pleased with the new phone. The cord did not fit securely into the hand set, so the connection wasn't consistent. When the connection wasn't made, the phone didn't work at all. Luckily, we still had the old phone, so I hooked up the handset from the old phone to the new phone. It works, but I shouldn't have had to do that. I would have sent it back if I'd had more time, but I don't. Too big a hassle getting it repackaged and taken to the post office. So, the phone is working and mom is happy to have her big button phone again, but I won't order it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"No dial tone","review":"The price was good, features listed were perfect, and I trusted the \\"Bell\\" name.

She is unable to get a dial tone. By the time she told me, it was too late to return it. This company only allows 30 days to return defective items, requires all packing materials to be included and does not cover return shipping even if the item is defective.

Upon arrival, it did not work at all, until we found that the handset cable was not plugged in completely. That small stuff was no big deal.

The clippers overall feel sturdier and more well balanced in your hand compared to entry level $30 clippers. They come with thick extension cords.The hair clipper cuts through thick hair quickly, evenly, smoothly. The blades are sharp and came well oiled. The T-trimmer makes quick and easy work of any edging you have to do.

Lots of commentaries, including several with specific focus on the music in the short. Very glad to see that they included some of the less politically correct shorts, though they have to use lots of disclaimers, both in the intros and in the commentaries, and they have 'buried' these in the specials on the discs (\\"From the Vaults\\").

Rather, the events of the 1500s were the culmination of a centuries-old search for truth. Ozment's account of the Reformation as something unfolding out of the Middle Ages is much more instructive than the standard view, which treats the Reformation as a starting point for this or that development. This book grounds Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and Ignatius firmly in the tradition of medieval scholastic, mystic, and ecclesio-political thought, as well as Renaissance humanism. Additional chapters are devoted to clerical marriage and resistance to tyranny, two legacies of Protestantism that Ozment finds particularly compelling. To top it off, the author has obviously done his homework; every significant interpretation by previous scholars receives due note here. I think this should the FIRST book anyone reads on the Reformation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Not The Joy","review":"I don't want to be one to pan another's life work.

While the first album could be called the more \\"commercial\\" effort, this album shows Hendrix experimenting with sound effects a lot more with tracks like \\"Little Wing\\" and \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\" rising high above the other tracks which are not exactly fillers either. This version of the album is also the best one that's out there at the moment. Not only is the mini-lp sleeve cardboard replica which opens up in a gatefold sleeve a work of art of itself, we also get a 24 page colour booklet with all the lyrics and very good liner notes on the band plus another booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese as well.

Their songs about different foods like Cookie Day, Hot Chocolate, Sushi Bar, Fish Eyes, and Banana Chips are all songs that can easily be stuck in your head for days. The music itself is simple, but Shonen Knife can give it that unique, come back to sound. Shonen Knife also does a cover of \\"Daydream Believer\\" that is perfectly done. Compared to other Knife CD's like 712, this sounds more professionally done, better sound quality... even the writing of the songs seems to be fulfilled much better, the growth of an artist perhaps.If there is anyone who can resist \\"banana chips for you, banana chips for me, in the afternoon banana chips and tea...\\" step up to the plate and tell me. Its a catchy J-Pop album worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shonen Knife returns better than ever!","review":"The Knife's latest outing is a return to the feel- good pop that made me fall in love with their quirky music in the first place. How can you resist a band that sings about bison, public baths, chocolate and cornflakes?From the opening cut (strongly recalling the opening cut from \\"Secret no. 712\\") to the wonderful food of \\"Sushi Bar\\" (and yet another song about chocolate!) this is a lighthearted romp only the most jaded should avoid!

Upbeat, fast and happy, this is the kind of music to wake you up in the morning. \\"Konnichiwa\\" and \\"Shonen Knife Planet,\\" the songs Shonen Knife usually opens their sets with, are both on this CD as well.This version of \\"Happy Hour\\" is the Japanese release, with 5 extra tracks, which are 5 English versions of other songs on this CD. It is nice having both language versions of the songs, and worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shonen Knife - 'Happy Hour' (Big Deal)","review":"A decent Japanese all-female punk / indie pop trio that apparently has a lot more CD titles out that I was aware of. Tracks here that were {definitely} fun to check out were \\"Shonen Knife Planet\\", the ass-shaking \\"Konnichiwa\\", the should-have-been a hit (at least on college radio) \\"Sushi Bar Song\\", the loopy \\"Fish Eyes\\", \\"People Trap\\" and their cover of the Monkee's hit \\"Daydream Believer\\". Personnel: Naoko Yamano - guitar & vocals, Michic Nakatani - bass & vocals and Atsuko Yamano - drums & vocals.

Perhaps the sad lack of cultural connection to different music forced \\"open minded\\" music listeners to dig this, but the overtly exploitive and gimmicky nature of these tunes, not to mention their dumbrock songwriting style, would have any hardened musical cynic laugh at the mere premise.

You could believe this story is about many things , depending on what you want to believe is the truth: talent, luck, ambition, revenge, perhaps a composite of some and not the others. Regardless of what one might believe, considering where this story begins and where it ends, this book should be re-titled Ezell Junior's Odyssey, it's that epical.

The pipe fittings are not designed to allow the pieces to be connected, the suction cups that hold the pieces to the tub fall off continually, and the valve does not actually open far enough to allow sufficient water to flow through.

It sticks very well onto our fiberglass tub/shower.

Sometimes it's hard to drag them out of the tub. You can set this up a different way every time you play. The boys love setting it up and then rearranging the pieces over and over. Some tub toys get boring, but this always brings something new to tub time! (If you put a colored tub tablet in the container that holds the water - it adds even more fun when you pour clear water in and colored water comes out!) One thing you need to consider is that the tub wall surface must be flat (part of our tub wall is slightly curved and it wont work there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suction cups won't suck","review":"I thought it would be really neat for my two-and-a-half year old to build an aqueduct system but this doesn't help.Nearly half the suction cups don't work. They are of such poor quality, they don't stick to tiles. Some do stick but not well so the pipes sort of hang off the wall at an angle. This causes the water flow to miss the subsequent pipe. This is a bigger problem with the \\"tank\\" that holds a fair amount of water.The suction cups are a fixed distance apart, which just happens to be the same width as standard sized bath tiles you're likely to find at your home. That's a problem because you end up with suction cups at the grout line.Ironically, if you do get the suction cups to stick, they're very difficult to move or remove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are You Prepared for an Emergency?","review":"Are you prepared for an emergency?

It was great to have Dawson back, but he no longer dominated the studio efforts. As a result, the album is decent, but unremarkable, and serves mainly as a curiosity.

So, I read her children's book, and I was enchanted. The story is great, the pictures are charming, but what I liked best was the book's \\"Child is father of man\\" philosophy.

This was written in 1920. The date of publication reported here is really quite a sham. It is a very poor reproduction of a dictionary of the Code that is no longer used. That makes this book totally useless. Even the actual, physical reproduction is crude and hard on the eye. You can judge a book by its cover.

I'm all for stunt men doing impossible things, and I don't mind good computer generated action either, however the CGI in Torque is just ridiculously bad, it is however nowhere near as bad as the acting. Instead of Vin Diesel and the dashing Paul Walker, the producers of this film settled for Ice Cube and some guy no one has ever heard of and trust me, the inexperience shows.

I was a little hesitant about this product because it seemed too good to be true. The only computer product easier to use than the XE102 is a mouse. You need two of these things. Plug one in by your router, and connect a cat-5 cable between your router and the XE102. Go to your computer room, plug the other XE102 into the wall socket, and run another cat-5 cable to your computer. Windows recognizes the connection after about 5 seconds. That's all there is to it; didn't have to do anything with the router, internet settings, no software to install, nothing to do with the XE102 except plug them in.

In order to give this the old college try I also contacted a local networking professional who came to the house to try and get this adapter linked up with the rest of my system.$100 later he came to the same conclusion as tech support, but he also reprogrammed my wireless router so that my signal is able to be picked up throughout the house.

I assumed the kit would contain what's needed to make it useful, but no... there's only a single plug in the package!You'll be better off buying a competing product (e.g. a SlingLink Turbo) which contains both ends of the unit.

The encryption utility takes a little time to get just right, and, on occasion, it drops the connection. In these cases, you simply unplug it and plug it back in, and you're up and running again.The connection is a little slow, but if you're not online gaming and sharing tons of files, it's more than adequate for most application.Although wireless may be cheaper, it just seemed too much of a headache for my needs, and these have been the perfect fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work very well","review":"I'm able to establish connection using this device, but the speed is patchy, and worse, everytime i shutdown or suspend my laptop, I have to go to the originator plug and cycle the power, then go back to the other end of the house and do the same on the destination plug. i don't consider running back and forth across the house every time i'd like to use the internet acceptable performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wireless","review":"This works ok, but not as well as hoped for.

The snow falling. The rose. The queen pricking her finger. That's the high point. How much stupid computer-generated animation, how much melting objects with deep voices, how many stupid battle scenes are the American public going to keep swallowing before they've had enough and stop going to see drivel like this?Give me the cartoon any day.PS Charlize has exceeded her limit of angry women roles.

The actors did the best they could with what direction they were given. The dwarfs were awesome, and the close ups of Kristen Stewart's Snow White were beautiful, but she was given very little dialogue. Charlize Theron's Queen was good as well, but she over acted in a couple of scenes. Chris Hemsworth's Huntsman was just the right amount of gruff, but I was looking for more from his character, to show Snow White more moves on how to defend herself.

I should have stuck with the trailer. The costumes and cinetography are as beautiful as the trailer would have you believe but the acting and script are subpar. I would watch it again but only with the mute button on and if we can skip Stewart's classic and always there \\"oh no. What should I do?\\" face. Even when she rides to battle and is supposed to be a strong heroine, she has her \\"I'm conflicted\\" face on. I think I may hate her as the heroine even more than the script. By the end of the movie, I was bored and secretly wanted the Snow White to die again just to spice up the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"A thrilling and action-packed version of Snow White.

It's surprising for a film whose moral message is supposed to be about inner beauty, I found it to be rather....shallow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"Waste of time and money. It sucked from the first minute to 15 minutes later. I could not watch more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just skip it.","review":"First of all, when I saw the trailer in which the always terrible Kristen Stewart is more fair than Charlize Theron, I decided not to even watch the movie. I later caved in and unfortunately watched it. If someone had cut out panoramic pictures and screen sets from the movie, it would have been significantly shorter. Also, there were no emotional connections to any characters other than the evil queen and at times the huntsman.Overall, a very boring and anticlimactic version of this classic tale. Literally NOTHING exciting happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huntsman was ir really worth it?","review":"I never saw the movie in the theaters, but thought that a different version of Snow White would be a refreshing family movie. It was okay, but the acting was not up to par. When compared to Mirror Mirror which came out before this, I would was better than Snow White and the Huntsman. There is only one saving grace for this movie that it was not too violent to it makes for an okay family movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern take on an old classic","review":"My family and I enjoyed this film. We are not huge fans of nor dislike any actors in the film so I cannot comment on anyone's performance. What I will say is that this film effectively and interestingly told a story by taking you through the adventure of Snow White's escape and defeat of the evil queen. I have read other's reviews and I get a real sense that people were wanting more substance in this film but I believe the substance was already there. It was present in the very fact that this is a well-known story. Most of us are quite familiar with the tale and didn't need to have every nuance explained, re-invented and/or re-interpreted. This story showed more of the evil queen's side and even hinted to the audience a back-story as to why she is so evil and powerful. That direction usually gets left out in things I've seen previously. It would be great to see a prequel at some point just about the queen and the events that led her to live such a scorned life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent. Rent it, do not buy it.","review":"Simply put, the movie is decent, Kristen Stewart is just as annoying and emotionless as ever, and the films dialog sound level is so poor you have to crank the volume to hear it just to turn it down not to be over powered by action scenes. Rent it, do not buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"It wouldn't make my list of top 10 favorite movies but with the digital copy it was worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rented this movie","review":"I liked the movie, what was a bonus, is the song that played at the end of the film. Florence & the Machine - Breathe of Life. I ended up purchasing that song and a couple of others from the group. Would recommend watching the movie just to see the end and be able to watch that with this song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy Rung True","review":"Despite all the negative reviews I read about this movie, I found it to be quite stunning. It truely brought out the darkness of the true Snow White tale as well as its blooming light and beauty. I must admit, it was a little long, but it kept my attention until the very end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be good","review":"Could be a good movie without Kristen. She must have slept her way to get the role. It was just a wrong cast. No way in the right mindset would anyone cast her for the role. She cannot act, she does not look innocent, and she is not pure, not pretty like what the storyline describe her. I will never watch a move with her in it again! Charlize is really good in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too thrilling","review":"I personally was not thrilled by this film. The acting on the part of Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth was quite good, but Stewart cannot act. Frankly, she is abysmal, and cannot even deliver her lines in a way to make you feel anything towards her character other than dislike. Stewart made this film difficult to watch at times, and to be quite honest, it is hard to believe she could ever be fairer than Theron. Theron was amazing, and I think if they had shortened the film and found a different actress to play Snow White, it would have done much better, but overall I found so many parts of it rather dull or a let down. I was actually just waiting for the film to be over while watching it in the theater. There was great potential here, but it did not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I was expecting it be more along the story but as usual the movie industry glamorized it with their own twist on the original. No worth buying. Charlize was awesome I it she made the movie as others have said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Yuck. Kristen Stewart prettier than Charlize??? Please!

The movie has some great special effects and it brings you right into it, which I loved. Kristen Stewart is not strong in this movie which I was hoping she would be; she still needs to grow as an actor and stop playing herself in all these movies. I don't see the character I see her as herself, but beside that it was fun watching this movie. I don't like to give to much away, but I have to say Ian McShane, Toby Jones along with a few other greats lost a few inches for this movie.

Concept is fine to twist the Snow White story a tad. Over dramatic thought. The whole movie felt like I was watching a college project to duplicate the Lord Of Rings movie feel as a class project or something. As a class project certainly it deserves an \\"A\\".

These types of movies tend to give the system a good work out so I paid Express Shipping and was delighted to see it sitting against my front door a few days later. I fired up the audio visual equipment, still on a high, so didn't mind all the ads.Finally came to sit down and start the music. Sound was good, picture quality just acceptable, story, gone. I swear there was a story in the blu ray container when I opened it, but turn around once and wooooooooooooops!! Story line never to be seen again.This whole movie could been so much better, and like other reviewers, I could not wait to get may hands on it. How disappointing.I haven't rented a DVD in years (perhaps I should have), but if you think you might like this film, rent the garbage first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice visuals...","review":"and that's where the positives end. I can only assume Charlize Theron owed someone a favor, or perhaps has crippling gambling debts. Kristen Stewart is basically paid in this movie to stand and look at whomever is talking. She's effectively a soundboard off which the other actors bounce their lines. The only other positive is that this movie eventually ends.The special effects are nice, and some of the bit characters are fun (if predictable), but overall I'd give this a 1.5 if I could manage to figure out fractional star-ing. This movie is a great example of why a 10-point scale is needed. Five-point scales don't provide enough granularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice visuals but everything else falls short","review":"The visual style of the film was very well done and set up a nice scene to look at and imagine, but everything else fell short. Apart from Charlize Theron's performance being exceptional all of the actors were forced to work with a sub-par plot and weak direction. There is little character direction and what seems like it could be an interesting angle between the huntsman, the prince, and snow white is quickly hurried past to move the action along.In short, it looks good but you'll end up wishing you'd watched something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired","review":"I missed this in the theatre, still enthralled by the spectacle of Avengers and am glad that I did. Kristen Stewart is just so wooden. She acts like she doesn't care about anything, which might've worked for Bella. Chris Hemsworth was all right, playing the strong brute. But the story was justkinda blah for me. If you want a modern retelling of fairy tales, watch Once upon a time. Much more inventive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"I was not prepared for the magic of this movie! It isn't your typical fairy tale, and I thought that it was incredible! I have not been a Kristen Stewart fan, because up to now, I have not seen her in anything that she could really act in. This movie proved/showed her acting chops and her performance was almost as good as Charlize Theron's. I recommend this movie highly if you like intense, action/adventure, twists on fairy tales. This one should not disappoint you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you need sleep watch it will put you out!!!!","review":"I thought it dragged. They shouldve had a better actress playing Snow White.

Also you can view through Itunes or Flixster which is nice. Gives you choices of what device to watch it on and depending on internet access can make it easy to view on trips."},{"rating":"1","title":"CGI Dwarves...really?","review":"I must say that besides the fact that most of this cast was simply miscast (Charlize overacting could have been anyone), and as the storyline became more and more absurd, it was the fact that the dwarves were CGI heads that finally got me...really? You honestly couldn't find any real little people to act as the dwarves?Other than that the rest of the reviewers sum it up nicely although I think this was not a good role for Charlize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave it away the first day...What's with the volume?!","review":"I couldn't enjoy this movie, if it was a great script (not), good acting (not really) or even oscar worthy (not in a million years). I spent the whole time with the remote control in my hand, adjusting the volume up and down. When people were speaking, the sound was a whisper. Then, abruptly...the background music would blare forth and sound effects would completely overwhelm me.At one point, my husband came running into the room, thinking that something horrible had happened in our living room. Why? Because the volume of the special effects had suddenly awaken him in the other end of our home. He was afraid that I had been hurt (only my ears).A friend was given this DVD, because she said that her son wanted to see it. The 'gift' came with a warning that this movie might get complaints from your neighbors; so, keep the remote handy.What a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um....Really?","review":"This movie was horrible. It was just a bunch of random scenes put together without a clear cut or interesting storyline. Luckily, Snow White is a common story so I still understood what was happening. In addition to the non-existant story line, Kristen Stewart made it even worse. She really only had one big monologue and it was meant to be a very serious moment. However, she butchered it and it ended up being hilariously funny because it was so bad. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow Blow White","review":"What idiot said K. Stewart could act? I guess it is obvious to all now how she gets the parts. I think I saw her blink once and smile once all through the movie. Her only parts involved running and riding a horse. And even then she had no emotion. I almost turned the movie off until Theron came in as queen and saved the day. C. Theron was the only performance worth watching. I have admired her acting ability for many years and she did not disappoint. The action and graphics around the castle were interesting. The Dark Forest was boring and perdictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Except for Charlize Theron's acting, the rest of this movie is terrible.","review":"Expressionless and always whispering her lines, K Stewart is miscast in this role as she plays most of the role as somebody who doesn't want to talk and who is hard to root for because she is expressionless and doesn't respond to any conflict. The effects are over the top and, while visually cool to look at, did nothing to add to the movie. Something about the entire film was cold, distant and shallow. Charlize Theron's evil queen was the only thing that created some fire in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only snow white wasn't in it.","review":"If only snow white wasn't in it; it could be a great movie. The dialogue between the huntsman & the character definition of the queen are fascinating, bringing a new take on an old classic. However, I still am fast forwarding any of the dialogue of snow white. If only she could have a facial expression that didn't look constipated, that would save it. I'm glad I didn't spend the $ to see in a theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully bad...","review":"(This review is for the EXTENDED version, not the Blu-ray) I admit, I read quite a few of the 1 star reviews before I purchased this, but I thought I'd give it a chance. Well, even though I purchased a used copy, i still spent too much.I don't want to be redundant about what's wrong with this mess of a film, but I will say that the attempt to retell an old story was ridiculously pretentious and so far off the mark that I couldn't finish watching. No, not even Charlize Theron could save this, and Kristen Stewart should get off the casting couch and learn a new trade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buffering Issues","review":"The movie was bland and predictable, below average at best, but that's not why I gave it only one star. This movie must have been interrupted about 15 or 20 times to buffer, usually lasting from 5 to 30 seconds. I cannot believe that I paid good money to be constantly interrupted and annoyed. My wife and I were so exhausted of watching it that by the end we were laughing about the whole thing. I was actually considering purchasing Amazon Prime since I use Amazon for other purchases, but, after this, I wonder who actually pays for this garbage. It might work for someone out there, but I've heard a lot of problems with Amazon's Instant Video streaming service due to buffering issues. I'll just stick to Netflix. I have had zero problems streaming HD from them. My internet speed is 15 mbps and every other service I use works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull White","review":"Yes the characters look great and the special effects are exciting and fun, but the story line is lacking and falls flat in my opinion. This movie could be so much better if they built up the relationships between the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was snow boring","review":"I admit up front I am not a Kristen Stewart fan. But I like Charlize Theron so I wanted to give this movie a fare shot. It's visually beautiful but that's about the only nice thing I can say about the movie. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"and I paid for this?","review":"The acting was barely adequate, the story line dropped some key points along the way, elements were introduced that were unnecessary, confusing or pointless, and between the fight scenes, which weren't too awful, it was as if you are waiting for a bus that is late.

I realize it is a children's story supposedly but I would take the Disney cartoon when it comes to maturity and intelligence over this film although that's not saying this as I find animated films superior to many live action films. If you want to see a great re-telling of that story check out Mirror Mirror with Julia Roberts as the evil Queen. Now that's a great re telling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For me this was easily predictable and boring","review":"Charleze Theron is a phenomenal actress and most everyone displayed good acting. Kristin Stewart is a one note character, from what it appears thus far.And her acting skills in this particular movie, are pitiful. Initially I thought her acting in this movie was passable, until she stood in front of a crowd of soldiers, giving a speech to get them to follow her into battle. This is where her acting just fell apart. Could not have been worse. I cringed for her, due to the display of such seriously poor acting skills during this particular point in the movie.The storyline itself leaves much to be desired.

The animation was fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Wins Again","review":"The good vs evil story is told again and again, and this is just more of the same. However, in a culture where evil is misrepresented all to often as merely an alternative this film is refreshing. Evil is completely and obviously evil. On the other hand good is depicted in terms of charity, tolerance and love. Yet, it is also strong and the film depicts the good heroin as a capable leader. Freedom, and expression are championed, while evil is controlling, subduing, and brutal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Snow White","review":"This was a very well acted production .

But I rented it and was surprised at how much I liked it. I don't think it deserves the one star that a lot of people are giving it.

Kristen Stewart can't emote, much less act (is 20-something too young to overdose on botox?) Charlize Theron chewed so much scenery it's a wonder she has any teeth left, and Hemsworth sounded like he was trying to spit out his lines while holding a mouthful of nails. The dwarves were the only redeeming part and they were vastly underused.And no, I'm not a Twilight fan so I'm not writing a negative review because I feel betrayed by Stewarts's stupidity, though it certainly explains why the director decided to use her.

What is wrong with her? Does she always act in this manner, or was she preoccupied with her affair? The few words she spoke, she stated them worse than when someone reads aloud from a book. Her \\"fighting\\" speech - she just yelled the words out. Huh?! Has she no experience in human suffering, that she can not remotely fathom what it would be like to be locked in an underground prison cell for so many years, to lose both parents, to see the depths of sorrow in her kingdom?... so that she can not bring these emotions to her acting?And what was happening with the last scene (coronation scene)? Why was she just standing there & almost pretending to have a 'climax' ???The Queen & the Huntsman were great. The scenery was beautiful, the effects (ok, except for that one scene) worked well. But .... the main character is a joke......!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What were you expecting, a documentary?","review":"I was thoroughly entertained for two hours. I thought the acting was top-notch, even in Kristen Stewart's case. Yes, Charlize Theron's performance was Oscar-worthy, but none of the acting by any of the actors was anything but perfect. All I can say to the movie's critics is, what were you expecting, a documentary of the Snow White tale? And to those who thought the movie was predictable: what, you thought the evil queen would win and rule the universe? This was a perfectly entertaining retelling of the Snow White tale, and I have become a fan Kristen Stewart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie, looks great in hd, enjoyed enough to rent tho, not sure if it's my kind of movie I would purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining movie","review":"I watch movies to be entertained.

When not drifting through the movie like a soulless zombie, her attempts at sincerity and passion are almost painful to watch.This may have been a good movie -- especially with powerful actors like Charlize Theron and Chris \\"Thor\\" Hemsworth, and employing top notch special effects -- but Kristen Stewart is just plain terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark","review":"A successful fantasy requires more than special effects, action, dwarves, white horses, evil villains and pretty women. I felt like the director really wanted this to be comparable to Lord of the Rings. It's so very much not. Without a good screenplay, the remaining elements are merely window dressing. This story was sloppy, flat, predictable, and tedious.

Here's why:- It was simply very entertaining. It had several subtle changes to the Snow White story so that the movie kept us wondering what would happen next. The characters were much more complex than the fairy story, so much more interesting to watch. There was some action mixed with fantasy that made it exciting.- Actress Charlize Theron was absolutely amazing and her character was well scripted. She brought this movie up to a whole other level. She gave amazing depth to the character of the evil witch, and made her much more than a fairy tale figure.- It had a positive message ultimately.This is definitely worth seeing for adults, and I'd probably watch it again. However this is NOT for kids. The story is rather dark, and although not bloody, there's some intense violence and some nudity."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie review","review":"Good addition to a blue ray collection.

A fun evening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Horrid!","review":"They needed to put in more special effects (which were well done, though few and far between), and less, poorly written,and sadly acted convoluted story-line. Kristen Stewart had the same stoned look on her face through the entire movie. Also, on what planet is Kristen Stewart more beautiful than Charlize Theron in any context? As if! Charlize Theron gave the best performance, but not nearly at the level of her other work, and her accent was most annoying.

Kristen Stewart's acting, as always, IMO, lacked, but she was a little better here than in the Twilight Sagas. Charlize did well but a little over the top. The fantasy and action was much better on the big screen and the story, on repeat view at home, became somewhat tiresome.

So I went for it... Yea, it wasn't worth it. You get all the best bits in the trailer-- seriously. The trailer is a better film than the actual movie. Kristen Stewart is predictably awful. You get the feeling Chris Hemsworth and Charlize Theron are kind of trying but their characters are just as flat as the green screen this shit was shot against. So mostly I just felt bad for them.Sucks, because more than once I got the feeling that, at any moment, the writers/directors could have turned it around. There was real potential here.

Save your time and money, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunting for a Story","review":"I recently watched this movie and the first 20 minutes of this movie was quite compelling. Once the character roles were established the movie went quickly down from the there. The movie had great potential and the story was well constructed in theory.Charlize Theron's performance was stillted and unconvincing. I wonder if she actually contributed more than just her name. She is a way better actor than this; she could have really delivered more.Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth were a little better, but certainly it seems as if the director was not encouraging their best efforts. Kristen Stewart had several believable moments but this movie needed more.So 2 stars and what movie was I reviewing again? It's that forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"snow white an the huntsman","review":"I never got it I paid for the movie but never came in the mail so please redeem my money or send me the movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot","review":"The movie has beautiful cinematography, but no story line. Kristen Steward is lacking the acting skills she needs to carry the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was the romance?","review":"While I knew that this would not be an epic film, I was hoping to see a little romance between Snow White and the huntsman. Why cast two charismatic actors in those roles if we can't even get one passionate kiss out of them or some verbal exchange of their feelings for each other.This one is not even worth the rental price unless you are a big Charlize Theron fan and even then."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes but...Kristen Stewart.","review":"The movie was visually stunning and depending on the price, I would definitely like to own this on blu-ray. Hemsworth and Theron were amazing in their roles as well as Ian McShane and Bob Hoskins but...they could have cast anyone but Kristen Stewart. I wanted to like her in this--I really did. I put Twilight behind me and was hoping she'd redeem herself. Except it was like watching Bella all over again. The same three facial expressions and mannerisms that plagued Twilight also plague this movie. She did not appeal to me as the rising underdog to overcome the hardships she'd faced. And in no way was she fairer than Charlize Theron. They would have done much better to cast an unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rotten tomatoes","review":"This movie is totally lame. It's use of fantasy was generic and inappropriate. Some of the special effects were great, but did not always make sense, as if it were a visual for visual sake.

Bit Boring...","review":"I wanted to watch this movie despite what negative reviewers said. I was even going to look past the cons and try to appreciate the pros. It started out interesting and then towards the end I couldn't stay interested. I wouldn't say it is a terrible terrible movie, it just didn't do the Snow white tale any justice. Not really worth a rental in my opinion. It's like hollywood just wanted to make a movie with the snow white title for recognition and then cast a few well known actors to make it worth your time. Then failed to deliver a great movie. Acting was a bit forced and weak. Well thats my opinion, don't get hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's good...Not great","review":"Good plot...good story...just didn't like kristen stewarts sighs!....u pulled it in twilight...ok...other movies NO!

My 13yr and 11yr old and I sat to look at this, and they were more disappointed than I was. The typical \\"good vs evil\\" can be show without it being so dark. We came away wondering what the message really was in all that. The special effects and good acting, which we would normally appreciate, paled into the background. Very disappointing. Too many shows now have too much \\"dark side\\" to them. What ever happened to movies that left you feeling edified and entertained?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not over the top","review":"I liked the movie, but I am not a big fan of Kristen Stewart.

We finally started listening for the times when Stewart would let the British accent would slip and just wait until we could see the menacing Queen in all her glory again. Everyone else was \\"fine\\", Charlize was glorious, Stewart oh so overacting. Sorry, even with Charlize, I can't recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White and the Huntsman","review":"Very seldom do you see a movie that had the right actor for the part that they played.Charlize Theron took control of the movie and never let go until her death."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Children's Snow White Version...","review":"My wife probably liked the movie more than I did but I am not really an avid movie watcher. It was nice to have the movie available as a streaming through the Amazon service because, while more expensive than retail rentals, it's on demand and convenient. I found the movie to be quite a switch from the old cartoon versions but I'm sure that it was supposed to be. It was kinda dark and eerie. The acting was VERY good. I don't know that I would nominate \\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\" for any kind of awards as best movie of the year but I sat through it and I give it a good solid 4-star review for the acting, plot and special effects. With that said, however, it's definitely not a kid's movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK ~ SPOILER ALERT","review":"A different spin on the whole princess happily ever after thing.

Shame on Amazon.","review":"I've rented this from iTunes before but wanted to see the extended version so there is some grounds for comparison. The biggest difference is the audio. The iTunes version has great audio but the Amazon version nearly blew out my speakers. On the Amazon version, the sound effects were at a normal range but the dialogue level was so low. So low that at moments with dialogue and sound effects you either couldn't hear the dialogue or your sound is turned up too high for the sound effects.So for watching a fun, fresh take on a classic story I'd give it 4 stars (cant be helped. It has Kristen Stewart in it). For audio quality, I give it a 1. In all fairness, it did have sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low profanity, good flick!","review":"I am normally not into this kind of movie, but I will have to say, I enjoyed it! I rented this movie for the grandkids and I like the fact that this movie has very little profanity which is very unusual these days.

Who is the evil-queens brother? What are they doing in this story? Man-Oh-Man, they really took some liberties in this story - poetic license I think it's called.... I guess it's basically, fundamentally, sort of the same story... I guess the real, actual, award winning story, the story known and loved by millions of people, the story with such positive messages - that story wasn't good enough for Kristen Stewart. If this movies didn't have such good special effects, I'd wouldn't have watched it all the way through. I'd have turned it off probably way earlier than those shrunken A-holes that were supposed to be dwarves. Loser of a story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I love this film.

My girlfriend agreed with me, worst movie we've ever seen at the theater.

I don't know why he had such a ig movie for his first.... Really failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"pity for the fairy tale...","review":"Disgusting!!! So much violence. Lack of real imagination and lack of tenderness that in fairy tales balances the cruelty of violence. If a young one or even a child sees it before sleeping he will have some nightmares.

Good to se kristen Stewart in a different movie she was good in it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Walt said it better","review":"I bought this DVD on recommendation of a friend, he said it was a good movie. NOT! It was boring, dreary and with a face and personality of Kristen Stewart who cares. To think a dwarf had to die for this dreary and colorless person is an outrage. The subplot of the Hunter and his dead wife adds nothing to the story. Also since Snow White didn't choose between her childhood buddy or the Hunter does that mean there is a sequel? If I spend any more money on the Snow White saga, I'll buy the Disney version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid, unless looking for a nap.","review":"I rented this thankfully so not a whole lot was wasted but my time.

Movie in general was very predictable suited for the intellect of a 7 to 10 year old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Movie!","review":"I love fantasy movies in general and this one did not disappoint. It is great to have a gritty, adult re-telling of the old fairy tale I had read as a child. At first, I could not imagine Kristen Stewart as Snow White. She never struck me as all that beautiful and there is a moroseness about her. However, given the dark nature of the film, her general film persona actually worked in her favor in this particular role. On the other hand, Charlize Theron blew me away with her performance as the evil Queen Ravenna. There is a love triangle in the film, and I like the fact that it was not neatly resolved at the end. Yes, it leaves room for a sequel, but I also felt it was a satisfying, appropriate ending to the film. This is not your grandmother's Snow White; plenty of good action, drama and excellent characterizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow White & The Huntsman [HD] (Amazon Instant Video)","review":"Poorly written, bad acting, written for teenagers, rested on the special effects.

The acting was well done, especially the Queen. A good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This was a lot better than I thought it would be. While I didn't like Kristen Stewart, like usual, I thought everyone else did an amazing job. Charlize Theron was AMAZING! Not many people could have pulled off such a psychotic character so well. It was so believable. Also, I loved the story. It wasn't just your basic Snow White tale. It went further. Plus, the dwarfs were adorable and heroic.The only thing I didn't like was **SPOILER** in the end, you don't know who she chooses! I have a feeling it was the Prince, because he's a Prince, but it definitely should have been the Huntsman. Also, I didn't feel much love from Stewart in this movie. She didn't do a very convincing job with either the Prince or Huntsman.Anyway, I would recommend it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"great cgi, not so great story..","review":"the special effects were great, and good acting all around, save Kristen Stewart, since I can't conceive why she'd be cast with someone as incredibly talented as Charlize Theron. Good thing she didnt have to do much, because she's really not much of an actress.

Horrible dialog, lame plot, clunky editing. I don't agree that the acting was bad. There's just no way the actors could have looked good given the terrible editing.

Considerable imagination and attention to detail went into the special effects, but the script was a relentless fusillade of cliches. It was as if the writers ransacked the archives for every lame and tired meme in movie-land history. The score was also a tired hack job. I guess Roger Ebert and A.O. Scott (two respected critics) gave the movie positive reviews for good intentions, and because of the superb art design, photography, CGI effects, but what a sad waste of money and effort.

At some point Hollywood decided that special effects could substitute for these things. One of these days they will wake up and realize they can't.There are a number of young, attractive women in Hollywood today who can act: Kristen Stewart is not one of them. She and Robert Pattinson should get married, take the fortunes they made doing the Twilight movies and spare us anymore pathetic efforts at acting. Casting directors should help them make this decision.Charlize Theron is too good an actress to have squandered her energy on this movie. Watching this movie was a total waste of time. My advice is to re-watch The Lord of the Rings which this movie tried to emulate to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but shitty.","review":"Aside from the pretty visuals and the occasional good moment from Chris Hemsworth this movie was terrible.

Lots of bad choices as well that seemed to happen because it would look cool but added nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a world where Snow White will never be anywhere near as beautiful as Charlize Theron","review":"If you like repetitive Kristen Stewart affectations you'll be fine with this. Casting rather stinks but the art directions, effects and wardrobe are stunning enough to make up for it. Watch it with the sound off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually beautiful but that's it","review":"Visually this movie is stunning but that's the only redeeming quality. Charlize Theron's performance is way over the top and I didn't care about any of the characters. I just couldn't wait until it was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well that was mediocre......","review":"The more I watch Kristen Stewart, the more I come to the conclusion that she has no or little personality. In this movie she played Bella (Twilight), nope, I mean Em (Adventureland), nope, I mean Sarah (Panic Room), nope, I mean Snow White. I think you get the idea. She is blah in the entire movie. The other parts of this movie are pretty predictable as well - Charlize Theron cries (again - she does it in every single movie she's ever made). Chris Helmsworth, who I generally like, has a bad, quasi Scottish accent that comes and goes. Please do not waste your time with this flick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by Kristen Stewart","review":"This movie was ruined by the bad acting of Kristen Stewart. My wife and I both felt that way after seeing it at the theater. If they had a different Snow White this would have been a good movie. The scene where she gives a speech to rally the troops was the worst acting I have ever seen. She has no emotion. I wonder if she is a zombie? Charlize Theron was amazing as the evil queen and the rest of the cast was good but they can't overcome Kristen Stewart's poor acting. Save your money and buy anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing and acting","review":"I give this two stars instead of one based on Charlize Theron's performance. She was the one light in this boring poorly written snore fest of a movie. I am very glad that I did not pay to see this at the movies. Reading the reviews I thought the blasting of Kristen Stewart was just mad Twilight fans who wanted to get back at her for cheating. Turns out Kristen is just about the worst actor I've ever seen. Even given the weak script her performance brought the movie to a new low. The speech she gave near the end of the movie was so badly delivered it had me and my 14 yr old daughter laughing. My wife, always the smart one, had already given up on the movie and left the room to do something more interesting with her time. I feel like this could have been such a good movie that just missed the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlize Theron was Slumming","review":"Talk about a bad movie. Why does Kristen Stewart continue to get \\"acting\\" roles? Charlize Theron was truly lowering herself and her standards to have participated in this film. When will Hollywood realize that just because someone gets lucky and has a role in a movie that was already a blockbuster due to the book that that does not qualify someone as an actor in anything else. Don't waste your time with this movie unless you really have nothing better to do or are looking for something to put you to sleep. If you want to see a Snow White movie, get the one with Sigourney Weaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow not so white and the old huntsman","review":"Movie was ok but silly. I think the seven dwarfs were the best part of the movie. Kristen Stewart I'm sorry is not the fairest of them all. i don't really have much to say about this move. it really was that same old story with a not so believable twist i just was not buying the characters. \\"sorry Rupert Sanders\\" if you like twilight you may like this movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I purchased the instant play of this movie. The movie played with out any problems and the movie was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good visuals but...","review":"The visuals of this movie weren't bad, some of the special effects were actually quite good but everything else about the movie was horrible. The acting sounded forced (especially the Queen) and the writing was horrible as well. I wanted to like this movie even though it had Kristen Stewart in it but it was not good at all. Also, it wasn't very original. The beginning is fairly classic snow white and then there is a scene that, to me, seems like it was taken straight out of the movie Princess Mononoke (with the deer-like thing in the middle of the forest on an island and then gets shot by the evil people). If you want to watch this movie I suggest you jump to the middle and skip any parts with the evil queen in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst movie of all time","review":"This movie was, simply put, awful. From the bad acting to the cheesy effects, this movie had nothing going for it. The plot was lame - we've seen the re-dos of too many fairy tales lately. Let's come up with something new, Hollywood. Not even the exceptionally good-looking cast was enough to keep this movie off my \\"worst ever\\" list."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Hours and 8 Minutes of my life WASTED","review":"FIRST of all Kristen Stewart should stick to her ridiculous Twilight crap.I would have rated 0 stars but it's not an option.Totally disappointing and I would like a refund of my $3.99 rental fee.Stupid @$$ movie......

I can not imagine why this was so popular a movie but I watched it once and gave it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This Movie","review":"This movie has a few entertaining moments that are buried beneath a flimsy plot and poor writing. There is very little payoff, which only compounds the loss of two hours that this film took from me. I do not recommend watching this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"It just drug on, and on, and on. There was so much potential for the story to get good, so I hung in there till the end, but it never did get good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give the trailer 5 stars. The movie 2 stars.","review":"The trailer made it look like a great movie. But it never got off the ground. When it ended, it left no thoughtful perspectives, no lingering emotions... nothing. A walk thru an uninspiring landscape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlize was GREAT!","review":"However Kristin Stewart is really an awful actress. There is nothing animated in her acting, she has but three facial expressions and they all say constipated. How this girl became an \\"IT\\" kinda gal is beyond me. She acts like one of the better junior high drama club enthusiasts, however in a Hollywood movie, we do expect more than this level of acting. The overall movie was predictable, and slow. I really wish I could find the right guy who will return the time I wasted watching this \\"very not good\\" movie.I say, see it if you've got nothing else to do and this movie is one you can see for free. Otherwise, I am sure you'll have a better time watching your dog's toe nails as they grow."},{"rating":"1","title":"snow white and the who?","review":"I thought the movie moved to slow and there was a very weak storyline.

Had some intertesting characters and special effects but I never really \\"got into\\" the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much depth to a story line that offers so many possibilities","review":"I was disappointed to say the least.

Moreover, the \\"Huntsman\\" never really seems to come to the fore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually a good looking movie, but the plot dragged on for way too long.","review":"The visual effects in the movie looked great. The acting was alright, but the story did not have enough to sustain a movie that long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snow White and the Huntsman","review":"This movie was bad enough but when you throw in Kristen Stewart it is almost unbearable to watch.

It trys to have magic and Christian values and it makes holes in the story line. I had fun but it needed some script work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"It was a good movie but I think they could have done more with it. The action should have been more I think and the story line could have been more in-depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was so excited for this movie. I was really not impressed with it. Kristen Stewart is still a bad actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"Okay to rent if you have seen everything else. As Dorothy Parker once said about another actress, and which I will paraphrase and adapt,\\"Stewart runs the gamut of emotions from A to B.\\" She brought the rest of the movie down to her own deadpan level. There was almost zero chemistry between her and Hemsworth. Charlize Theron, as far as she was able to, added to the overall movie, but she can't do it alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Fantstical","review":"I like this kind of movies- fantasy, storybook, simple maiden who is empowered, injustice but wins in the end. I like pretty actors- Kristen and Charlize."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Snow White and the Huntsman\\"","review":"Won't let the fact that the behind the scenes scandal brought my \\"Like Kristen\\" button down a few notches and my disappointment after the lovely and innocent Isabella Swann affect my rating of this movie...Chris Helmsworth and Charlise Theron did good jobs as the huntsman and the evil queen...a bit of horror added to the real Snow White story but everyone eventually lives happily ever after..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great movie! Charlise Theron does a great job! Not your typical fairytale that's for sure! Kristen Stewart is amazing as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie.","review":"The other side of Snow White made this movie very exciting. She has finally found her strength. Good work to the writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White, Warrior Princess","review":"The heroine in Snow White and the Huntsmen is a far cry from the comely, delicate Snow White of Disney’s fairytale fame. The modern version is a princess whose mother the queen dies, and father the King is seduced, betrayed and killed by the evil, now his queen, Ravenna. Still a mere child, the princess is imprisoned and after ten years escapes. The queen, will live forever if she takes the life of Snow White, so she dispatches the Huntsman, a wild-eyed trouble maker, to hunt the princess down. Upon finding her, he succumbs to her beauty and charm and teaches her the art of the sword. This is an action packed adventure, with a fine cast: Kristine Stewart and Charlize Theron.In the end Snow White regains her throne and the evil queen meets her sorry end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it with a passion.","review":"Ugh, what a piece of crap. From the visuals shown in the trailer, I thought this movie would at least be tolerable but it really wasn't. I don't know how they got Charlize Theron or Chris Hemsworth to sign on for this, but they both seemed to have been taking acting lessons from Kristen Stewart (read as \\"a very BAD thing\\"). No redeeming qualities whatsoever for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film, but one tragic flaw","review":"While this is a very dark interpretation of Snow White and was expertly filmed the fact that Kristen Stewart has no acting ability ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kristen Stewart is truly awful.","review":"I desperately need to understand how this girl has a career as an actress. Seriously, will someone tell me? Surely she hasn't banged EVERY director she's worked with. Her excruciatingly dull performance not withstanding, the rest of the movie is kind of entertaining.The script is weak, but Charlize Theron is perfection as the queen. And the special effects are beautiful, but it's not enough to carry the film. Casting agents: There are a ton of talented young actresses out here. Try harder next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, bad direction, just plain bad.","review":"This was not a good movie. I waited and waited for it to improve, never happened. Some of the visual effects are cool, but even that gets redundant. Theron does the best she can with what she was given. Hot Huntsman, so a little eye candy for the ladies. And Stewart, oh that poor girl. I have seen her in other movies (not Twilight) where her style is appropriate for the role. Think \\"Into The Wild\\" or \\"Adventure Land\\". It looks like her Twilight success has pushed her into a role that is beyond her abilities. I do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're making a sequel.","review":"Ms. Stewart can't act very well,but thank goodness the others can. Hollywood needs to come up with new ideas for a movie. It's remake after remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"I thought the movie was really entertaining. I liked the visuals and the story line.I would watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Movie","review":"I enjoyed the movie. Charlize Theron is an amazing actress and she does an amazing job as the evil queen. Kristen Stewart is not the most talented actress and it is hard to see her as an inspiring leader, but she did well enough as the naive innocent princess in the beginning that I enjoyed myself. I will not ever buy the movie, I feel no need to watch it again but still worth watching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Your Cash","review":"The title says it all, I mean how desperate are you for a movie plot, the animated version was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed incomplete","review":"There wasn't a booklet with the dvd and the person I gave it to was disappointed and wondered if it was used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"Terrible movie, terrible directing, Kristen Stewart is like the new Kevin Costner, sometimes british sometimes not. It kills my suspension of disbelief that she could ever be fairer than Charlize, (who I expected to be awesome but was just eh?) Chris Helm is decent eye candy but there is very little build to romance or actual romance. Fail Fail Fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to sit through","review":"Shut it off after the first half hour. Just gore for the sake of gore, and a bore fest galore. There's a shortage of quality movies nowadays. Just big-budget, made-for-money crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow White and the Huntsman","review":"I believe everyone knows the narrative and basic symbols of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, the evil queen, the poisoned apple, seven dwarfs and the huntsman. The visual effects of this movie surpass the imagination. The evil queen in this movie is given center stage to give the viewer a glimpse of her true evil which has never been done to this level before. Kristen Stewart as Snow White is effective giving balance to the movie. Well worth a look, see."},{"rating":"2","title":"haven't seen it","review":"I haven't seen this but my daughter did and she loved it the extended edition she said was great glad I got it for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Warned: This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN!","review":"Please be warned! This movie is NOT FOR CHILDREN! The PG-13 rating is no lie, here. There are images and themes in this movie that could easily give any sensitive adult nightmares. Here are some EXAMPLES of only a few of the scenes children would find deeply disturbing (as did I): The evil queen tells her newly married husband, the king, of her hatred of men, who \\"use women,\\" just before she kills him on their honeymoon bed. A few scenes later you watch as her brother kisses her shoulder as he and the queen hint at an incestuous relationship with each other. In order to preserve her beauty, the queen eats the hearts of an animal or bird of some sort, which you see cut open at her dinner table, as she digs the heart out and puts it in her mouth. The queen pulls the heart out of one of her subjects after he attempts to assassinate her. No child should ever be exposed to such horrors. You can definitely cross this movie off your Christmas list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Great acting, emjoyable movie and the streaming of the movie was excellent. Great quality.I'd recommend this movie to anyone for a good time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not watch the movies","review":"I could not watch the movies because they are in the Blue Ray format.

I gave them away."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your time unless you are a teenager","review":"Must not waste your life/time/ trying to figure our this plot, or why you should care for the characters. Its xenia warrior princess meets harry potter and brother grimm. In all the wrong ways. Unless you are 16, and highly susceptible to special effects, and have no expectations. In which case this movie was made for you. 12-21 year olds enjoy. Other wise you will regret it, like I still do. waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"snow white & the huntsman","review":"Good movie. Sorry I waited for dvd should have seen it at the theater. Buying it online was easy and now its always there. The should have offered a rental option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stewart is barfable","review":"Charlize Theron was visually brilliant as the evil queen and Chris Hemsworth was, well, Chris Hemsworth, wonderful visually and acting - the movie could have been about the two of them and been fantastic, but no, they had to have Kristin Stewart play Snow White... correct me if I am wrong, but I don't remember the character being a vacuous twit who appears to want to catch flies with her constantly opened-mouth expressionless face. Gawd, she was awful. It even feels as if the film has been cut to try to eliminate as many scenes with her as possible... they didn't eliminate enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sometimes the villain makes the movie","review":"This movie seemed more about the rise and fall of a tormented, twisted, and evil villain who desired immortality at any cost - and an unsuspecting heroine princess who gets lucky every time she turns around as if fate is paving the way to destined victory despite the obstacles. The villain carries out continued destruction of others lives in order to perpetuate her own. We need someone really bad to hate, so when goodness triumphs, we feel a deep sense of gratification - and now satisfied, we can move on with a calm sense that right will ultimately win out in every situation no matter how dark and desolate things may become."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aww Yeah","review":"I had no desire to watch this movie, but when it was my wife's night to pick, she allowed me to choose between this and October Girl (or something like that). I picked Snow White. What a movie! This story was never meant to be a fairy tale.I was also skeptical because it has that Twilight girl in it. I never even noticed. I'll say again; what a movie! WATCH IT! You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"SNow White","review":"I don't care for Kristen Stewart's acting. She acted just like she was Bella in the Full moon movies. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Loved this movie. The actors and actresses did a wonderful job with the parts they played.

Leave the Snow White story alone. We feel the story should remain animated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Watched about 45 minutes (rented on my Kindle Fire), wound up not finishing it.The special effects were great, and the camera work. Everything else, and particularly the script, sucked, to me. Some of the acting was alright, but honestly they weren't given much to go by.It definitely strove to be a \\"fresh\\" retelling of the story, and succeeded to some degree, but I felt like the things they added to make it more \\"unique\\" wound up just being more clichés that were just new to Snow White, rather than genuine innovative. I felt like I was painfully aware of how much they're \\"trying\\" to be something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"Saw it a couple of weeks ago, just didn't like it. Felt silly. Like a cross between snow white and joan of arc, but not in a cool way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential Unrealized","review":"On paper (and in commercials), this looked like it should work and that made it's failure all the more disappointing. The back story was hurried together and created no sympathy or depth in the characters. For all the rich visuals, I never felt completely immersed and there was no broken ground - everything looked like something that had been done already and done better. Charlize Theron's character should have been much juicier, a queen that you rooted against but enjoyed watching. She simply was not fun to watch. The movie was unsuccessful at creating a sense of dread. By the time the dwarves showed up, I was completely checked out and the rest of the movie - too long, by the way - was a complete drag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell asleep","review":"This movie had promise, but I couldn't even stay awake through the whole thing. Complete lack of interest in the story and how it would end (which was beyond obviously predictable). Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"Completely forgettable.

It was hard not to laugh during her motivational speech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"Great storyline, special effects but Kirstin Stewart was not the lady to carry it off.

I fast forwarded through the movie so I move along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Effects","review":"Some of the visuals were good but the story was lacking and the dwarves were unremarkable! Kirsten Stewart spends the movie looking like she is going to vomit, like she does in all her movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boycott Kristin Stewart","review":"This movie had a chance. It really did and honestly is started off well. The plot was a unique twist on the classic fairy tale and all seemed well. Then entered Kristin Stewart as Snow White... Uggh. Hopefully she will be able to purchase some acting lessons with what she made on this movie because breathing heavily and looking sad/confused all the time doesn't make the cut. Its really too bad because Charlize Theron was remarkable as the evil queen and it's a shame to cast a horrendous actress such as Stewart opposite Theron. The only value in watching this movie was that I can now, without a shadow of doubt, save money in the future by avoiding any film with Kristin Stewart in the credits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, waste of time","review":"Just wasted $3.99 on this video. Highschool-esque actors, recycled Lord-of-the-Rings props, road movie storyline.

And I especially like that the Queen had a brother who was as equally evil and mean as the queen.

I have to say, unless you are a twilight fan, flee from this movie, it is a one watch movie at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage Folks!","review":"This film is so dreadful that I cannot even find the words (w/o getting tossed off amazon). No story,worst acting. This is why Hollywood has no clue. This film is as bad as \\"Avatar\\", and that is saying a lot! Kristen Stewart had better start thinking about saving her career. Kristen was excellent in \\"The Runaways\\", so we know she can act. But, after being in many of the worst and most successful films (Twilight Franchise and This THING), I think I have made my point.

Kristen Stewart is so terrible and so oddly disconnected that she appears partially tranquilized. Thank goodness they didn't give her more lines! And the scenes where she is supposed to come across powerfully to evoke the kind of connection to Snow White you want to have. No chance!Charlize Theron and the huntsman carry this movie to its final conclusion. Which is ruined by a queen apparently struck deaf and mute standing around after being crowned.

It was slow and very boring.Everyone said it was such a great movie. Well I am glad I didn't see this in the theater. I don't seewhat the big hype is about Kristen Stewart. I think they could have found a prettier Snow White. Thatmight have saved her relationship with Robert Pattinson. Overall not really worth your time unless you want to take a nap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"I Have met so many people that say this movie sucks, and i always say have you seen the movie? and most of the time they haven't seen the movie they just assume that because Kristin stewert is in it its going to be a terrible love story like twilight, and the movie has extremly small amounts of romance in them, that if thats all you will focus on you went into the movie wanting to hate it, and if you do that you will hate it no matter what movie you see if you have your heart set on hating something you will hate it. but this is a good movie great acting yes even from stewart and theron really steals the show she was great. but this is a good movie its not great and its not bad but it is above average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't eat the yellow snow!","review":"I regretfully fell prey to this aweful display of acting and overall storytelling. To be fair, Charlese Theron and Mr. Helmsworth were at their usual best, but were still not enough to make up for Kristen Stewart's usual depressing, monotone, unconvincing, amateur, pissy spoiled teen performance. I hate it when movies don't live up to the expectations set by the trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and too Dark to see","review":"I found myself falling asleep in the this boring film. It was too dark and you need a really need a dark room and time to focus your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"On the up side, the special effects were great. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth gave good performances, though Hemsworth was pushed into the background pretty quickly.On the down side, Kristen Stewart got a lot of screen time. This wouldn't be a problem if not for the fact that she can't act her way out of a wet paper bag. She has no emotion and is totally unconvincing. Also, the writing was a little iffy. It wasn't terrible, but it was obvious that the screenplay did not live up to the director's aspirations.My expectations for this film were not that high to begin with, but it still failed to reach them. If I had it to do over, I'd save my money and wait for this to come to Netflix or Amazon Prime for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"I expected to be entertained. Instead, I was bored to death!!! I love fantasy and horror, not horrible. The plot was scattered. The acting awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster with a Touch of Blah","review":"Mirror...Mirror starring Julia Roberts was a much better movie. Neither the Huntsman nor Snow were fully developed characters and didn't deserve their status on the marquee. An imprisoned Snow White doesn't emerge as a warrior heroine but as a girl lost to her circumstances. And who is the huntsman...an actor stuffed in a role for his looks because he cannot be the love interest of Snow White? This movie suffered from a case of reaching for too much while giving too little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"That chick cant act her way out of a bag....dialogue was horrible....boring movie overall. Expected more action then there was. Movie idea had potential but epic fail ensued."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the.....","review":"Charlize was great. She brought back memories of my phyco b**** from hell stepmother. That was worth a star. The story is a good one, the eye candy was ok too.... But Kristen's inability to act was a huge downfall.

So not worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"........ ...... .. . .... ... ...... ..... ... .... .... ..... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ... .. .. .. .. .. .. .. . ... .. ... .... ... ... . ..... ... ... ... ... ... ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little short on content","review":"So this movie is better than a few other Snow White remakes that came out recently but that isn't saying much. The director obviously wanted Kristen Stewart for the Twilight popularity and a little something on the side (just Google it if you don't know). She isn't real believable in any movie I've seen her in and always seems constipated before she delivers her lines. For some reason Charlize Theron seems a little off here don't know why she is a great actress maybe it was the writing. But that said the rest of the actors are pretty good the dwarfs are awesome and the sets are done very well. So not the worst movie you could watch but certainly not a great one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need 2 hours and 8 minutes of my life back","review":"Firstly for those people who found the preview alluring let me warn you this \\"action packed movie\\" spends more time blankly focusing on Kristin Stewart making all the same ridiculous facial expressions she did in the twilight movies. The plot started off as a promising one , but quickly they get caught up in trying to create beautiful eye catching scenes rather than actually telling a story. The movie earned the one star but Charlize Theron and Liam Hemsworth both did a great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Till The Last 30 Minutes","review":"I was liking the movie up until the last 30 minutes.Eliminate Stewart and the movie would have been awesome.Theron proved she can be a wonderful villain but..Stewart damaged it.Not only did she kill it when she rose up from the kiss from the Huntsman but then gave a speech to all the soldiers to wage war against the princess. That really bombed it for me. She is not to be a lead actress, she desecrates it almost every scene with her not changing face which her expressions are the same throughout. The Hunstman was good but Theron was the movie for me. The ending sucked and the movie for me is a 4.5/10. Magnificent settings, special effects were nice but Stewart again...bombed it for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly, poorly executed, awful movie.","review":"I thought 'Hey, the guy who plays Thor is in it... maybe it will be good.' But I was wrong, this movie had such a big budget and does not deserve any of the money it makes back. The only watchable character is the guy from Thor, then rest of the actors almost didnt need to even be there. Someone could have filmed the queens character pacing the halls of her castle for two hours and the movie would have made just as much sense. Save your money and buy something that is actually quality, and not just a bunch of odds and ends of special effects thrown together. This movie gets two thumbs jammed into my eyes so that I never have to see this crap again."},{"rating":"1","title":"stinks","review":"K-stew can not act! worst movie ever. Dont waste your money. Use real little people next time. nothing is worse then full gown men trying to act like little people. The queen was the only good thing in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"Felt compelled to stop watching about 1/2-way through. Once the dwarves come out, there's no rescuing the movie. Charlize Theron does a pretty good job, but the rest of the cast are pretty wooden and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Snow White I've Ever Seen","review":"This is a great film to watch with the family, but maybe not small kids. There are a couple graphic battles and images that might freak them out. It is definitely a beautifully shot, well done film, but it is also pretty gritty. Consider that before the 4 yr old sees someone get run through with a sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"An entertaining retelling of a familiar story that doesn't shy away from its dark side.

Terrible writing, stupid plot, fake story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Snow White and the Huntsman was a nearly perfect movie. Charlize Theron was amazing as usual. As was Chris Hemsworth. His fake Irish accent didn't go over too well, but his performance was excellent. Another highlight for me was the seven dwarves. I loved the new take on their life style, and the actors were very well chosen. The only drawback for me was Kristen Stewart's acting. I will say this in her favor, however, she did seem to put forth more effort in trying not to be so wooden. But it is painfully obvious that she is trying. I'm not sure if it's lack of confidence or what, but she always seems very unsure of herself. I do hope that she is able in time to grow into a more mature and confident actress. But for now, I would love to have seen the movie with a more adept actress playing the part of Snow White."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and Overwrought","review":"This movie wasn't very good because it tried too hard to follow the Disney version while crafting this weird narrative that was never explained. It was confusing and it really dragged during the middle and end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Okay","review":"The movie starts off well, but clearly begins to lag as Kristen Stewart becomes the focal point. The scenes with Charlize as the Queen are the most intriguing part of the movie and she clearly steals the film. In the middle where she is absent for large gaps, the movie drags."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wast of Time","review":"I didn't expect much due to the reviews but I at least thought it would be visually interesting. A lackluster boring waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I cannot believe how many bad rating this movie got.This has been one of the better movies of the year.

The only redeeming factor was the ever eye-catching Theron. Otherwise, fans of the fantasy genre should give this one a pass. Might appeal to teenagers obsessed with \\"Twilight,\\" I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, i want my money back","review":"Very bad movie, too slow, kinda butchers the whole snow white classic, and is way too expensive for what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Stewart Some X-Lax","review":"Maybe its just her acting but Kristen Stewart looked constipated the entire movie with a some relief in the final minutes of the film. Also Theron who is super hot was made fugly by CGI and lowered the entertainment value of the film for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This movie was totally boring and I had no connection to any of the characters.

Did not like the movie at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent departure on a classic story-line","review":"This genre is one of my favorites. As a movie buff, I have a wide taste (and tolerance) for remakes and deviations from what I grew up knowing.

But watching it, I hated it. You don't end up caring for any of the characters, and you in fact hope they die so that there is something unexpected.

In the Spanish course you are given the entire phrase and then the sentence is broken down starting with the last word, then the last two words, etc. However, in the book the individual words are given first, building up to the sentence. Not only does this mean that the CDs do not follow the book very well, but often times the last word in the sentence will be a word you have already become familiar with and the first or second word in the sentence will be unfamiliar. As a result you get to practice the word you already know quite a bit, but not the words you don't know.I've also used Barron's German course. The German course builds up with the words first, then the sentence. This also means it follows the book. I found the German course to be great, whereas I would not recommend the Spanish course."},{"rating":"1","title":"FUN!!

When I got this toy, I charged it for as long as it told me, then I tried it. It didn't even sputter. Then I tried it again, and charged it, since for some reason it ran out of battery. Didn't work. I then tried bouncing the beam of the cieling to the ufo, no go. I tried launching it from middair, it just fell. Then I charged it again. Seems repetitive, don't it? Then, 5 minutes later, after almost giving up, I tried it, IT ACTUALLY FLEW, and then crushed my hopes by stopping and falling on my face, and then it never worked again. Just so I can prove it wasn't just my ufo, 5 of my friends got the ufo, with similar destructive results.

It is quite fragile though, but crashes don't break it unless you step on it somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"indoor toy!","review":"An important thing to note about this toy is that IT ONLY WORKS INDOORS. I bought the \\"National Geographic\\" branded version (identical except for box) and the outside packaging said nothing about not working outside. But it doesn't -- the light of an overcast sky is enough to swamp the sensor for the infrared remote. The saucer starts by itself, or refuses to start at all. The manual says in this case \\"fly indoors in room with appropriate ceiling height.\\" Apparently it relies on the light bouncing off the ceiling to read the remote.A flying saucer indoors?

I have never understood the desire of someone to conquer a boring, undesireable little town. What the module really boils down to is a cleverly disguised linear (thats right... linear) adventure, that clever players can suffer from. If players figure out what is going on too quickly, they can be in over their heads just as quickly.

Oftentimes, our motives are pervaded by sexuality when we're least aware of its presence. Good vs. bad motives - - points of view - - shades of gray - - how our sexuality influences what we do - - how others see us - - These are the shared themes of these stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Thought Provoking","review":"As all Sue Miller's are, this one is no exception.

I have not read any of her other books, but this one was a waste of my time. The title story was the best one and it went downhill from there. The stories were disappointing &/or disgusting &/or irritating. I kept waiting for something more to them and they fell flat. Perhaps there was a hidden meaning? Well, it was too well hidden!

For the most part these songs are similar to the original recordings except with less instrumentation. \\"All I Know\\" is sans piano and adds acoustic guitars which give it a more cheerful (or slightly less depressing at least) sound. A sort of bar room sing/mope along version.. I would buy it for that track only, plus \\"Dimmest Star\\" has some great electric guitar which stands out more on this version than on the original. This CD is a good introduction to the Pernice Brothers music if you are hesitant on buying their full length CDs or are unsure which to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most invigorating adaptations","review":"This video trilogy is a set of live theatrical performances taped up in Canada of three of Shakespeare's more familiar works: \\"The Taming of the Shrew,\\" \\"As You Like It,\\" and \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\" Unfortunately, they are not the most LIVELY theatrical performances I have encountered.The productions are sound, and obviously ably directed. But that doesn't fully counteract the fact that, especially for two of Shakespeare's sillier comedies, they just aren't played very funny. This particular production company obviously went for a deep artistic production rather than audience-friendly entertainment. Which is too bad, for I like all three plays when they are done well and captivating.These are NOT the videos to buy if you're hoping to foster a love for Shakespeare in new-comer junior high students, which is what I was hoping for when I bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality construction, broken in a month","review":"At first use, cd burned fine & read fine.

It does, however, still read DVDs, but that is all.This is presumably a consequence of poor quality design & construction; design looks slick, but in such a slim package, the components must not have been solidly secured.

I'll be gently packing this back in it's box and storing it in my closet for the next time I need a boot disk (hopefully never).As far as a sleek, plug and play external USB optical drive that is sturdy and fast, I recommend the Sony DRX-S70U.

I emailed LaCie tech support. After two days without a response, I decided to call their support line which IS NOT toll free. After listening to on hold music for 2 hours, I gave up and decided to return the product. I finally did get a response from their tech support. They told me to exchange the unit. I find it completely unacceptable that a company, with the brand recognition that LaCie has, does not have a toll free tech support number, takes over two hours to answer a tech support call, and takes over 3 days to reply to an e-mail when their response is to exchange the unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serene and Relaxing","review":"Jill's music is beyond the realms.

Since this unit is factory service only I mailed it to Toshiba. Several weeks later I was informed that the main board was burned out and the cost or repair was $466.00. That is in addition to the $70.00 to look for the problem. If I had it repaired the total cost invested in the unit would be $1,135.00. This total, of course, does not include the $49.00 I had to pay in shipping and handling to return it to me. Run, do not walk, away from this product.

I was very nervous about transitioning, and did a great deal of research before settling on this seat. Its proven to be a great find. Sure, the cup holders are a bonus, the moveable armrests make things easier, and the print is just too cute. But I was most interested in making sure that the belt threaded through safely and securely and at an appropriate height. I am so happy to report it has been great. It fits exactly where it is supposed to, at the chest and across the lap (don't forget to adjust the neck support- its so easy!). The folding feature is nice too as we generally used this seat for summertime daycare trips and it went easily into other cars. We still primarily use a 5pt harness in our other car, and for longer trips, but when we're comfortable enough transitioning to full time booster seat use, we'll definitely get another of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bargin!","review":"I bought this car seat for my 4 year old daughter. She is rather tall and weighs 50 lbs. We have her in a 5-point harness (for kids up to 80 lbs) in our primary vehicle, but needed a booster we could easily move around in our other car. We are very pleased with this car seat and my daughter loves it. It arrives completely assembled. The car seat is wider and more stable than most other boosters. The head rest is perfect and keeps her head from falling forward when she falls alseep on long car rides. And with this being a discontinued color/style it was a great bargin.

Often there didn't seem to be a logical way to find solutions, so I got there by trail and error, and then the crappy paper (erasing) is no fun, also because some times it seemed that I had for instance found a \\"1\\" somewhere to later realize it had pressed through from the puzzle on the other side. Anyway, all in all I just didn't enjoy these puzzles very much. I like a bit harder puzzles, love the Mensa book and the Black Belt Kakuro is good too, but this one, no fun.

It was _almost_ as close as when I use a razor and shave \\"against the grain\\". Very good, and better than I expected even after reading the great reviews.

I can shave anywhere I want to, no need for a sink. In addition, I am able to dry shave so I do not need to waste my time or effort with water or creams, and washing them off. Finally, the shaver cuts the hair just as close as a blade.

The influence of co-writer Jeff Lorber is obvious here, as the music is very upbeat, but Jeff doesn't play the trumpet. There is still something about Alpert's trumpet tone that is unique. There is no tint. It is so smooth and rich. Listen to the track \\"Wherever you are,\\" for example and ask if you have ever heard such a beautiful tone from a trumpet. Alpert's playing is great throughout the CD-- Side steppin' and Rendezvous display his fine technique and great tone, which for me more than make up for his limited high-end range.

I don't mind a muted trumpet in a big band arrangement, but in a small combo setting when it is essentially a solo instrument, I don't find it very appealing.

It is up to the individual reader to decide which parts to accept and which parts to pass by, but there is probably something of value to all women in the Craft.If I were stuck on a desert island and had only one book on the Craft, this would be it.

Many diagrams are shown, and the poetry is wonderful, though some phrases did crack me and my boyfriend up (\\"my bowels know thee\\" and \\"my stomach partakes of thee\\") :D And I cannot help but think that this book is maybe a little *too* feministic, and instead of presenting both sexes as equals it rises women high above men.

The main purpose of the book is to show how radical Muslims become more and more dominating in European countries. Their culture is differnt from ours, and integration has not been successful. Muslims represent 2 - 14 percent of the population in Western European countries, and may be in majority within a couple of generations.

I would have liked to have seen far fewer emotional quotations and anticotes, less Europe-bashing and more constructive, concrete, corrective suggestions.Finally, for such an educated, well-traveled man, Mr. Bawer has chosen to lump huge groups of individual, culturally-diverse people and their nations located thousands of miles apart across the globe into categories - Christian,Muslims and Jews, as well as \\"Europeans\\" and \\"Americans\\" in the USA. Each of these categories contains thousands of component groups that range all the way from anarchists, to the silent majority, to fascists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Whole Story","review":"This book has lots of anecdotal evidence that the Islamic fundamentalists are absolute crazoids and dangerous. There is some truth to this; however, from this book it is impossible to tell how much.The book has no bibliography, no footnotes and no documentation of most of its anecdotal assertions. The book's focus is on fundamentalist or radical Islam, but no effort is made to show what proportion the radicals are of the whole. An attempt to portray American Christianity by focusing on the Christian fundamentalists would be unbalanced and misleading. So it is with Bawer's book.A much better treatment of Islam can be found in \\"The Long Divergence\\" by Timur Kuran. Kuran's book is more scholarly, more balanced, more nuanced and more credible than Bawer's pop-journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"While Europe Slept: How Radical Islam is Destroying the West","review":"Hardly a more timely subject can be found. Perhaps long overdue, if you want to educate and inform yourself about what is really going on behind the press headlines, you owe it to yourself to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a MUST read!","review":"This book is a serious wake-up call to Western Europe, and to America about the seriousness of radical Islam to the future of what we hold dear: a secular state which institutionalizes freedom of religion, a state which recognizes the equality of women, and a state which recognizes that all people are subject to the laws of the country of residence, not a religious law.Incident after incident of Muslim conflict with local officials shows the pattern of infiltration, attempting to get governments to allow seperatism to be the norm, until it becomes the law.The stories told by the author are chilling, but eye opening.The murder of the Dutch author Theo Van Gogh is graphic, but must be read to understand the degree of fanatacism we face.Our freedom of religion and speech is under siege! We must wake up, or lose everything we hold dear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must reading for every US citizen","review":"This book is very enlightening as to the current status of Western Europe. Most Americans lack this perspective of excessive dependency and too many want to emulate the European form of government. I appreciate the author's insights and first hand experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for any European; any American","review":"Solely as a recitation of recent events in Europe that are under-reported in Europe and the US, this is a must read. Bawer is a journalist who spent quite a bit of time living, working, and traveling in Europe, and his insight into how real events are morphed as they find their way into the evening news or morning paper can help one make sense of what's going on in Europe, the UK, and the US.This is not an academic excercise in \\"what's wrong with Europe\\". For that, perhaps try Weigel's \\"The Cube and the Cathedral\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into the Islamic expansion in Europe","review":"The author clearly explains the complex reasons--what it is about Europe that makes it more vulnerable to Islamic expansion than America.

Bower brings tons of facts, statistics and insight to illustrate how Europe led by a layer of disconnected elitists is allowing Islam to destroy the continent by cynically leveraging hopelessly outdated laws. While the rest of the civilized world may enjoy the irony for Europe paying the price for their disgraceful past, the book can better serve a wakeup call for yet a more destructive force which is about to rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"While Europe Slept","review":"Contains an important message why people should not allow themselves to be maniputated by political correctness or be cowerd by being labeled whilst pursuing their justifiable beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very necessary jolt of reality","review":"Mr. Bawer provides us with a harrowingly realistic, no-holds barr look at Western European culture today. The Western European political elite, in their absolutely disgusting quest to preserve their own interests by taking the path of least resistance, are all too willing to sell out their respective heritages and cultures to Radical Islam. Mr. Bawer's well-written account of the growing menace of fundamentalist Islam in Europe is terrifying and should serve a very necessary jolt of reality for us here in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"While Europe Slept","review":"This book should be required reading for every American, especially our political leaders.

It just floats, IF your lucky enough to get it off the ground. I put 8 BRAND NEW energizer batteries in the charging base and charged it twice as the manual specified. It lifted up for about 5 seconds, flew around in circles and then crashed into the grass. The manual also says that to turn it you just let off the throttle, but when you do this your helicopter comes crashing down!! The manual says you will get a whole 30 seconds of fly time which was not written on the box, (because it's pathetic). Another thing not written on the box is you cant steer it.

Both are good but different. Buy the \\"origial score\\" if you like the music you hear in the movie. This comes only in CD form from Hollywood Records. The other soundtrack is country music from MCA Nashville on CD and cass. Both look almost the same but read the cover before you buy. More movies now have more than one soundtrack, so pay attention to what you want when buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst of the trilogy","review":"Fans of Schnauss, which includes me, often consider this album the last one of a trilogy, the other albums being \\"Far Away Trains Passing By...\\" and \\"A Strangely Isolated Place\\". Unfortunately, this is, in my view, by far the worst of the three. It has neither the simple, shamelessly melodic charm of \\"Trains\\" nor the unrelentingly emotional impact of \\"Place\\". Where the childish vocals add flavor in the background on the other albums, here they are placed way up front, turning every track in which they appear into toe-curlingly sappy new-age schmaltz. Schnauss always uses loads of digital distortion and reverb, but here this tendency gets way out of hand, turning most tracks into a gooey, mushy mess, drowning out every musical nuance. Even after repeat listens I still don't feel this album as much as the other ones, so I will likely only listen to those in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good stuff.","review":"\\"Never Be the Same,\\" the first track on the album, is magnificent, and should be considered a shoegazer classic.

Certainly flawed, but overall quite nice.The rest, meh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Goodbye and 10,000 HZ Legend by Air have a lot in common.

Well, judging by this book, that sure ain't gonna happen! This book was a big disappointment to me. I had to force myself to keep reading it because all the flowery language (too many adjectives!) was boring! The characters were not likeable at all. And the story borrowed very heavily from the Exorcist (an excellent book by the way). The graphic descriptions of cannibalism, murder, mutilations, demons, etc., are probably what gives this book its' horror rating; but it was very predictable (especially the ending, which was DUMB!!)and didn't thrill or scare me in the least! I really wanted to like this author, but based on this novel, I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADVERB HELL","review":"This is just amateur hour. This book must hold the world record for containing the most adverbs. Characters stand up \\"nervously\\" and \\"gaze helplessly\\" \\"staggered clumsily\\" etc. etc. page after page, painful adverb after painful adverb. It reads like something a mildy talented high school freshman would come up with. I'll admit there are some wildly entertaining descriptions of filth and perversion but that dosen't make the novel enteresting. The language is so overblown and florid that I found myself laughing several times. And if Mr. Laimo is going to use a story from the bible to base his novel on he should at least bother to read that story and get it straight. I love good horror novels but this isn't one of them, in fact it is one of the most inept attempts I have ever suffered through."},{"rating":"1","title":"ending gone wrong","review":"I thought this was an entertaining enough book not very deep but kinda a fun summer read until the end. For me it not only made no sense but it seemed contradictory, DON'T READ ON IF YOU DON'T WANT A SPOILERSatan erases his memory to ease his pain, Satan takes the soul of the demonologist to punish him for almost taking over the world. Satan then allows the demonologist to go after an imprisioned Bev. Why? If he wanted Bev why erase his memory and for being a vindictive prince of darkness he sure was forgiving to the demonologist. It seemed like a rushed excuse to set up a sequel or a bad attempt at an open scary ending.

Instead I have now spent a great deal of time removing the horrible, tacky gold sequins and fake coins and just that in itself has improved this item.

It is solar powered and unlike the competition has a capacitor instead of a storage battery so I never have to shake it or replace anything. Except the only problem is, I didn't have the band adjusted when I bought it and this watch is bigger than my wrist. I haven't found anybody around here who is capable of adjusting the band on a Pulsar or Seiko, which have little bushings that always fall out and get lost because they aren't where you expect them to be. After several tries with a pin pusher which broke, I found a nice jeweler who cut pieces of stiff carbon-steel wire and swedged the ends.

I actually put a scratch in my pickup truck with the watch while changing out the tires. I had a Seiko for 8 years and it finally rusted out from the inside due to not being water proof.

Unfortunately, they didn't have the creative drive that the underrated Beland/Guilbeau team had. The musicianship is great, but the 1985 group took a big leap backward. Harris' strained vocals didn't help much either. The sound quality is miles above the very poor \\"Cabin Fever\\" CD (which features the same line-up), so, if you're curious, get this one.

Because this sounds exactly like too many people have been telling him for too long 'What? You're Thee Mickey Baker?'.

This arcade is easy to use, even for my youngest child. The menu shows them which buttons to use to play each game. It's great to see them playing the same games I played as a kid. These classic games are really timeless.My husband has even added additional games to play. My only complaint is that it doesn't have a timer to limit how much time my kids spend playing it.This is definitely the best family present we've ever gotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only architectural renderings","review":"One reviewer here says that this book isn't in English. Well it really has NO language. Each section has just a heading to identify the geographic location of the airport and the architect and a year. It doesn't tell you if that year was when the airport terminal was proposed or when it was finished.There is NO other information! Nothing about the cost, the size of the building, to say NOTHING about how this terminal is different than any other terminal building. The architectural renderings are very detailed--so much so that they look like photos and might be in some cases. It just leaves me cold and unsatisfied.Some years ago I encountered another similar book also sourced in Germany. It seems to be in a rare genre that includes only visuals and almost no words. I need more than just pictures. If you do too, DON'T buy this book.I returned it and took the effort not to recover a few bucks but as a protest about the lack of information in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"good as expected","review":"I appreciated the lower price for the same product I buy at my local store...too much packaging sent with it but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff is horrible","review":"the \\"clean burst\\" on this floss is really little waxy flavored flakes that come off on your hands & teeth. it turns into a slimy mush on the floss as you are trying to floss your teeth, making it unable to get a good grip on the floss. do not recommend.i only gave it 2 stars because it still works as floss if you're in a pinch."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Celtic/Jazz","review":"This is a great album, having a new-age sound but with a definite Celtic mood. This is the multi-instrument artist who is well known for his recordings with the \\"Afro-Celt Sound Band\\" and other groups. He plays mostly high and low whistles in this album. Some tracks are slow and haunting, others lively and rythmic, and yet others are his takes on some old favorites.

It also does not throughly explain some of the tools and how they are used.It has been most helpful for many things and has been a good addition to my library, but it was not the end all answer I had hoped for"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I should have looked for something more basic.","review":"I found that Paint Shop Pro is not like your usual Windows products, meaning that you are not just going to easily start using the program intuitively from what you already know of MS Paint or MS Composer. There are quirks and tricks. This book, however, is totally task oriented, and did not tell the reader the mechanics of using the JASC Paint Shop Pro tools. I had to access the Help files often.Also, the book was short-shift on the drawing aspects of Paint Shop Pro, and zoomed righ to the photo editing aspects. I felt like I was reading a book on a photo editing program like PhotoShop rather than PaintShop Pro! Doesn't the name PAINTShop mean anything--it's for drawing more than photos.

She is in the movie for maybe like 15min and her character is unnecessary. Keifer Sutherland is playing Jack Bauer again basically but doesnt get to beat anyone up. Oh and the movie overall is pretty dumb. The President is like this pansy guy who is being targeted but what doesnt make sense is why Douglas's character doesnt just turn himself in in the first 10 min to avoid a lot of people being killed and destruction of public/government property.

Kiefer Sutherland plays a co worker whos suspicious of him as he projects credible acting. Kim Bassinger as the typical frail, shaken first lady is a bore. That would basically sum it up. I was expecting more mystery and action and was disapointed on both. I can not find anything further to say about this film, and thats whats known as average. Destined for the back shelf . Oh, I came up with one more thing. The movie was full of camera jutting along with quick cuts in and out of scenes at an attempt to give big screen splendour. Great audio and picture quality ."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most absurd move I've ever seen. Zero star out of 5.","review":"This is a movie about Secret service. One should expect logic, action and suspense from it, right?The most disappointing thing about it is there's no logic. Agent Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas),kissed the First Lady without closing all the doors right in the house where the President andother agents were resting! The simmering scene was photographed by a mole. It was later usedto blackmail Pete. Please be reminded that, Pete had more than 20 years of experience asa Secret agent. Yeah, right! Where's his intelligence? No wonder Secret Service had a mole whenthey had an agent like Pete. If this was a fantasy movie like Lord of the Ring, I would be able to ignorethis illogical hole.There are much more better action or supense movies than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reminds me of basic instinct","review":"As I started to watch this film, my mind went back to the other kop character Douglas played in that film Basic Instinct called Nick aka Shooter. In that film, he seemed to fit the role like a glove: he was fit and dashing, and was believable. When I watched the sentinel, I couldn't help feeling that Douglas was (sorry to say it) clumsy and overweight. When he tried to run after someone, he seemed unkop-ish. Im a huge Douglas fan, but I felt he was trying to play a younger person's role, and it didn't work. The plot seemed a bit too far-fetched, and I ended up hoping the end would come soon. At the end, everything turns out as expected: Douglas gets all the praise, and there were no twists or surprises. In short, it was all too predictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!!","review":"To start off with, yes this plot has been used over and over again in movies. This movie is nearly identical to the 1993 movie, \\"In the Line of Fire.\\" That being the case, this was a damn good movie, since that one was. It was everything I expected it to be.Lots of action, suspense, everything that you would want in a thriller. So please go and see it and disregard reviews from other moviegoers and critics who bash it just because they point out that we have already saw it done millions of other times. If they were correct, then there would be no point in going to the movies, right?? Tons and tons of movies have the same plots and storylines.So all in all, this movie is a MUST SEE! Excellent performances by Keifer Sutherland, Eva Longoria, Kim Basinger, and the always outstanding Michael Douglas. It will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time.

At first I thought this is another \\"In the Line of Fire\\", but the story was different and I actually enjoyed it more even if once again I thought this guys is to old to be secret service.Good cast, sets, directing, and story make this a good one for most the family. The rating suffices it to say there is some adult situations and language. Although you can't help thinking Clint Eastwood and Michael Douglas are to old to playing active agents, you have to give them credit for doing their best.

Are there holes in it? Of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments. However, it is unfairly bashed here.

He seems obsessed with the beauty of things, especially women, and is remarkably uninterested with what lies underneath, territory that many of us turn to literature to explore.

The masks do not fit comfortably and they constantly leak, no matter how much you tighten them. I even bought fog spray, but the goggles fogged and leaked, clearly they don't seal to your face like a good snorkel mask should. Also the actual snorkel doesn't fit well in the mouth and so you get water in your mouth and in the snorkel and unlike most snorkels, blowing the water out doesn't work very well. It's too bad cuz we really wanted to use them there so we wouldnt have to rent gear, but the snorkel gear we borrowed on our snorkel boat was much better and we were able to snorkel with ease.

Did not try the mask on but it looked of very nice quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"We're now snorkelers!","review":"We bought these prior to our recent trip to Bermuda. We had never snorkeled before. They were perfect for us! Highly recommended - especially if you've never snorkeled before. The fins make the experience so much more relaxing than without. A fellow snorkeler offered this tip to prevent the mask from fogging: spit onto the inside of the lenses, rub around then rinse the the ocean water - gross but works. I saw other people doing this, so it must be \\"standard\\" procedure. The price is great too - already paid for itself rather then renting and I know where the mouthpiece has been!! I just ordered the carrying case too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Starter Kit","review":"Good for beginning snorkelers. My sister and I used them in the Caribbean and they worked very well, just you could tell that they weren't very high end. But for the price you get what you pay for and it is a good product. Much better than any of the snorkel gear that the local guides provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"I ordered this set for a week long snorkeling trip to the BVI. The reviews seemed mostly positive, so I took a chance. I wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews. The mask leaked quite a bit, and the side adjustments on it would not stay tight. The fins were very stiff...I guess I prefer a more flexible fin. I ended up using other people's equipment when they weren't using theirs, and not snorkeling as much as I would've if I had been happy with my own set."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"Unless you have the face of a child the mask is good for nothing, the snorkel is VERY uncomfortable; AVERAGE fins, maybe good for tropics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!

The mask broke on first use - the adjustable strap is held in on each side by a small plastic rod which snapped when I first pulled it on. Saw other reviews say the same thing.

Might suggest getting fins only, then a higher quality mask elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"good set","review":"The only problem I had was getting the fit right on the fins.

It was very painful to try to interpret all the specs on the equipment. The fins were absolutely fantastic! Easy to carry, easy to put on, and worked great!

DO NOT BUY THIS SET UNLESS YOU ONLY NEED THE FINS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great snorkel set for the price!","review":"We used these snorkel sets in Hawaii for a week. For the price, these are great! Sizing was also perfect. We didn't experience any issues with them. They were comfortable enough...but I have never actually had a \\"comfortable\\" snorkel set. What I look for in snorkel gear is: a mask that doesn't leak; flippers that stay on and don't hurt; and, a breathing tube that doesn't hurt my mouth. The set didn't have any of those issues. The mask stayed on with no leakage, the flippers were as comfortable as flippers can be, and the breathing tube worked just fine.If you are a serious 'snorkeler' that plans on using this set for many, many years, I would suggest investing in something a little more high end. If you are a 'snorkeler' that just needs gear to use during a tropical vacation here and there, then this is a great set. I doubt you can get a much better deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what we needed","review":"We spent a week on Isla Mujeres in Mexico during late March, we purchased this dive set so we wouldn;t have to rent and the gear we purchased was far superior than what was offered. The value was expectional, and i found the whole process easy, i encourage other consumers to purchase this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mask Leaks - Here is a Test You Can Do to Check","review":"We bought this set based on the mix of favorable reviews and were disappointed. The mask leaks. Most people probably know this, but a GOOD TEST is that you should be able to (on land!) press a mask against your face and have it stick by \\"suction\\" (without using the strap). Neither of the two we bought came close: air hissed in and they came off within 1-2 seconds.The gasket around the mask that conforms to your face has distortions in it, and is made out of a less-pliable material than that of our other snorkeling set mask. I was hoping this was a one-off problem, so we ordered another identical set and had it overnite-shipped. Same problem: the mask gasket was distorted and had small kinks in it.So, I have to conclude there is some sort of production problem. If you buy this set, at least BE SURE TO TEST the mask using the above procedure so that you don't discover the problem on vacation.Hope this is useful...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible value!! A cheap rubber set works much better!","review":"Water kept seeping into the nose part of the mask as soon as I would put my face in the water. The problem is that the mask is not capable of creating a watertight seal the way good masks do. No matter how much I tightened the mask, it wouldn't prevent water from seeping in. In addition, the flippers are much harder to use than ordinary rubber flippers because they are not nearly as flexible and they slip off much too easily. I switched to a cheap rubber snorkel set and was MUCH happier. Save yourself the money and buy a rubber set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"Do not buy this pair. It's badly made and badly designed. After a couple of days of beach going with the occasional snorkeling the fins started to deteriorate, literally, and the mask was always full of water no matter the corrections I made to the strap. Very bad choice even for swimming in pools. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"19/21 pieces worked perfect for us!","review":"We ordered 7 sets of these for a trip to Jamaica.

After several sessions the fins flexible and stiff parts split apart. The mask silicone is very stiff compared to other masks costing only slightly higher. They do not fit narrow faces well at all... LEAK. The mask straps slip. The strap attachments are very cheesy and break easily. The snorkel clips do not keep the snorkel attached to the mask and fall off while carrying. After a season of cruising, we are buying all new setups. We would NOT buy any of the US Diver combos again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snorkel Set Review","review":"Fins are good. Snorkel tube was decent. Water still entered the purge tube occasionally, I had to keep blowing it out. That kind of defeated the purpose of purchasing a tube with a purge feature. It was somewhat of a nuisance, but didn't distract me from enjoying the reef. The mask is horrible. Be careful the strap can break easily. I bought two sets, one was fine and the other broke the first day.I wouldn't recommend this set to anyone. I'm surprised with the poor quality b/c U.S. Divers products are usually great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic pin holding mask strap tore out","review":"The pins on which the strap pivots (and connect the strap to the mask) are cheap plastic and pressed-fitted into place. The first time I tried adjusting the mask while it was on my head a pin pulled loose and that was that. I finished that session holding the mast to my face with one hand.To keep it short and sweet: this is a cheap snorkel set for a mid-range price. If you are only the occasionally snorkeler while on vacation I suggest renting. It's easier and cheaper than you might think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for basic swimming fun","review":"Purchased and took this compact kit on my trip to Maui... it worked just fine for beach entry snorkeling and off dive boats. The rubber is soft and seals well for me, the snorkel clears easily, is adjustable as long as you wear it left side, and the slip-on fins fit well with no blisters. The fins worked well for propulsion and minimized the amount of work to swim around in low current situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for vacation snorkelers","review":"I bought this set for our once a year beach vacation, and I'm very happy with it. I've tried it out in the local indoor pool several times. The mask is comfortable and does not leak and the glass is clear. When we take our snorkeling trip, I'll bring some anti-fog for the mask. The snorkel clears easily after you dive and surface.The fins are the full heel type with no strap and they fit perfectly. They offer a nice propulsion and are comfortable - I've not had ankle fatigue or red marks. I think the fins are far better than any I could rent.The snorkel works well and the only problem I've had was the plastic clasp that attaches the snorkel to the mask broke fairly quickly and I had to resort to a rubber band. I think it was too stiff/brittle.Without the clasp issue, I would have given this 5 stars for the vacationing or casual snorkeler. I would buy this set again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fins are decent....mask is not.","review":"I purchased this set to use during my scuba certification class. For the price, I believe this set represents a good value for a beginner/infrequent snorkeler IF you can get the mask to seal properly. Unfortunately, I never could get it to fully seal and the straps easily loosen after you attempt to tighten them. The snorkel is decent and even has a purge valve which is handy. The fins also provide decent thrust and the vents keep your legs from turning to mush. But the poor design of the mask ruins the whole set. I have since purchased a mid-range Mares mask and it is just so much better overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked perfectly","review":"Just got back from our trip to Kauai and my wife and I had purchased 2 sets of these just before leaving.

Easy to put on and mask doesn't leak or fog up. Fins are good and durable , but definitely not for a long-term use. So, if you are like us, beginners in snorkeling, this is the set for you. But if you are looking to buy something that will last for a while- I would recommend to invest a little more :)Great overall. I also liked the fact that mouth peace fits great ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and as advertised","review":"This is a good and affordable product that worked well during the two weeks that we have used it so far.

We purchased the Vicks thermometer while away from home when a family member came down with a high fever, however the Vicks registered that her temperature was completely normal.

That it takes these special covers isn't so bad in itself, it's the fact that no drugstore in my area sells replacement covers (and even if I bought them online, they are ridiculously pricy for something disposable). If you use generic covers that are readily available, it flips out. If the thermometer could use any ol' sensor covers it might, just barely, be worth it.
