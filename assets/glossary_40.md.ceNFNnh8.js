He could just as easily have been given another name, but this shows the lack of origanity of these two authors. SPOILER - anyone with a knowledge of microwaves can tell from the very first how the \\"mysterious\\" deaths occured. I will not go into detail about that but it is far from being a supernatural kind of death that would relate to \\"brimstone\\".So much of the book is contrived and silly that is seems the authors only used the situations to stretch the story needlessly.I purchased the \\"sequal\\" to this book at the same time I bought \\"Brimstone\\" and it is one book that will never be read after having seen what \\"Brimstone\\" is"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Comic Book","review":"This is a terrible book. Pendergast knows everything, charms everyone, has done everything, and is invincible. That sounds more like a comic book character than a human being. The weapon of concern is obvious almost from the start of the book . . only one kind of appliance will damage a body like that. What was all the mystery in the Riverside Mansion in New York City. That was never explained, nor were the people associated with it, namely his ward and the old man. Saving themselves from assassination was too ridiculous to be credible. Not only was Pendergast a comic book figure, the entire novel was of comic book quality. I kept on turning the pages hoping to find a reason why I was reading this book, but I never found it. Don't waste your time with this unless you like comic-books, and stories that have no real ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY BUT I'M SPOILED...","review":"I'm sure I'm being unfair to the author, but I was spoiled by reading RELIC,STILL LIFE WITH CROWS, THUNDERHEAD and (to a lesser degree) RELIQUARY, which are among my favorite books in this genre. In comparison, I was underwhelmed by BRIMSTONE, DANCE OF DEATH, etc. I have just started Preston's TYRANNOSAUR CANYON, and I'm getting that same dragging feeling...It's not that it's not good, it's that it's not what you'd call a page-turner..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner from Preston/Child","review":"I borrowed the CD audio version of this book from the library and listened to it while I drove. What a wonderful story. I love Pendergast so much, it was a pleasure to hear from him again. The reader (Scott Brick) for this version is just wonderful, and I love hearing him voice Pendergast (and his Italian was also very nice). In the author's note at the end they mention that one of the characters Count Fosco is from another novel,The Woman in White.. I may have to hunt that one down, as Fosco was an intriguing character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I've only recently started reading the Pendergast series and am enjoying all of the books tremendously.

It kept me reading when I should have been sleeping.","review":"I really love a book that keeps me turning the pages. I am a giant fan of Preston and Child, The Pendergast series anyway.

Go ahead and get it you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, smart ride!","review":"I read a lot of mysteries. This one--my first by these authors--was definitely a cut above. Why? Without going into details (find those elsewhere) the characters were great...the plotline nearly epic (from Long Island to NYC to, eventually, Italy)...the writing was tight and intelligent...the mystery was good (even though--moot point--I kinda had a sense of the villian)...and the ending left things somewhat unresolved in a not-bad way. I liked it so much I'm now reading their two preceding books featuring Agent Pendergast--and I look forward to the follow-up to Brimstone when it comes out in paperback. Hey, I was skeptical about what kind of mystery would hold my interest at 700-plus pages. I mean, most mysteries are fairly formula. But, this one did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The demise of Pendergast?","review":"Finally finished Brimstone. Once again these authors jump right to the action in what seems a stellar plot. Then the read bogs down with information overload and descriptive passages, IMHO - and I'm a huge Pendergast fan. It was nice that the rogue agent had a romantic interest in this book - however slight. The novel ended with a cliffhanger, another plus. But come on . . . we know Pendergast isn't dead. LOL. D'Agosta, our favorite beat cop, carried his weight throughout. In fact, Vincent flexed muscles we'd not seen before. But I didn't really get the sidebar re: Reverend Buck. Perhaps a lead into another novel?Giving this one four stars and passing it onto a friend, along with the bulk of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I really enjoyed still life with crows and Cabinet of Curiosities, but this novel got downright dull and boring by the middle AND I thought the characterization of Agent Pendergast was even off a bit.

I have begun Dance of Death and it is off to a good start... so I have higher hopes for it and will review it when I'm done..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used To Write Much Better Than This - Not Their Best..!","review":"Preston & Child have put out some memorable books in the past (Relic, Reliquary, IceLimit were all excellent!). However, they managed to fail miserably in their last 3 books - even though they had a very interesting character, Pendergast, to work with.BRIMSTONE only barely managed to hold my interest: the plot was stretched-out (the price of sequelization), the villains were obvious and all style, no substance. The side stories were but page-stuffing, they added nothing to the story or the characters' development - whereas, (the partial) catharsis came in the most predictable way possible!!This is another example of a story diluted to blandness, in order to milk the cash-cow until it bleeds...Disappointed. Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brimstone","review":"Not pleased. The dust cover was torn and taped back and I wasn't told that it was torn. Other than that the book is ok.

It's the worst novel I read in a long time.The characters are a poor cartoon of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and the plot is constantly circuling around those characters. \\"Sherlock/Pendergast\\" revailed his discoveries always at the end inventing new plots to try to to continue the story. But the worst is at the end. They end this story not ending it, and leting it open for brimstone 2. What a shame!!!

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. I found it to be slow compared to some of the other books I have read lately. The coolest part of this book - which linked certain past historical events to the present - was given about 10 pages of attention I really wish they developed that further. I found myself wanting to skim a lot of the detail to move the plot along more quickly. This story should have been told in about 300 pages. There were at least 200 pages of fluff (I wasn't very intrigued or interested by the central park plotline).Wait for paperback - if at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific read!","review":"I enjoy the style that Preston & Childs use for the Pendergast books (and their other books as well). It is chilling and scary without being over-the-top.In this prequel to \\"Book of the Dead,\\" Vincent and Pendergast must stop a murder who kills in such a way as to make it appear that it is the work of the devil. Additionally, Pendergast has received a message from his long-long brother - Diogenes - that he will strike in January (the results of this are listed in the previously mentioned sequel to this book). There is a fascinating cast of characters and the book takes them from Southampton to NYC to Italy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good....","review":"It took me just a short while to read this book. I usually shy away from the ones that are 700 plus pages but I liked their previous books and decided to dive in and give it a try. I was not disappointed at all. I tend to stay away from trilogy type books too but this is way different. I will definatly keep going with this one. These guys are my second favorite authors next to Steve Berry. I am looking forward to the next 2 in this series. Go ahead and dive in and enjoy. Just remember...It IS Fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scorching Hot Thriller","review":"This effort by Preston/Child is a seamless thriller that moves from page-to-page faster than Britney Spears drives away from the Paparazzi with her kid on her lap.Agent Pendergrast is joined by Vinnie D'Agosto in their efforts to resolve a series of crimes perpetrated in a supernatural manner. The clues reveal themselves one-by-one and the dialogue and action sequences propel the story along. This was a book that I stayed up far too late reading, and woke up in the middle of the night thinking about. The ending is a little weak, but now that the sequel is out interested readers will be able to get on to the next part.An excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smugglers run","review":"This is a great game.

I haven't bought Smuggler's Run yet, but I plan to. This is a very interesting game. I think (for car lovers especially) that it will amaze you. It's not a game that you'll beat right away because of the continual difficulty of the missions. But even if you do, you still have the turf war, joyride, and capture the flag. This is a game similar to Midnight Club Street Racing. Basicly they're the same game just one's outdoors and one's cities. So it depends which one you like. thanks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you guys smoking....","review":"This game was the worst. I got quite far, but it was boring the whole time. The fist couple of missions are fun. Once they get too challanging you realize that your doing the same exact stuff as you were doing on teh first mission, just a lot faster. The cops have to intelligence at all, they just go directly at your car. The game is a MAJOR WASTE OF MONEY. I reccomend using your money wisely on something like Onimusha, that's a great game with better graphics, gameplay, plot, and variety. Don't waste your money or time. I am aware that this review is on the contrary to most of the others, but I feel that you should take my advice.

The graphics are barely of Playstation 1 quality. The storyline is far from engaging, and it really falls flat compared to some of the other titles out there. The concept of how goods are transferred is even rather ridiculous (ram a car and the contents of his trunk move into yours?!).

I'm the first to admit that...sure the drug smuggling and being chased by cops while trying to deliver the goods is great and exciting, but what I really enjoyed was the joyriding. Just driving responsibly and WHAM, run over a hiker. Or WHAM a train. Or flying down a snowy hill to ram a camper van into a frozen lake. Oh it's fun. A Tipper favorite for sure. All it needs to make it a perfect game is a little more GTA blood and guns sprinkled with some Twisted Metal/ Vigilante 8 massive weapons of destruction. I bought three other games at launch: Tekken,Orphen,and Ridge Racer but Smuggler's Run has taken up the bulk of my gameplay time. BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"This game sports great graphics. Beautiful worlds but no beef.

But it isn't indispensible Cecil Taylor. For that I'd get the Blue Note albums of the 60s, or the Cecil Taylor Unit work of the early 80's when Ronald Shannon Jackson was the drummer. And the spoken word soundscapes wear out their welcome quite fast really. The way that the CD is tracked, it is impossible to skip over these sections so I find that, if I'm in the mood for Taylor, I choose other albums to listen to over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great speaker, lousy product","review":"The sound is fine, but I broke it before I could even get it on the wall.

I still have them because it seems to be a waste to pitch them in the trash but who has time to get their shoes resoled.

Within 1 year, the stichting along the top of the toe came unraveled on one shoe such that I could see my sock while wearing the shoe. The soft leather at the back of the shoe along the achilles tendon became ripped up on both shoes with less than one year of wear.

They had rubber-like soles with an embedded oval containing the word ECCO. I wore them on a two-week trip around the eastern Mediterranean, and when I got home I found that the oval on both shoes had disappeared, leaving a big oval-shaped hole. The local shoe repairman said he could not resole ECCO shoes, so I sent it to the recommended repair depot, which resoled them with Vibram soles. I hardly ever wore them until this year on a two-week trip to Russia. Halfway through the trip, the sole partially separated from the shoe. I repaired it with duct tape to get through the rest of the trip.Given the problems I've had, I don't understand why ECCO shoes are so highly rated; from now on I will buy only Merrell shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST shoes in the world !","review":"This is my 3rd purchase of the Seawalker.

It is as if victory records made them release an album by spring. Because of this the album is weak, with less of an alternative feeling Spitalfield, was definitly known as.

I made that mistake. It IS a fun toy, but the plastic strawberry scent is EXTREMELY stubborn. After having washed it with 3 separate soaps 5 times, the scent is still very prevalent. The only way it went away was when I dunked it in my bathroom sink. Only completely submerged in water does that plastic strawberry smell go away, and even that was only temporary, because as soon as it was pulled from the baptismal sink the smell came rushing back.

Google phthalates, I had never heard of them before, but they are a type of chemicals used to soften certain rubbers and jellies. They are also quite bad for you.

The computer doesn't use much skill when driving, just frantically jumps around avoiding cars... The \\"line\\" (the ideal path to take into and out of a turn) really doesn't exist with the computer. The dialog and story line was not only cheesy, but almost offensive in that it's so stereotypical. The game doesn't have any licensing, so all the cars are made up, except for one, I think... You can't modify or tune your cars, and you can't win money and buy cars, you can only acquire cars by winning a specific race. In which case you win the car you just raced...

I rented this game, and was severely disappointed to say the least. The box made this game look like a playable \\"Fast and the Furious\\" type game. Boy, was I disappointed. I rented it, and brought it back the next day. My friend is big into racing games, and he said \\"I need to buy this\\" after watching the opening cinema. However, the gameplay is [terrible], as we both soon found out. Seeing that this was made by Rockstar, we expected something in the area of Grand Theft Auto 3, but with more emphasis on racing. What we got was Playstation One graphics, no cars to start off with except for a stupid taxi and truck, and no incentive to unlock the other cars. I felt like I was playing Sega 32X!!!!!!!! Avoid this game like the plague, rent or buy Grand Turismo 3 instead!!!!!!!!! Please, it's for your own good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing...","review":"I got this game through Hype and the previews of magazines, and I must Say What a Disappointment!! The gameplay is horrible compared to what the ps2 and decent games are capable of. The graphics are ok but the cars just ...... I would not recommend this title to anyone. I have played this game for an hour and must say got bored with it almost instantly. Even with the Gameshark codes with all the cars unlocked it was horrible. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! The reason I even gave the game a 2 was the graphics alone, and even those could be a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midnight Clubmeinthehead","review":"When I first bought this game, i thought that it would be much like The Fast and the Furious.

He said that you could snatch poeple out of their cars, and candy paint cars, and put gold thangs on the cars. but wut really got me pumped was he said that there were old schools, like cutlases and regals, but he lies again.

I couldn't catch him. I tried but I couldn't. I tried everything excepting using codes which I didn't want to do but I mean, that boss guy was so fast I couldn't catch him. I tried everything. Who else had that problem??? Who???? I want to know just so I am not the only one. Anyway, it was fun for about a day or two and then I just put it back in the case and never ever ever ever ever put that game back into my PS2 again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thought for the game, but the product not the greatest","review":"After reading several reviews on Amazon.com and couple of other web sites, and then finally maing the purchase, and actually playing the game, I'm somewhat disappointed in its design, gameplay and the story. I've expacted a little more. Truely graphics need to be improved, they don't look like PS1, but need major improvement. Gameplay is simply okay, but the story and the plot of the game could be done with more sense. I personally hate the idea of chasing some guy around NYC for couple of longer minutes, before he finally stops and tells you, that you can race him. The game itself is somewhat confusing as it lacks good instructions and what the objectives are.If I were to rate this game by gameplay, design, etc. here is what you can expect (on a sacle from 1 - 10):Gameplay - 6Graphics - 7Sound - 7Fun to play - 5Value - 8 ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a Substitute for Driver...","review":"I loved Driver and Driver 2 on PS. My favorite way to spend a couple hours gaming was to go for a ride around the featured cities, just exploring. Midnight Club almost brought that experience home to the PS2 for me. Unfortunately, though the graphics are much better than the latter titles, the cities (only two, New York and London) in Midnight Club are too small and don't have the same atmosphere as those in the Driver games. Regardless, some of the visuals in MC are jaw-droppingly gorgeous, like the rain/wet tarmac effects. wow. Another great thing about MC is that in some small way, it satisfied my hunger for Gran Turismo 3. MC is one of the best first generation PS2 titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mid-night club with cheats","review":"I got this game a few months ago, it's not bad, just confusing when doing a race because you can go both ways eg left or right and still end up at the end.you race a guy once to enter the club and get his phone number (if u beat him in a race) next time u race him and come first, u win his car, race him again u get his other car. after that u have to find another guy to race and get their cars, then u go to london........also theirs capture the flag. u have to pick up the flag at a flashing location, shown in yellow on ur map, and deliver it, a flashing green light on ur map, before the other racers.... . ....Overall not a bad game but can be boring after a while (couple of hours)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Gaming","review":"Hey everyone, this game is awesome if you have someone to play along to and it is also fun to play by yourself. In multiplayer, there are various options. One option, freeride. Where you ride around the streets hitting cars and breaking into buildings. And Also HItiing People On The SiDEWalkS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! That is an awesome option. In one player, it gets a little difficult but is extremely fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"This one got dull pretty fast. 2 cities and 4 cars to choose from. This one appeared to be rushed in order to make the launch of PS2. Another good rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK Game...","review":"I bought this without renting...to tell the truth, I was expecting a bit more. The graphics on the back of the box look mindblowing..but when you load this game up, it just lacks shine. Running at 30 frames, it's OK, but it can do better..60 frames. Now that would be great. In this game, you do same thing over and over..gets boring. So if you don't to do things repeatedly, don't buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"And the best streetracer game is:","review":"Okay, this is a very enjoyable game. The graphics are excellent, with the cars looking almost real, you can drive anywhere -- including through buildings. This is a very straight-forward game, you race your cars against \\"seasoned\\" streetracers, move yourself up in the world, as you do you get the deed to their cars in special races.My big problem with it is, sometimes the jokes that the characters throw out while are funny the first time or too around -- after you get into several races with them they start get very tiring very fast. But thast has nothing to do with the gameplay itself.You do have to be careful of some of the cars -- they all have their own \\"flaws\\", but if you can learn what they are and how to work around them you can actually get them to work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty damn good...","review":"I can't give it 5 stars cause I'm not addicted enough. It's a great game, otherwise, with enough different levels and \\"games\\" to keep you occupied for quite awhile. This was a rental for me, but the only thing that I could see keeping me coming back for more than this one is theme park. That's just addictive for gameplay in itself. This one has outstanding graphics. I don't live in NYC, but it's damn real to me...and although there's only two cities to choose from, the different tasks and races keep it more than interesting. I won't buy it in hopes for great things from GT3, but if there was no such thing, this would be my first racing purchase for PS2. And there's so much more with this one...take my word for it. Enough said???"},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I rented this game after reading some good reviews here, but personally I thought Midnight Club was pretty lame. The lighting effects and cars are pretty cool looking, but otherwise the graphics were just average. The audio is really bad. The characters that you race against have about three different taunts that they say and it gets annoying in a hurry. On the positive side, the controls are decent and the cars handle well. It's a nice concept for a game, but I just didn't think Midnight Club Racing was that much fun. I'm certainly glad I rented it first instead of wasting fifty bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok game...might want to rent it!","review":"This game is ok.

Hipsters, old hippies, overly involved parents and trendiness are all given a wonderful satirical going over in this show. My personal favorite...\\"Gotta get the Gear\\"..... since I definitely buy too much junk when I get into a hobby. You do not have to live in Portland to enjoy this...Eugene, Davis, Eureka or any of the other small cities that are inhabited by us greensters will do.

I really tried to like this but just couldn't and this one was by far a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and judgemental","review":"Overall, this book was a disappointment. The section that actually gives tips on how to successfully breastfeed is very short, while the rest of the book is filled with anecdotes and repetition. While I understand the desire to promote breastfeeding, this information could have been condensed to 1/3 of the length and would have been much more direct.I am a strong proponent of breastfeeding, but I found that the author's tone was condescending and judgmental towards women who are having difficulty breastfeeding, rather than offering help and suggestions. I was greatly offended by the first third of the book, where all medical professionals are described as incompetent, uncaring, and mean.I would suggest choosing a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful","review":"While it is titled \\"the definitive breastfeeding edition\\" it is more just filled with anecdotes the author and her friends experienced during their own breastfeeding adventures rather then giving advice and suggestions for going about breastfeeding. Entertaining at first but more annoying towards the end. I wouldn't recommend actually purchasing this book unless you are strictly doing it for an entertainment value rather than educational/informational value."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"This book is totally useless. I am 100% all for breastfeeding and did very successfully for both of my children but this book was not the least bit helpful to me. Most of the book goes on about how only real women breastfeed and anyone who doesn't is a bad mother. It puts a lot of unecessary stress on the breastfeeding mother who only wants to do good but only feels inadiquate if she decides not to go through with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!!!","review":"I received this book free in a breastfeeding class I took at a local hospital. I thought this book was absolutely terrible. It bashed hospitals, nurses, and anyone else not 100% involved and supportive of breastfeeding. I myself am planning on breastfeeding, as I am due in one week, and wanted to read up on the subject. I just thought the writer was overly negative about everything. It was a shame I wasted my time reading the book. I threw it right in the garbage after I was done. I am not even sure way I finished it. I was just hoping chapter after chapter it would get better. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational AND Entertaining","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It taught me the basics of breastfeeding as well as made me laugh. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best breastfeeding book I read! (out of 5 books)","review":"This is a great book for anyone who wants to breastfeed. I found it useful because I didnt know anyone who had done it or was successful at it. It gives you info for whatever type you are in plain, humorous language. It also gives you one of the most important things you will need...which is confidence!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good information but too onesided for me","review":"The information was good but it was buried within the author's own prejudices. I was very disappointed as I was really looking forward to this book. My recommendation would be to spot read this book and use it for reference only. Reading it cover to cover will make you frustrated, just give me the information and not your own \\"formula makers are evil\\" speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read","review":"When my friend handed this book down to me I thought \\"A whole book on breastfeeding? How much can there possibly be to learn? And how will I ever make it through the whole book?\\"Well, there is a lot to learn but this book made it enjoyable. It is an easy read and offers great advice on breastfeeding and dealing with a newborn in general. I breezed through this book and before I knew it I had a wealth of knowledge in the breastfeeding department. My stance on breastfeeding before I read this book was \\"Well, I'll try it, but if I'm not able to do it I won't be devastated.\\" Now I know that most women \\"can\\" breastfeed if they want and only about 5% of the population have serious enough problems that they actually cannot physically continue breastfeeding. It has made my decision a much more definite one which I believe you will need in order to get through those first few weeks of breastfeeding.Don't be scared of this book! It's great and you will get through it in a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful at all","review":"I have the 2nd edition and so maybe the 3rd is a huge improvement, but I didn't find this book helpful at all. It's basically one long cheerleading book for breastfeeding. I am fully in favor of breastfeeding, but whenever I would turn to this book for some actual helpful, specific information, all I got was more encouragement to breastfeed. Yeah, I AM doing that and everyone is being supportive, thanks, now how about some actual real world help? I found it really irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Threw it Across the Room","review":"I bought this on the recommendation of several people before my daughter was born, but she was only a few weeks old when I literally threw it across the room. For one thing, I found it VERY light on actual concrete information/mechanics, and almost all breastfeeding problems were attributed to \\"not breastfeeding enough.\\" Second, I thought the author's attempts at humor were lame and not funny at all. Finally, the author presents a view of the \\"breastfeeding lifestyle\\" that isn't necessarily accurate. I wish I'd known it was possible to breastfeed without going whole-hog attachment parenting - we're just not a co-sleeping, 24/7 babywearing, extended-breastfeeding family - because seeing that presented here as THE way to breastfeed made the whole thing sound so unattractive that it made me want to give up completely. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must buy for soon to be mom","review":"very informative and interesting read. not dry like many other breastfeeding books i have come upon. i highly recommend if you want to know all about breastfeeding!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to breastfeeding","review":"I'm pregnant with my first child and was sitting on the fence about breastfeeding...until I read this book. A lot of the information I read up to this point intimidated me and made me feel just a bit guilty about my ambivalence.At the advice of a friend, I picked up a copy of So That's What They're For and it was just what I needed! After reading only two chapters, I immediately felt more comfortable with the idea of nursing my child. Janet Tamaro injects a healthy dose of humor into this practical primer on breastfeeding and isn't heavy on the guilt.

This, however, was the simplest yet most imformative guide that I read. The author uses an entertaining tone while informing you of everything that you need to know. It is actually a pleasure to read!!!! I breastfed my son for 13 months and survived pumping at work for many of those months....all thanks to this helpful book. I passed it on to others who have loved it just as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book!","review":"I read this book through before my pregnancy was over and found myself returning to it during the first month's of breastfeeding. Very easy to read and felt like a girlfriend to call on. I totally disagree with the comments below that it is fanatical or guilt inducing in ANY way. I am not one to push nursing on others-it is a personal decision. Ms. Tamaro does however, tell the truth-nursing IS the BEST way if it fits your life. Even if you can only do it for the first days or weeks, as she points out.

The video was disappointing. The words used were too sophisticated for this age group. The animated lizard led me to believe it would be on the appropriate age level for my needs. However, the video contained scenes of a fish being eaten by a shark and an octopus being attacked and subsequently losing a tentacle, which was shown hanging from the fishes mouth! It was too graphic for early childhood. Just be aware of these scenes and the fact that even though there is animation, this is deemed too intense for a young audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift","review":"This was a used version, but it didn't appear to ever have been used.

I thought I was buying a history of a Black Fighting Division, instead I get autobiographical information on three people, only one of which-General Ed Almond I hadn't seen before. And no where in the book do I find any reference to the Divisions performance during the Serchio Valley attacks in December of 1944. As I stated in the title to this review.

We may be the only ethnic group that doesn't find comfort in our own comfort foods, at least that's my take on it, for numerous reasons, some of which I will respectfully not go into, as they are not flattering to my family.But still, a nice book, a nice series.

He has a reputation as a researcher, yet he bases his conclusions on his thoughts and feelings as a father of young children and not on any solid research.

The stories, with a couple of exceptions, are self serving and insipid. More about the main characters foibles, it leaves nothing behind with the reader but feelings of depression about what should be a warm and cheery time of year. Personally, this is not the type of book I look for at the holidays. Aimed above the head of the average man or woman, these stories tell of the rich and supposedly famous, who muddle and whine their way through the holidays without a warm and caring thought about others. Mr. Devereaux has missed the mark on what the average person would like to read. I read, and enjoyed, Nevada Bluff. This is a total let down from his normal fare. \\"The Hare's Path\\" and \\"The Gift\\" are the only two stories worth reading in the whole collection.

We tried it out ahead of time to see how it would work. I have owned two rice pots in the last 30 years. Each has made perfect rice. Each lasted way longer than I had the right to expect.This little pot was cute and compact but the water overflowed every time we cooked leaving goopy liquid on the lid, down the side of the pot and on the counter.

I had to look at all the other reviews on Amazon to make sure it wasnt just mine and low and behold everyone else is having the same problems. When you cook rice in this it overflows everywhere. Slimy sticky rice water overflows all over the counter and continues to pour out until it switches to warm. The more I use it the worse it gets each time. Im throwing mine away.

With larger amounts of rice, it does boil over as stated by other reviews. One thing good is, we only cook 1-2 cups of rice at a time, so the boil over is not an issue.

Over all, I like this cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in My kitchen!","review":"This is poorly designed and messy.

I previously owned a Panasonic (for double the money) with all the bells and whistles and 10 different settings and if you didn't program it precisely,the rice was a disaster and their steamer basket was plastic and stained easily. I had to get rid of that one. The Cuisinart is simple and I have never been disappointed with the results. Great for steaming veggies too(in a stainless steel basket)while you prepare your rice. Great size, it's small enough to be on the counter,prepares 8-15 cups of rice and coordinates with any other small appliances from the Cuisinart line.

So next go around, I added more water, but still the rice tasted funny- a burned taste- although the rice didn't burn as much this time. For the cost and design, I was hoping this would be a great rice cooker. Design element is cool especially wiith the retractable cord, however, this cooker can't even perfom its main purpose- just plainly cook rice without burning it.

After having my trusty (if battered and aged) old rice cooker replaced by this contraption after my wedding, it quickly became apparent that Cuisinart has no idea how to manufacture a quality rice cooker. The product produced a gelatinous goo that bubbled through the steam escape, and even pushed the glass lid ajar. I took to using a piece of tinfoil as the lid, so I could best manage the steam release. My problems are now solved, however---the heating element just burned out; TWO YEARS AFTER WE RECEIVED IT!!

The non-stick coating of the pot does not hold up very well. We ended up returning it to the store we purchased it from, they don't even carry it anymore. There are much better rice cookers out there, I would steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice rice cooker, steamer","review":"This is used nearly everyday in our house. I never measure the water and just eyeball it (1 inch of rice = 1 inch of water, but I use my finger ;-). YES, if you use too much water it will boil over (duh), but that rarely happens. We steam rice and often other things with rice, like sweet potatoes, or other veggies and it (almost) always comes out perfect. If it doesn't it's because we used too much or too little water. My only complaint is that the knob for the lid fell off shortly after I got it and I've had to super glue it back on twice now. The screw goes into hard plastic and once that's damaged there is no repairing it other than a new knob (or super glue). Overall a very handy little rice cooker that gets heavy use at our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just rice","review":"Very happy to see it steams veggies alone or at the same time as the rice, great product, delicious and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I had high expectations from Cuisinart, but I think they relied on their name and slapped it on this piece of junk. The first week the knob on the lid came loose and when tightened it stripped out. After about a month the on switch broke and pushed back into the housing. The rice it makes is OK and the steamer works fine, but hardly worth the money. The steamer is stainless but has a very sharp crease and is nearly impossible to get bits of vegetables out when cleaning. Overall, poor design and quality.

I haven't had any boil-over problems yet, although I've only cooked 1-cup servings so far.

No, it seemed we were doing everything correctly. So we tried a few more times, and then in exasperation returned the rice cooker for a new one. We thought given the generally good quality of cuisinart appliances, this one must be defective.Well the new one does the same thing! I give up. Enough of the messes.

The rice sticks to the bottom if I don't stir it up immediately after it switches off (to warm). I hate this rice cooker now, and I'll look for another. My biggest regret (other than wasted money) is putting something this new into the trash.I think quality must vary item to item or must decline over time (like mine) because the positive reviews look so good. But believe me, you don't want this mess on your counter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hands down the worst rice cooker ever made!!!","review":"This is a very nice looking rice cooker but it stops there. I have had alot of rice cookers over the years and this one caught my eye!! I thought because of the price this was that bad boy of rice cookers but to my surprise it turned out to be the biggest piece of JUNK EVER!!! It cooks the rice fast but makes a mess a very big mess every single time!! It must be a design flaw because the milky part of the rice while cooking over flows and spatters all over the place. I read if you use the steam tray it will help elimInate the problem, but it doesn't help the least bit.

However, no matter which recipe I use, it over flows onto the counter.The shape is great, the squareness of it makes it easy to store. I still use it all the time, I just make sure that there isn't anything near it when it cooks. The only other complaint I have is that there is not an off switch, you have to unplug it after every use. Maybe they are all like that, I do not know, this is the only one I have ever used.I love the retractable cord!!! Rice is perfectly cooked and appliance is easy to store. Too bad it makes such a mess, I expected more from Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same.","review":"Like many others, steaming rice in one of these contraptions is a waste of time. We thought perhaps we were missing a gasket, given the mess that was on our counter after each use. And reducing the water made the rice come out crunchy. So, we're chalking it up to a bad purchase and returning to our tried and true pyrex casserole dish in the microwave. That always worked just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for brown rice, and oatmeal, too...","review":"We use this cooker at least once a day -- in the morning to cook oatbran cereal, in the evening to cook brown rice. We bought it after a few close calls burning rice on the stove, and have never had a problem with burnt rice since (it has never been undercooked, either).I'll admit that I did not really care for the brown rice or oatbran cereal my husband needed to eat for sugar-busters until we found this cooker. Now I really enjoy them!Pros: Compact, attractive, warming mode, great results time after time.Cons: Relatively small capacity, top gets very hot, can boil over if you do not use oil, have to unplug it to shut it off.Since rice expands, it's important to read the guidelines and not try to cook too much. We find using about a teaspoon of olive oil eliminates any boil over. Also, for the hot cereal, try adding dried fruit or nuts -- it's great this way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"spilled over","review":"I bought this as a gift for my brother he didn't like it to much because it would spill all down the sides with a sticky mess. the rice was ok nothing special"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great appliance, used right!","review":"I love this thing!

It does a wonderful job cooking the rice and the end result is good, however, it splashes sticky rice water all over. I even read the other reviews that said to spray non-stick cooking spray on the pot before turning on -doesn't help.Also, I ran the cooker with different amounts of rice and water. One cup all the up to four cups. Four cups really make a mess. I did not rate it one star because of the design and overall appearance of the unit, which in my opinion are stylish and modern. I confess, this , along with the brand were the reasons I purchased this rice cooker. Go with a top rated version with a locking lid and save your money.

There is no way to release the water from the underside of the rim and who wants to use a lid that has trapped water that can drip into the cooker. I have tried everything to get the trapped water from underneath the inside rim, but to no avail.

But 3 times now, we've forgotten to put the liner back in the rice cooker, and have gone ahead and poured the rice and water in the cooker without the bowl. No biggy, you would think, except that when you do that, the rice (and water, in my husband's case) get in the engine, and are near impossible to get out. I've taken it apart, and the fiberglass insulation has began molding and is impossible to clean out.What is otherwise a fantastic item has a small glitch for people that are in a rush to cook and sometimes \\"slip up\\" on having everything in place. If you're super thorough, great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rice Cooker","review":"This is a great rice cooker. Our Rice turned out perfect. The insert cleaned up easy.

What this really means is that you will have rice-water spattering everything nearby, even if you're only cooking one cup of rice.The lid seems mismatched to the bowl. It doesn't quite sit right, so you have steam escaping out one side as well as out of the \\"steam hole\\". The knob on top of the lid gets pretty hot, so you have to have a hot pad to open it.There's nowhere to put the rice paddle. Most rice cookers have a place to put the scoop. (You're supposed to \\"fluff\\" the rice a few minutes after it finishes cooking; it's nice to be able to put the paddle somewhere other than the counter top.) Due to the shape of the lid, you can't even set it on top.It looks nice, and it cooks rice, but the design is terrible.

It's a pain to clean up the water stains on the stainless steel.\\"I can now say that I've gotten rid of this rice cooker. Besides being totally messy, the plastic in the cover knob completely cracked in half -- this cooker was purchased less than a year ago.

We own several Cuisinart appliances and are quite happy with them, but this rice cooker is horrible. I have yet to cook a good pot of rice. The pot steams over, leaving a coating of starchy rice water everywhere. The rice is either moist and sticky, undercooked or burnt on the bottom. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away from this Product!!!","review":"We bought this product thinking all rice cookers produced the same results. Unfortunately, this couldn't be further from the truth. The product does cook rice but the boil-over produces a mess that requires 30 minutes of cleaning time. This boil-over happens every time you cook and not just rice. Cooking oatmeal produces the same mess. The steam-cook system that sits on top didn't seem to produce the results stated by Cuisinart either. Not all the vegetables cooked and we ended up cooking them separately.We ended up having to buy another product that did the job we needed. We spent half the money and got a better product on eBay made by Ikeda."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK!","review":"The first thing that happened after only a few uses, is I dropped the lid... by some miracle the glass didn't shatter, but, it may as well have since the handle broke apart and was unfixable.

After maybe another 10 times of use the \\"push down\\" button to start it began to pop away from the frame of the body.

I had a Black and Decker \\"plain jane\\" rice cooker that worked perfectly for 20 years and there was no mess at all. This thing sits on your counter and tries to figure out ways to get even messier. This is the gift you give to people you hate. Think about this for a moment.

The unit power is controlled by plugging and unplugging the device at the wall. If you leave it plugged (on warm) in for a long time after the rice cooks it will eventually dry the rice completely.Follow the ratios of water to grain recommended in the accompanying booklet, not on the grain packages. I've successfully cooked rice, grits and oatmeal. Haven't tried cream of wheat yet. The steamer basket placed over the cooking rice turns out veggies that are perfectly steamed when cooking a couple of servings of rice.

It got hot and seemed to be working but then shut off like it was done after about 15 minutes. We would push the power switch down and it would keep switching back to warm. Then we unplugged it and tried to restart it. No dice. We were left with crunchy rice soup! Maybe we just got a defective one but it was a disappointing first use. The next morning I tried one more time before boxing it up for a return after the unit cooled down but it switched off early again.It looks great and would make a fine addition to the countertop if it worked properly. If I get another unit I will ammend this review as it could simply be we got a lemon.__Well the replacement unit died after less than a year. This is the second time I've had one of these last less than a year. The problem is the same - the water constantly boils over and out into and must leak into the inside damaging circuitry.

I always place this rice cooker in the middle of my glass-top stove when I use it because I know it'll require a clean up. Honest;y, I should start putting it in the sink when I make rice. Or, better yet, I should put it in the trash and buy a rice cooker that functions properly.Come on, Cuisinart! Don't you use your own products? I can't imagine how this thing made it through testing without someone noticing the mess it makes.I only gave this rice cooker two stars because it's attractive. Then again, my ex-girlfriend is attractive, but there's a very good reason she's an ex! This rice cooker should become my ex too. Seriously, the second star is pure charity. Unless your highest priority is how a rice cooker will look on your counter, don't buy this one. Not even on sale (I got it for $30)."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"The rice is ok, nothing special.

Even after cooking the rice with the extra water, the rice at the bottom is dry. We also have to quickly unplug the rice cooker once it's done cooking (can't keep it on \\"Warm\\") to keep the rice from getting burnt or drying out even more. Also, while cooking, the rice boils like crazy, causing liquids to spew from the pot, even with the lid on, making a huge mess everywhere. For some strange reason, it makes a bigger mess when you cook less than 2 cups of rice in it. Another problem with this rice cooker is that the lid has a ridge along the inside of it which is a hassle and is hard to clean out every time.

I really don't think the R & D people at Cuisinart actually even tried to see how their machine cooks rice before putting it on the market.

If you place it too close to the edge of the counter, it gets all over the floor... either by spitting its way over or by pooling and running off the counter. I'll probably never trust a Cuisinart again. Oh, and the food burns a little too if you don't remove the cooking pan from the base unit IMMEDIATELY after the light turns from red to amber.

The Cuisinart stopped cooking before all the liquid was gone. It also boils like crazy. I think the issue is that the insert is tall and narrow.

When we cook Lundberg Organic White Basmati or Lundberg Organic White Jasmine this cooker makes a MESS! A gelatinous goo flows out of the top, down the sides, and pools on the counter. It takes about 12 paper towels to wipe the cooker clean, then several minutes with a damp sponge to finish cleaning. Oh, it is so gross. It would be easier to cook on the stovetop then to spend the time cleaning this mess. Plus, it gurgles and shoots the goo pretty far, so whatever is nearby needs a bath too (e.g., the blender, the bowl of fruit).I will not cook this brand anymore, because until this brand, I did not have any mess and was happy with this cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Cusinart appliances are generally great, and my kitchen has several. When I saw this one, I bought it due to the Cuisinart name. I wanted a top-of-the-line rice cooker. I am returning it today after three months of use. It cooks great rice, but the clean-up is ridiculous. The lid just rests on the top, and it doesn't stop spewing steam and rice goo all down the side of the machine, as well as the kitchen counter. It's got to the point where we cook something other than rice because we canot stand the clean-up. I get this same result whether I cook one cup, or six. I've tried difference rices. Always the same. So, it's going back today and I will get a rice cooker that has a clamp-shut lid like my old Zojirushi, which gave me ten years ol great service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cooker I've ever had","review":"Cons:- Rice gets burnt at the bottom- Water boils over every time unless you are willing to eat high-fat rice by adding a lot of butter or oil to your rice.- The knob of the lid is made of conducting metal and gets extremely hot. So dont try picking it up once the rice is done.- The cooker does not turn off once the rice is done and if you dont manually go turn it off, it continues to heat the rice and burn it (supposedly keep-warm mode)- Doesnt cook rice like all the other regular rice cookers I've owned (Panasonic or other brands)- Most of the time, the rice is not completely cooked.Pros:- looks good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for brown rice","review":"I ended up returning this because every time I tried it with brown rice it burned the rice. I even tried doubling the recommended water amt. for brown rice and it still burned."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointing for Cuisinart","review":"I use this rice cooker mostly for brown rice and it is a fiasco. You need to put in 1/2 the water that you are supposed to, wait until that is cooked in and then add the other half. Adding all the water up front causes the cooker to boil over - a real mess with rice. It looks OK, but it just isn't the quality item you would expect with the name Cuisinart. The price is also reasonable, so its not the end of the world - it might be better for things that don't require as much water or cook time (like white rice)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless!","review":"This is the worse purchase you could make.

We are very happy with this rice cooker. Our biggest complaint is that the water boils over when we cook brown rice; we now put several paper towels under the rice cooker, which saves a little time with the mess. It is fine with other types of rice. Sometimes the bottom of the rice will be a little overcooked. The \\"warm\\" feature does not seem to work so well. Still, the rice cooker gets the job done and has so far stood up to daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"rice doesn't have to boil over","review":"I have read a lot of reviews that talk about boil over problem. Here is the prize winning hit. This is my second rice maker of this kind and I love it. This rice cooker has a steamer with it. When you make rice, always use the steamer pan. The little metal part that hangs down on the bottom of the steamer keeps the rice from boiling over. If you have something to steam, even better, but not required. You will never have the boil-over problem again."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money until you can buy something better","review":"I made the mistake of buying this rice cooker about 2 years ago. I looked at other brands but wanted to save money and try this one. Two years later, I wish I had never done it and put the money towards something much better. I am about to give it to Goodwill. It does still work - BUT - it overflows about half of the time (and I do put oil in as other reviews suggested, which does help some). The non-stick coating is really poor and basically is not very non-stick. So now I am back on amazon looking at getting a new rice cooker. I would rather spend more initially at this point, and get something that will last for many years. This does work and does cook rice reasonably, so if you're looking for a bargain I think there are some around on this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got over their name and so can you!","review":"I'm not sure if there is a category for Spock's Beard and their unique brand of music, but there are other great bands who share their quest for musical perfection. Folks like Gentle Giant, Porcupine Tree, Yes, Jethro Tull and others come to mind as I sit here and let the beautiful melodies wash over me. To think these same instruments make the music found on the radio today is a bit confusing. Anyway, this latest album is great and I must admit I am not a fan of song 3 but I do not hold it againgst the boys for trying to make a buck. I'd put this up there with The Kindness of Strangers and just short of V as my scoring goes. If you like Spock's Beard, buy this disc. If you are new to this band, this is a fine place to start. I got over their name and so can you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Found Their Voice","review":"I don't often write reviews, but I've been enjoying this CD so much lately that I had to say something. I love all the Neal Morse era SB and his solo/side project works. I didn't think SB would last long without Neal. Their first two efforts didn't really do it for me, but this CD has finally, in my mind, delivered a high quality SB CD that stands separate from the Neal Morse era. The musicianship is excellent as always and the material is now equal to that musicianship.Buy this and support the Beard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away as long as......","review":"They continue to call this Spock's Beard. What a Joke.I am a HUGE fan of the Beard. This is not The Beard. The Beard died when SM found Jesus and decided that because of that he needed to take a great band and turn it to ash.These are great musicians. This is a good album. But it is not, and will never be Spock's Beard. Not even Close.Buy this cause you like Nick, Ryo and the guys. But don't pretend and compare it to V or KOS or even the disjointed Snow. It's insulting to the greatness that was, and shows that you have no appreciation for the greatness that was the Beard..RIP - Spock's Beard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another solid Beard CD - But why only 4 stars?","review":"Ok, so 4 and not 5 stars... why? \\"Is this Love\\" is horrible (and it's the 3rd track on the CD!). So horrible that you will skip past it EVERY time you listen to this scattered, but very solid Beard CD.Enough about what isn't good, so what is? All the rest. What really stands out is Nick's drumming (especially on \\"Skeletons at the Feast\\") and his voice range. Ryo is at his best on this CD. Dave shines both with his bass playing, but especially his song writing.If you liked Octane, buy this and you'll be very satisfied. If you haven't quite connected with the new Beard and are looking for a Neal Morse era CD, then just download the first track \\"On a Perfect Day\\" from iTunes and you'll be happy (but don't buy the whole CD!).I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Georgie and Caspar are soulmates","review":"A friendly little ghost named Georgie must look for a new place to live when the gentleman of the house decides to nail down the stair Georgie creaks each night and oil the hinges on the door he squeeks each night.

I wanted to purchase the book for my friends because I enjoyed it so much. When I pulled the book up on Amazon and saw that it is a Harlequin book, I was very surprised! I have never wanted to read a Harlequin Romance Novel because I find the books boring and very predictable. As far as I'm concerned, this book doesn't belong in a catagory of books that are mass written, boring, gushy, and predictable. I couldn't wait to get back into my car to listen to more! I was totally capitavated by the mystery of the book. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a love/mystery book.

But the biggest shame are the length of the songs, 4 minutes seemed to be cut off comparing to \\"Hidden Hands....\\" and that didn't ride to well.If you want to hear the best of Darkest Hour, buy \\"Hidden Hands\\" you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sissy gothencore","review":"Dont get this confused with good melodeath.

Man, was this stuff generic. And I know, melodeath isnt exactly the most groundbreaking stuff, but play 20 diffrent songs from 20 diffrent good melodeath bands and I could tell you who they were. I had to ask the clerk ten times to make sure I wasnt listening to Unearth, Killswitch Engage, All that Remains, or the Black Dahlia. And to be frank, who cares.This is audio feces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"While I'm not much of a fan of this band, and never was, I have to say this album is surprisingly conventional and commercial sounding. These guys haven't developed any pop songwriting skills, they've just watered down their sound for the masses. The tempos and melodies of these songs are ridigly conventional and dull. If you want to hear Darkest Hour when they were more brutal and creative, when they had a somewhat fresh approach to mixing thrash, death and hardcore, when they had more of a musical identity, check out So Sedated So Secure. I wasn't much into that album when it came out, mainly because it wasn't very melodic, but I could at least tell they had some balls and creativity. On Undoing Ruin they've polished their sound to a high sheen, but lost everything that gave them vitality in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"better every listen","review":"I bought this cd thinking it would be a big risk. I had only heard \\"district divided\\", which somehow had an effect on me. At first i hated the singer's raspy vocals, but after a while it grew on me. The cd is hard-hitting, fast-paced, and has some great endings that give you chills where the singer emotionally screams a line over and over(ending of convalescence \\"these wounds will heal\\"). I am a huge metal-core fan and this cd is not metalcore. It is so hard to classify this cd into any genre because it is so unique and has so many unique aspects. I usually hate guitar solos, but the solos in \\"sound the surrender\\" and \\"these fevered times\\" blew my mind. For an addicting cd with great vocals, crazy fast drumming, and unreal guitar work i highly suggest the purchase. just listen to \\"these fevered times\\" (my favorite track) from 1:25 on for a demonstration of the talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality photos indoors","review":"I have owned this camera for a year now and I am not able to get good quality photos indoors.

While time won't change that, it is growing on me. Dickinson and Roy Z are as good as ever, the songs are varied and generally flow well, but something is missing. There's less fire here, as though the distance between albums has given Bruce less to work with, and I can't help but think that Adrian Smith would've pulled this up a notch. Still, Tyranny of Souls is a solid metal album, and fans of Dickinson's other albums should enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Some Adrian Smith","review":"About as good an album as Bruce and Roy Z could put out without the melodic counter solos that Adrian Smith added on Accident & Chemical.

A must for any Maiden fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No atmosphere, no chemistry....","review":"There is a HUGE diference between ACCIDENT OF BIRTH and The CHEMICAL WEDDING. Although TYRNANNY OF SOULDS is very good, there is a very strange atmosphere in there that is the absolute portrait of the truth about the amking of this album: the fact that none of the musicians involved ever recorded / rehearsed int the same room together!! This sia n album made entirely on PC-Tools (Bruce himself admitted it), in reunions between Roz Z and Bruce. I think Bruce never ever met bass player and drummer.

This film purposefully marries the viewer's experience with the amazing eye of Robert Rauschenberg. From the town of his birth to the architecture of a window behind him as he speaks, you experience how the artist transforms what he sees into art. Thus, when you look at Rauschenberg's art, which incorporates these same elements into it, there is a sense of inner knowing, a comradery with his genius, that few viewers will ever come close to realizing in any other fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth buying, but not their absolute best","review":"If you're already a fan of this wonderful Scottish group, then buy this album and don't look back. You won't be disappointed. I don't, however, recommend it for someone unfamiliar with the band, as I just don't think it showcases them in their best light. It's good, but it just doesn't have the \\"wow\\" factor of some of their previous releases such as \\"Nadurra,\\" and I don't know if the jazzy direction they're going in really suits them. The instrumental tracks, especially, seem to suffer from it. On the other hand, however, they include some beautiful ballads (\\"Little Do They Know\\" and \\"I Will Set My Ship In Order\\") that truly show off Karen Matheson's voice, and I am glad to see the return of the syncopated \\"puirt-a-beul\\" singing after its notable absence from \\"Nadurra.\\" Overall good listening, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good Celtic music","review":"I was disappointed with this album.

Only the 2007 Samsungs will.The FAQ at the Samsung website says:If you have a 2007 Samsung LN-T LCD TV and it has more than one HDMI jack, you can use the HDMI 1 input jack to connect to your computer's DVI video output jack using a DVI to HDMI cable.No Samsung LCD TV built before 2007 (LN-S series, LN-R series, LT-P series, etc.) has a DVI input for a computer. All models built before 2007, however, have an analog, 15 pin D-Sub (RGB) computer input.Important: Many of Samsung models built before 2007 have a combined HDMI/DVI input jack. You cannot use this combined HDMI/DVI jack to connect your pre-2007 Samsung TV to your computer's DVI video output jack. Samsung TVs built before 2007 do not support DVI to HDMI computer video connections.HTH"},{"rating":"1","title":"Samsung 26\\" LCD TV","review":"TV is probably a very good product but I was working with a height limit.

Awful reception (on cable). Even tho it advertises a wall mount with it... no such thing. Unless it's very well hidden. Unless they meant the instructions for a wall mount. Got those.So outside of no wall mount and very snowy reception, it's great. Um... huh? I gave it the one star because it looks good when it's turned off.I guess I should point out that I pretty much detest the wide screen format anyway. I rarely watch dvd's so staring at tv shows with the people all stretched out and distorted doesn't really work for me. Yes, you can adjust it for standard screen, but then you've just paid a fortune for, in this case, a 26\\" tv and you get to watch a 18\\" tv. Wheeee!

I have no nearby television repair service to help me fix it.

The Component inputs provide a superior picture, so use one or more of them if any of your components (e.g. DVD player/recorder) provides Component outputs. The sound is surprisingly good--finest I've heard from any TV, although of course you can route it through your regular stereo system for optimum results.

The transmitter and receiver are constructed using cheap lightweight plastic and are made in Malaysia. I have three comments:1. The lavalier microphone jack, and the cable that you plug into your camera's audio input are both 3.5mm mini jacks in MONO, instead of STEREO. So if you use a DSLR which records in stereo, like my Canon 60D, the system will record only on one of your two channels. To avoid copying the audio track onto both channels later on you have to go to Radio Shack and buy a mono-to-stereo adapter.2. The system has a useful range of only 15 feet, not 150 feet as Sony claims. And it will absolutely not work around a corner. It's line of sight only.3.

The swing stops swinging after you turn on the little mobile. Something about the extra power or gearing needed to turn the mobile and get the swing going seems to fail. We often here our baby girl start crying to look over and see the swing stopped swinging (although you can hear the motor still running). The light also goes out after a certain period of time. There must be a good reason behind this but we find it to be impractical, I wish there was an option to turn the timer off. The build quality seems good but a swing that will not swing well... doesn't get my best score. I have contacted the company and await reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing should be recalled","review":"This thing is a hazard waiting to happen. It should have a 5 point harness, especially for the sitting up position. My baby is only 15 pounds (5 months) and managed to hang over the side in the reclined position. It also should have come with an electric plug. It eats through batteries like crazy and it's so big you aren't going to be moving it from room to room often. If you use the mobile or the music on it the swing will slow down and almost completely stop. The cover can be taken off to wash, but it is a pain to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk!","review":"Broke after 2 months! Does not work at all. No movement sound nothing.

My son refused to be put down, I couldn't even sit while holding him he wanted to be walked non stop. We got him this swing and he LOVES IT!! He actually cries now because he wants to be put in his swing. There are some nights he even sleeps the whole night in the swing, thats how much he loves it. I got it for my baby when he was 1 month and at 3 months he still demands to be in his swing all the time. Now my baby is the happiest baby on the block!

My daugther was only 2 weeks old, when I first put her on this. I was surprised that the cradle hardly shook. It kept making a rattling noise, it would stop and then shake a little and then stop... When i took the baby out, the cradle would swing vigorously, inspite of setting in speed 1. Then yesterday, the mobile began to make a rattling noise. I think mine came with a faulty motor. I am going to return this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only one speed","review":"I was really excited to see all the great reviews on this swing - and honestly, it is a great swing. My daughter loves being in it. When she was about 4 weeks old, we bought this swing and it was a lifesaver. Unfortunately, this swing only goes one speed, even though it says it goes 6. I called customer service and they told me the turnaround for a new swing would be 6-8 weeks because they had none in stock. That is really frustrating, I must say. So I opted to let it go and just deal with it. I wish I hadn't - now the option to turn on the starry sky along with the moving mobile works sporadically. I had read previous reviews about the motor smoking so I'm wondering if this is the start to a faulty swing... :(I would've given this a 5 star rating if they could've replaced the swing within 2 weeks at the most - but 2 MONTHS... just not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replaced motor once and still won't work!","review":"This is a great looking swing and I wish I had a better review. It has great features- if they worked! The lights and music stopped working immediately and then the swing stopped swinging. It shows a bunch of speeds but there is really only one and I had to turn it all the way to the top speed to get it to move even a little bit. Then that just stops working after awhile, too. Fisher-Price replaced the motor once and it still did the same thing. Definitely NOT worth the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think I'm in love!","review":"What can I say, I love everything about it. It was easy to assemble, does everything it said it would and is cute to boot. The music is not annoying as I find most infant product music to be. The lights are bright and defined enough for my baby to notice and focus on. My daughter is colicky and won't let me put her down much but when she does she likes this swing. The only thing it lacks to be a truly all-encompassing swing is the ability to vibrate! I love the fact that I can plug it in and not have to worry about batteries. I think I'll keep this swing to use with my children's children (when they start having them in 15 years or so!) I like it that much! It does take up a bit of space but it's worth it and it's legs to fold in towards the center."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, my daugther loves it !!","review":"My little daughter (10 weeks now, 5 weeks when i bought it) loves it, she talks a lot with the little bear and the stars on the swing and she gets relaxed when she is on it.

Easy to install took about 30 mins or so to install and worked like a charm.

She's two months old and this is her favorite toy. the only thing is the speed of the swing, on the lowest setting it still seems like its going too fast.

I definitely appreciate that both swings come with an ac adapter, much cheaper than replacing batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son hated it","review":"We purchased this swing since it got such wonderful reviews from so many people. It is an adorable swing with everything a child could wish for. Except mine. He hated being in it. He is six weeks old and loves his bouncer but could not stand being in this swing for more than a couple minutes at a time. The motor is a little loud and he would startle when it was started up. Honestly, I'm not quite sure why he didn't like it, except to say that it does provide a lot of stimulation, so be careful if your child is easily overwhelmed. This review isn't here to bash the swing, just to say that some kids like it very simple and don't require all the gadgets and gizmos. He loves his plain old bouncer. We subsequently purchased a FP open top take-along swing which we've had better success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Light swing is a life saver!! Not really purple","review":"My husband and I love the swing. We bought it after we had already tried 3 different swings for our new baby and this is finally the one our 2 month old will sit in and stay for more than 5 min. He loves the lights it has and the direction of the swing. It says it is purple but it isnt. I think it is supposed to be lavander but is actually more of a pale blue.

My daughter will not sit in without crying and she will only sleep in it if she is alseep before I put her in it.I love the fact that it can plug in and that the music does not shut off and its realy pretty but I am not happy with it and I now dont know what to do. I still have the ocean swing and they are now set up side by side in my living room. I keep hoping she will adjust to the slower speed but its been 3 weeks and its not happening!So if you dont mind a slow swing this is the one for you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's purple - not blue!!","review":"I loved this product with the pictures online and the concept for my new little boy on the way looking up at the stars, rocking, etc...

I called Fisher Price and they want me to send the whole swing back so they can replace the motor...when I ask them if they were paying the shipping on this...they informed me no it would be at our expense. I than ask if I could just send the motor back they once again informed me no. My grandbaby loves her swing just to sit in but I finally told my daughter just get rid of it...I went to WalMart and bought her one that works....I miss the old days of the hand crank ones so much for this all pretty stuff cause we are paying more for junk....One mad Grandma.Fisher-Price Tree Party Cradle 'n Swing"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver!!","review":"My baby is a light sleeper and always crying...

We have used it ever since our baby girl was 10 days old and now she is 4 months. This was basically her crib. Babies like the swinging motion and this would calm her and put her to sleep in a 10-15m. Helped a lot during the initial stages. Now, she still likes to sleep in it, but with all the use we have made out of the swing, it needs some lubrication it looks like. It squeaks when it swings. Don't know how to get rid of that sound but we still continue to use it as its like white noise.For all those in 2 minds, get the swing, it will help you and the baby,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing if you get it on sale the better!","review":"I was a bit pessimistic on getting this swing because of the cost...yikes! I ended up getting it from amazon on sale with free shipping for $114. The ability to plug this swing in and have batteries as a back up was one of the biggest pluses for me. My first child, a boy had a swing simmilar in the ability to switch from side to side and to front to back motions which is great when the baby gest a bit older. The swing does tilt way back which is great for newborns and preemie's so they can lie far back with no worries.

As you can see, I put it together myself...it was that easy! I was SOOOOO Excited when I saw it here on Amazon for $114 SHIPPED!

Having the option of using either the wall outlet or batteries were great. We bought this for our daughter in 2011 and she used it for a few months. We put it away and just took it out for our 2nd child. We plugged it in and it worked for a week or so. Then it stopped. After some research, I found out this is a common problem with the swing. The motor and power plug needs to be replaced. Seems to happen after taking it out of storage, but not necessarily. Batteries worked, but I am constantly changing the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a lot of quality for $159.99","review":"For the price of this cradle/swing, I'd hoped for a lot more quality and reliability than I got. First, the stand seemed a little wobbly--you really need to make sure that the feet are as wide as possible when setting it up as they don't lock into an optimal position. Even worse, however, is that after less than two days of use, the lights, sound, and mobile stopped working. Calls to \\"customer service\\" were a complete waste of time and I ended up returning the item. While the netting and other features appeared attractive and desirable, I'd have to recommend purchasing a less expensive Papasan cradle/swing."},{"rating":"1","title":"choking hazard!","review":"This swing almost killed our daughter! At first we loved this swing for our newborn daughter, until at about age 4 months, she grabbed the netting and started sucking on it. The netting tore in to large pieces in her mouth. She had no teeth at this point. I heard her making choking noises and was horrified to find her mouth full of the fabric. She had swallowed some of it, and other peices were caught in her throat. She used to nap in the swing. If I hadn't been right there, she absolutely could have choked to death. Although we notified Fisher Price, and the CPSC, we never heard any follow up. We sent the netting to Fisher Price for them to analyze, but they never gave us any comment or explanation. The swing is lovely, but please remove the netting! It is an absolute death hazard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great but.....","review":"My baby loves, loves, loves this swing. We love it because it swings two ways. If he gets fussy swinging one way, we turn him around and swing him the other way.Now, the reason for the two stars: the motor went out... Twice! We purchased the first swing in December 06. In February the motor went out and we had to get another one. Then just today, April 25, 07 the motor conked out AGAIN!We don't even turn on the lights for our baby because they distract him. All he ever does is swing. I don't think we got a lemon.... TWICE! I think it's a flaw in the motor.Someone talked about this item not being sturdy. It doesn't feel sturdy but it is. It has to stand on two legs because you need to turn the swing. We've never had any problems with it breaking down. We only have motor issues.At $159 the motor should not go out. I'd stay away from it.If you can get another model that swings both ways, do that. That's the only feature that is absolutely fantastic about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow!!","review":"I want to start this by saying that swings are not something that you can buy before you know what your baby will actually like ... but what I do know is that this swing was entirely too slow for our son and he could only be in the swing for about 5 minutes before he started crying. We purchased it based upon all of the good reviews but ended up purchasing the Fisher Price Snuggabunny swing today which goes way faster and our son is content and sleeping in it as I type this. Again, it's hard to purchase a swing that is appropriate for your newborn without knowing what he/she will like, but if you get the Starlight Papasan then you are definitely limiting yourself to basically one speed with is just SLOW. Hope this helps anyone who is trying to buy a swing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Armsaver...","review":"This swing is not only adorable but snuggles my little one and rocks her, keeping her asleep after she finishes nursing so I can get a few things done. The set up was simple and I have never used batteries...the plug in feature is wonderful!!! She likes to sit and swing with it in the upright position and toybar when she is awake. I can also put her in the recline position and buckle her in. She falls right back to sleep after I get it turned on. She loves watching the butterflies (so do I) and at night they are so relaxing, but not so bright to interupt tv viewing. Music choices aren't great, but not bad and more often than not I turn off the sound and we play our own music in the evenings. I recommend this to anyone with a new little babe. This is our fourth child, each had a different swing and this is by far the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it but....","review":"I really like this swing. Unfortunately my two month old daughter does not. She rarely will sit in it for more than 5 minutes without fussing. The motor is quiet. The sounds are nice. The speed settings on the cradle are perfect. And its very soft to the touch, especially the pillow. It was easy to assemble and I did it all by myself (GO ME!)

I spent a few weeks looking at swings and finally decided this was the one that would be best for our daughter to be. We made the right choice. For the fist month and a half of her life this is the only place she would fall sleep. It really does not take up that much room, and it is very cute and neutral. It was very easy to put together, and it is very sturdy. She likes the rotating mobile, and can just stare at it and giggle. One drawback is that the music will get stuck in your head for weeks and you'll be able to sing nothing else haha. At 2 months old, Isabella is starting to get bored with it, and the days of it rocking her to sleep are over, but for the time we used it she absolutely loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price Star Craddle Swing","review":"The product only has one speed.

When it is on it's highest setting, it only swings as fast as the slowest setting on our Nature's Touch, which is not enough to keep our 3 month old happy or asleep!I called the company and they said that there must be a problem with the motor, so they sent out a new motor housing (for free) which I got within 2 weeks. It swings the same amount, so barring a really strange coincidence (two duds with the same problem) it's just the way it is.I'm going to try to sell this one and get a new motor housing for our nature's touch, which will be $35."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT baby swing!","review":"This swing is fantastic! Electric or battery run - wonderful music selection or nature sounds with several volume choices. Rocking can be forward and back or sideways. Comfortable and adjustable seat. Grandson loves listening to all the different sounds while watching the star lights (really beautiful at night as lights show up against the lightweight siding) and moving stars and teddy bear - usually asleep w/i about 10 minutes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please think twice, the speeds are crazy","review":"I requested this item on my baby registry. It is beautiful and is very easy to assemble. The main problem I have is the speed, which is almost as important as the construction of the swing. There seems to be no middle groud between not moving and light speed. The instructions actual say that if you have a ligher childer, which I did, that you should put a towel behind the swing to create some drag and slow it down. I did try beacuse I wanted to make sure I exhausted all methods of using the swing. The tray does not come off easliy and my daughterr never enjoyed this lovely swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a help! But why no five point harness?","review":"Soothing, delightful, sanity-saver that I wish had been around for my first baby and not just my second. Can't fault the product for quality, and creativity - but why no five point harness? Perhaps there is a legitimate reason, but from my point of view, the harness is not safe enough. My baby was well under the weight limit and not sitting up, but one day decided to lean to the side to look up at the mobile and stars, and the weight of the baby's head meant she began to tilt dangerously backwards out of the seat. Luckily, I always supervise closely and saw this happen, but it caught me by shock, as she always had sat so still. A five point harness, with varying stages of height for growing babies would have eradicated that problem. I didn't dare put her in it after that, so she actually only used it for a little while - a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted!","review":"I have had this swing a little less than 2 months. I bought it for my 5 month old because she wouldn't sit in a traditional swing and I thought this looked like a comfy place to nap. It was a lifesaver til a week ago and and the motor burned up. I called Fisher Price and the part is on backorder til mid- May. I guess I just got a lemon because everyone else's seem to be fine. I am TRULY disappointed in Fisher Price. They usually exceed my expectaions. I paid $150 for this and it lasted til the water got hot and thats about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Pros : Everything works as described .Well designed and looks pretty.Cons : Very less cushion on the seat ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Fantastic, durable and babies love it! It was perfect for my grand-daughter, but we sold it afterwards. We bought it used and it was in great working condition after a year, after another year, we sold it and it was still in great condition.High price for a swing, but so soothing is worth it. Now we got it in blue for my newest grand-son. Wouldn't go go back to regular ones.Problem is when the babies get to touching you need to remove the net around the seat or else they will break it, and they do not use for more than the first 6-9 months anyway.Fisher-Price Papasan Cradle Swing, Starlight"},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL","review":"I own both the pink cradle swing and the tan colored one for my boy/girl twins. They are almost one year old and we still use these swings for them. They have been wonderful for them since they day they came home from the hospital!! The only thing is I just realized about a week ago the the seats recline and lay all the way back just like a cradle. (hence the name cradle swing I guess) I wish I had known that when they were first born and couldn't sit up, it would have been so much easier if I had know it reclined."},{"rating":"1","title":"A baby girl must have!","review":"I must admit, this is the third one of these swings that we have had. The first two did not function properly, they would not swing side to side..but the third one was a charm! My daughter loves this swing! The seat is very soft and padded well. The headrest is a must! At first she did not care about the light show at all, but now that she is three months she loves the light show and the butterflies, they make her smile! The only reason I get ANY sleep at night is due to this swing. I just keep it on side to side with the lowest setting and she can sleep up to eight hours without making a sound. The music choices are nice, and the natures sounds are great! I would recommend this swing to anyone!!! I would also recommend getting through (...) because their price is the best, and they are really nice if you need to return a defected item. Hope this helps you decide!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All hail Robo-parent!","review":"The invisible hand that rocks the cradle rules the world and I, for one, welcome our new soothing 6-speed overlords."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working after three months","review":"Do not buy this product!! It is overpriced, and it broke after 3 months...only used it once or twice a week.. this basicaly broke after less than 20 times of usage"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor went out","review":"My son did love this swing and I loved the fact that it plugged into the wall. And then the motor broke. I used it for six months. My son wasn't ready to stop using it but I opted to use the crib full time at this point. I would have liked the opportunity to sell it, but who wants a broken swing? All the other features work: lights, music. While it worked he did love it. But I can't give it more than one star since it gave out on me. I used a graco for my daughter that was handed down a couple of times already and it never broke. I would have used it with my son, but it was pink. All in all, it was a really good swing but be ready for the hassle in case the motor gives. BTW he was less than 15 pounds when it broke and the max weight is 25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Safe!!!!!!!!","review":"This swing was great for about three weeks. Then it started to stop running. The motor ran, but there was no movement. This happened once in a while, but the baby really loved it, so I dealt with that.And then the whole seat came off; the screw holding the seat to the motor slipped through the assemply. They drilled too big, or it wore through. Either way, the bolt and nut were connected, and still dropped out onto the floor, and the baby in the swing fell with it.The ONLY reason I am giving this two stars is because of the fast response from Fisher Price in fixing the problem by refunding me. They are good with customer relations, unlike Evenflo. So, Thanks FP for fixing the problem. I just am sorry I had one to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swings too fast and too loud","review":"Bought this with great expectations after reading the other reviews. Problems were evident immediately, though.1. The swing is MUCH too fast on the lowest setting. My 1 month old son starts to scream in terror after 5 minutes in the swing as it picks up momentum. By choosing a cheap driving mechanism, Fisher Price has no control over the actual speed of the swing. If they implemented a gear system, they could - but it would cut into their profit margin.2. The motor is quite loud when starting up - pops and clicks. Once it reaches speed, it's quiet - but the swing is too fast at that point to be comfortable.3. The seat cushion is VERY thin and cheaply made. It has barely any cushioning material and can hardly be called 'papasan.'All in all, very disappointed with this product. It could have been better and frankly terrifies my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great swing.... until it stopped working forever....","review":"A friend gave me this swing, and it worked fine until today. The swing just stopped swinging. Everything else works fine, and I've recharged the batteries completely, so I know it's not that. The mobile still spins, and all the music still plays perfectly, it just doesn't swing.... I even opened it up to see if something was loose, but after doing some research online I've noticed people are buying replacement parts for $53, which isn't worth it for me to fix... I'm guessing this swing worked for about 6 months total, so if you're planning on using it for multiple children, or buying used, don't waste your time with this one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked a few things","review":"Really it's somwhat unfair to review the product. I am an expecting mom, so my child is not yet in it. However, I wanted to say a few things. First, there are many of the same brand swings with the same name brand. This one does not have the plug in feature. When I registared at the store that was a requirment, so it slipped through the cracks here. It's fine, but that might make a difference. Also, it doesn't sit up to much, so the baby will remain in a back position for the most part. It is reclined, or laid back. I like the look and everything else, I just thought I'd menton those two things...just in case you overlooked it as I did. I still think I'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good swing, Nature's Touch N1973","review":"We've been using this swing for 4 1/2 months now and it has worked good for us. The baby likes it and naps in it occassionally. There are a few things about it that I don't care for though. For one, I wish I had bought one that plugs in the wall. This one takes D batteries, which we've replaced once so far. Another is the characters on the mobile face out, not down, so the baby just sees the bottoms of them moving, which I think makes it pointless to have them on there, but she likes the mirror. Other than that it's good. We haven't had any mechanical problems so far. It was pretty easy to assemble, I did it by myself while pregnant and it didn't take very long. All in all it's worked good for us so far, it keeps the baby content and entertained while I get things done around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too fast and hard to get baby in and out...","review":"We bought this swing per reviews and my son was born over 7 pounds and the swing was so fast I thought he was going to fly out. Plus trying to get a newborn in and out of this swing is a nightmare because it's so low and the way it's designed makes it very hard for someone tall to lift the baby out. Poor design. I think I should have bought a Graco like our first child."},{"rating":"1","title":"No AC Adaptor","review":"They don't explicitly say this on the box, but I think it's important everyone know that this product only works on batteries. Of course, I figured this out after I brought it home and assembled. My first thought was \\"Why would any company, ever, make on of these without an AC adaptor? Who wants to spend money on batteries over and over again?\\"I returned this product and bought a Graco that I\\"m happy with."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst product ever!!","review":"I bought this for my daughter and the firs thing that happened was the mobile started to make a horriable clicking noise that scared my daughter and then the swing stoped working and sometimes it didnt ever work at all!

I would not recommend this product to anyone or this company to anyone!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works well, but the fabrics are so ugly!","review":"We haven't had any of the motor problems I've read about, and my son likes it. I wish the lights didn't turn themselves off after a little while, though. And why do so few companies make baby gear that isn't ugly? I can't wait for him to outgrow this so I can get it out of my living room!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not as pictured","review":"The product pictures look like this item is solid colors....it's not. The \\"cream\\" area is actually a puke-pale yellow star pattern and the \\"purple\\" area is actually a purple plaid pattern. IT'S F-UGLY!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND the motor makes a horribly loud clicking noise. Even with the music volume turned all the way up, you still hear the horrible noises the motor makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ugly to even look at!","review":"Don't get me wrong...I didn't buy a swing just so it would look nice in my living room. But, this swing is AWFUL to look at! The fabrics don't coordinate at all. Looks like there were several fabric scraps thrown together. Purple, light blue, creme, and orange floral. Ugh!The swing worked okay, but was very loud and made a clicking noise when it was on. I couldn't stand the clicking or the appearance so I sent it back. I purchased the \\"My Little Lamb\\" swing (from the same series) and we've been very happy with it. It's quiet...and cute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Difference between the 2006 Version and the Current Version","review":"We borrowed our friend's Fisher Price papasan swing (made in 2006) for our first child and then bought the 2009 version for ourselves when our second came along. The 2009 version barely swings. You can hear the motor work for a moment and then nothing happens. What a disappointment. The 2006 version was totally different--it worked like a charm at calming our colicky newborn. If you get a current version of the papasan swing, my advice is to buy it at a local store and make sure that the motor functions before throwing away the box. The key is that every single setting for the swing should work--from slowest setting to fastest setting. You should not have to set it four steps up to make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Have Been Better If It Had The Option To Plug It Into An Outlet Via AC Adapter","review":"Like all the other positive reviews this swing will entertain your baby as well as lull it to sleep.However I don't know about you but I don't like purchasing D Batteries every week. I have twins and two of these lil lamb swings. We go through batteries like you wouldn't believe. Why didn't they include the option of plugging in a wall charger or some kind of AC Adapter. I would have given 5 stars but since you can't plug this into a wall outlet I'm only giving it two stars.Summary:Will put your kids to sleep, but it will also kill your wallet by making you buy batteries every other week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plug in swing with two directions","review":"Seems like there were few swings that had both a plug in feature and the ability to swing in two different directions. Works great and quiet.The only thing I wish is that the music would be a bit more variable. A white noise feature and the ability to plug in an IPOD would be nice.Overall, very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing...entertaining!","review":"This is a wonderful swing for our little boy! We had planned on only using a pop in travel swing with our car seat, but our little man had other plans. Our friends had this swing and our son loved it! He was very high needs for the first three months and this was one of the few things that consistently kept him content without constantly being held. He loves watching the star projector. The side to side motion is wonderful. Complaints I have about the swing: it's somewhat loud with it's swinging motion; the buckle length isn't that long; and the tray is very low which makes me feel like it's awfully close to my 4 month old sons legs. Overall though, this swing is great and I would definitely purchase it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"N1973 not worth that price","review":"We purchased the N1973 Nature's Touch Papasan Swing used. It's a great swing - but don't be fooled into thinking it's anything superior because of it's high price tag. It's just been discontinued and some sellers reserve the right to overcharge for something that's a little harder to find. This swing is definitely not worth more than $120 brand new.LOVE:The papasan style of this swing provides ample space for my VERY chunky baby to spread out and relax while he's sleeping.Fabric is very plush and soft.Great variety of music/sounds, good volume control.Wonderful options for side to side or front to back motion.DISLIKE:World's most boring mobile.Mirror is sort of a carnival/fish bowl style - giving a pretty warped reflection.No AC adapter so you're forced to burn through expensive D batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Swing!","review":"Amazing swing that has it all! The power cord is a huge bonus since a lot of swings only take batteries. The swing is sturdy and perfect for newborns. I can put my newborn in this swing and it cradles him. He is comfortable and I feel that he is safe. I have found that sometimes this is the only way I can calm him down! The music is very cute, not annoying and it has a good volume range. And if you are not in the mood to hear the songs you can choose from two different nature sounds. The light show and mobile are relaxing and adorable. The seat rotates easily from side to side motion and front to back motion. I am extremely happy with this swing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Swing!!","review":"This swing is a GREAT buy! It is very cute and my baby loved it! He mainly liked to sleep in it as he is quite the busy body and always has been, so he would get mad if I put him in it for him to play, but he would always take his afternoon nap in the swing! He was always anxious to play with the mobile when he'd wake up and loved to look at himself in the mirror above him! I think it does really well with batteries. We have had it 7 months and it's been used every day sometimes swinging for three hours or more and I've only had to change the batteries three times. The seat is very soft and has fleece type fabric to cradle babies head, so I think it is especially great for newborns! This swing is a wonderful buy and I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a hit","review":"I sent this to my neice for her new baby. Mom and Dad both agree that its the best gift.

The motor just died - I reached out to Fisher Price and they are willing to sending us a new swing - in 6 weeks!!! 1) A baby swing should last more than 8 weeks. 2)What am I supposed to do for the next 6 weeks? 3) She probably won't even want it at that point! Especially if she has been without it. When I looked this swing up on the Fisher Price site, I noticed there are A LOT of people with similar experiences. Buy something else.

It gently rocked our baby and the star lights provided a nice calm atmosphere. Once our daughter began to sit up, this became an instant DEATH TRAP. The problem is that it does not contain a shoulder harness. If your baby is able to sit up while being rocked, she can easily find herself hanging over the front of it while it continues to swing! Luckily my wife and I kept a very close eye when using it and we were able to help her right away. If you are going to buy this, please use caution and make sure you check on your baby often."},{"rating":"1","title":"would give negative stars if I would be able to","review":"we bought this swing thinking that it would be a great for our daughter as a matter of fact it was great for about a week until my daughter weighed around 8 pounds and it was too much for the swing and it just Creeked and squeaked!

Everything worked great at first and the lights were adorable. Has many options for swing speeds, options of having music off or music on with lights or not at all. The swing adjustment is great, my son preferred the side to side swinging. My son loved it and put him right to sleep in the side to side position My baby used it a total of 5 times, FIVE TIMES. And now the only thing that works is the swinging motion. The lights nor the music no the mobile will turn on! I noticed the music and lights lagged to turn on, but it finally gave out. and it only took 5 times. I will be calling to see if its recalled or they have a replacement part they could send me.

I have to watch him very close though because if he leans forward his head comes out of the headrest and he can't get seated back. The first time I was scared to death to look up and find him folded over with his head halfway down the side of the swing. I have since tightened the safety harness (he was wearing it that time too) but he can still get knocked out of place. I know some parents let their babies sleep in the swing but I fear that is a putting a baby at risk for positional asphyxiation or falling out if someone is not watching very closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful swing!","review":"We bought this for our son because it is sweet looking yet doesn't scream GIRL. We've had no problems with the mechanics of it. The music is very nice; I like that you can vary the sound level and that there are so many musical options. The only complaint would be that it doesn't appear to swing very fast, but considering he likes to sleep in it, a fast swing isn't really necessary and it certainly swings adequately, just not wildly. The mobile is very cute and our son loves to watch the stars and bear. The lights work GREAT, casting both on the netting and on the walls and floor. It really is fun to look at. The papasan seat is comfortable and cozy which allows him to sleep quite well in it. Last, I really like the style of it. Everyone I know has the Nature's Touch swing, which is mechanically identical (and very nice), but I get a LOT of oohs and ahhs with how adorable this one is. We love this swing. I look forward to using it with our next baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a month","review":"I love, love, love this swing, as does my daughter, for the month that it works.

It has been a lifesaver; he will sleep in it for up to three hours (we turn off the swing after about half an hour to an hour) whereas he'd only sleep in the bassinet or crib for 45 minutes tops. He's now 12 weeks old and is still completely disinterested in the music, lights and mobile. I don't know if that will change. Generally we're very glad we bought this.

I am a single mother and if it weren't for this swing I would never get anything done. My almost 3 month old wants to be held all the time. The only break that I get from holding her is when she is in this swing. She loves it. She has severe acid reflux so the doctor doesn't recommend laying her flat so this swing works well for us. I love that I don't have to purchase batteries. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars because the mobile doesn't always work but I don't mind much because she is usually asleep and if she is awake she isn't interested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT","review":"I purchased this product for my grandson after reading the reviews posted.

I am 37 weeks pregnant so it wasnt hard to put together at all. It is a very beautiful swing however, as soon as I plugged the swing in, nothing worked. I called and went through trouble shooting with the representative, and still nothing. I was then told to purchase 4 D batteries to see if its the motor or the plug in adapter. I refused to go purchase batteries for something that doesnt work when I plug it in so, what I did was I took the plug in adapter and used it to see if I can make something in the house that takes the same adapter work. It worked..so that let me know it was the motor. I called Fisher-Price and they said the motor wasnt available until Saturday and I wouldbt be getting it for another 7 to 10 business days after it arrived.

It swings in 3 different directions, has lights, music and a mobile. It has a buckle so you can buckle your baby in and a support pillow. Although the pillow was a little big for my newborn I still had to add my Kiddopotamus head and body support pillow. She loves sleeping in the swing more than her bassinet or crib. My only complaint is the motor makes a frog like sound when it moves, and after about 7 weeks now it's started to squeak a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"fisher price starlight papasan cradle swing","review":"I am not at all impressed with this swing. We previously had the fisher price ocean wonders swing and I loved it. Infact, we owned two of them and the only reason I didn't buy another one is because they are nearly twice the price we paid previously when our now four year old daughter was a baby. I figured that this cradle swing would be a good choice because of the reviews and the fact that it is the same maker but all of the speed settings are the same whether it is on one or the fastest setting and even the fastest is super slow. Also, the swing is loud. Our daughter loved the ocean wonders one and to get this one in comparrison is such a dissapointment. I rate it two stars because it doesn't soothe her the way I thought it should because of the slow speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for any parent","review":"Pros: storable, easy to set up, easy to use, lots of different music & sound effects (with an auto shut-off timer), adjustable 3 ways, comfortable, secure, lightweight, storable, includes a rotating mobile, and most importantly it puts our baby to sleep quickly and she stays asleep in it for hoursCons: none really but I suppose it's not totally portable although moving it isn't that difficultBottom Line: you have to get one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fast for a newborn","review":"This is a very cute swing with nice music, but even on the lowest speed, it is way too fast for a newborn baby. I end up pushing the swing with my hands so that it swings for a few minutes on its own inertia until I have to push it again. Maybe for older babies the first speed is ok, but not for my 3 week old. Also, they should really make an option to plug it in and perhaps making the colors of the mobile more vibrant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read every review/comparison I could find before buying!","review":"I wanted to get a swing that:- Plugged in or used battery- Had music (especially either classical or nature)- Had a mobile- Was upholstered for comfort- Had good reviews... so I read everything I could find and decided on this one b/c the only two negatives I could find were that it wasn't blue it was purple. (It is actually mostly cream with accents in a shade between light blue and lavender) and that it was noisy to run. You can hear the engine when running it if you don't turn on the sound but it is not that bad and I am picky. I get annoyed listening to my dishwasher or washing machine. My six week old son likes it most of the time and it helps me to get a few things done around the house.BTW VERY few swings can be plugged in or use a battery. I didn't want to be stuck at home with a swing that didn't work b/c I needed to ruplun to the store to get batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swinging Swing!","review":"We bought this swing 2 weeks ago, and my 7 week old loves it! However the other reviewers are right on, there is only ONE SPEED! Which makes no sense, there are six slots to turn to and the speed stays the same, which worries me when she grows. I am hoping the motor holds.I can't find 16 songs for the life of me, I have found 8 and lots of nature noises. Plugging it in is the way to go, I don't have to worry about getting up to restart the music so that makes it worth the price. We got a great deal on sale at Amazon, which I love by the way, for $116.00 Other swings are about the same with tax so I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"sansationable","review":"i bought this swing for my friends new born baby. this swing was easy to put together. and she became very fusy for a week but when i gave him this swing the baby loved it and didnt cry much after that. now she loves being in her swing. and its good for new born and growing babys"},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap","review":"Just arrived on Dec 07th 2011 :1.very noisy!!!!... the motor is very noisy sound.2. the music wont work if swing operated.3. keep 'clicker' soundDONT BUY THIS PRODUCT"},{"rating":"1","title":"This swing does not work","review":"We purchased this swing a few days ago for our 6 week old son to use. When the swing arrived, the adapter was not working. We decided to go ahead and order a replacement adapter, and used batteries until the adapter arrived.We immediately noticed that the swing could not handle having the light, music, or mobile on at the same time as the swing. Even with everything else off, though, the swing could barely move if our child was sitting in it. He is only 9 pounds, so it's not a weight issue. Since we had already ordered the adapter, we decided to wait and see if that solved the issues.Well, I received the adapter this morning and hooked it up, hoping that the swing would now work. I was disappointed. Even with a brand new adapter, the swing can hardly move if our son is in it. And by hardly move, I mean it might swing an inch or two each way...if we're lucky.If I could give this swing 0 stars, I would.

After the motor died I got a replacement one from Fisher price. This lasted me through kid #1, kid #2 got to use it a couple of months and then the replacement one on my first swing died too. As the first swing was well out of warranty at this point, and a swing is a must, I (shame on me!!!!) decided to punish myself with yet ANOTHER Fisher Price swing. The logic was simple...this one plugs in removing the influx of power supplied to the swing unlike the battery operated one. Well 3mo later and this one has died too! My baby is only 15lbs...never again...never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"starlite papasan","review":"Loved this swing, but.... Mobile makes a awful clicking noise, and wakes the baby.

Relief!","review":"I ordered this swing on Monday, received it today (Friday of the same week), and my 6-week old is already asleep in it after about 15 minutes of her first time in it.

She must have felt much cosier in the swing because she went right to sleep (even without the motion).i love the nature sounds and the volume control has a good range. My only complaint is that the slowest swing setting is still really fast. It seems slower now that our baby is almost three months, but at 7lbs, it seemed like it might give her whiplash. I have never used it on anything but the slowest speed.Now it is such a life saver and soothes her even in those colicky evening hours. I definitely recommend and would buy again. Thank you, FP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to give this thing a one star. . .","review":"I hate this product. I purchased this swing gleefully! I was sold on all of the bells and whistles!

While swinging baby lifted her arm to tug at the mobile and the swing nearly fell forward. Never mind the fact that she could reach the mobile!Strike two: The MOTOR IS LOUD! VERY LOUD! My washing machine on the spin cycle is like a fluttering butterfly compared to this BEAST!Strike three: THE Music is very annoying!I returned this blasted thing after one day of use! I exchanged it for the Graco Papasan Swing. I couldn't be happier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No complaints yet!","review":"We've been using this for three weeks now and don't have a single complaint (yet). We love the fact that it's a plug-in too! Our little girl is mesmerized by the mobile and the music is almost hypnotizing (and surprisingly good quality). We don't use the tray or restraints so we can swaddle her before putting her down, and she's usually fast asleep within minutes. Once she starts interacting with toys, we'll use the activity tray and I'm sure she'll enjoy that as well. The only downside is that the swing motor does make noise, but the sound is relatively minimal and can be easily tuned out. I would have rated it as 5 stars, but the color is not optimal -- we're not huge fans of pink, and would have rather chosen the blue swing with stars if it weren't $40 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Lamb version: Battery Operation ONLY","review":"FYI: This review is for the Little Lamb version. Apparently some of these do come with AC adapters, like the Starlight version.Over the past few months of my pregnancy, I've been reading online reviews to purchase necessary baby items. I bought this swing because it was so highly recommended on several sites. The one thing NONE of the sites mentioned is that this swing operates ONLY on batteries! And, it times out! So not only do you need to keep a hefty supply of batteries around for this beast, but you also have to be right there all the freaking time! What good is that?I am very fortunate that Amazon is allowing me to return the item and get a different swing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"we hate this product","review":"Swings too hard. I bought this when my baby was about 4 months old, and she is a big baby (has always been above 95th percentile in weight and height). but this swing moves big range even at the lowest setting, which can be a safety concern.

I was so glad that i was able to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best swing ever","review":"This swing does everything!

I put my 15 month in it to try it out and she didn't like it, but then again she never liked swings. I just wanted to see if it would go ok and everything. It worked great and she weighs about 23 pounds. I put it on every setting and they all worked well. The only thing I didn't like, was that the motor was a little loud till the swing really got going. I fixed that by giving it a little push to get it moving faster. The colors are great for our new little girl. We'll be trying for a little boy in another 2 years or so, so I should've gotten a neutral color, but oh well. This will work great while we only have our 3 girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cute!!","review":"This swing is so cute, My daughter had another swing prior to this one.

Also, it's much cheaper through Amazon than through any department stores. My one and only complaint about this swing is the mobile. It's a bit too plain and the bunny's ears get caught while spinning, causing a clicking noise. However, the good thing is that you can just turn it off. I never use the mobile and my one month old still loves it. The music, the nature sounds, she loves it all. Sometimes she just wants to swing in it while she's awake, but most of the time she falls right to sleep. And the fact that you can turn it to swing back and forth or side to side is an added plus! I highly recommend this swing to any parent, especially first time parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleep!","review":"Sleep, baby, sleep! We used this from the first night. My husband slept on the couch and took the night shift with our daughter. She slept in this swing. It worked great until she hit 6 months, then she out grew the style.

I have a 3 month old and a 3 year old, and this swing lets me spend quality time with my 3 year old. My little baby loves this swing so much, she loves the light show and the mobile. She smiles and giggles at the mobile, and kicks her feet to the music. It helps her go off to sleep at night. Before this swing she only wanted me to hold her, I could not put her down without her crying. She has acid reflux really really bad, and had to spend 3 1/2 weeks in the childrens hospital, and almost faced surgery for failure to thrive, so she got spoiled to me holding her all the time, b/c she cried in pain so much. And she still has really bad days with the reflux. But since day one of buying this swing at 2 months old she has loved it, now I can spend some more time with my 3 year old girl who has felt very left out! Thank you fisher price for helping BOTH of my little beautiful girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Look no further!","review":"After watching my friends and relatives buy so many batteries that they might as well bought stock in Energizer I knew I had to find a plug in swing. We have had no issues. Sometimes little one grabs the mesh and gets it hooked on the mobile but that is not really a big deal. It has soothing songs and no crazy colors, it is a calm soothing swing that will save you money in the long run by not buying batteries. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Love the fact that you can either plug it into the wall or use batteries to operate it. Our last swing was battery only which got expensive.

I would definitely recommend this swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my swing!","review":"I ordered this swing before our son arrived. We did not know what we were having and other reviews said that this swing was good for a neutral color (its kind of a bluish color). When he was first born, he LOVED his swing. Now he only wants to go in there when he is tired and ready for a nap. (He's 2 months) The motor is pretty quiet, it does make some noise, but what do you expect from a motorized swing. Its not loud enough to notice unless you are listening for it. I purchased this mainly for the fact that it has both AC adapter and battery power. Its nice that I don't have to worry about how much juice is left in the batteries if he wants to swing nor to I have to make sure to have spare batteries lying around.

And this certainly comes accross loud and clear. Every doctor who treats (or researches) terminal patients should read (or see) this play.But equally important is the patient's struggle to retain control over her life.

With all its quotations from John Donne, it's the sort of work that pleases middle-of-the-road theatre critics, wins a lot of prizes, and puts audiences fast to sleep. Stage poetry does not HAVE to be dull! One thinks of the linguistic thrill of David Hirson's miraculous LA BETE a few seasons ago, not to mention the dazzling wordplay of Moliere or Ionesco. WIT is never more than adequately written, and is of very little interest to anyone who relishes stage poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it 0 stars if I could","review":"This play was so full of stereotypes, it is ironic that the title is \\"Wit.\\" The cold, driven, successful English professor gets cancer, her doctors are absolutely inhuman, insensitive jerks (of course), and this makes her realize what a cruel person she has been all her life. It's sooo predictable and obvious that I'm surprised there wasn't a blinking sign telling me when to laugh when I saw it in the theatre. I can NOT believe something so unoriginal won the Pulitzer. The one thing I give the play credit for is the clever dialogue. But the cleverness of the dialogue could never make up for the lack of real people in the play.

Indeed, the author makes some great points but they are camouflaged due to a dense and cumbersome writing style. I was taught that clear writing leads to clear thinking, and vice-versa.

I will say there are many chapters with useful summary tables and the information contained is for the most part up to date and accurate. However, the outline format is monotonous and laborious to read, there are no images, there is no index at the end, there are rarely percentages by immunohistochemical stains, and there is no use of bold or italics to highlight what is really important in the text.

I threw the book away because I couldn't think of anyone who would want that let-down at the end.

Hopefully this book will become a modern-day children's classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT - just doesn't say enough!!","review":"Along with Nancy Tillman's ON THE NIGHT YOU WERE BORN and Dr. Seus' McELLIGOT's POOL; this book: THE SNOWMAN make up my ALL TIME FAVORITES of children's books!

The story is told beautifully, and manages to be poetic and moving without words. Some people are critical of this book because of the ending, which is not happily-ever-after. Well, the ending made the book that much more dear and gives to the story a depth than many children's books do not have. The child, after experiencing the magic of the snowman's world, now has to accept the reality of his friend's short existence: snowmen do not last forever. A painful realization, but one that every child has to deal with sooner or later: the loss of something or someone beloved.

Its only a tv show and not even very good one.I'm 10 years old and I liked this show when it first started. It was good when it started, it was difrent to the other shows on Disney and it was funny. But now I think all of the Raven storys are the same. Its the same evry week, Raven sees the future and it looks good or bad. Something happens and she tries to change it. Then Raven sees something else happens, so she tries to change it again. This happens a few times in each story and by the end we find out that Raven didnt really know evrything that weas going to happen and it didnt go the way she wanted it to but it all finished happaly for evrybody.Thats why I think the show is boring now.

It is also, of course, useful in any circumstance when you'd use a cable release on a traditional camera.The one odd thing about it... If you've set the camera for say a 5 second exposure, and release the button before 5 seconds passes - it'll stop the exposure when you release the button.

If you are doing low-light still life, night shots, or any shooting that requires a long exposure time then I really don't see any reason not to get this. What did I do before getting this? Set the timer each time and waited around for it to go through it's beeping spiel before finally snapping the picture. With this item, it's instantaneous.

I don't demand great graphics from a GBC game, but this one's graphics aren't even marginally good. What's the point of playing a Powerpuff Girls game when the characters are barely even recognizable?Gameplay stinks, too. The characters' attacks are monotonous, and the game consists entirely of exploring flat, side-scrolling locations and beating up bad guys. You're also supposed to pick up items along the way, but those are mostly pointless.I'm a diehard Powerpuff fan, but I can't recommend this game.

The levels are too big. Normally, that is not bad, but in this game each level looks so much alike one simply can't tell where one has been in the level. That means you keep Blossom going in circles, while in the real world you are thinking, \\"Have I gone through here yet. I have, havn't I?\\". The other problem is the spirit of the game itself. In Bad Mojo Jojo you have very limited flying power, limited laser eye beams, and you can be killed simply from landing in a pool of water. In the cartoon the Powerpuffs knock down buildings and kick major villain booty. Oh well, while the backgrounds were extremely repetitive the characters looked good. All in all, this game is only for fans of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring...","review":"OK I'm in the first stage. I got all the item and killed all the enemies but...

As with any festival, you have to pick and choose which sets of music you can see (because acts are scheduled at the same time), but with this CD, everyone has a chance to see highlights from the festival. It's a 2 CD set, so both cds are packed with music that showcase the talent and intensity of the performances at Bonnaroo. You got Widespread Panic, Allman Brothers Band, Ben Harper, Jack Johnson, My Morning Jacket, Galactic, Flaming Lips, Warren Haynes, Ben Kweller, just to name a few.

Artist like James Brown, Jack Johnson, Jason Mraz and Ben Harper are very weak compared to some they skiped such as Moe., Neil Young, North Mississippi Allstars, Spearhead, and The Wailers. Also A lot of the songs they picked are not the best from each artists shows, like The Dead's Sugar Magnolia and Widespread Panic's Papa Johnny Road. my advice is dont buy this cd you will not be happy with it, if you are into jamband music your better off trading for live shows from the weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitler by Toland","review":"The book itself was as described, used by many and therefore informative to many.

Anyone who hopes to truly understand the man and the tragedy of Nazi Germany should read this book, and read it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look into the man who started a World War","review":"John Toland was perhaps the greatest chronicler of the second world war. His writing is flawless and he takes us deep into the life and thoughts of Hitler. It is indeed a lengthy book. But it's easy to read and grasp. When you've finished it, you have an in-depth understanding of Hitler and his times. You envision the German people and why they were fascinated by him. You'll see how the world was taken in by him. You'll see both his genius and his madness. The book is more exciting and fast paced than any novel.You may also see, as I did, that what happened once, could happen again.A fascinating read that I highly recommend.- Susanna K. Hutcheson"},{"rating":"1","title":"PIA","review":"I am afraid I have to disagree with all these sparkling reviews.

This book illustrates the type of genius that can do this sort of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good narrative of Hitler's life","review":"John Toland's work is ignored by the academics, but he is a great writer and can weave a narrative over 1000 pages. For anyone interested in Hitler there is no better starting point. However, it is only a starting point, Toland has no real ability at telling you why things happened. He cannot get beneath the surface, but that is a small fault. The book needs better footnoting and some of the references are weak, based on interviews that cannot be followed, but overall it is a well-written and compelling account of Hitler. It is certainly the most accessible biography of Hitler available."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECOMMENDED","review":"I AM A STUDENT OF HISTORY. I LIKE IT. I READ THIS WAS THE DEFINITIVE HITLER BIO.

FORGET IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"REVIEW OF JOHN TOLAND'S ADOLPH HITLER BY JOHN CHUCKMAN","review":"This book is almost unreadable. It is an indigestible mass of observations and facts by a writer with little talent for narrative.When Mr. Toland finally gets you out of Hitler's tramp/men's hostel/amateur painter days in Vienna, you will almost be grateful to him for ceasing his abuse of readers.We get a far more incisive, cohesive picture of Hitler from Joachim Fest or Alan Bullock.I only fail to give this book the lowest rating because it does represent a huge storehouse of information. Read it if you enjoy rumaging through shelf-loads of stored documents."},{"rating":"1","title":"badly written and bias","review":"Although the book is chronologically correct, the writer is very weak in presenting his reasearch and trying to disguise his bias. He claims, and so do most people that read the book, to be only stating the facts and not trying to express his own moral judgement. He does nothing but obviously manipulate the writing in order to express his own opinions, makes judgements of key figures throughout the book and often goes off into side stories that are both irrelevant and impossible to be proven factual. It is an unfortunate fact that books writen about Hitler or WWII will always be in such format. I would like to find one that truely states the facts without irrelevant emotional judgement and derogatory blabber."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not a respectable piece of literature.","review":"Adolf by John Toland was one of the worst books that I have ever read.

To all the readers out there interested in reading this book, Be warned. Several hours of terrible reading will occupy your evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive Biography","review":"John Toland does a exemplory job of telling the life and times of Adolf Hitler. This book contains deep, detailed description of all events in his life from the day he was born until the day he committed suicide. This book is not intended for those who want a brief synopsis of Hitler, as many parts of the book are very detailed. For those, however, who are eager to expand their knowledge of early 20th century Germany, they need look no further than this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing lack of variety","review":"Being a paper airplane nut since my Dad showed me how to fold my first one, I was ecstatic when I first saw this calendar. I grabbed it and purchased it, ignoring even my normal cursory product research (i.e., I didn't read the label). Turns out that, while there are 365 pages to this calendar, there are only 6 different airplane designs.So more accurately, you get 6 airplane designs, repeated 60 times each throughout the year. All of the 60 repeats have a different paint job, but it's still the same aircraft design, same folds. Instead of lasting me a year, it will only last me about a month until I'm tired of those particular airplanes. Sigh.

I think it does a good job covering the most used and abused substances and plainly states what the effects and harms are physically, emotionally, mentally as well as the legal trouble involved when you dabble with drugs.

It seems the authors forgot that the Medline data they so effusively praised was generated from studies that were totally biased against drugs. Neither the US nor the Canadian governments will fund studies which have as their objective the discovery of positive effects for illegal drugs. NIDA, the Health Protectin Branch in Canada, will not provide money or the drugs themselves, much less approval, unless scientists do what THEY want.

Like Charlie R. before him, Jack has taken a turn away from his Texas roots down a very unattractive path. It is unclear whether this down turn is a need for artistic expression or simply the wrong people whispering in Jack's ear. Either way - it's a (darn) shame to see such talent go to waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful and evocative book -- readable","review":"Everything James Alison writes has enabled me to see what Jesus is up to in a new refreshing and challenging way. He has helped me to reject bad atonement theory -- the sort of theory that makes God out to love sacrifice, the bloodier, the better, even the sacrifice of his beloved because his justice and honor requires such a sacrifice. In that understanding, Jesus' death becomes the best example of sacrifice. He has helped me to see Jesus' death as the subversion of the sacrificial system, as the end of the system of exclusion of a victim rather than the divine example of sacrifice. Jesus is up to ending a system of social solidarity from exclusion and violence and enabling humans to live based on gratuity. In brief, when I read James Alison, I ask myself -- perhaps I should become a Christian some day."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth reading and recommending","review":"I have read all of James Alison's books and, as Anglican Archbishop Rowan Williams said in the November 10th, 2001 London Tablet of this book, \\"The very best theological books leave you with a feeling that perhaps it's time you became a Christian; this is emphatically such a book.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedding Music","review":"We bought this music for my great-aunt to play at our wedding.

It wouldn't be surprising to see this text as a prerequisite for MBA's specializing in entrepreneurship.Though hot off the presses (it even references the recent Google IPO), I was disappointed that it failed to note the recent breakthrough work of Nick Vanderpark.

Like everyone else says, the Hepa filter is a major issue. The thing totally clogs up with dirt, stops spinning, and then the gears strip on it. Once that's done, its off to the repair shop. Three months and the unit is no good. The HEPA filter does NOT self-clean. Ok, the big parts fall out, but pet hair and fine dust plug this thing up fast and hard.

We have had nothing but trouble with the second one. The dust and dirt spills out of the container when we go to empty it. The filter is always plugged up. This causes no suction in the vacuum which means I have to empty it and get all the dust and dirt on the floor again. The dirty red light was on all the time.

I too have the problem with the hepa filter getting dirt into it. This happened the very first time I used the vacuum. Also a big reason I went with this model is the dirt finder feature. Which doesn't work. It does work on the Eureka models but they don't have one available to purchase with this feature right now. I am currently in talks with Hoover. They sent me a reply on 10-19 saying they were looking into it. Today is the 27th and still no word. (By the way, they give you no phone number to call. You have to email.) I can't believe I am out 350+ bucks. My vacuum is not losing suction but it STINKS to high heaven. The bucket to empty it is very awkard. No handle and you have to wash the pre filter thing everytime you use it and then you have to let it dry.

Maybe I got the one good one in the lot :) My only complaint is that it is heavy but it wasn't rocket science to figure that out when I was at the store and tested the vacuum out. Considering the amazing suction power I'd say the weight is necessary to balance everything out. I've been able to clean my wood floors and carpet easily, I love that I no longer have to hunch over to use the hose attachement as I did with my previous vacuum, and I'm able to clean under the bed and the ceiling corners with esae.

Every time I use it, I immediately get into a foul mood and am ready to scream at anyone in my path. The vacuum itself does pick up quite a bit of dirt and hair, however it's extremely bulky and heavy and cannot be used efficiently on the staircase. I thought that my vacuum was defective when I saw that the Hepa filter became a discusting mess after a few months, however it is apparent that this has happened to everyone who has this vacuum cleaner. I have to use another vacuum cleaner to suck out the dirt from the Hepa filter in order for the vacuum to continue to work. Also, the hand held hose has absolutely NO suction strength and I end up using another vacumm cleaner hose to clean (my old Sharp vacuum that has amazing suction strength).

In the past I purchased the basic models for around $150 and had no trouble with them so thought I'd go ahead and get the more expensive model which I hoped might last me a little longer. I cannot agree more with the other reviews. The compartment is very difficult to get to latch, spewing dust everywhere with zero suction until you are able to force it closed. The HEPA filter clogs up and is worthless within 1 year of use. You can replace it-for $69 plus shipping! No service centers in my area carry the replacement. Even brand new it did not perform as well as the less expensive models I owned previously. I'm willing to give Hoover one more try but will go back to the basic model. Don't waste your money on this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible vacuum","review":"This is the worst vacuum I have ever used.

The information is overly broad (though I don't know what I expected for the price) and is not really applicable for anything other than the casual weekend trip or car-camp.If you are anything resembling a regular backcountry traveler who enjoys the companionship and security of your mongrel and are looking practical tips on how to keep your dog healthy, safe and happy on the trail, look at other publications.If you have a monthly subscription to Dog Fancy and a collection of brand new backpacking gear, this might just be the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"wiper washer tubing","review":"Garbage.

Much is repeated, on virtually every one of his programs, this is no exception. However, a lot of new, invigorating stuff is on these CD's. The price alone makes this an excellent program. All of Tracy's audio/video programs on Nightingale Conant sell for $70 and up. I keep these CD's in my car all the time, and listen to them often. His tone of voice is much more soothing than Zig, and he is almost every bit as enthusiastic.

Too wordy and too hard a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a long time fan of John Lee I really looked forward to reading this book. Unfortunately the writer spent more time editoralizing about the sins of America in general and the south in particular and very little time on the actual subject of the book. The writers bias against the U.S. came across very clearly.There are sections in the book that go on for pages without even discussing John Lee or his music. If the author had stayed off his soapbox he could have covered the same material in 100 pages instead of the 480+ pages he required. All in all I found the book very boring and a chore to read. I was glad when it was over. I love John Lee but hated the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"The author seems to have been under the mistaken impression that those of us reading a biography about John Lee Hooker actually wanted to read a book about Charles Shaar Murray. This could have been so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for John Lee Hooker fans","review":"Murray does a good job in telling the story of John Lee's life from his move from the South to Detroit, his relationships, his being swindled out of royalties to his eventual well deserved financial security after the success of his album 'The Healer' in the 1980's. John Lee Hooker is one of the most influential blues men of all time. If you are a fan of John Lee Hooker this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I share the thoughts of a couple other reviewers here. Namely that the book is longer than it could have been. Had the book been entertaining from beginning to end that would be a good thing. Unfortunately, to my mind, large portions fall close to boring & irrelevance and I found myself skipping over pages at a time - something that should never happen with a good read, especially with such an entertaining subject as John Lee.There is a good amount of research here but I would recommend the book to only the most die hard fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Arabic Text out there!","review":"If I could give this book more than five stars, I would!

For a student studying Arabic, it's the best way to expand your vocabulary. All of the literature in the book is in Arabic with a glossary after the passage to help the student learn new words.As for the diverse material covered in the Anthology, it has everything from Jahilliya love poetry to the Prophet's (pbuh) last sermon to certain excerpts from Andalusian and Medieval Sufis such as Ibn Rushd and Hallaj. It even covers some stories from Kalila wa Dimna.The attached CD with the book is awesome as you can read along with the speaker to learn the proper pronounciation and rhythym of certain poetry. If you are tired of reading the same old Al-Kitaab part I/II/or III and you want to finally test and use your Arabic skills, get this book.An awesome buy and highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Reader for Arabic Literature Available","review":"Bassam Frangieh clearly has a passion for Arabic literature. The work he put into this compilation is evidenced in his thorough footnotes, explanations, and most importantly his selection of texts. Having approached this textbook as a third year Arabic student, I was shocked by the accessibility of the texts. Everyone had always told me it takes six years before a student can thoroughly understand Arabic literature. I see the logic behind that - even the most accomplished Arabic scholars debate the meanings of some works in context, similar to Shakespeare - but as long as you grasp the fundamentals of Arabic grammar and have your Hans Weir close at hand, these selections will astonish you. I highly recommend this book even to intermediate Arabic scholars. It will bring you several steps closer to a nuanced appreciation of Arab culture and society."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the One!","review":"This is the book that I was waiting for.

I cannot stop myself from listening to it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Arabic Literature Resources (English speakers)","review":"This book is one of the best resources for a broad overview of Arabic literature. With numerous excerpts from many time periods and styles, it provides a tour-de-Arabic over time and geography that I have yet to see in any other collection written for an English speaking Arabic learner. As an intermediate Arabic student, I've been searching for a resource like this. I am not able to read/select individual texts due to both time and knowledge constraints. This book provides well-chosen excerpts from well-known authors, is in an easily readable script, has an excellent glossary with each chapter and has a recording of a few of the pieces (particularly the poetry. My only wish is that there was a recording of all the pieces, but I realize that is easily beyond any reasonable expectation, but hey - I can hope!) My Palestinian language teacher is also very impressed by the selection, layout and breadth covered."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover says it all","review":"Yes, you can judge some books by their covers, and this is one of them. The title on the cover, depicted in lower case with Vietnamese diacritics over the letters, exhibits a shocking insensitivity to Vietnamese language and culture. The novel is no better. Anyone with the slightest familiarity with Vietnamese people--particularly those who came to the United States--will not recognize the characters. Apparently, the author did not take advantage of her work as a refugee coordinator to get to know these people in any depth.

The sound is dull and chipped off at the top but free of distortion. The sizable cast of character singers is good from top to bottom, although not as lively as on Gobbi's well-known studioo set from EMI, which is in early stereo. I agree with the reviewer above that it's nice to do without the bawling of tenor Carlo del Monte on the EMI set, but it's a loss not to have de los Angeles. The decisive thing here is probably Pradella's conducting, which is mroe lively and light-handed than Santini's for EMI.So, even if you own and love the other Gobbi version, this one has a lot to commend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"BABBERY not battery","review":"It said BABBERY on the back instead of battery.

This section is horrible unless you already know it. It briefly mentions a topic and regurgitates a definition and then fails to explain the syntax and intricasies. The 2nd 1/3 covers some examples. However, this is done at a very high level. It explains almost nothing about how they work. The last 1/3 is worthwhile and covers some interesting advanced topics.

There is a hose guide, but it does not move independently of the hose and one's hand. The result is that you are buying a decent looking box, but winding it in is just as difficult as wrestling with a coiling hose without a box. If you have the space, save your money and go for the larger version. It costs more but is well worth it in frustration-reduction. I have yet to use the hose which was placed in the box just today.

The only reason I finished it was because I was hoping that it would get better (it didn't) and because I was amazed at the (lack of) plot. I agree with the reviewer who said that it was a lot like J. Evanovich's Stephanie Plum family, but it didn't hook me as those did.

Finally i found the CD here on amazon and had to get it, based off how great the title track is alone. I was not disappointed in the least. There is some strange vocals here, but not too much to distract you from the killer beats. They mix a good amount of classical feel with synthpop effects and hard hitting drum & bass. I recomend this to any electronic fan who knows good music when they here it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming Industrial??","review":"I've had this album for a few years, and I sometimes forget how good it is. The sound is layered and varied, yet the songs retain a sense of spontaneity. Part of the album's strength is that it never stays with one idea too long--even within the same song. It embraces the formulas of its predecessors (there's even the early nineties obligatory Borg samples) yet it seems more like industrial trying to evolve into something new. The electro-industrial genre can sound so stale, but these kids went into their music with the vim and vigor of youth and the result is surprising. Their attention deficit will annoy some listeners, but I think some of their instincts are right on, and the album is kind of charming because of it.Their record label folded right after they put the album out and as far as I can tell they've been silent ever since. Too bad.

It is extreamly slow, much slower than a George Foreman which really surprised me. Also, as another reviewer wrote it is very messy, I never appreciated the design of a foreman until I used this, the sides of the Cuisinart do not extend past the cooking surface much so they don't block any spray and when you open the griddler any condensation or food residue can slide off the back onto your counter because of where it is hinged.In conclusion get a foreman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then the Foreman Grill","review":"I was a little hesitant buying this grill -- I had a George Foreman that was hard to clean and food stuck after the first month.

Originally put out in 1972, with founding members bassist / keyboardist Michael Gunther and guitarist / keyboardist Lutz Ulbrich. Some say 'Malesch' is one of the better krautrock efforts ever. Personally, I cannot disagree with that at all. Here, Agitation Free fuses spacey synth work, an atmospheric vibe with a Middle Eastern sound as so few ensembles can. Best cuts include \\"Sahara City\\", the intricate \\"Khan El Khalili\\" and the title track \\"Malesch\\". For other great Agitation Free titles, make sure to check out their CD reissues of '2nd', 'Last', 'Fragments' and their 1999 reunion effort - the fantastic 'River Of Return' (see my review).

It is a real shame to release a study book without proof reading it first and correcting the mistakes. An individual who is studying for the MOS Excel certification can get some good information from the book, but a student will be very confused if not very frustrated using it.

However, as I've seen from other reviewers, over time the casing begins to fall apart exposing the wiring in the cable. I now have around 7 or 8 areas on the cable that are showing exposed wire and can feel several other areas where the casing is going to start to split.

This probably could have kept pills dry after being pulled up from the Titanic. It has no paint or surface coatings to fleck off and contaminate your drugs. The one downside is that the interior diameter is 11.5 mm (measured with calipers), not 12 mm as advertised. 12-mm diameter tablets, of which there are many, will _just_ not fit. It can fit one 1,100-mg fish oil pill and many others, but measure your meds to make sure they're at most 11-mm wide. My prescription medicine (a fairly common one) was 12 mm.

The LCD display on this unit does not display the real-time power draw--but rather a snapshot about every second. So, it is impossible to know exactly what the peak draw is when my flashes fire. Moreover, the unit's memory does not store raw statistics (watts, amps, etc.)--only calculated figures like energy cost over time. While it may fit the needs of some consumers, it certainly does not fit my (quite basic) need. The menu system is also fairly cumbersome. For example, reading the memory requires unplugging the unit, plugging it back in, and then accessing the memory quickly before it is automatically overwritten. I find it hard to believe that this thing cannot tell me something as simple as the peak power draw when an appliance kicks-on. These limitations are not clear on the packaging.

The competing brand went belly up so I had to get one of these.I think the kill-a-watts improved a lot and I like it now. The accuracy seems to be there compared to my more expensive units (note that the usual exceptions apply, this won't work for fridges etc).The usage is a little bogus, or more than a little. What I want to know is how many watts are flowing. I don't care about anything else. This functionality is now hidden behind a two-level menu. The top-level buttons only display fluff.No battery buffer, unlike the other brand I bought (which was also cheaper). Come on people. Stupid retail packaging, too. If I wanted scratches I'd go to the zoo and pick a fight with a cougar.But it's worth a 4 star now. I had lower expectation but overall this particular kill-a-watt now works as it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but some flaws","review":"I really like these power meters, but some of them are not very accurate. I have tried 3 P4460s and several of the cheaper models and found that one of the P4460s read 86 watts when it should have been 80. That's off by 7.5% and is way out of spec according to the manual (which says it is suppose to have .5% to 2% accuracy). I am returning that unit (the replacement I bought reads 83 watts which is better). Some of the other units were off too, but not by as much. Otherwise this is a nice unit but could include an optional short power cable which makes it much easier to handle and use. I like the fact that this unit does not lose readings when power is lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"Unlike the picture shows.1. There is no short little cord included. It blocks both receptacles of a standard outlet.2. The display is difficult to read because it is dim (no backlight) and the display fonts are super tiny.

You have to play with the menu buttons to get there.A local hardware store had an easier to use unit for $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little device","review":"This device is quite useful. I have already unplugged several electronic devices or at least changed my setup to save a little wasted power.

We plan to check all our appliances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, but not perfect","review":"Very useful for determining the amount of energy used by major appliances. I like the fact that it keeps track of total energy consumption and uses the actual energy cost to forecast the cost of operation. This information is very useful when targeting appliances to reduce energy consumption. It is also useful for evaluating how successful I am at reducing energy consumption.I don't like the fact that the LCD does not have a backlight, and that the display can only be read while the unit is plugged in. I have to get on the floor to read it. The unit also blocks both outlets.I recommend getting a couple of extension cords and using this device \\"in line\\". Use one cord from the kill-a-watt to the wall, so that it's easier to read, then another cord from the kill-a-watt to your appliance (not needed if your appliance has a long enough cord)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electricity Usage Moniter does exactly what is says","review":"This product is worth every penny. Whether you are doing a power rating on a desktop computer to judge the proper size of a UPS, finding out how much your entertainment system pulls when it is active/idle, or just seeing how much power things consume. I found out that my entire desktop (computer, router, modem, printer, monitor) uses just 20 watts when I power down, so no need to unplug or flip off the surge protector, since the savings would be just a few cents. Overall, a very worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, could use improvement","review":"I've been using this for about 3 months and it works well. Everything works as expected, but the Kill A Watt could really use some updating. It would be nice if the display weren't limited to being attached at the plug level - some sort of remote display would be really nice - it can be a pain to get down and look at the display. Secondly, since you do have to get down on the ground to read the display it would be nice if the screen were backlit - that close to the ground I always have to bring a little flashlight to read the display.If either one of those things were addressed, this would be a five star review! It's a great product, just needs a little ease-of-use updating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"This product does exactly what it says, it measure the power consumption of a single appliance when it's plugged into it between the appliance and the wall outlet. The features are a little counter-intuitive to use.

Everything read the same, the toaster, the electric heater and the electric blanket. Even if it did work it is very hard to use. It takes up both outlet spaces in a regular wall outlet but that's not the really bad part. Instead of giving you kwh it gives you cost per day or cost per month assuming that the load stays the same. It is almost impossible to read. You have to get down on your belly on the floor and even then it's difficult. The principle numbers are big enough but the little words like day and month are tiny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poow Quality","review":"I bought one of these and it functioned as advertised but lasted about 3 days. Since the cost and hassle of returning is more than the product I opened it up to look at the production quality. As an engineer I have seen good production quality and poor.

The title cut is an exceptionally beautiful 1970's composition, rather in the mold of some of the Discipline series (particularly Discipline 99)and available on no other recordings.

It appears that Lang Lang is beginning to believe the hyperbole of his own press & has decided to abandon any pretence of having depth & nuance. All we have here is self-indulgence & caricature.Gergiev, who seems to be gravitating towards more extreme tempi & dynamics every time I hear newer recordings of his, does nothing to rein in Lang Lang and simply allows him to run amok.

This is one of the most popular concertos and maestros from the four corners have studied and played this. Maybe Lang Lang should consider composing an adaptation to Palestrinas choral music for piano. That way he will have the luxury of playing a piece and not being compared to anyone else.

It arrived in a rather flimsy carton but there was no damage to the tank by UPS (which I guess is both a testament to UPS and to the durability of the tank). I took it to my local Propane retailer and had it filled. From what I have been told, any retailer than can handle 20 lb tanks should be able to handle 40 lb tanks. It takes almost 10 gallons of Propane and weighs around 70 lbs when filled. So be warned if you have trouble lifting heavy things as the tank is long and heavy. I will be using this tank as an emergency Propane supply for a generator. After hurricane Sandy and the shortage of gasoline, I discovered Propane was readily available. Also, Propane can be stored for long periods of time without the kind of degradation that gasoline suffers from."},{"rating":"2","title":"reduce number of tanks needed","review":"Found these and now can make 1/2 the trips to fill with these \\"double size\\" tanks.

This is one of the BEST MP compilations out there and was of course released originally as the Instant Record collection way back. For those of you younger than 25, a record is a flat piece of vinyl with the sounds basically scratched into the surface. My instant record collection wore out from the thousands of times I listened and laughed to it. You won't have that problem if you purchase the CD, with proper care it should easily outlive your flimsy human carcass. Enjoy and G'day Bruce!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's only fault: it's TOO complete","review":"The only real failing of this collection is that there's too much material to be able to appreciate it all the way it deserves. Don't give in to temptation and try to listen to it all in one day, it will start to lose it's humor. Meter the tracks out for gradual consumption.

It's almost a short Anne Rice. Simply put, the cacoa bean is used to create an elixir of immortality and, like most of the vampires of Rice, our erstwhile hero Diego de Godoy wanders back from the New World to Spain and beyond attempting to reseek his lost Aztec love, Ignacia. With his faithful dog who makes the perfect silent partner over four centuries, Godoy perfects the chocolate art and the ties between both it and love are there as a major theme. The novel is a series of episodes, from the Bastille, to Freud, from Hershey to the whore houses and each one touches on the almost epicurean meddling in important historical moments until Diego realises that he simply missed his love by a matter of not thinking.I highly recommend this. It is an almost dreamy telling, easy on the eye and, whilst it can be though-provoking, is almost wickedly sensual in its cares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"A facinating history of the evolution of chocolate.

The protagonist, Timothy Brogan, is a hardworking, lower-class youth, steeped in integrity and a strong family religious faith. He makes good in a dark, competitive world that seeks to compromise his ethics and his personal wholeness.The story line is part buddy film, part romance, part galactic blood and guts, and part suffering hero. What's refreshing about the story is that the hero risks failure in all his relationships as he dares to examine the real motives behind his drive to control his own destiny.What is unpredictable about the novel is what transpires when this freshman Imperial Guard makes deliberate choices that go against the psyche of our contemporary heros of today. What the readers are forced to ponder is whether they dare tap deeply into the same source as Timothy Brogan did."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is great facial soap","review":"This soap will leave your skin clean and residue free as well as smooth and exfoliated without overdrying.

Ariel Segal made me feel detached and unemotional about a subject that one could feel compassion. That of Jewish men, woman and children living in isolation from their culture and history. Perhaps, this subject could be reworked as a novel. The story of a white family in the Belgian Congo was addressed rather grippingly in The Poisonwood Bible by Barbara Kingsolver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog car seat","review":"We bought this car seat because we were taking our Pomeranian on a 5 hour drive to DC. She had been carsick on short drives before we bought the carseat and was not totally comfortable in the car. We had bought a carseat from our local Petco but it was not meant for a bench seat so we returned it. This car seat worked perfectly in our back seat. It comes with a strap to attach to the seatbelt and to her harness so she remained secure in the car seat. She was very comfortable in the car seat, was fine for the drive and was not car sick. It was definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Coach!","review":"The product was larger than expected but my dog seem to like all of the room.

Of course during the summer the fur would get even warmer as a result she would eventually climb out of the seat.After 2 weeks of having this product the strap broke from the back of the seat. I decided not to send it back due to the size of this thing. It's huge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My dog loves this!","review":"My dog and I love this riser car bed. She is secure in the car and I know if we are in an accident she stays put and doesn't go flying. She can turn around and lay in many positions as well as sit. It attaches to the harness your dog wears, not a collar. She can see out the window which is great on long trips or for dogs who love scenery. This item goes into and comes out of the car easily and you can also use it inside as a bed. I've washed the cover and it washes well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best seat ever!","review":"I purchased this seat after trying many others that my dog either hated or collapsed after 1 use.

I adopted a 2 year old Shih Tzu who seemed to have anxiety attacks during car rides. It didn't matter if he sat in the front, the back, or on someone's lap. After 2 weeks (it took time to adjust) being buckled in the Snoozer, he is travelling happily, and is relaxing more and more during car rides. I did have some trouble with him twisting himself into the harness when he was more anxious. I used the manufacturer's suggestion to use a safety pin and it did help some. Now that he is used to the car seat, it is no longer a problem. Highly recommended by my dog and me."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Pet Car Seat is Great!","review":"I bought two of these car seats for my shih tzus.

My little dogs ride safely without the worry of them getting hurt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big and Unstable","review":"This seat is far too large for my car or my wife's SUV. It also seems too high and unstable as it hangs over the front of the car seat. We are returning it as it seems unsafe and is too big.

One dog kept jumping out and getting hung up on the seat belt. Never use this seat with a collar, only a harness. There is too muh leeway since the tether slides along the length of the seat belt. The only way to make them work right would be to cut a hole through the back and put the tether through that. The other dog did fine, but you never know when a dog will decided to jump out.

It is tall enough for her to look out the window and see out the windshield. And I feel better knowing we are both safe! I got the medium size for my nine pound yorkie because she likes to have her \\"space\\". But I think the small one would have worked great too.

There's prayers for almost any occasion or life circumstance, and they are very good. Besides prayers, there's Martin Luther's thoughts on the sacraments, such as baptism.On the negative side, which is the reason why I didn't rate the book another star, an awful lot of prayers in the section that offers morning and evening prayers seem to be variations on the same few topics, i.e., asking for forgiveness for shortcomings, thankfulness for living to see another day. Like a great many other prayer books, none are targetted for different life stages. I say this as a shortcoming, because in my own prayer life, I find that at age 54 I'm praying for different things than I did at age 15 or 25. Of course, there's nothing to stop you from using any of the prayers as a starting point that you can add to.

Basically this book contains brief, rather mechanical prayers and has selections from the Psalms and occasional prayers. A few other selected snippets of things found elsewhere and that's about it.

It comes off as insincere and WAAAY over the top syrupy. When I pray, I keep it genuine and personal. Many of the prayers in this edition are too verbose and borderline silly. If anyone spoke to me in the tone the authors use, I'd have to laugh and roll my eyes.One other thing that disturbed me about this book is that many of the prayers seem to mirror the hijacking of Christianity by the republican evangelical right. It mixes secular politics and earthly hot button topics with the true word. I found it VERY offensive. Particularly the prayers about govt and the armed forces.

It is written from the small business person's perspective and is easy to understand--jargon free. It also has several letter templates for writing customers and vendors. This is an excellent tool for small businesses that need to understand the implications of Y2K for their businesses. One of the key points this workbook undescores, is that being prepared for Y2K doesn't just require getting your computer bugs worked out, but it calls for a well thought-out, overall business plan. The challenge is creating awareness and a sense of urgency. As this review is being written, the year 1999 is less than two months aways. Y2K will be here too soon. A solid business plan is required--this isn't day light savings time, where we just set our clock's up one hour. Small businesses must get ready now and this handbook can be a valuable asset."},{"rating":"2","title":"customer","review":"Item was as pictured. Shipped out promptly and packaged to prevent damage.

Don't bother.","review":"Working in a big blocked building it's hard to get reception on a radio here,but I had hoped this radio headphone set would be different,It wasn't. I can't tune one station in on this,and at my apartment,it's not that much better. I was only able to tune one of my favorite stations in,and that had static also. I live and work near a big city,so getting a strong signal was not the problem. Maybe it works best outside when your working out? But then again the design of this wasn't very well thought out. It has around the ear design,but it doesn't feel secure,and I would think it would easily fall off if your jogging with them on. I'll go back to using the,around the ear MP3 player that I have,until a better product comes along. The seller of this product shipped the item fast,and I would buy from him again.

It's an EXCELLENT family movie with a sweet story as Clayton Poole (Jerry Lewis) does everything in his power to take care of these little girls. Sure, it's hilarious but it also has a strong family theme as the Clayton, the babies' aunt and grandfather do whatever they can to do what's best for the babies.

In fact, I was searching Amazon to buy one as a gift for someone this year. It's true that the thing eats up batteries like crazy when playing a CD, but I almost exclusively use it for the radio function. With just playing the radio and only using it when showering, the batteries last about 4 months.As I said, it's approaching a year old and all of the functions still work fine.As for the person who claimed that the manual said not to use it near water, that line was taken out of context.

Then, when I finally got through to customer service, the woman on the line said they could do absolutely nothing for me without a receipt (even when I offered to give her the serial # off the player, which presumably would tell them it was just purchased and is still under warranty).

It uses batteries at an incredable rate (a AC adapter is not included, so even though I was using it on a counter, not in the shower, I still had to feed it batteries.) I could only tune in one radio station clearly, even with an antenna attached; the control buttons are poorly laid out, and make no intuitive sense. It is dificult to tell at a glance if the unit is turned off, so it is easy to leave it left on by mistake, further draining the batteries. The CD player skipped and would stop in the middle of a song for no apparent reason.

I personally wish they would have started with Dragon Ball and maybe combined the DBZ a little better, but this is ridiculous.

Picture and graphics are exactly what I expected. I can't wait to get the DBZ set's in box set and will order then ASAP. No Blue Ray available though.

It appears here that either Eduard Hovinga has matured or he had lost a part of his range or both. His vocal is very rough more in the style of Elegy's Lost than the first Prime Time. Still his voice his very good, it's a little drawback from the unknown. But still a lot to enjoy. The instrumental parts and the vocals are very much hard rock for most of the album.Although it doesn't improve anything over The Unknown, something very important happened. The production is Kicking. At last we don't get that clear mastering the first tree elegy as long as the unknown had.The rest of the ensemble is good.Buy it if you already got The Unknown. If your looking to try only one, try The Unknown. The production is weaker, but the composition is maybe a little stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the DVD release!","review":"\\"Enjo\\" is a great movie but it deserves to be released on DVD. The letterboxed image was very small on the screen, squashed into the 4:3 ratio box and not centered. It is skewed toward the top of the screen so if you zoom it you lose not only the subtitles but also part of the image as well. What was intolerable was the fact that the legend: \\"PROPERTY OF NEW YORKER VIDEO\\" kept appearing from time to time ON TOP OF THE IMAGE. At times it covered the faces of the actors! New Yorker Video proclaims on the box that Enjo is \\"One of the great masterpieces of Japanese cinema\\" so it is... why desecrate it in this way? It's like the burning of the temple in the film!I hope that Criterion or Kino or some other company releases this film on DVD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this product.

Anyway, I tried to groom it before giving it to my four-year-old and she didn't say she hated it, but expressed concern at her dog's lack of eyes and she hasn't really played with it since.

There are some interesting tidbits of information, but overall it's just a hodgepodge of facts that the author cobbled together with no rhyme or reason. Some of them were obviously added for no reason other than to fill the remaining blank space at the bottom of a page.

It's amazing to go through the simple techniques of rearranging your priorities and being honest with yourself. I understand that some people may hate this book, because of the direct approach involving the reader on a personal level, and the author doesn't talk around the issues. But Dietmar Scherf offers his advice kindly, leading the reader step by step into a healing of the soul and mind. Almost all of my friends and neighbors love this book and are reading it over and over again, and we even discuss various subjects from the book whenever we gather for a chat.

These ideas have very little to do with the real world problems people face in their depression.

So I don't understand the negative critics of this book...I think they're in desperate need of 'I Love Me' because they must be a bunch of very depressed and rebellious people that just don't want to face the truth. Well, I've written to the Scherf headquarters and I received very informative material from them and as I can see it, many thousands of people have been healed from depression.

It just seemed that the approach was one of \\" smile, believe and you will feel better.\\"I felt the book was talking down to me and I was so annyed I couldn't even finish it.

Mr. Scherf has no training as a psychologist; he bases his book on his religious faith. This would normally be just fine, but he boils it down to \\"You're OK because God made you,\\" and \\"You'll be great if you just hold to the Truth\\" (i.e., the Bible).

Hint: it has to do with the importance of religion in each protagonist's life.Road to Paradise's characters are engaging and the plot is riveting. It is Collins' intention to catch the flavor of 70's Chicago and the 70's mob. The conclusion of the novel involves a mob hit which remains unsolved but is neatly 'solved' in Collins' fictional construct.

If this is your first Hannah Howell experience, please don't give up. I have read Highland Warrior at least seven times cover to cover.

I mean, I get the joke...they're trying to lampoon the whole death metal thing with about a billion references to Satan and music that is laughably extreme. Okay, I get it...you throw in a thousand blast beats, tune the guitars down low and have your singer growl like a dog fighting over a bone. This mock death metal thing is being done a thousand times better by Hate Eternal, the kings of joke metal.Just not enough laughs to recommend. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"You think you know metal?","review":"Nu metal junkies, listen up. Nu metal is not metal, it's hard rock (not that it's bad- I have some great nu metal cd's). If you want REAL metal, check out Deicide, one of the most brutal, punishing, menacing death metal bands of all time. Death metal fans know that Deicide has been an unstoppable force since their self-titled debut was released in 1990. Nu-metal junkies will be scared out of their wits when they hear the ultra-heavy, ultra-speedy sound that is Deicide. No boy band vocals. No harmonizing. Just death metal of epic proportions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks with the Best of the Young Indy Series","review":"I really enjoyed this one.

This is not an action episode!In spite of a brief, but very welcome appearance of the original Indiana Jones, (Harrison Ford), donning his whip and fedora for the fourth time, this is one of the quietest YIJC episodes ever!The episode revolves around young Indy learning to play the saxophone and playing with a jazz band in the 1920's.There is a moment in the second half involving a murder and an action scene in a warehouse. But this is not an episode for action fans; it's an episode for jazz afficionados.I wish Ford could have leant his cameo apparance to an action-oriented episode!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bad poet in the English language!","review":"McGonagall was a 19th century Scottish poet,Who had no talent, only he didn't know it.He wrote several volumes of terrible verseThat read like this one, only much worse.Like whiskey, his works are best in moderation to take,For too much at once will cause a great headache.But if you delight in reading verse that is awful,Then by all means peruse this book by McGonagall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thoroughly disappointing sequel","review":"The Kindle edition is full of so many typos that, while still readable, it is thoroughly annoying.

Except for a brief appearance by Uncle Matthew, who has given up his entrenching tool in favour of a cocktail glass (!!!), none of the other characters from Ms. Mitford's earlier works appear here.Rather, the novel is populated by pop stars, dull diplomats and something called \\"Teddy boys\\". These uncompelling characters are further handicapped by tedious dialogue and an utterly boring plot.Completely lacking the charm and wit of \\"The Pursuit of Love\\" and \\"Love in a Cold Climate\\", this novel disappoints as much as the others delight.Sorry, Amazon, this book is No Sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uli Jon Roth : a guitar player god","review":"Metamorphosis is a very good example of how great is Uli Jon Roth as a guitar player. He is probably one of the most unrated guitar players that I have heard and it's a pity. He deserve to be more recognized.Vivaldi's Four Seasons is well known in the clsssical music world , but a guitar player who is able to play a masterpiece like that is something that you don't hear everyday and not any guitar player can do it . So, this is what you will find in this cd: a classical masterpiece played by an extremelly skilled guitar player (what a great combination). Whatch the way Uli J performs the guitar in this cd, there are some moments when the guitar can be confused with the violins. It's amazing.I strongly recommend this cd not only to all guitar freaks but to any music fan with good taste for music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...impressive","review":"I love Vivaldi's Four Seasons. Absolutely love it!So I saw this, and I like power metal...and the thought of an electric guitar with the Seasons, was just interesting to me, so I picked up the CD.It takes awhile to get used to at first, but after that, it's just amazing. Alot of the solos are just like...it GOES with an electric guitar. Mr. Roth is extremely talented to be able to pull that kind of stuff off.If you're looking for something different, a little edgy and perhaps just throwing yourself to wind, try this. Especially if you like classical and metal. I mean, it's just an awesome mix!Go ahead, buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great start, but needs more product R&D","review":"I can't recommend this one.

Basic blocks, punches, strikes and kicks are shown as well as how to flow from one technique to another. As anyone who has studied Shotokan karate knows, the basics are practiced in every training session.This book in combination with actual training under an instructor, will make you better at karate. In conclusion, if you are serious about learning true Shotokan karate, you will want this book.Rating: 5 Stars. Joseph J. Truncale (Author: Shotokan Karate Self-Defense Techniques: Combat Karate for the Street)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book.","review":"The other reviewers are spot-on with their praise. With a complex sport like karate, a student needs to have unambiguous instruction. Otherwise, the student risks learning the movements incorrectly. This series delivers informative instruction as clear as clear can be. The author carefully and brilliantly presented the material so that there is little room for doubt. Other karate books are good. This one is great. Other books can have you scratching your head, wondering what it is they're trying to say. After purchasing other books, I purchased this one as a supplement to explain what the others didn't. I realized that if I had purchased this one first, I wouldn't need another supplement.Don't be fooled by the low price. This book and the rest of the series is worth many more times the price you'll pay, especially when you consider the time and energy that goes into learning the sport.Buy this book. You'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Disappointing","review":"This is less a book about the French paradox than it is a book on how to count calories. Thanks but I didn't need to spend money to figure that out. I wanted to know more about the French approach to eating, which he only briefly covers. His 22 secrets to the French diet include such worthless memes such as exercise more. Novel! He spends a lot of time telling the reader that low-fat diets are worthless, but a bunch of recipes include low-fat and low-cal substitutes. That's a fine approach, but not one the French would use. So he should have just named this book \\"How to Eat Lite with semi-French recipes\\". I would not recommend this to people who want to eat like the French because while some of these are covered, it's not all that hard to look them up on the net.

For a young author Mr. Da Cruz did a excellent job of describing (to a non-serviceman) the life of a modern USMC recruit. As the son of a Marine 1951-1953 I can say the current challenges of boot camp pale by comparison to those most other (older) Marines, and other foreign services. Surely for 88 days we can give our recruits the CHALLENGE OF THEIR LIVES without hazing or abuse that used to be regular component of boot camp.Given the old axiom that peace is merely the time between wars I hope the USMC or the Pentagon heed Mr. Da Cruz's concerns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Island","review":"Unless you believe that the typical Marine Corps recruit, straight out of high school, uses words like \\"exemplifies,\\" \\"engender,\\" \\"transgressor,\\" and \\"invariably\\" -- all of which appear on just one page (page 42) of this book, you will soon question whether Daniel da Cruz even exists. It is worth noting that the author acknowledges the contributions of approximately 130 Marines (ranging from a Major General to Corporals, but no Privates, PFCs or Lance Corporals) to his (or their) effort. In style and content, the book is little more than a recruiting pamphlet. It contains some useful factual information, but readers seeking a realistic description and assessment of modern Marine training should look elsewhere -- \\"Making the Corps\\" by Thomas E. Ricks provides a far better description and analysis.\\"Boot\\" is the right title for this book, but not for the reason the author(s) intended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boot","review":"My son and I read this book shortly before my son went to boot camp.

It was very informative and was exactly what I was looking for on some of the details and facts of training in the U.S. Marine Corps. It was nice of the author to mention a bit on the training of foreign elite armed forces, but I felt that U.S. Navy Seals and U.S. Army Special Forces and Rangers might be a better representative of the U.S. elite to compare with the foreign elite services. The Marines also have elite groups among themselves in the form of Force Recon and Scout/Snipers, so comparing Marines by itself to foreign elite services may be a bit tough. With the cultural and legal differences between the U.S. and other countries, I doubt that the training rigors will change much for the U.S. armed forces in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal Book","review":"Da Cruz does a great job of recreating the essence of boot camp.

The whole premise of the novel was barely believable - nice Catholic boy impregnates half-Jewish girlfriend, girl loses baby, boy joins the priesthood to atone for the sin of getting her pregnant in the first place . . . and because his mother told him too. Doesn't make for a very charming or believable hero. The whole book revolves around Annie's rightful distrust of this former priest. Does she love him, doesn't she love him . . .

There are way too many characters and by the mid-way point, I could care less who the killer was, who he killed or why he killed.I will give Camel Club a try, but if that one doesn't do it for me, this will be my last Baldacci.

With that said, however, this book isn't that bad, especially if you are looking for a quick read that will keep your attention. I don't think \\"Hour Game\\" was one of Baldacci's best books, but it did capture me in the beginning and kept me reading to the end. There are a lot of characters in the book and the story does somehow entagle all of them in this small Virginian town murder mystery, but Baldacci does a good job at keeping the story flowing and does not confuse the reader too much.

Just when you think the characters will make some progress, the characters regress and do the same thing all over again.Lots of people are murdered here. Though people are scandalized that so many murders happen in a small town, no body seems to actually care for the people who are murdered. The victims matter so little that the characters go on and on talking about the intricacies of fine wines.I believe Mr. Baldacci felt pressure to keep putting out books even when he has nothing particular say. Writing imaginative literature is tremendous work. I just don't see that work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A heap of clichés","review":"I enjoy a good thriller as much as the next man, and I liked the first couple of Baldacci novels. Hour Game, however, has got to be one of the worst novels I've ever read. It's nothing more than a formulaic, predictive heap of clichés, and even though clichés can sometimes be put to good and effective use by skilful thriller writers, that certainly isn't the case here. One piece of good advice for Baldacci: letting the bad guy kill off all other possible suspects before the halfway point of the novel doesn't exactly increase the suspense.So, Reader, beware: stay far away from this one. It reads like a very poor B-movie transcribed by an especially unimaginative plagiarist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I really can't imagine anyone rating this book with five stars. I am (was) a Baldacci fan but this book just made me angry that I wasted so much time reading it.There is not nearly enough character development, even for the two main characters, Michelle and Sean. What makes these people tick - who are they? Sean, as a character, was very boring, although apparently he is clarvoyant and can figure out complex mysteries with no real police work or clues.The reasons why the main killer killed are extremely muddled and really don't make any sense. And the ending plot twist was just infuriating since no background for it had been included in the story. It seemed like Baldacci just wanted to finish the book and dashed off any old ending just to be done with it.Many popular authors turn into hacks - Harris and Patterson come to mind - and it seems that Baldacci is headed down the same road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"David Baldacci proves one again that authors care more about fulfilling their contracts than they do about putting out a quality book.We've all seen it before from Grisham, Patterson,Follet, S.

One thing I will note however, is that there's nothing wrong with a novel having a lot of characters and a lot of sub-plots. I did have to go back and review some things as I read to keep things straight, but that's complexity and that's how life is...complex. That said, with so many characters, some of them end up being shallow and one-dimensional. King and Maxwell are a good pairing, and I think they can certainly be characters for future stories.As noted earlier, the bullets that collide and explode (admittedly in the book a \\"one in a billion chance\\") is a preposterous scenario (one of several).Bottom line questions: Was I entertained? Yes. Was I frustrated by the climax and conclusion? Yes. Has Baldacci done better? Absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci's worst book.","review":"The characters in this book are wooden and contrived.

The method of each killing is copied from classic cases in the past. Meanwhile the two sleuths are hired to defend a man who is being accused of burglary by the Battles, a wealthy, though dysfunctional family. As in most books of this genre, the two cases begin to merge as the victims are shown to have some relationship to the Battles. Author Baldacci takes the reader through the thought processes of the depraved killer, never hinting at his identity. The suspense builds until at last the killer is caught, but Baldacci has a few more tricks up his sleeve before the books ends. The author's technique of using short chapters only enhances the suspense which the plot creates.

A murder may be a necessary plot element, but here Baldacci turns them into lovingly-rendered snuff films, the details of which do nothing to advance the plot.

Instead what you have is someone murdering people one right after another, slowly widdling down the characters until you're left scratching your head because there's nobody left! The plot takes forever to develop and the characters seem like half-wits bent on either revenge, money, or hate.Our two main characters are supposedly the only smart people in this small virginia town, why, because EVERYONE else DIES!The plot and the various sub-plots would've been better if they had been highly restriced to a specific few cases.

I enjoy a complex book with a lot of characters, except when those are as badly conceived as had been the case in this book. Not having previously read any books by this author, I'd initially wondered if this one were meant to be a farce, but the plodding tedium soon dispelled that notion.

The ridiculous plot lines,laugh out loud live saving scenarios and inept law enforcement characters make this a total waste of time as well as an insult to your intelligence. Like Grisham and Patterson, Baldacci has decided to pump out trash for the quick buck. I think it is possible that he wrote this while in high school. Stay far,far away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done with Baldacci","review":"Since the reviews printed on the inside cover of the book all are blurbs, here are my blurbs:\\"Really hard to get into ... tough to follow who's who ...\\"\\"Opens strong, but fizzles out early ...\\"\\"I literally feel asleep while reading this book one night ...\\"\\"You'll finally give up without really wondering who did it ...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother - its pathetic","review":"This book started off OK -- then you realized that this author wrote like it was 'on the fly' - that is - no plot that made sense, no story line whatsoever - just threw in a character and had him either die or be a killer! This book was not planned out at all.Way too many dead bodies - some that didn't even make sense, a ridiculous story line and total unbelievability.This book is certainly NOT a 'whodunit triller', its an insult to anyone's intelligent. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Baldacci will not be a must read author for me again","review":"The Hour Game was hard for me to really get into. It was just too much going on and none of it going anywhere. It was so frustrating that the only reason I continued reading the book was I always finish what I start.I have been a Baldacci fan for years but his past few books have left me disappointed more each time. This was the worst by far. Mr. Baldacci needs to quit speed writing trying to beat the contract deadlines and go back to when he first began to write."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hour Game","review":"This is one of my favorite novels of all time, it has twists that i know i was never expecting. i couldn't put it down, i read during school, while i worked out, before bed, during meals, this was just an incredible book. there was so much suspense that i had to read the ending early to find out who really \\"did it\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Hour Game Falls Below Standard Set By Esau Swindle","review":"Dr.Solde's online review got me enthralled with The Esau Swindle. I too had been looking for a new thriller. I checked The Da Vinci Code, and Hour Game to find out what's hot. The Esau Swindle by Gerald Rothberg came up and caught my attention. Rothberg has a brilliant sense of timing and an incredible way of melding mystery, assassination attempts, beautiful Buenos Aires, art forgery and crime. I'm a doctor too. I read thrillers to relax my mind. As they say a good book is hard to find, but The Esau Swindle is bold. Thank you Dr. Solde. I will e-mail my physician friends and let them know about the Esau Swindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"GAME'S OVER!","review":"After reading Split Second, I wanted to find out more about Sean and Michelle. Hour Game is a disappointing book. So convoluted and too much minutiae; it was a mish mash with a lot of subterfuge thrown in.

I purchased the book, got sick and when I was able to hold my head up I realized that I read this book in paperback. I had read the sample also. But it didn't ring any bells. So I asked for a refund, yes I was past the allotted time, but you can't control sickness either. It would be nice to at least receive some kind of acknowledgement from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too violent","review":"I read the 1st 48 pages of this book - it's given me nightmares for 2 nights now. WAY too violent. There are way too many other good books out there. I'll not be reading this author again. This is the 2nd book - and I'm disappointed in the voilent actions in each of them. I would never recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hour Game is one of the worst books I've ever read","review":"This is the first (and last) book by David Baldacci that I've ever read. He is one of the worst best-selling writers I've ever read. He writes almost every sentence of dialog in the form of a Tom Swifty sentence (\\"We've got to get out of here,\\" said King, menacingly). His flair for melodramatic overstatement is second to none. The actions of the characters make no sense at all. For example, when Michelle sees a laser from a gun sight pointed at the chest of her trusty sidekick, Sean King, she says, \\"Sean, don't move!\\" instead of \\"Sean, dive for cover!!!\\" Bottom line - save your money and buy something worthwhile!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hour(s) Wasted","review":"Wow. Published in over 35 languages in more than 8 countries, with nearly 40 million copies in print (from the dust cover). Sounded good to me. My reward: this drivel: \\"She trembled, jerked, moaned and then lay still;the sweat was shooting through every pore in her body... in one of the heat-charged spasms she tore off her sweat-drenched camisole and dropped to the floor in only her [...], her breath coming in huge bursts, her [...]slapping together as she rolled back and forth in a convulsion of manufactured ectasy\\". Much murder and mayhem perhaps in the hope that quantity would disguise the tabloid quality of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baldacci reaches new low","review":"Up until now, I've read every Baldacci novel. This latest one exhibits a continuing downward trend (his first few were brilliant!). I wonder if Baldacci is retaining freshman lit students to write his books. They could easily be TV scripts...\\"the phone rang. He answered it. It was his office...\\" sort of stuff. The novel could easily been half as long and thus better. Two many words, fill fluff and the like.I'll not buy another David Baldacci book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"Had this one on the shelf; recalling I had enjoyed Baldacci in the past, I dusted it off and gave it a go. I tried to remember the last time I had experienced such mediocre writing and plot development. It really felt sohomoric from the get go. If an unknown writer submitted this manuscript to a publisher, I dont see how it would be accepted. I could scarcely accept this was from a popular author, so I looked at other reviews to see if I was off base - but sure enough, others seem to agree! He must have cranked this one out in his sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic...","review":"This book is truly dreadful, and I have enjoyed his earlier work. Perhaps he needs to give it a rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring read","review":"I picked this book up because I had seen several ofBaldacci's books in the best seller list. However, this one turned out to be quite disappointing. I couldn't bring myself to finish it. For a thriller, it was simply not enough of a page-turned for me. The story progresses at a mediocre pace, but it isn't gripping enough. The characters seem listless and uninteresting. I suggest trying a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have read others of Baldacci's books before on plane rides and enjoyed him as an author. Hour Game was a real disappointment with a plot that was unconvincing.This book falls flat and I'm sorry I wasted my time reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"Although there are lots of boring parts such as Michelle visiting eddies battle, but other than that this was a pretty good book with a good ending"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected from a Baldacci book","review":"After reading several of this author's books, I arrived at the conclusion that he could not write a truly \\"bad\\" book, which he has not here. However, it is a ho hum, skip a lot of pages book. Way too many characters and they don't seem too believable. I was eager to read this book, having read several of his other ones, especially \\"The Collector's\\" and \\"The Camel Club\\" (loved that book!) Also, needed some editing - I started counting the number of times thatthe author said King \\" shot back\\" - in reply to a statement from other characters, but the count got too high and I gave up. Just cringed when I read another \\"He shot back\\". I do hopefully look forward to another book about The Camel Club, though. I would give this book 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing Serial Killer Story","review":"The storyline of this book actually really bored me. It took me a life time for my standards to read it beacause the plot has no thread to it, is confusing and not very \\"mind-sticky\\", the two main characters have a nice personality, but the serial killers homicides lack completly of immagination as does the killer and the characters that circle around the story. I do not recommend it personally. The only good thing is that you are not sure of who did what untill almost the end (at least I was not but maybe I got so bored I did not see it), but the mind of the killer/s and the reasons are lame and all in one there are nicer books to spend your money in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence and Gore","review":"I have read other books by David Baldacci (Wish You Well / Christmas Train) and thought him to be a very talented writer. Hour Game is a tough read -- I had to persevere and fight an increasing sense of alienation and desire to return the book unfinished. The story focuses on grisly murders and does not spare the reader any of the gory details -- including several trips to the morgue to oversee in vivid detail what the Medical Examiner was doing to the bodies. I had the impression Baldacci was entangled in an immature flashback to childhood where as a boy he delighted in grossing out his peers. Interesting characters were presented, but their depth was not developed. It was also impossible to embrace a heroine who would push crude, disgusting sexual gestures and comments off on her well-mannered, brilliant partner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Convoluted and Contrived","review":"What a disappointment this \\"thriller\\" was! Nothing thrilling about every twist and turn having to be explained... right up to the very last page. Contrived plot. Uninteresting characters. Not worth the effort reading after the first half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amaturish","review":"I cannot believe this book got published. I'm an avid reader, and especially enjoy a good mystery. I took this book to the beach expecting a good read -- boy, was I disappointed! The characters are superficial and unbelievable, the dialogue stilted, the chase scene and the two bullets colliding in mid-air at the end are completely ridiculous. To top it all off, the murders -- and there are plenty of them -- are just disgusting. I can take gore when there's a purpose, but the only purpose here was to make you sick.I get the feeling that Baldacci was just in a hurry to write this book and get it on the market. There is absolutely no development of characters, and the plot is ridiculous, convoluted, and laughable.I guess you can tell I didn't like it -- at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"weak writing, weaker plot","review":"Baldacci's writing style is on a par with that of a skilled high schooler. What has made his books enjoyable to read is his imagination and interesting plot lines. This is one you'll completely forget in a week. Either he has run out of interest, or is tired of putting in the necessary work to write a better book. Your time would be better spent finding a Scott Turow novel you haven't read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it...","review":"I tried many times to finish this book because once I buy it and start it, I hate to just walk away from it. BUT, this book did it. I was never really interested in the plot, I thought the writing was very basic, elementary actually, slow, and just plain boring. I tried on more than one occasion to pick it back up, but I never did get into to, making this the only book I've ever started and put back on my shelf with no interest in finishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hour Game","review":"I thought I was a Baldacci fan, but after reading this lastest work I wonder what I ever saw in him. The language is at about a 4th grade level. The character development is really \\"caracature development.\\" The author introduces important characters late in the book and pins the murders on them. As for the murderer, we are never really prepared for what made this person such a diabolical killer. This was truly a stupid book - it was all I could do to finish reading the last two chapters. Now that's pathetic. I will say that the action scenes are compelling. But that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A C- at best!","review":"At best, a Cee Minus for David Baldacci's \\"Hour Game.\\"It starts out promising with the return of ex-Secret Service agents turned PIs, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell.They were terrific in \\"Split Second\\" and still have some savoir-faire.However they are placed in a bloated plot that is filled with one contrivance after another. Even I do not possess the ability to suspend my disbelief this much.Ludicrous situations and resolutions abound. When, in a shootout, the two bullets collide---well, you almost lose your sanity.If you like thrillers that offer sound reasoning, elan, plausibility or profoundness this is not for you.It wins this quarter's James Patterson Pathetic Thriller Sweepstake.He phoned it in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time out","review":"That loud thump you just heard was a copy of David Baldacci's Hour Game hitting the bottom of my waste bin with 162 pages (27%) yet unread. What can you say about a story in which EVERYBODY dies to no apparent purpose. David, why not just set off a suitcase bomb in the middle of Virginia? Everyone will disappear, including your work and all that tedious editing. I threw the book away upon realizing that I don't care about ANY of the characters therein - not the dull investigators, not the police, not the FBI, not the medical examiner, not the faux rich Capulets and Montegues, and especially not the perps. The text of this incredibly boring tome is annoyingly stilted and repetitive, as if written by a 9-year-old. The last book I thought was this \\"good\\" was a Grisham novel that had no ending. Duller than the proverbial box of rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"listen\\"","review":"I sometimes listen to books on my drive back and forth to work. I just listened to THE HOUR GAME after it was suggested to me by a friend who reads a lot of mysteries. I did find it a little confusing, but it definitely kept me thinking and trying to figure out who the murderer or murderers were. I liked the writng style. This is the first DAVID BALDACCI novel that I have read. It reminded me of other books that I have read by LAWRENCE KELTER. It had suspense and intrigue and a surprising little twist at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Despicable","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever partly read. David Baldacci, if Hour Game is any indication, no longer cares how bad his stories are. The writing style is almost as bad as Catherine Coulter, truly the worst \\"writer\\" in the English language. Each chapter in this somnolent dribble is four pages long and ends with some stunning line to keep the reader interested--its artificial placement is so obvious that one's gag reflex is overwhelmed with the desire to spew stomach contents over the page to shield the eyes from such excrement.The plotting is ridiculous and formulaic, and the characters are cardboard cutouts. I really think he can't have written this, as it is clearly designed for a mediocre highschool mind that considers People magazine high class. This is pure garbage, and Baldacci should be publicly ridiculed for allowing this slop to see the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"It took a lot of effort for me to finish reading this book. Characters & plot just did not grab me. I have many books on my TO BE READ pile and would not go there until I finished this one. It took too many WEEKS to finish!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to put down","review":"I liked the two main detectives, but thought the added story of the burglary stalled out the lack of depth on the serial killer's story. I just couldn't keep reading about one murder after the next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the 25-Cent Cost","review":"When I found \\"Hour Game\\" in paperback at our local library's monthly book sale, I thought I had hit pay dirt. But I cannot believe that this author who wrote such gripping gems such as \\"The Winner\\" and \\"Absolute Power\\" could turn out such a dog. Long, boring, and confusing. I fear that Mr. Baldacci hired an \\"aspiring young writer\\" to \\"help\\" him crank out a quick book. I cannot pass this book along to my friends -- I couldn't do that to them. It will be tossed into our blue recycle bin. What a waste. What a shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"I am a bit surprised at many of the other reviews of this book. I really liked it. It did have a lot of characters and plot twists but I thought that is what made it interesting. I thought the ending was dragged out a little bit too much and I think the whole Kyle storyline could have probably been dropped without the book suffering, but otherwise I thought this was a good read. I like the Sean and Michelle characters, however, I do see Baldacci setting them up for a romance, which I hope will not happen in any subsequent books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"Have you ever read a book wwhose plot was so convoluted and whose characters were so uninteresting that by the time you got to the end you just didn't care? \\"Hour Game\\" was like that for me.The promise displayed by the pairing of Sean King and Michelle Maxwell in \\"Split Second\\" isn't realized here. If they became romantically involved, all the chemistry would be lost, but \\"Hour Game\\" suggests that, with that option closed to him, Baldacci doesn't know what to do with them.If you're looking for a good Baldacci read--heck, a good thriller/suspense/mystery read, period--try his \\"The Camel Club\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hour Game","review":"It is not the kind of story that I usually like. There is too much killing for my taste. Not Baldacci's best novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hour Game: a waste of time","review":"With an parade of suspects wading through a bland plot, Balcacci's latest effort does not rise to the level of a novel and perhaps should have stayed in his hard drive. It's just too much plot and precious little imagery or character. I've enjoyed many of his previous novels, but this one seems to have been rushed and uninspired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Read","review":"This was an interesting book where the killer is committing murders, copying murders done by previous serial killers. It is an interesting premise which I thought plausible. Baldacci is a good writer and does a good job of building the story and the suspense. A decent read but not superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Choppy, uneven writing. A bunch of unlikeable characters. A weird plot with multiple loose ends. Don't bother with this book unless you like all of the above. I'm usually a fan of Baldacci, but this book reads like some first-time author's old effort that he picked up and tacked on an ending to before he sent it off to his publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I usually really enjoy David Baldacci, but this book was a huge disappointment. I almost quit reading at the beginning due to the gorey description of the first murder scene. Those types of descriptions don't usually bother me, but this one seemed to be worse than most. Add the multiple scenes in the morgue and the description of the smells and it was enough to completely turn me off.There were also too many plots and subplots going on, many of which were really irrelevant to the 'hour game' the murderer was playing.I have to admit, however, that I did enjoy a few of the surprises that came toward the end, although I wish the characters involved would have been more central to the story. While it all fit together nicely in the end, the story would have been more interesting with a bit more foreshadowing tieing some of the secondary characters into the story more closely early in the book.It was OK, but not up to Baldacci's usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hour Game","review":"I was sooooooooo disappointed in this book. I had been waiting for it to be available because I liked the previous one so well. The story was way to long and disjointed. There were way too many characters to keep track of but, most of them got killed anyway. I have never written a review before but, I had to warn someone. Stay away from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"Maxwell and King are not believable. Two Secret Service Agents that both lose dignitaries and both settle in the same small town, what are the odds. They essentially take over homicide investigations from the police chief because every cop in the small town vomits at the site of a dead body. There were a number of inaccuracies in the book. The forensics in the state of the art morgue was more realistic. The storyline was all over the place. Not his best work. I enjoyed a Simple Truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have read all the major works of David Baldacci. I rushed to consume all of his works. Suddenly I hit a brick wall. Hour Game is true to it's title: it has a theme of hours and has your interest for about an hour. It is terribly disjointed, seems written by several authors, and struggles for sense for the last 20 percent of the read. I was terribly disappointed to see this as a Baldacci writing. I'm on a diet and will move on to a new menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"curates egg","review":"'Good in parts' about somes this book up. The scene setting and early chapters were good,very good indeed, drawing me into what seemed a dense and interesting mystery. Some interesting and well presented characters. However, it veered into the realms of fantasy later on and I just lost patience e.g. the two bullets striking each other ??? Get real: this is NEVER going to happen in the real world and such silliness is a huge block for me. I suspected quite early on who the perpetrator was and there was a definite lack of subtlety..unusual for this author.So, first half was quite good but spoiled for me by silliness and loss of realism in the second half."},{"rating":"1","title":"A standard setter","review":"This book sets my standard for one of the worst that I've ever listened to. A friend bought the set of CD's and based on the Baldacci name, I made the error of uploading the CDs into my computer - at least I didn't compound my error by spending my own money. I then completed my error by listening to this \\"book\\" and actually finishing it. The plot is trite and full of holes, the characters are not even two dimensional, and the writing is sophomoric. I previously read one Baldacci book. I won't read another after this junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"Hour Game serves as my intro to the work of David Baldacci, and it hasn't tempted me to try any others of his titles. The 150-plus Amazon reviews of this particular novel are divided into two camps, those who loved it and those who had problems with it, and I'm afraid I fall into the second camp. The plot opens with an enthralling vignette, of the encounter of a deliberate and detached serial killer and his hapless victim. Good beginning. For some reason, however, the plot diverges almost immediately, disintegrating into a hodgepodge of murders that may or may not have been perpetrated by the guy who opened the book. Previous reviewers have done such an admirable job of enumerating and describing the glitches that complicate this book, so I won't belabor the subject. Hour Game ends with a prosaic boat chase, in which our valiant hero comes perilously close to losing his life. Never fear....Nothing new or original here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a break","review":"Mr. Baldacci can do better. On this one he didn't. Maybe he's burned out.

Many life saving plants can be found in the rain forest. This book tells us that it's important to take a stand against the deforestation.This book is one of the We Both Read series where more detailed reading is on the left side of the page for the parent to read and the child's page on the right has only two or three words in larger type.I would recommend this book for children and parents to read together.

But when he found the feisty tomboy alone in the Superstitions, he knew he had to bring her back home for her own good-no matter how hard she fought him. Sam was used to gunmen shooting at him, but he soon realized he faced a new kind of danger with Billie-the danger of losing his heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Valuable","review":"Well written, succinct text in a portable format.

It appears to me that the author has taken a college lecture , xeroxed and folded it and now call it a book. First of all I suggest that the author obtain an editor, having said that , I find the approach very difficult to follow. The book misses many important topics such as coverage of buffers.

Following the events of Sharpe's Triumph, Richard Sharpe is an Ensign who is unhappy with his command. All he wants to do is fight, and instead he becomes the assistant to a corrupt commissary officer. His old nemesis Hakeswill is still alive and well, and allied with corrupt Indian Allies. The third in Sharpe's adventures in India, Cornwell conjures up another unique and rolicking adventure full of danger, blood and beautiful women."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low point in the Sharpe series","review":"After reading this, my first thought was \\"you're grounded Orville, that won't fly.\\" The others in the series I've read were all good or better, this one is weak and poorly constructed. Cornwell spends too much time on secondary characters who aren't interesting. As for Hakeswill, Cornwell made a serious error in judgment by allowing him to return to haunt so many of the books. He's a good villain, but only in small doses. He shows up so much that his quirks and presence quickly grow tiresome and irritating. If this is the only book in the series you've read, don't despair because the others are much better. This one never gets off the ground and is of very poor quality compared to the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharpe in India, part III","review":"This is an excellent series of books on Richard Sharpe, the enlisted man raised to the officer rank after saving the life of the future Duke of Wellington. The reader follows Sharpe from his beginnings in India, through the Napoleonic campaigns to Waterloo, and then in South America at the time of the former Emperor's death. All of the works are detailed, and contain enough action to suit anyone. Since this is a series, and the current works take place before the Napoleon ones, there's no suspense about Sharpe's fate, since he so obviously survives to fight on another day. That doesn't detract from the sheer joy of reading them, however, for you will learn an awful lot about the British army of the early 19th century, not to mention geography, history, and flora and fauna about all of the countries in which our intrepid hero battles.

The steel bands are of the buckling type (rather than the ratcheting or screw type), and it's quite difficult to get them tightened properly.In the case of my '01 S4, this is not even worth it as a temporary solution, especially as the OEM-equivalent CV boot kit (from Raybestos) is less than half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very reasonable and lasts a long time.","review":"I was never a person that wore perfume but I love this smell.

This perfume I was not impressed by. The vanilla was way too strong and has an after smell of old lady and black licorice. I thought maybe I sprayed too much or was just having a weird smelling day, but I've let a few people smell it and they all say the same thing. One of my friends loves this perfume so I gave it to her so at least in some way it was money well spent!

First, it doesn't smell anything like anyone else described. Its a strong smell of sandal wood, which I think smells alright for a house...but not so much as a perfume. Second, its way to strong. I didn't want to waste it so I tried to pawn it off on the girls I work with. All of them said it was not that great and way too strong. So at least I wasn't the only one who thought that way about this perfume. I never write reviews just always read them.

I wasn't sure what I would think of it, but I like it more than I thought it would. The best adjective I can use to describe this scent is soft- this scent was tremendously soft on me. It was so soft, in fact, that I almost couldn't smell it, even after I'd just put it on. The scent that I was trying so hard to smell was that of coconut milk mixed with wood. It's a nice and somewhat unusual fragrance. It does sound a little odd, but the two mix very well together, and the wood ensures that the coconut notes aren't too sweet and overbearing. Overall, I just wish that the scent was stronger. If it was stronger I'd purchase a larger bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fragrance!!","review":"I've been leary of the celebrity created/inspired fragrance, but I picked this up and was pleasantly surprised.

I read the book on first publication 3 years ago and it inspired me to undertake much more detailed research into cacao and chocolate.

Far from being \\"autistic\\" on any level, the author is (as she admits, herself) lovingly obssessed with chocolate.

The muddy production is spot-on (if you've heard any of GBV's more \\"polished\\" albums you'll know what I'm talking about). Actually, this album and others like it (see early Sebadoh and Pavement) were revolutionary in their production methods.

From a historical standpoint, it came out during the early 1990's \\"alernative music\\" rage and critics were looking for artists to champion this new genre.While there are some interesting ideas and quality melodies, this cd is hurt by the poor production and too short length of the songs. \\"I am a Scientist\\", \\"Hot Freaks\\" and \\"Smothered Freaks\\" could have been so much better with higher quality production.In defense of GBV, they were truly a indie band and, for all I know, this was the epitome of a do-it-yourself work that was picked up by a label and then distributed.This was all the rage 20 years ago but there's a reason why you don't hear anything about it today.

I agree with the other review that stated, these are 20 tracks of low quality but the album would have been better with around 10 quality tracks.I don't slam anyone for liking this album.

The sound quality of the lo-fi 4track album was something that a few listens cured. That said the songwriting on this album is simply amazing. Reminiscent of the Beatles and the Who, GBV songs are filtered through a short attention span impared by a case of Budweiser. This album is tuneful and it rocks.

Even though it's short I think it would be confusing. The book is a compilation of the talks (even a lead up to the talks) given at a Carnegie Hall event telling people about alternative schooling. If you're looking for alternatives to the public school, it is worth reading. If you like John Gatto, it's worth reading. If neither of those are the case, I'd skip it. However, the last chapter was a fascinating look at how Plato's Republic has negatively influenced our country. So if that pique's your interest it may still be worth it.

Interestingly enough, there is another John Baines, an Englishman, who is REALLY an Egyptologist, but has nothing to do with these books. That's not a good sign.The second thing that should make you lift an eyebrow is the fact that Mr. Salas is a bit of a cottage industry in his native Chile and elsewhere, as the Founder and Spiritual Master of the Dario Salas Institute For Spiritual Science. Which undoubtedly you can gain enlightenment from. For the right amount of money, of course.There is nothing in this book that cannot be discovered in other, older, and more legitimate works.

This is the personal story of one young boy as he spends the day at Grandma's, waiting for Sunday dinner to be ready. He and his grandmother snuggle and cuddle, then they watch Grandma's fish swimming in the fish tank, then they wait and snuggle some more. The illustrations are very sweet and reading this story makes you feel a sense of warmth and comfort.There was just one thing about this book that I didn't quite like. To me, this book felt as though it were written particularly for one child. It felt so personal that it almost seemed like I was intruding on someone else's story. -Still, all in all, it was a very sweet story.DeeDee Fox, author and illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunk.","review":"This book really stunk.

I settled on this performance by conductor Michael Gielen because I was impressed by his recordings of the Bartok Piano Concertos with pianist Gyorgy Sandor on VoxBox (see my review). Gielen turns in a good account here as well, though the performance of Shostakovich's Concerto for Piano, Trumpet and Orchestra certainly takes a back seat to those by Previn/Bernstein and by the composer himself with Cluytens (see my review of the latter).

I have had to correct and educate scores of people on the realities (and grossly false percieved realities) of Wicca. In the midst of this, I have always wondered where people come up with such bizzarre ideas about Wicca.I now know, however, where people must have been coming up with this stuff....I think they read this book.Christians who really want to be eduacted in a way that you can come to a legitimate understanding of Wicca should not bother with this book.

As a collector of mermaid literature, I was irritated by his conviction that all mermaids are actually pagan idols in the image of some archaic god called \\"Dagon.\\" (Who knows who Dagon was?) I wonder what Benoit would do with the suggestion that the mermaid is a symbol of Mary Magdalen, a favorite of Jesus? My bet is that he would focus on Magdalen being possessed of seven demons while ignoring any positive mention of her.

It is about nature and loving the people around you...and it never says anything rude about God or Jesus...in fact, quite a few of the books I have read say that you should respect the religions around you even when the people don't understand your own.

All they care about is intolerance. Wake up people! I personnaly don't hate christians. But I do hate the fact that some feel as though they have a right to control the religions of others.

This ... author seems to feel that we have \\"Missionaries\\" that roam from home to home wishing to brainwash children, eat them and/or force them to sit and watch Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles.

Mr. Benoit, a self proclaimed \\"Christian\\" and basher of all things rock and roll, seems to be on a mission to single-handedly discredit Christians in general and evangelists in particular. MARVEL at his attacks on the Smurfs. GAPE as he accuses \\"The Little Mermaid\\" of promoting witchcraft (see, since there's a bad witch, it implies there are good witches, and there's no such thing as a mermaid, so the movie is anti-God, and...well, you get the picture). READ IN AMAZEMENT as Mr. Benoit declares Barney to be a subversive Anti-Christ (actually, he may have a point here). Listen, all Christians and social reformers: this guy actually claims he's on your side.

This lashing out--without exception--includes venomous lies and outrageous claims not even in the same world as fact. Why is it that no other religious faith in this world sits about creating obnoxious missives about how evil and wretched Christianity is?

Some aspects of the story are refreshing: the protagonist has a loving relationship with his wife and parents. When is the last time you saw that in a novel? However, the characters all speak in the same \\"voice\\", that is, they all use the same slang and the same sentence structures. Dick Francis is a good example of an author who distinguishes his characters with dialog. There are lot of glaring grammatical errors. There are also several minor plot errors: eg, a character showing up in a different place than he was minutes before.

If this book has 17 reviews that give it an average of 4+ stars, then the author and his family/publisher must be writing them.

It felt rushed.The idea of North Korea was intriguing considering the current situation, and there was a some good elements to the book.In the end, I think the writer has potential.

(I had the impression that the author was being paid by the word.) An editor would have caught these errors; a good editor would have rejected the manuscript as hopeless.Please benefit from my bad experience. 1.Don't buy anything based on glowing reviews without doing additional research. 2.Have a healthy mistrust of obscure publishing companies.

This movie was original, unique, and very well cast and directed. This film also tells the story of a piece of history and a part of the world that is often overlooked and stereotyped. In a day and age where many films are made about \\"ethnic minority\\" immigrants, it was interesting to watch a film depicting the struggles of immigrants from a country in Europe (Hungary) that went through so much turmoil and hardship. The transition of different time periods and places (half the movie is set in Hungary - the other half in Los Angeles) was also smooth and well executed. Lastly, the cast was superb. Each character fit their individual roles perfectly and it was also interesting to see a pre-\\"Lost in Translation\\" Scarlett Johanssen.

Guess who Christian Kim blames for this alleged discrimination? You've got it; the Jews. Christian's books are so boring and predictable; he always focuses on discrimination, racism and Jews. The level of hypocrisy shown never ceases to amaze me e.g. Christian complains of being a victim of racism when he is a racist himself. Please avoid Christian's poor books, they really are [...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of a Christian","review":"If there is anything I believe in, that is that Christian is good. You should read this book and you will see. He writes in an empathetic way about the suffering of Korean parents and Korean youth in America. I was moved to tears. Christian has a heart of Christ -- full of love and understanding. But from some of the hateful comments that I have read, I can see that he is also like Jesus Christ in that although not because of his guilt, he had enemies in the figure of the Pharisees and the Sadducees, who hated him and tried to kill him. It is unfortunate that not all love the light. Some love the darkness as the Bible tells us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written from a Jewish perspective!","review":"I get the impression that the author is a Jew, who wishes to give a Jewish perspective on the experiences of Koreans' in America. He appears to be clueless as to the lifestyle of a typical Korean family living in America. Kim over-estimates the role of Confucianism. Many Koreans' ignore the traditional rules of Confucianism and adopt the more liberal American approach to life. Kim argues that Koreans are isolated, persecuted and racially abused in the U.S. This is simply not true, many Koreans' are very well integrated in American society and experience very little racial discrimination. One only needs to look at the over-representation of Koreans' in American universities to see that they are not discriminated against; in fact if anything, they benefit from positive discrimination (an abhorrent policy of the American left wing). This book really is a waste of money and time. Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More rubbish written by the 'sex pest'","review":"This is yet another of Christian Kim's terrible books. Christian gives a biased and stereotypical account of Korean's living in the U.S. He claims Koreans are an oppressed minority that suffer discrimination from white Americans and Jews (Kim's favourite group).

This may be appropriate for a biography, but it certainly is not appropriate for a book describing an ethicity of people.

This book is extremely brief, and you'd be better off learning about Korean Americans from a biography or from a more documented source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a disappointment. I found it to be tedious and very poorly written. The book failed to hold my attention as it merely rambled on about the stereotypical views of Koreans and other Asian races living in America. There were many false statistics that the author may have invented himself and inconsistencies in the main text. The book appears to have been rushed into publication as the quality is typical of what you would find in a rough draft. The book contained material that some readers may find offensive. The material in question had anti-Semitic undertones.This book is very poorly written and not worth any of your money - avoid!Kim should seek a new career path in life because writing books appears not to be his strong point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather poor","review":"I found this book by Kim to be a disappointment. I bought this book, hoping that it would provide some insight into the plight of Koreans around the world.I was very disappointed to find that it consisted of false/inaccurate statistics and stereotypical views of Koreans, which were reinforced throughout the book. It was also very poorly written and badly edited, that's if it was edited at all.The author tries to make out that Koreans are 'down-trodden' in all walks of life in foreign countries. I find this to be a fallacy when there are many examples of Koreans being given the same opportunities as the locals in other countries and going on to achieve considerable success. It maybe true that Kim has suffered some sort of discrimination but this is certainly not true for all Koreans.This book appears to be the rushed work of an amateur, who needs to seek professional help when it comes to writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"I'm afraid this book gets the thumbs down from me.

He leaves me absolutely perplexed. I bumped this cd in my car and was literally left speechless, it is that deep, and definately of the highest quality. His messages, lyrics, fluency, rythms, beats, and overall composition is stupendous! Second to none. I don't know what else to say. KRS is real, to the core. He is deep and profoundly spiritual (which has a major effect on me). He raps with power, and authority, and it hits you hard. He definately raps with true, righteous, holy spirit. What he says is real. I believe he is in a class of his own, the highest of classes. KRS is one of the untouchables. The substance and depth of his overall musicianship and creativity flows with such tremendous mastery that it will penetrate your soul and knock you to your feet. Big up, KRS! You gave us a masterpiece. Thank-you (and thanks for a clean version too). Keep your art coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Half and Half","review":"Not his best stuff. He's running short of lyrical ideas, he recycles his own lines, like Star Wars recycles \\"I have a bad feeling about this\\".Beats are usually cool, I don't care for the popish tracks with the singing. I didn't mind it so much when he sang REALLY BAD back on his first album, but now it's no longer funny, it sounds like pop.Anyhow, organized religion is crap. I thought KRS understood this back in the day. What happened? Now he's got his own little organization and his own little phylosophy, and his only little diciples and crap, I dunno, it's posative, but then again it's gay like some of his modern tracks.Anyhow it is cheap, if you have to finish off your collection as I do, then buy it, otherwise go buy his anything BoomBap on back.

Someone suggested that if I liked A Tribe Called Quest, and the early Jay Z material (i.e. Reasonable Doubt), I would probably like this, latest, KRS One release. Unfortunatly they were wrong, I found the cd to be slow starting, the beats weren't really all that much to keep me interested, and KRS One's harsh voice comes off a little too crude for me. Don't even get me started on his egotistical \\"rhymes\\" after about the fifth track I'm tired of hearing how he was the first, and still is the best and how recent artists aren't that great. This one is a sleeper folks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is REAL HIPHOP!!!!","review":"I've been a fan of KRS ONE since the beginning (1986).

KRS-ONE has had a well over a decade of destruction and the brother keeps going. This album here touches on a lot of topics. From the government and what it means to have false pride and a bum(you'd understand once you pick up the album). His rhymes always make sense and it has a plot to it That you can use in everyday life.I have been listening to hip hop since '83. KRS never seems to let me down.

He is an ADULT communicating to ADULTS. I have read the other reviews and like them i enjoy the h_ll out of this CD. I cant help thinking that the message is lost with the other reviewers. This album has a very action oriented focus. Many artist tell a story but KRS has words on how to effect the ending. \\"I will make it\\" and \\"Raptism\\" are my two favorites. As i get older and my time in the club decreases and my bills and responsibilties increase \\"Lifestyles of the rich and famous\\" over phat beats is less and less interesting to me.

So I figured now she's got her jazz cred half originals half covers album out of the way the training wheels will come off and she'll make a comprehensive artistic statement. Well it seems more like she just sank into industry-conscious mediocrity. There isn't even a single Mushaboom here, let alone a whole album of them. The single My Moon My Man is driven by an irrtatingly simplistic three-chord piano part with a one-beat rhythmmic loop and the majority of the album is similarly governed by tight regimented rhythms that allow the songs to move only in a rigid graceless fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised","review":"I actually purchased this for a friend before I bought it for myself. I admit, I discovered her once I looked up that catchy song from the iPod commercials.

That song aside (a decent song ruined by Apple overuse), this is one h@%% of a cd. In a day and age when it is impossible to hear two songs in a row on a cd, it is very refreshing to pop this baby in and experience a wide range of moods as the themes harmoniously flow from track to track. There is nothing more for me to say, buy the cd - excellent voice, writing and melodies. Also, if you are a big fan of this cd, I also recommend the unknown but similarly talented Sasha Dobson (Modern Romance CD)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent (just another glowing review)","review":"I don't really have anything profound to say, or anything much different than the other glowing reviews here. I just absolutely love, love this album. I hear something different every time I listen to it and it's always good. Her voice is in a class all it's own, and it's so beautiful and lyrical to listen to. I love the different faces of Feist throughout each of her songs. This album came from someone who truly loves music, and who truly enjoys expressing herself through music.I love Feist! And I dearly love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I gotta say that my music taste goes in pretty much any direction that doesn't lead to speed metal or cheesy country music. I was at work when I got the chance to listen to free music online so I chose this album based on one song I'd heard: '1234'. I was pleasantly surprised with the entire thing. Some songs are a bit slow for my taste, but it's a good accomplishment when an artist actually has more than 3 good songs on their album. Nice to just chill out to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feist a winner","review":"I was so glad to hear Feist on the Grammy's. She is such an interesting performer and deserves the exposure. I bought this because of the Apple 1-2-3-4 song but love it for all of her song choices. It's a great background CD, one to play when it's raining outside, a rather slow and contemplative (kind of calming) music choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"two worthwhile songs and the rest is painful","review":"I have never felt compelled to write a CD review, but this set of recordings is so poorly done that I have to try to save others from wasting their money. There are two tracks of merit: \\"My Moon My Man\\" which you have heard on TV commercials for a certain cell phone company and \\"1234\\" which you heard in the new VideoNano commercials. These two tracks are well done. The balance of the CD sounds as though it was recorded in a bad studio with a very low quality mixing board. I'm certain you will agree that the first two songs are an odd combination of muffled instruments and piercingly high treble vocals. This CD is a great argument for buying songs one at a time from a web music seller versus buying the whole CD. If I could return this CD, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her voice doesn't cut it.","review":"The Reminder by Feist is considered one of the best albums of 2007 but in my opinion, this cd is pretty forgettable.

People may adore this woman but she isn't gonna break ground anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get It","review":"For the life of me, I don't get what the hype is. She does indeed sound like a junior high kid on YouTube. I can't really address the lyrics because she is almost impossible to understand.

Boy, what a disappointment!! I couldn't believe it! I really don't understand what the fuss is about over this album. All hype.The album is poorly produced. Every song sounds the same, and at times I didn't know where one song ended and another began. Most of the songs lack passion and committment and if the artist doesn't care, why should I?There are a few good songs: \\"1234\\", \\"Past in Present\\", \\"I Feel It All\\"Feist can obviously sing, and is talented. But this album - The Reminder - is not a good example or showcase for it.It's like a watered down version of a folk singer. Most of the songs sound like different versions of each other.I am giving it 2 stars because: she's talented and can sing, and because of the few good songs.MY SUGGESTION: If you are really wanting this album, download a few songs first - don't spend a lot of money. See if you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing despite the reviews","review":"I bought the album because of the rave reviews and because I like folksy music, but I was disappointed.

However, since then, upon countless listens to the record, i've come to realize that Feist is something more.Feist's second, The Reminder is similar. It's like a chocolate covered tootsie-roll pop, sweet at the beginning but with each lick you get a bit more taste of the delicate soft center you're working towards. For Feist, the center is elegant yet casual, sharp yet well-rounded, and gets better with each lick."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tour de force. It will grab you!","review":"Feist's voice is a terrific instrument, with cool jazz singer style, and the melodies she sings are captivating. To top it off, the arrangements and production are lean enough for you to enjoy her voice, and quirky enough (banjos, anyone?) to be really interesting. Even better -- the lyrics are poignant.I admit that I felt silly about getting an album because I liked the ditty from the Nano commercial, but I've been absolutely delighted with the album. And I still love \\"One two three four\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Music","review":"Absolutely lovely cd. Bought it for the counting song (1234) because it is guaranteed to bring a great big smile to my granddaughter's face. Found that I enjoyed the entire CD.

I recomend buying the cannon bag designed for the camera. I will probobly do that and get rid of this one.But on the plus side, the belt strap is kind of nice. It connects on the bottom with velcro and a button so it can be attached without taking off one's belt or attached to anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely put this on your to-read list. Very cool.","review":"Ok, so this is a little more low-brow than the last guy's review, but I have to say that this book is just so cool. I understand why it's still around after a couple thousand years. There's no mincing words in here. Totally passionate, without any smarty-head professor putting in his 2 cents about the story. You can just enjoy it for what it is. Definitely put it on your to-read list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely reproductions","review":"I'm really pleased with this book - the reproductions of the paintings are excellent with really vibrant colors and detail. My kids enjoyed finding the items on each page. It would be nice if there were more things to hunt for, but we've enjoyed making up our own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"I work at a library and bring this book home frequently but decided to go ahead and purchase. My children (ages 6 & 9) both love sitting down to look at this book. This book is enjoyable to a fairly wide range of ages--I'd recommend 5 and up if an age label was needed. A great introduction to art too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have bought it, but...","review":"I seriously considered this book against other books featuring artworks and aimed at young children.

I chose to spend my money elsewhere..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great art for the preliterary set","review":"This is a lovely book with which to introduce the alphabet and classical art to your child(ren). Each two-page spread contains, on the lefthand page, the jingle \\"I spy with my little eye something beginning with ... \\" and the upper and lower case of a letter of the alphabet, while the righthand page contains a large reproduction of a work of art by one of the masters -- Rousseau, Hogarth, Picasso, Botticelli, Vermeer, Sargent, Renoir, Seurat, etc. Kids can think about the alphabet while being exposed to some great art.Terrific idea!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fond Memories","review":"I have very fond memories of this book from childhood. I remember my mother bringing it home one day from the bookstore, and we curled up in bed one night and I was introduced to both the wonderful game of \\"I Spy\\" and twenty-six masterpieces from the world's greatest artists. While I already knew my alphabet quite well, it helped me expand my vocabulary (I learned what a magpie was, for example) and think \\"outside the box\\". Honestly, at the time, it wasn't my favorite book in my library, but I always picked it up and begged my mother to sit down and play \\"I Spy\\" with me. Currently, I'm a twenty-one year old college student. Because of the book, I already have a leg up in my art history classes, and continue to keep the book close to me at all times. I highly recommend this book for young children (buy the hardback version!) and can almost guarantee it will be treasured for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"in a nutshell - meh","review":"I am a programmer, and in a programming language book, I expect to find syntactical diagrams of the language. Anyone can read those, we should not have to glean the diagram from the wordy explanation. It's fine to have all the verbiage, but head each section with the syntax diagram.Also, this book goes into lengthy explanations of what object oriented programming is NOT, as on page 104. This is a very bad practice in teaching. Only teach what is correct, not what some novice might ignorantly think. I have gotten better fundamentals in Java free on the w3c site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Java In A Nutshell, 5th Edition","review":"The book does not cover GUI (AWT & Swings), and suggest you need to purchase yet another book.

The sample code is not helpful and examples are few and far between.There is nothing in this book regarding the image processing capabilities of Java. The author skipped that part of the language entirely.I returned this book and paid the return shipping because I would rather put some of my money towards another book than have this book sit on my shelf and never get used. Buying \\"Java SE 6\\" by Murach Steelman instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible","review":"I use this Java book more than any other programming book I've ever had. That's probably because it's a reference book. Although all the reference material I could need is available online, I still like having the book on the desk next to me so I can look up a class or a method without playing around on the computer.

Despite that, it there is no waste. The book sis jammed with all the basic information about the language, tools, and major packages of Java. A must have for Java programmers, professional and hobbyists alike. The only complaint I can think of is that some of the class descriptions are a bit light but really, it's just a reference and there's always Javadocs and Internet sources.A great feature is the binding. I know, the binding? With a book this size, it's real easy to crack the spine and end up with loose pages falling out. This book overcomes that problem. You can even lie it flat most of the time so that it stays open."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a great book and this is a must for a 72 hour kit, a lot of people do not think about it but these are a must for them in the Arizona area."},{"rating":"2","title":"should've come from the factory with these installed!","review":"I installed these on my 2006MX5 GT. Did it all by myself in my garage with simple hand tools, I was able to remove the old shocks and spring assemblies using a spring compressor. But I brought them to my local garage to have the new springs mounted on my shocks and have them reassembled, then with I brought them home and reinstalled them. Just like all the DIY's on Miata.net drove it around the block gently before setting torque on the bottom bolts. Then didn't get an alignment until about 30days of driving. Lowered exactly the amount specified and the stance of the car was well improved. You can't really tell that I have these springs on them until I park beside one with stock springs. Ride comfort wasn't sacrificed, well except when trying to clear some of the humungous speed bumps.

I would recommend finding another version of this text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Syntax of the moods & tenses of the Greek Verb","review":"This is an excellent re-production of W.W.Goodwin'spublication of 1889. It still has the original examples in small type but the section introductions are in larger print and certainly easier to read. Paperback form is a disadvantage for such a reference book,no doubt to keep the price down for students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read publisher warning!","review":"Useful book with all the disadvantages spelled out by earlier reviewers. For myself, although I read the publisher's caution that the book can be read in landscape orientation only, I discovered that it was incompatible with the iPad unless I enabled the device's setting to freeze the orientation. Otherwise, no matter how the iPad was held, the text orientation changed to an unreadable angle. This is presumably not a problem on an actual Kindle. Fortunately, Amazon allows returns of Kindle books within 7 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning","review":"Potential readers and buyers of this book should be aware that the authors are sede-vacantists, who believe that Vatican II was not a legitimate Council and that John XXIII, Paul VI, John Paul I and John Paul II were/are not legitimate popes.If you can cope with that, you will find that the first half of the book is a fascinating history of the Church, full of historical detail that is hard to find elsewhere. The second half of the book, dealing with Vatican II and the years since, is also fascinating, revealing a great deal that has been kept from ordinary folk. It is possible to read it without necessarily agreeing with all the opinions and conclusions of the authors.I liked the beautiful production of the book, which made it a pleasure to the eye, even while some of the contents (for instance about changes in the Church) were quite disturbing to the mind and heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"-a pro-Vatican II Catholic reviewer","review":"I've spoken with Father Radecki and I must say that he does make some good points.

Unfortunately, that's not what I was looking for.This is not a book for specifics on the craft. The 73 notations by published authors in this book are everything serious writers will hear at writing meetings, conferences and critique groups. They are, in some cases, inspirational, but don't offer the specifics new writers need for structure and development.This might work as a nice, general gift if you have a friend who is a writer and you don't know which books on structure they might like. If you are a serious writer, I recommend spending cash first on Plot and Structure by James Scott Bell.

This one does offer improved sound quality in many respects... when it's not clipping. I mean, every forte section of the music has horrible clipping distortion.

It is definitive. In purity of voice and in uncompromising schmaltz, Dover is one of a kind. But, hey, the world needs at least one Dover to remind the more cynical among us that there is something to measure our cynicism against. It would be nice, perhaps, if she did not feel compelled to accompany herself all the time on voice-over -- her solo voice is more than good enough.

The phases are well-explained alongwith important elements like pragmatic issues, entry-exit criteria.For those attempting to bring more structure to their development process, this book's utility can be enhanced with knowledge of design patterns, and previous OOAD experience. One can certainly modify / improve the various deliverables covered in the book to their own needs.I do wish for a better title and singular focus on UML, now that it is a standard.

Plus, since I'm the one reading to her everyday, I wanted some books that I like too! It's a full size hard cover book that has all six stories in their original color and format.

Certainly the research strongly points towards cranberry in its role for prevention of UTIs and limited research that indicated cranberry for treatment,...which in this case, I thought it worked for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"european motley crue","review":"There's so much to say to this CD, but my topic says it all...It's a mix between 'girls....' from motley and 'appetite..' from guns...

My Doctor said Wrist Cuffs can be -10% off just because of taking the reading at the wrist and not on the arm next to the heart, just like taking your bp on the right arm. The further from you heart the lower your readings.Example: The doctor takes my BP then I take it with the cuff monitor He/she sys its 110/56 54 beats/min where this one reads 151/93 60 beats/min. We tried it several times and each time it was incorrect. So he told me not to use it. I bought a simular unit, no date, time on the screen, but stores 99 prior readings, tested again with the doctor's nurse and found it to be within limits.

For example, in the morning I got a reading of 89 over 79. In the afternoon it was 188 over 155. Then a bit later it was 155 over 150, nearly a flat line indicating death. At my doctor's the reading was a very normal 118 over 78. It's a wonder this little machine didn't cause me to keel over just from shock. I don't recommend it to anyone. Mine is on its way back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly Inaccurate Device","review":"I read other reviews and am mystified at how other people feel they are getting good results with this unit. My results closely follow the other negative feedback with measurements off by as much as 50-90 points. The pulse measurement seems reasonably consistent, but blood pressure is a total crap shoot. With a cuff measurement consistently around 124 over 68 the wrist unit seems to stay closer to 170 to 200 over 80 to 99. If it were consistent you could add a correction factor, but it is wildly inconsistent. In a few minutes of testing I got readings as low as 99 over 61 and high as 214 over 101 with typical readings around 195 over 99. Although the unit has some nice features, it takes almost twice as long to get these inaccurate readings as other units I've tested.

My wife found these Special K Bars and we keep a supply on hand. They're only 90 calories each and have a low fat content. They're made from whole grains. How bad can that be?I tend to prefer the strawberry variety. My wife has a preference for the Chocolate Drizzle. It really doesn't matter. I tend to think they're too sweet, too much like candy, but every once in a while I'll have one. When I'm carrying my lunch to work, I sometimes include one. We buy the large box and keep them in a sealed container. They have a long shelf life and must contain a lot of preservatives. Oh well, they're not a bad snack on those rare occasions. I might add that we never use them as a breakfast food.Gary Peterson"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Search Is Finally Over!","review":"I came across this documentary by chance, not long after seeing the \\"Ghost and the Darkness\\" on the big screen. I was in one of those video-rental chain stores, (coincidentally, with the friend who took me to see the movie) and this movie was in an \\"employee's pics\\"-type section. We rented it, with no hesitation, as I had discredited the \\"based on a true story\\" intro. to the \\"G&tD\\", while my friend did not. This documentary erased whatever doubt may have lingered, while it also explained \\"How?\\", and \\"Why?\\"-which is why it was so memorable to both of us. I have since read J. Patterson's book, \\"The Man-Eaters of Tsavo\\", which holds his first-hand account of the events which are put to life in the \\"G&tD\\"... but the lions' history/background was covered best in this documentary. It's not \\"Hollywood\\", and one shouldn't expect it to be... however, it DOES document the reality behind the \\"G&tD\\", & shouldn't be overlooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another dissapointment","review":"'The Ghost and the Darkness' fell way short of my expectations and I had hoped this documentary would do the subject justice. Unfortunately, 'Maneaters of Tsavo' sucks worse than 'The Ghost and the Darkness'. Every aspect of the production - the filming, narrration, editing, etc - is amateurish. Its like watching a home video of someones trip to Africa. And who cares what Val Kilmer and Michael Douglas have to say on the subject? They're just a couple of dopey actors. Just because they starred in and produced a crappy hollywood version of the story doesnt mean they're authorities on the subject. I also have my doubts about the 'veteran guides' and 'renowned experts' featured in the video. They offer no insight or revelation, as you might expect 'renowned' experts to do. Don't waste your time or money, theres no education to be had from this video. Its not even worth giving away. My copy is headed for the dumpster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cognitive Analytic viewpoints","review":"This book is written for the small group of folks who are Cognitive Analytic therapists CAT. It has a well meaning and workmanlike apprach but its not very user friendly, but analytic appraoches tend not to be. There is something dated about the analytical approach to early life experince. Murray Cox work with offenders in Brooadmoor is analytical but has more clarity and I found it more inspiring. The supposed integration of Freudian analysis and CBT always seems a bit lumpy. The CAT dilemmas traps and snags just seem very thin after Wards five implicit beliefs that inform offending.Good lives are raised at the start, it seems to me Wards Good lives theory and Narrative therapy is a neater and cleaner integration.

After 45 minutes into the movie, I became mystified as to why someone would give a 5 star rating. Simply put, movie was choppy, lacked entertainment value, and the dialogues sucked. During the second half, I realized this movie is actually a (cheap) spin off of Bill Murrays movie \\"Broken Flowers\\". Movie is nothing compared to rab ne bana di jodi (a true 5 star movie).

Pastor Boli, with his very limited English, was not able to read the final production so was unable to even identify the kind of language used in his story's English version.

I tend to underline about the romance instead of the suspense cos the suspense still can't compare to those belongs to Marry Higgins Clark. But it's very amazing and thrilling waiting for and seeing the relationship between the female & male main characters here.

This book would have been great if it was comprised of only the first and last 5 chapters. Everything in between was a drag.The characters weren't the least bit appealing.

I am not a big fan of her early novels, her most recent work is tremendous! Charade is probably her best work that I have read. It pulls you in from the begining, and won't let you go until the last page has been turned. There are so many twists and turns in the plot, but all plausble. The charcters are believable and likable. I spent the whole book trying to figure out who the killer was, and was totally blown away once revealed. Brown knows how to take a great suspense story and weave in a little bit of romance and do it all with style. She has definatley turned me into a fan with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story with Heart!","review":"CHARADE is an interesting mix of romance and suspense. You have Cat Delaney who has a new heart and a TV show she's always wanted to do - a show about children with special needs. She meets an ex-cop who now writes books and together they begin a journey to find out why other heart transplant patients are being killed.The storyline is not new, but the way Sandra Brown tells this story is great! When I was reading it I was laughing, crying and then immediately trying to figure out who could possibly be the villain. This book is much better than Brown's earlier attempts at mixing romance and mystery, but not as terrific as her later books. The more Sandra Brown writes, the better her stories become! If you've never read any of her books, I suggest that you start with the ones written about 1994 or later - they are definitely great parables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful, but not realistic","review":"Brown needs to work on her verisimilitude a bit with respect to human behavior and psychology. Alex Pierce's character was more than a bit unbelievable. And the undercover cop in the bar? Please.Also, there were too many coincidences in this novel. One of the first rules that a fiction writer learns is not to use coincidences--instead, everything must make sense plausibly. Too many events fall into place by sheer luck, which is annoying. This isn't a book of fantasy and magic, after all.Also, the language is unnecessarily vile at times, which can be distracting, especially during romantic scenes when Brown is trying to set the mood.Now that I've gotten the caveats out of the way, this novel *is* suspenseful, especially as you get toward the end. And the person who did it is a BIG surprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will stop your heart from beating....literally.","review":"The is a real page-turner. The best of Sandra Brown's work. Cat believes she is in love but can't be sure if the man she loves is in love with her or the woman he thinks got his dead lovers heart. It makes you gasp as the pages turn and the characters get more confusing in their real motives and it all comes down to the basic emotion love. Who is he in love with? I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspenseful and Romantic","review":"This was a very enjoyable read. I may be biased b/c I'm a huge Sandra Brown fan, and this one does not disappoint. Cat, the beautiful soap opera star, undergoes a heart transplant, leaves the glamorous life behind and starts a new life helping abandoned and abused children. Then she starts getting newspaper clippings in the mail, anonymously, that have to do w/ others who had transplants the same day she had hers, who have died mysteriously on the anniversary of their transplant and she senses that she may be next. She meets Alex Pierce, a former cop turned novelist, who helps her to solve the mystery. Cat and Alex, of course, fall for each other, but Alex has some mysteries of his own, and without spoling it, suffice it to say that after they make love the first time and Alex kisses the scar from her transplant, there's a lot more to that kiss than we first realize. That's all I say about that. It's a great book, and one I know I'll read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was on the edge of my seat!","review":"I am a BIG fan of Sandra Browns books!

A lot less sex this season, but then treason trials, miscarriages, heretic burnings and royal beheadings don't really add up to effective foreplay - or at least not in Texas. (I've never been to England.) But much more actual history than previously and a lot more character development. All in all, a great season, with an extremely moving final episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Henry The 8th","review":"Another hit show filled with a beautiful cast.

As I recall from my history books, though they were mere overviews of the period, what I saw depicted in the Tudor series was a lot as I remembered it. The actors did a fine job depicting their characters and I was more than pleased with my purchase. I look forward to getting more on the series.

This season was excellent and you are really starting to see the tyrant in which I and many others find King Henry the 8th to be. I have started to hate King Henry more and more and that is by the great acting of Meyers. You know an actor is really good when they make you feel the way you should about that type of character. But all in all this season was really very good, and I am truly going to miss Anne Boleyn's part on the show, she was portrayed wonderfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why doesn't the subtitle appear?","review":"I couldn't wait to watch season 2 of the Tudors, but to my dismay, the subtitles won't appear on the screen.

Dialogue right out of the worst scripts Hollywood put forth, but this is not fun, as those scrpts and presentations were. This is a bore, and Henry VIII had paintings done of him; he was very tall and very fat, but, he was intelligent too, when not letting sex get the better of him, and this Henry is very dumb. The acting, as in part I, terrible, especially this Henry. Stock gestures of thge 60s and 70s when this period was portrayed. No sense at all about the precariousness of life in those days, and the fear of assasination, of untimely death, and madness. All nuances are missing.See Young Bess, Charles Laughton as Henry..anything but this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still three wives...","review":"I was rather deceived by the second season of The Tudors.

Natalie Dormer does an awesome performance as the Lady Anne Bolyen. She ivites you to experince the drama and demands you to pay close attention to her eyes, her words and her actions. It was Ms. Dormer performance that inspired me to watch the Tudors season 1,2, and 3 over and over again. The Tudors is a historic documentry worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showtime? BBC maybe, both Excellent, Henry lives.","review":"I have read the other reviews, and totally agree with them, very, very well done indeed. My only query is that the series seems to be done by the BBC, and probably the cost is shared by Showtime. Either way this is well worth seeing, the acting is nothing short of miraculous. Don't be upset by the historical questions, it really doesn't matter that much. Being educated in England, and having History crammed down my throat, for several years I thought that this series was very entertaining indeed. Henry VIII was well known to be a willful character, and very influenced by his entourage. You should try and see Keith Michell series, also well done by the BBC. This is also available from Amazon as \\"The Six Wives of Henry VIII\\".The Six Wives of Henry VIII"},{"rating":"2","title":"Natalie Dormer reigned in season 2","review":"Season 2 was superb. The casting was just magnificent Henry and Anne were brilliantly cast the chemistry between them was unbelievable.Natalie Dormer was the winner in season 2 she simply was Anne. At the end of season 1 I was so happy that I knew she was going to lose her head soon. In season 2 I was unable to watch the final episode where she was beheaded. I had to watch at a month or so later I was so emotionally caught up in the series. She truly deserves an Oscar( if only the gave on for cable productions) for her performance in this series.I can't wait for season 3 but I will really miss Natalie Dormer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Temptations - Christmas Celebration (Unbelievable harmony ..... sung only from the soul)","review":"I miss Eddie Kendricks.

It spun an invisable thread that pulled me in and wouldn't let me put it down until I finished it. Its gorgeous, beautiful prose flows so smoothly and its lovely images that it projects are like poetry. I utterly reccomend this book! This book begins with young Morgan (before she became Morgan le Fay) living with her older yet more timid sister Morgause, her beautiful mother Ingraine, her beloved father who has an aweful fate, and her nurse who is really a wise woman. Morgan sees her father die a gruesome death and her mother be taken away by the evil king Uther Pendragon, and she doesn't know what to do. Between finding a magic stone and discovering her true powers of fey, and setting her eyes upon a beautiful boy named Thomas, then leading him to his own death, you can almost relate to Morgan as a real teenager, yet she is so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"More More...","review":"Personally, I finished the book wanting more.

As you might imagine, most guides share quite a lot in common. If I were using a field guide to simply look at a backyard bird, I might equally well use my Peterson's Guide or my NGS Field Guide to the Birds of North America. All three of these guides have good art and organization, and are very usable. I think this is the best guide for FIELD use for several reasons: 1) The size and shape easily fit in a normal pocket. 2) The weather resistant materials the book is made of. 3) The way birds are grouped, by similarities in behavior, habitat, and appearance, allows for easy comparison and rapid identification of a species. The authors have obviously put a lot of thought into the design and organization of this book and it has a lot to offer both the beginning and advanced birder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever used in terms of organization. The color coding is done with these vaguely differing colors which are only differentiated in the best of light, the numbers shown on the inside of back and front covers are never explained, and there are quirky things such as why do they list \\"Swimmers\\" twice without an explanation -- if I'm trying to identify a swimming bird why not group them together?

What made me decide on this book is that it can easily fit in your pocket, it has a waterproof cover, and it has much more information about the various types of birds, including information about whether or not various species are declining and/or threatened or endangered. But I think the point that others have made, that the Golden Guide has more and slightly better illustrations, is well taken.

I would probably be better off, just throwing it in the garbage and buying another brand monitor for 25 dollars. Not a good way of doing business. I'll spread the word on this bad buy!

For what you get compared to what you pay, it's a great deal for all those people that don't want those silly looking things hanging off their ears.Battery life is great because of an auto off feature that turns the unit off after 5 minutes of being disconnected from your phone, the only downside of this is that you have to press a button to turn it on when you get back into your car.Sound quality for people on both ends seems to be good. Only a few times have I had trouble with the speaker not being loud enough.Difficult to dial handsfree, I gave up with the voice commands and now dial with my phone.Incoming calls have an annoyingly loud ring.A couple times I've had problems with static/interference in the speaker, but a hang up and redial fixes the problem.Overall I'm very happy with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable, low feature, handsfree."},{"rating":"2","title":"HF820 Bluetooth","review":"This hands free device works great, I am told that it sound clear with no background noise, it takes a little playing with the controls but once you get it figured out the operation of it is easy.

The only way to turn it off was to let it discharge completely. It would then reset and connect to the cell phone. Motorola told me the unit was defective.

After doing that it worked fine until a week later. This time, though fully chagred, it would not turn on. Unplugged the circuit and has worked since OK.

I found this unfair to the people she had hurt, and rather unprofessional in a Biographer, who should keep some objectivity.But overall it gives a great detailed story of Ingrid Bergman's life, career, and many loves.

It's a somewhat spare novel, an almost quiet novel, and it is moving and emotional. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, but good read","review":"This is the first book I've read by Anita Shreve and while it's not going to list under my top 10 favorites, it did make me want to read more of her stories.The setting is an old refurbished house with a young girl and her father. They find a baby in the snow and rush her to the hospital. Originally, I thought the story was going to move around the baby and the young girl and father trying to adopt her, but the story takes a much different turn. You'll have to read to find out.It only took me a day to finish the book. It wasn't an \\"edge of your seat\\" thriller, nor a die-hard romance, but there was a little suspense and some love in the pages. The ending wrapped up with a nice little bow and I was happy. I didn't have any problem with the writing or the story; I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because for me, a 5 star book has to be a story that stays with me and won't let me go. This story didn't do that, but I would still recommend it for a stormy night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A heart wrenching tale of love, grief, loss and regret","review":"Shreve's detailed writing style creates not only vivid visual imagery but such a deep emotional response to the characters that you feel as if you are living through the story with them. This type of storytelling is not lost on this novel.Light on Snow is told from the perspective of a 12 yr old girl who makes a transition to a young woman through the unfolding of events in this story. From finding an abandoned newborn, to making peace with the loss of a baby sister; the symmetry of this book is not only engrossing but inescapable.A heart wrenching tale of love, grief, loss and regret that you can finish in on evening and not forget anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"through the eyes of a child","review":"Light on Snow is told from the perspective of a 12 yr old girl who makes a transition to a young woman through the unfolding of events in this story that coincide with nature's changes in her body. Anita writes from this angle so well that she enables you to identify with the thought process of Nicky(12 yr old) and by doing this it is easy to enter into the heart and soul struggle and grief of Charlotte, the teenage mother. Unfortunately the ending does not complement the story...the crescendo of emotions and ideas are left with an undesirable and short changed conclusion. The underlying tragedy of Nicky and father that are flashed back upon are good..but the father's present state is almost just a little too unbelievable. Worth the read for the experience of being 12 going on 20 and a heart wrenching tale of being used deceived and regretful , but just a caution on the ending...that it may feel like a letdown. All in all..still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read","review":"~~~This is my first Anita Shreve book. I was utterly taken in by her writing from page one. Her words are simple yet elegant, the characters are real and so human and the plot has interesting twists and turns. The bond between Nicky and her father, which is defined by their grief, makes for a unique father daughter story. The ending certainly left me wanting more of these compelling characters.~~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Devistating, brilliant read","review":"This is my second Anita Shreve book. I found both to be brilliantly written (engaging, envolving, true to life) and yet emotionally devistating. This one in particular, as I have a one year old daughter.Shreve is a master at simple language, simple emotion communicated so powerfully. Her writing draws you in and in my case stays with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast read, but not as good as other Shreve novels","review":"I am a huge Anita Shreve fan and I awaited this novel with much anticipation. As with all of her novels, it is very well written, she makes you care about the characters, and she writes about their sad situation with poignancy. Some parts of the story are very, very sad and I believe she does a very good job of describing the pain and hopelessness of one who has suffered such a tragic loss.But .... the ending is just terrible. I was expecting a turning point for the main characters and, although this was hinted at, she stopped short of delivering. Even more annoying is the fact that there were many loose ends left untied.This is a good book if you're looking for a fast read with emotional depth, but don't expect a satisfying ending. A better choice would be \\"The Weight of Water\\", \\"The Last Time They Met\\", or my absolute favorite, \\"Resistance\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story","review":"I had never read Anita Shreve's work before this book. It was very heartwarming, especially as it was told through young Nicky's perspective. I only wish it hadn't ended so abruptly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story; weak ending","review":"Other reviews have laid out the story of 12 year old Nicky and her chance encounter with the teenage mother. The story reads smoothly and quickly and the characters are pretty believable, especially Nicky who at times seems a child and at other times, a young woman. A few incidents in the story are a bit of a stretch and I felt the ending week; however, good story, quick read, and great for light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Purchase","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Anita Shreve, so I wasn't sure what to expect. Judging by many of the other reviews on this site, I should have picked another of her many novels. Light on Snow starts out on an intriguing note, but it just doesn't pay off. Nicky and Charlotte are interesting characters, and the conversations between them are the most believable in the book. Unfortunately, I never bought the idea of the adult narrator looking back at a traumatic summer of her childhood. As several other reviewers have pointed out, Shreve never gives any sense of the grown-up Nicky or how her relationship with her father evolves. Strictly one to check out from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing....","review":"I've read everything by Shreve I could get my hands on. When this one came out, I was really looking forward to it. It started out very interestingly and the idea was wonderful. She could have done so much with the story idea and the characters, so as I read, I just wanted it to keep going... But then, it seemed very suddenly, it just ended. I was totally confused. I had many pages left, only to realize that it was the author's favourite fiction and the reading group guide. I honestly feel cheated - there is no resolution to anything ... we are just left to wonder about all of it. It would be wonderful if she were to write a follow-up to this novel - I would look forward to that very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"what!?!?!","review":"I am a huge fan of many of Anita Shreve's novels. So I was really excited to read this book, however....I was disappointed. I felt like I was reading a short story from a high school English textbook. I bought this novel because I wanted to read just that, a novel. Instead, this book is about a father and daughter who have been through a terrible tragedy, then they find an abandoned baby, then they meet the baby's mom, the end. There are too many unanswered questions that are just annoying. Not mysterious or interesting, it felt like the author didn't have the answers either, so you just feel frustrated. When I finished this book, the only thing I felt was that I just read a story that was set over just a few days and found out nothing about the characters. I recommend reading The Weight of Water or The Last Time They Met both by Anita Shreve. Now those are interesting novels with some depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIGHT.... ON ?????????","review":"I am sooo bummed!!!!! I read this book in one day it was an easy read and I couldnt put it down until i turned the page and realized the STORY JUST ENDED.. ENDED!!!! WITH NO REAL ENDING!!!! We really never know what happends to anyone in the book except that the father moves on and finds a new love but that little tidbit is soo subtle you almost miss it. I felt like this was one of those books that was written not because there was a story to tell but because there was an obligation to get another book on the shelves. BUMMED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the point?","review":"Disappointed read, didn't get to what effect this had on her life today. Finished book today and stated what a waste of time. Very Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as in-depth as other Anita Shreve novels","review":"This is a well told and interesting novel, but I felt highly disappointed at the end. This is in no way comparable to other novels by Anita Shreve (such as Fortune's Rocks)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW-MOVING BEYOND BELIEF","review":"I am a fan of Anita Shreve and have read most of her books. I particularly enjoyed Fortunes Rocks. I was therefore greatly disapointed in Light On Snow. Indeed, in looking through many of the other reviews, I noticed that the word \\"disappointed\\" kept coming up time and time again. I guess that word just sums it all up.The book is painstakingly slow - indeed, there were times when I was reading it when I kept thinking, \\"Is this some kind of joke? Could a book possibly be this painful to read?\\"Virtually nothing ever happens here, and you never learn enough about the characters to care very much about them. Indeed, until I read some of the other reviews I totally forgot that the book was written by an adult looking back on her 12th winter. The book just wasn't memorable at all.I am glad that I took this one out of the library! Anita, let's move on from this nightmare and try try again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"After the first few pages nothing happens. It's a slow read, and a disappointing one. Not much a plot, with nothing much to say about love, life, or anything else. Skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good read!","review":"This is a very good, easy read, that kept my attention from cover to cover. Briefly, the story is about a Father and preteen Daughter who take a walk in the snowy woods one afternoon and find a newborn baby left there to die in a sleeping bag. The book unfolds the mystery of who the parents are, why she was left there and what ultimately happens to the baby. You will not be diappointed by this page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"I'd recommend this book for virtually anyone. It's a moving character driven story and both grandparents and teenagers in our family enjoyed it. A great book for re-birth, renewal or anyone at a crossroads in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Story","review":"Good story with an unexpected twist to it.

I managed to finish the novel but it was more of a chore than a pleasure. It wasn't bad enough not to finish but I am sure am glad that I didn't purchase it. I would have wasted my money. I have a friend who likes to read as I do and we share/pass books to each other...this one, I don't think I will share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent plot, but......","review":"I'm a huge Shreve fan and did enjoy her latest novel. It was poignant and had me finishing the book in two days. Loved the characters and as always, the author's unique prose. However, I felt a bit cheated at the end....It's mentioned in the beginning that Nicky is now age 30, so I certainly thought this fact would be mentioned again at the end of the story. Now I'm wondering why it was mentioned at all, as it didn't seem significant. I thought it was a very \\"appropriate\\" ending, yet I was waiting for a bit more.Over all....I love Shreve's books and this was no exception."},{"rating":"1","title":"just okay","review":"I have read all of Anita Shreve's books and sadly, to say, this was not one of her best! I was shocked because I am an avid Anita Shreve reader. I have read most of the above review and agree that there lacked some depth of what I have found in other books. This book left you feeling that there should've been more to the story...I was shocked when I came to the last page and found there wasn't anything more to read. I left the story, a sad one, very empty and listless. It starts off with the daughter telling the tale from her current adulthood and recalls on this heartbreaking story of when she was much younger. Somehow the beginning of the story didn't wrap up with the ending.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OLD, OLD, OLD","review":"This mapset is very, very old.

While not as danceable as some of their more recent efforts TKK create an album where songs melt effortlessly into one another and make for a good solid album of TKK songs. The sound is a bit more \\"heavy\\" than the last few releases and not as danceable true, but for a group like TKK it stands as a testament to their ever changing and evolving sound. 4 out of 5 stars.

And whats that song that you have called \\"U Don't Know Me\\", exactly people don't even want to know who the hell u are you dumb bamboo, Cause you problably smell so bad just like the rest of all these dirty south rappers that are lame as hell.

He maneuvers over tracks with verbal agility, braggadocio and a swagger that hasn't been witnessed in rap since Jay-Z's 1996 release, Reasonable Doubt!Hopefully he holds true to his lyrics and stays out of the headlines for illegal activities.

He boldly steps out as he did before but with a more finessed roughness(oxymoron). I'm not your usual rap fan that likes to hear Jay-Z repeat himself and Nelly sing but something about T.I.'s down south raw country grammar is somehow just what the doctor order in 2004/2005. This album would be definitely recommended for verses that will make a priest unknowingly start rapping \\"U Don't Me\\" and have a nun singing \\"But she's a freak though...\\". LOL! The beats are something you want to hear while trying to pump yourself up while brushing off the rest of the world. All in all, go get this!

Did Georgia Pacific really think they could trim so much from the width and nobody would notice? I assume most people are kind of like me, and have habits in the use of their product that have been pretty consistent for quite a long time. Grabbing the customary amount of tissue recently yielded an entirely unexpected and unpleasant result. Other manufacturers have narrowe to some degree as well, and I'm putting more effort into finding TP that isn't so narrow. The fixtures in our homes are specifically designed for a standard width. This is on the same level as Coca Cola messing around with the formula for Coke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't mess with a successful product","review":"I am very disappointed Northern has decided to reduce the width and number of sheets in its Quilted Northern Double Rolls brand toilet paper. I firmly believe if you have a product that is well established, well-liked, and sells well that you should be very cautious about changing the product in any way, especially when de-contenting it. Raise the price if you must, but don't make it less desirable to save a buck. It will come back to haunt you eventually. By the way, I've bought Quilted Northern for as long as I can remember. I've been very partial to the brand. But I'm not so sure going forward.

Yet I was totally freaked out when seeing it. It is such a unique and intriguing costume drama that provides audience constant amazement as the story goes on. The language is superb. I enjoy the witty screenplay and the blithe performance so much that I cannot give up seeing and reading it over and over again.Mr. Stoppard's efforts of weaving various Shakespearian plays and sonnets so cleverly in a two hour film is indeed remarkable. This is a must see - both the film and the screenplay. I can imagine that even the Bard will be grinning when seeing the film himself - just for the part of making him and his plays so humane and accessible. What a brilliant accomplishment it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best picture of the year!!!","review":"I loved the film,but its not for everyone you have to understand shakespear I've been studying shakespear for ten years and I still dont understand it that well.

If only it had any editorial introduction to help one understand the theatrical setting for which the plays were produced or the poetic traditions in which such masterpieces as The Sonnets or Venus & Adonis were written.If you really care to begin appreciating the sophisticated historical and political insights of Shakespeare's genius or the beauty of his verse you'd much more enjoy one of the Arden or Cambridge copies. For just getting started with any of the Bard's works, the Oxford School copies make him so much more fun.Even the inexpensive Folger , Signet, and Penguin are so much more helpful than this version.

Terrible moire on the left curable only by 100% h-moire correction, which on the other hand makes it a bit blurry. It looks like you can actualy see the crt mask. Every line is comletely separate.

The power of love and attachment are beautifully depicted. The self-doubt and confusion of a heart-broken man are very obviously seen. Anyone who has loved and failed will be able to empathize with the hero.I have read several books on love and related topics, but, I still dont know why one should be so blindly attached to somebody at the cost of happiness when there are others to love you. I see this same dilemma poetically depicted in \\"gertrude\\". Only Hesse can do it. But, why 4 stars, one can see self-pity and self-doubt reeking in these pages. This is not i want to see from Hesse. But, i guess, it is very human and natural."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cracking short novel, and a great way to start with Hesse","review":"This is a great novel. While perhaps too short to deal with its subject matter, Hesse writes a fantastic account of the young composer Kuhn's love for Gertrude and his depression as he watches her marriage to his best friend, a charismatic opera singer, gradually destroy both of them. He deals very sensitively with the concept of love artistic development, and also the effect on the psyche of the hero caused by a crippling accident. While not quite as impressive as Steppenwolf, this is a great book to start with for those new to Hesse; introducing many of his recurring themes, including Indian philosophy and rural idealism, and providing an interesting comparison to the musical development of his contemporary and friend Thomas Mann's composers( Leverkuhn and Hanno Buddenbrook)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value","review":"I used white chocolate and it worked great.

While certainly not in the class of the Beatles, or maybe even the Searchers, the Merseybeats are still a very good group. Guitarists Tony Crane and Aaron Williams blend very well together, and Crane and bassist Johnny Gustafsson work some wonderful harmonies. This collection is one of my favorites.

These are comfortable, but that's about the extent of the favorable rating I can give. The sound is \\"muddy.\\" There's very little clarity in any frequency.

But in this collective form with a nice price (no more a Best Buy exclusive)you just have to throw this package a maximum rating.The movies run a little more than an hour each, and although none are classic, they are nevertheless entertaining. The package is a well-balanced slice of Universal's second string offerings during the 1940s. Collectively, you have all of the elements of what you want in an old horror/suspense movie. Dark old houses, strange goings on, creepy, sinister characters, and some comedic relief.My personal favorite is \\"Horror Island\\" which is really a fun flick to watch when you want to take your mind off the troubles of the world.

The rags to riches theme about aspiring musicians was reasonably well described, but the drug abuse and infidelity of some characters was just mentioned in passing. These people appeared to recover from problems without any intervention and the neatly tied-up ending almost made me gag. This author has written several books (this is the only one I have read) and I wonder if her theme (girl from the wrong side of town) is the main thrust of her books.

This book hits the mark, and could not have come at a better time. I particularly like the way Mr. Millard deals with topics such as asset diversification. He uses great analogies to bring it all together, and offers great advice on others who can help with the process.

This book is completely different! Extremely well-written and full of practial advice, the book gives a step-by-step plan for building an investment package that requires minimal maintenance. This is not formula investing, however; the book shows readers how to evaluate their current position and investment thinking to tailor a portfolio to meet his or her needs, and obtain the goal of enjoying life instead of worrying about money. All of this is done using everyday language and terminology -- while defining key concepts to enhance comprehension -- so that the book provides a solid framework for those of us without a master's degree in finance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introductory Book","review":"This was a good, quick read.

In these times of sinking equity markets, information overload and the resulting anxiety and confusion,Mr. Millard fills a real need to bring some order and perspective into play. Using sound basics and fundamentals, he presents investing in a way that allows us to incorporate it smoothly into our lives rather than letting it overwhelm our time and energies. He is realistic; he offers no miracles. However, he does leave the reader with a confidence that investing can be dealt with in a calm, controlled fashion, relatively free of stress and worry. This fast, easy read will be particularly helpful for the investor who has lost his/her way and needs a fresh start. It would be ideal for the novice investor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and solid detective novel with a touch of humour.","review":"Asey Mayo is a jack-of-all-trades, who becomes an amateur sleuth after the arrest of his friend and boss, Bill Porter.

The music lacks the intensity that it may portray on the album and the lead vocalist can't even hit his own recorded melodies.

My copy's slip cover is worn and well used. I recommend this movie to any horror fan, who appreciates a good story without the intense gore and shallow dialogue.

The overwhelming majority of the book is a secular rehash of what is in the Bible, but with liberal scholarship and scepticism. I had really purchased the book to learn about the kings of Israel which are not recorded in the Bible, but there was little information there ... just scant references and ultra brief biographies.I would not mind the liberal scholarship if the author had been honest enough to furnish the conservative responses and evidences, but it was obviously a one sided portrayal.Consequently, these two reasons (too little on extra-Biblical kings and too liberally biased) I cannot recommend the book although the other Chronicle series are well worth the money.David C., Ph.D."},{"rating":"1","title":"wandering aimlessly while dazed","review":"The players play as if they were playing by themselves in their own little world totally unaware of the other parts.

The silver stripes are actually a gray color, with the green color being a dark forest green. I wish the colors were more vibrant like in the picture. The Slytherin emblem was not sewn into the scarf as in the picture, but was instead a separate patch sewn onto the scarf. The frills at the bottom of the scarf fall out if you pull at them too much, and I find the scarf a wee bit itchy, since it is made of lamb wool.

This product is assembled in China and fabric is Korean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"We purchased this for the beach and dragged it on vacation with us. Taking up valuable luggage space, I thought for sure this would be worth it. It was easy enough to assemble but we did not spend much time inside it (not really needed as there was other shade). When it was time to take it apart at the end of the day, it took 3 adults to try and figure it out. It ended up snaping in half (one of the poles) when we were trying to collapse it (even folloing directions). Needless to say, I do not think we will get to use it again. My advise is to practice setting it up and taking it down prior to using it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sun Stopr Kwik Cabana with shade","review":"This is a great little tent to take to the beach and pool!

So far we used it for the backyard as opposed to dragging out the pac n' play. It is easy to open but closing it with the tarp sometimes is hard. I have not used the canopy yet. It is worth the money if you need something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous book...","review":"At least the other reviewer called it a novel, which was generous; I will grant that it is largely fiction. This book has little or nothing to do with the actual murder of Rebecca Ewing Johnson. Moreover, it is written like a really, really bad romance novel, not an investigative study of the actual case. If that's what you're looking for, it may be your cup of tea, but if you are interested in furthering your knowledge of the case, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cant catch me","review":"This version of the Gingerbread man is pretty close to what I remember as a child.

I chose this one based upon the reviews & low price, despite my initial feeling that the cover design looked cheesy. First the illustrations are some of the worst that I've seen. The story line is too straight forward, nondescript with very little embellishment. I think one reviewer said \\"repetitive\\". I agree with that. The original story that we've read had vivid details and better showed some of the attitudes that the characters exhibited, which made for great discussions about the gingerbread man's arrogance & naivety etc. Nothing profound (it's not War & Peace after all!) but I believe that great stories can lead to great discussions even if it is a fairy tale.

The book helped her to understand that the kids who were being mean have problems and hurt feelings too.

I thought it really gave you an insight to Dale's passion for racing. No matter what it took, he was going to succeed and be the best race car driver. It really showed the relationship with his father and how it made him the man he was. Alot of people wondered why he had such a distant relationship with Kerry and the movie helped people to understand. Another review said it great, you can never truly be an intimidator if you dont know what that truly means. The movie showed you how Dale was intimidated by his father. I think it could have shown more of the personal side of Dale as far as the all the things he did for other people and the softer side. The movie did make him out to be a hard, kind of cold, person and to hear other people talk about him that really knew him, he was not that way. Overall I think a great effort by the entire cast. No movie will truly show us the real Dale, but I think it gave us a great insight to the man and the legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"the story of dale earnfart","review":"this sucks. dale earnfart was a terrible driver and human being. he killed himself when he turned his car straight into the wall at daytona - some driver!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time (and money)...","review":"First off, I am a big Henley fan and, for a live CD, the audio is pretty decent on this release (although there are a few sound drop-outs throughout the CD). However, this is basically a re-release of a bootleg CD of the '93 benefit concert in Boston. I'm sure Mr. Henley isn't making a cent off this release (not that he really needs the money at this point in his life). Anyway, the reason I only give this one star is that the tracks were shuffled from the original order they were played. Normally not a huge deal, but when they keep the song intros on the end of the preceding track and then shuffle the songs, you get intros for each song that are just plain wrong. For example, did you know that Bob Dylan and Danny O'Keefe wrote \\"Desperado\\" or that \\"Sunset Grill\\" was released in 1975?***BZZZZT*** I think not...How hard would have been to leave a bootleg CD in its original running order!?!?!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don Henley - One of These Mysteries","review":"Again, I am looking at this site for info to purchase a new CD, but there is none.

I think this is the same show that was broadcast on King Biscuit Flower Hour or one of those radio shows (it's been quite a while since I've heard it). Again, if this is the same show, Jimmy Buffet makes a cameo appearance with Don. Of course, since there is no song listing here we don't know if Volcano and Marguritaville (sp?) made the disc. This might also include new songs that made their debut during this leg of the tour like \\"Well, well, well\\" - which have yet to surface on any official Henley release.

There's less than 17 minutes of music on the CD, and actually just 13 if we exclude the two tracks of drum rolls and trumpet blasts Morricone wrote merely to add drama to something happening on the screen.

However, the soundtrack to For a Few Dollars More is by no means a throw together piece, as everybody who has watched the movie knows. It fluctuates and flows, moves and shakes, keeps the listener enthralled to the very edges of their being. Ever driven to the sound of Manko riding his horse? Ever shot apples off a tree with a classic six shooter? Ever uttered the phrase \\"No old man, thought I was having trouble with my counting, but it's alright now\\" after you've just piled all of the men you've just killed into the back of a wagon?

( You must press and hold the button to turn it off; speeds 1 thru 3 and A1 thru A3 ) The auto mode will cool down to 60 degrees but of course, it has to be that cool outside for it to bring in cool air. ( it's a fan, not an air conditioner ) I rate this fan a 4 only because I cannot give it a 3.5; wish someone would make one with a hepa type filter to not just clean the incoming air but also keep the bugs out that get sucked in!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product","review":"I purchased two of these to act as largely exhaust fans for my second floor.

I have definitely noticed a significant difference in the room temperature after the fan has been running for a while, once the outside temperatures drop. It brings the cool air in much quicker than using open windows only. The fan is fairly noisy on speeds two and three, but one can sleep pretty comfortably with the lowest speed setting.

The outside temperature was in the 50's overnight and having it on the intake setting was cooling my hot computer and TV-filled den perfectly. Then, it got hot and humid. If the fan isn't running, it's just like having the window open a foot or so. This causes humidity to skyrocket in the room. I tried to run it on exhaust on the humid days, but it still went to almost 70% while the other rooms on the second floor were in the mid-50% range. I think I was better off just running the air conditioning by itself. The temperature was still around 79 deg. in the room, but humidity was 10-12% lower.

I had to open up the case and glue the wire back down. Ok, that's annoying, but relatively quick fix if you're at all handy. The fan worked fine for about a month and then one day I went to turn it on and POP, there was a flash from control panel. The panel stopped operating and the fan became a one speed. I had to pull the plug in order to turn it off. Now, the fan is gradually slowing down and humming loudly. It's gotten to the point where I'm afraid to leave it plugged in.

I'd give five stars to the first, which I bought around 2003 and used very heavily. I bought another in 2009 and it had a couple of problems. First, it was cost-reduced by combining several functions into a toggle button with seven settings: on-high, on-medium, on-low, on-autotemp-high, on-autotemp-medium, on-autotemp-low, off. It's so fiddly that we often turn it off by unplugging it. Second, the volume of air moved is much lower.

I would recommend to anyone.The only reason it didn't get 5 stars is b/c it could be made more powerful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took it back the next day","review":"I wanted this fan not for a window, but to put atop a split door in order to draw A/C from the adjoining hallway in a house with no central air (only window units)and push some of the hot air out to try and kind of equalize the temperature to make it more comfortable in the room. I was rather disappointed in this fan. It had so little power on high that I thought it was broken. The temperature gauge only proved to make me more miserable by showing me just how hot it was in the room. I used it one night and was so underwhelmed at its performance that it was boxed up and returned the next day. I got a MUCH cheaper box fan and just propped it in the door. At least now I'm not sweltering as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fan sucks.","review":"I used to own a Lakewood LPRW1.In comparison to that fan: This fan is louder, pushes significantly less air, can't be disassembled for cleaning, and doesn't fit in windows as claimed.Look elsewhere.

Clearly they have NO idea what a good window fan is like."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better ODE Texts","review":"This book was used in my \\"Introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations\\" class when I was a senior at Louisiana State. I found it to be one of the better texts in differential equations that I have come across. The first chapter is mainly the prerequisite calculus, then the next chapter jumps into first order equations. Then unlike most other books, he jumps straight into second order problems. the biggest plus in the book is the ready use of complex analysis throughout, something which most books avoid altogether, thus allowing the student to get only a partial understanding of the theory needed to solve more advanced problems. Answers are included at the back of the book, problems are clear and well-explained, and there are enough advanced topics covered later in the book (including celestial mechanics) to keep the course interesting for students of all kinds."},{"rating":"2","title":"visuals needed but good","review":"ODEs are really fun to study and this is a very convenient book. I have taken an ODE class and the textbook was very helpful because it has visuals.

The RPMs on this one are similar to a hand lawn mower. This is very painful for me, because after 50 years, I feel like I have to try something else, perhaps buying Braun next time.

It seems like he did not even research properly for his book and relied on someone else's ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Keegan's First World War","review":"This is an excellent study of the First War. It is as good as any that I have read. Keegan as most British historians write with a fine command of English proseIn order to get the most out of this book one ought to have an atlas of Europe close at hand. Without maps it gets a little difficult when one is especially reading the portions about the Eastern Front,ie Tannenburg, the Carpathians etc.The need for good maps is not only true about this volumn but I find it necessary to follow,with maps, any history of war that I have read, including biographies of famous generals. The publishers are not overly generous with maps in their books. It really makes a great deal of difference to follow with maps.I used a West Point Atlas of the First World War. These Atlases have been available online."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitive","review":"A masterful account of the Second World War, not only on the battlefield level but also on the political and economic level.

So when I spotted The Second World War i was a bit hesitant but once i flipped through the first few pages and saw detailed maps of the campaigns i decided give it a shot. What The first world War lacked The Second World War made up with even better writing and more detailed maps so at least you know where the conflicts take place. It's sometimes a bit dry in some chapters and drags, but most of the book is for the most part readable and easily understandable. highly reccommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great command of the language and superb analysis","review":"I have to give this Brit credit; he can write and think on his own. By far the best British writer on WWII. Get this book and not the ridiculous Penguin History, which gives you the impression the British single-handedly won the war.This is balanced, insightful and interesting. Along with Weinberg (more of a political emphasis) this should be required reading. For more of the military angle, try A War to be Won, by Williamson Murray, Allan R. Millett."},{"rating":"2","title":"J.Keegan : Second World War __ Very Good","review":"Book was very good. If you like details, there are plenty of them. It was eye-opening to know how much equipment was used in WWII. It read very easy. I did a little skiming. Too much detail for me about the battles. Despite the length of the book, it kept me interested. I will probably read more of Keegan's books. I read this one because I just finished his book on WWI before I read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Definitive Overview","review":"After reading several reviews of the book, I felt compelled to add my thoughts. I agree with several reviewers who were dissapointed with the maps. Most history lovers are visual and want to see what's going on. Keegan's book on WWI also suffers from this. I do wonder however if that may be an editorial/publisher decision and not the authors.Mr. Keegan's book displays a remarkable ability to explore the complexity of this war concisely. It is an overview, and so does not get into the detail that multi-volume books do. To his credit, he leaves little out and illuminates many battles that are not often spoken of. Mr. Keegan writes with clarity and wit, but not irony, one of the great downfalls of so many historians writing today. Peter Green comes to mind. Sorry, digress. Anyway, I found this book and his book on WWI excellent reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII Survey","review":"Keegan's survey of WWII takes the reader from an excellent political, economic and military background to the conflict to a comprehensive overview of the war. Warning: it is not an easy read. Keegan's run-on sentences and confusing misplacement or sudden appearances of pronouns that force the reader to go back to the previous sentences can slow down the narrative. Nonetheless, once over the book's idiosyncracies the reader is rewarded with an insightful perspective on the war. Probably not read for relaxation but rather for a good history lesson, the book is well worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised - Great help","review":"Well written from the standpoint that it gradually builds in more complexity. Given that there's a good bit going on in praying the LOTH, this method really helps. I see some are really put off by the campy humor. I bought the book to learn the LOTH, so I just blow past that stuff. Water off a duck's back. No impedance to learning. I'm not sure how I was going to learn the LOTH without this book. A few things could have been helped with more coverage on them, such as memorials, but I got additional help from the Catholic Answers forum on liturgy. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying and overly complicated","review":"I guess I was expecting something like the Dummies or Complete Idiot's series, both of which work quite well. This does not. The author's tone is both cloying and overly chatty; neither trait makes the information any clearer. If anything, they made me loathe the book so much I couldn't get much out of it. And the ribbons and bookmarks! Ugh! I tried cutting and labelling all the \\"bouncing bookmarks\\" and \\"resting ribbons\\" but got sick of the whole business so soon I never really got to use them. If there were no other sources of info on this topic, I suppose this would have to do, but since it isn't, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.In fairness, the author means well and knows her subject. Perhaps there are readers who would find her charming; I don't and that ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried, I really tried","review":"This was a hard book to get through. In fact, I didn't. It was frustrating on several points: 1. I didn't know I had to order the bookmarks separately when I ordered it. I wanted to use it right away. And I tried to, but she kept referencing the bookmarks and ribbons, so I was perpetually lost. I still haven't ordered them. 2. The humor was a bit annoying ..ok.. VERY annoying. As much as I know it was tongue in cheek, I guess I was hoping for something that was a bit more straight-forward. I tried to skip over the banter only to later realize I was missing a valuable tidbit. I felt like a captive audience to a bad comedy routine. So I've set it down for now in hopes I can pick it up again when i can be more charitable and open-minded. I commend Ms. Nugent for taking up the task though. Maybe she could rewrite a version for dodos who have no sense of humor and just want the facts?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super series!!","review":"I have read this complete series and find it excellent!

What really is great about Caplan is that he is a speculator, he seems to enjoy risk, heck doesn't every options trader. Unfortunately, for most readers, the majority of books on the markets are written for people who despise risk. Caplan exposes a number of techniques that will eliminate a fair amount of the risk that goes with buying outright. However, the best techniques in the book are about selling options. Ask your broker if he agrees and he will probably say no, but I would bet that Caplan has gotten rich on this technique.

Ten thousand years ago we were all this way; now we are down to one man, his wife, and two daughters living in the remote bush of Alaska, eating mostly meat and surviving in a shack too small for most lawn tractors in the lower 48. While this may sound grim, it is usually not. It isn't paranoia but rather a pioneering spirit and awe for the natural world that compels this lifestyle (if \\"lifestyle\\" doesn't overly trivialize three decades in the bush living mostly on wild game and facing environmental extremes usually associated with other planets). The author is a good writer, the subjects of the story remarkable and sympathetic, and the pace of the narrative usually brisk. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, unsentimental tale of subsistence in Alaska","review":"Comparisons will be drawn between this book and Krakauer's excellent Into the Wild based on the common themes of living off the land and the unforgivingness of the Alaskan wilderness. Where Krakauer's book is a meditation on the romanticism and perils of self-reliance, The Final Frontiersman is an unsentimental and penetrating look at the physical, emotional and psychological challenges of making a living in this remote and and unforgiving environment.Heimo Korth, his wife and two daughters and the life they lead are fascinating.

I follow all the procedures for recharging NiCd- even letting the battery go completely dead between recharges.

The writing is crap (I cringed as the Invisible Woman complained about her wedding plans throughout the first stage). The gameplay tended to feel repetitive as the main objective is to go into a room, smash all the bad guys and move on the next room, and smash all the bad guys. The only bit of challenge comes with figuring out which Fantastic Four's powers unlocks the door to allow you to move on to the next room (Johnny's fireballs, Invisible Woman's force bubble, Thing's fists, or Mr. Fantastic's electric glove thingy).Not the best game, but I could imagine a younger player having a ball.

In order to get it to switch over to my laptop, I have to turn my home computer on - if that isn't on, it won't flip to the laptop. Even when the laptop goes into sleep mode after it has been working, I often have to turn on my home computer yet again to get it to flip over.It does not work as designed in my case. If you have two computers that you keep on all the time, then this product will work great for you (when it works, it works perfectly) - if you have a laptop and don't keep your home computer on, then look elsewhere for a solution.

Very annoying.This product is extremely functional, seems well built, but I give it a 1 star hit for the delay when switching. It's minimum, but it does take several seconds for the Mouse/keyboard to \\"register\\".

Well, it is not working on my Windows 7 computer. When you search the user forums, you realize that this is a common issue with this product. Belkin's silence on the issue is not helpful.

Needless to say this is annoying and destroys the entire purpose of the switch - i.e. convenience.Another problem I've noticed is that my desktop PC was hanging on the OEM screen at bootup for a ridiculous amount of time (2+ mins) before loading the OS. I tried messing around with all sorts of stuff in BIOS only to find out that it's the KVM causing the problem.

I tried to use this rather stylish KVM with a MacMini and a PC running XP-sp2. This is the USB variety, and the switch would work with the PC, but not the MacMini. I think the problem is that the Mac has a DVI output for video, but even with the DVI/VGA adapter that is supplied by Apple for use with VGA monitors, it still refuses to send a signal that my VGA monitor could understand. I've kept the KVM because you never know when a KVM will come in handy, and at the price I can't be bothered to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"Belkin F1DG102U Flip 2-Port KVM Switch with Audio Support (USB Connection)This switch worked the day I installed it. At boot-up the next day it did not work on either computer. After many fruitless attempts, I finally got it to go by disconnecting and reconnecting the USB cable to my computer; however, the unit failed to work again at boot-up. It appears that the only way for me to get it going is to unplug and re-plug the cable to the USB port on my computer each and every time I boot up. I tried using three different USB ports on the computer but got the same result each time.I have the PS2 version of the same Belkin switch which works just fine all the time. I bought the USB version to use with a wireless USB keyboard/mouse. I switched back to the PS2 version and all works well now; however, I'm out 50-some dollars that I paid for the switch as well as the 120-some dollars that I paid for the USB wireless keyboard/mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Purchased one in October, it worked very well 95% of the time as long as I didn't want sound with both computers (sound never switched over) until June when the button stopped working. Also found the wiring very difficult to work with since the hub is between the computers and the button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, bad execution","review":"This product is a great idea, and a very simple user interface, not to mention it look nice. Unfortunately, it didn't work with my windows laptop nor my Linux system.

I had good luck sometimes, then complete failure other times. I am returning. After installation it worked well, then I powered down the laptop. I could not get it to switch back to the desktop without powering the laptop up again. Just not ready for prime time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"When connected to 2 computers' the computers must stay on. If for any reason you turn off one computer, the mouse and keyboard stop working. Not what I expected. Quite disappointed. It takes too long to recognize the keyboard and mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavy use.","review":"If you only use this once or twice a day, or don't mind unplugging and replugging your peripherals in a couple times a day, go for it. I flip between two machines repeatedly throughout the day, and this switch is not reliable. I understand and can handle the delay when switching, but having to mess with the usb ports a couple times a day at minimum is irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design but has a few bugs","review":"I like the design of the Belkin Flip, but I experience some of the same issues that have already been covered in some previous reviews: (1) the connection with the remote switch needs to be \\"just right\\" in order for it to function (I usually have to press the plug into the unit really hard until the green/yellow light finally comes on), and (2) with my Mac/PC setup, it almost always fails to recognize the mouse & keyboard on the PC side (not trying to start a Mac vs. PC war, this is just the way it is). The video works fine & switches instantly between the two systems, and the Mac side always recognizes the keyboard/mouse right away. To compensate, and since both computers are fairly close together, I just swap the keyboard's USB plug between the front USB ports on both computers (with the mouse plugged into the USB port on the Mac keyboard)...not the greatest setup, but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"Belkin Flip worked for a couple of months, then quit. The light on the unit went out so the mechanical switch no longer works. I did download the software to flip via the keyboard but I don't like the way it works. I once inadvertently flipped it to my docking station when my notebook was not docked so had no way to flip it back. If your in the Market, try the Rosewill KVM. The flip mechanism works much better and smoother than the belkin and it was MUCH cheaper though it does NOT have the sound option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchase something else","review":"A friend gave me this to use for my laptop and PC.

In the specs it said it would work on a Mac OS, so thought it would work. When I brought it out of the package I knew right away that it would not work based on the cables. Got in touch with Belkin and they said that it would not work. I told the rep that they should put that in the information since a lot of people are using Imacs now. He was not that responsive. Now the product is all boxed back up to be shipped back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of your requirements before buying","review":"The directions are basically worthless; simple diagrams would do it but they make it much more complicated than it should be. Beware that it will only work with USB keyboard and mouse -- I didn't catch that when I bought it. Then, it doesn't work with a DVI monitor interface. I had to go buy a DVI to VGA converter. I went to set it up and realized the mouse and keyboard on one computer are not USB. I got tired of messing with it and threw it in a drawer, so it was a total waste for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive paperweight with legs.","review":"Funny, it's got a hardwired flip button but doesn't work.

It gets out of sync. I liked the idea of the remote button instead of installing more software / hotkeys. But it simply doesn't work reliably. And the delay on the USB is obnoxious - three to six seconds. I hope I can find the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor results","review":"I have a laptop running Vista and a desktop running XP, and I use a Logitech wireless mouse/keyboard. This unit was extremely frustrating because one minute it would work perfectly, and the next I would zero response from the unit when pressing the button. Even more frustrating was the fact that it would switch without warning, and any time it switched there would be a significant delay before I could use my mouse or keyboard again (4-5 seconds). I replaced it with an iogear unit which works much better, but still seems to have issues with remembering the custom key settings. More on THAT in another review. :) I'd stay away from this belkin unless you really, really want to have a little wireless puck on your desk that doesn't work half the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst KVM Switch","review":"Bought this KVM switch and upon installation my Logitech MK 520 keyboard and mouse combo was not recognized by the motherboard's bios. Belkin says to try another keyboard and mouse. Tried 4 other keyboards and mice - same results. This is the worst KVM switch I have ever seen. Sent back for refund and bought the TRENDnet 2-Port USB KVM Switch Kit with Audio TK-209K. The motherboard immediately saw the keyboard and mouse attached to the computer - works flawless on every boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"what i wanted","review":"Two computers, one monitor and one set of speakers and keyboard and mouse.

After a few hours of reconnecting the wires, I figured out that it is REQUIRED to have the usb or ps/2 connectors (depending on the type of Flip switch) connected to BOTH computers in order for this to work. It is not just a VGM cable that works without all cables plugged in. I bought this for two notebook computers that I wanted to hook up to a bigger monitor, while using each notebook's separate keyboard and mouse. If you're buying this, make sure you've got the extra usb or ps/2 ports to plug it in, even if you don't want to share a mouse and keyboard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ready for Prime Time","review":"When I first plugged this thing in, it was great. I was amazed. I have used switches like this since the late 80's, and there were always problems. So I was surprised about how well this worked...then...two months later it started to lock up - unable to switch. Complete shut down of both computers for 5 minutes is the only way to clear it. I contacted Belkin - no solution or recourse. This product was new to the market when I got it. It needs more R&D time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flip locks up and won't switch","review":"I find that at least once a week, my Flip won't switch and is somehow locked up. The only cure for this seems to be to unplug both USB cables and let the unit power down. Once it is back on it works again for a while, but it is a major pain. I have to crawl under my desk and find my USB ports. I have much cheaper KVM switch with PS2 plugs that is has never given me a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit for purpose","review":"I tried to use this to switch my USB ireless keyboard and Mouse and my new widescreen 19\\" HP monitor.I could not get the monitor resolution to work on my laptop so I used the digital connection to switch the screen and the \\"flip\\" to switch everything else.The keyboard worked fine but the mouse would consitently freeze up.

This episodes in this set deal with a terrorist better known as \\"Laughing Man\\" and Section 9 tries to uncover who this \\"Laughing Man\\" is as well as what his motives are. Each episode I feel is well written and the animation is rather great for any anime that I've ever watched throughout the years. While this is one of the first animes that I have a chance to watch in recent years but it's one of those that was able to pull me in with it's great storytelling through Season 1's great writing.

At if a machine obtains individuality, is he/she/it human?And lastly, if something occurs, that appears differently to others eyes, does it become what the others thought?Philosophy, action, sci-fi, complexity, and excellence is what you will get with Ghost in the Shell."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent English dub and a very well-done show.","review":"It's a fantastic anime with a great English dub, good music, and a very engaging plot.

If I had known more about this aspect of the movie, I would not have bought it. \\"White Christmas\\" is definitely the movie to buy, as it is truly a Christmas movie, and it is sweet and charming in every way.

It is in Black and White, which too bad because it would have been better in color, but they didn't make many color movies at the time.

I find it impossible to imagine a crowd of intelligent people sitting in a theater and finding this film entertaining or enjoyable.

As long as you don't let those stupid parts spoil it for you the rest of movie is fun and truly enjoyable. I'd like a home just like the Inn where a full stage just sorta appears when you need one!

I was not disappointed! If anything, the picture was even 'crisper' than the B&W version, and the coloring was realistic and natural. Bing & Fred are always a class act whether in color or Black & white, but it was great to see this perenial favorite as close as we'll ever get to how it would have looked if filmed this way. Hope Universal commissions more of Bing's [and Fred's] early films to be treated this way! Of course there are certain Bing Crosby films I'd love to see on DVD in any form, namely 'Sing You Sinners' [my personal favorite], and I think 'Holiday Inn' proves it's a worthwhile venture. On this occasion, Top Marks to Universal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic Movie","review":"My friend introduced me to this movie when I was in College and loved this old movie.

For me this shaft did not work. I was impressed during the first test drive, but after just a few days the knock is back. The shaft does appear to be a heavier duty remake, but evidently it is still engineered with either the wrong material, design, etc... I dont know what the answer is...maybe stainless instead of mild steel or whatever they are using to keep the shaft affordable. After just a month now I am debating weather or not to try and modify this shaft or the original. I can't think of any options that will work for me besides just dealing with the knock. I wasted my time and money on the shaft I purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last something that works.","review":"At last something that works as it should.

This steering shaft is supposed to expand and collapse. However, this Dorman shaft was stuck and would not expand (should expand easily using hand strength). I am very glad I didnt install it first. Some users have also reported that Dorman had a bad batch of about 1000 of these. This is noting amazon did, its just an issue with Dormans QA process. I ended up ordering the original GM part from a well known GMPartsDirect dealer (pt number is 19153614). I would not recommend this Dorman Product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not cure the \\"popping.\\"","review":"I purchased this item to replace the poorly designed stock unit that is making terrible popping/clunking noises in a 2005 Suburban. Prior to this, I replaced the steering column bearing to ensure that was not the problem. Much to my dismay, this part did not stop the noise. Actually, when I drive over speed bumps it makes a loud squeaking noise, presumably due to a lack of grease in the shaft. Although it is designed differently, it looks almost identical to the stock unit. I'm now contemplating whether I want to re-install the stock one and send this unit back. Not sure it's worth the $40 or not though, although Amazon is fantastic to work with. Borgeson makes a much beefier shaft for this application but I'm not sure I want to spend the extra $'s on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fixed Rattle and Loose Feeling","review":"I was thinking about 'pumping up the grease' again when the steering on my '04 Z-71 started feeling like it was loose again and kind of rattled. I saw the Dorman and read the reviews. I was going to take the engine compartment end loose and work the shaft back and forth to break up the grease, but I figured why not go the extra step and disconnect the inside too and replace the shaft. It took me an hour to do by myself, only needed 15mm wrench & socket, and torque wrench. I did not have to remove anything else to take out old shaft and put in new shaft. Just take your time and you can work it out and then work the new one end. Mine fit right in with a little push and shove into mating parts. Steering is now quiet, tight and feels solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silverado Intermediate Shaft","review":"Easy repair on the my 2002 Silverado pickup. Great deal.

Not only for his leadership, which undoubtedly saved the world from Nazism, but also because of his memoirs. Reading this book, it felt like I was actually there, feeling the tension as Hitler prepared on new conquests, the revulsion as France & Britain allowed Germany to destroy Czechoslavakia, the disbelief as neutral countries, USSR,Belgium, Netherlands, Norway etc, clung to their neutrality as it meant anything to Hitler, admiration for the British people as they resisted such overwhelming odds at great cost, and triumph as the Grand Alliance combines to crush Germany.

I think Brenda is an entremely talented writer and I loved the characters. The biggest flaw was the lack of depth her heroine Allie has. She doesn't feel real as a cop. I could believe her more a P.I. The part about losing her gun just doesn't ring true. I also (although I LOVE Clay) had a problem with how quickly he opened up to Allie, after keeping so closed into himself the past nineteen years. These are small things, which truly don't distract from the book much, but unfortunately its enough to knock my review down to four stars.

Some of the stories deal with hard issues, ie. child abuse, rape, violence against women. The issues aren't sugar-coated, or swept aside.

Once back home, we discovered that it had broken right on the seam. We tried to fix it, but the way the mattress is constructed, it was impossible to put any patch on the area, and we had to throw the mattress out.I have an 8-year-old son who walked over the mattress several times during camping, and once jumped on it, and I'm sure this contributed to the leak.

Also, ppl calling me can't hear me while I can.I exchanged this unit from the store, thinking a surge or something might have caused it & installed a surge protector with it, but to no avail the second one also ended up with the same problem.Now, I can't even return it as I am over the return period & the customer service is of no use, they want me to pay for shipping & handling to their service centre for a repair or refurbished unit. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality - don't waste your money!","review":"This phone is not worth the money! For starters, the battery will not hold a charge and the phone gives no warning that the battery will die. In addition, the reception quality is horrible - is constant static. The speakerphone is a nice feature, but it is difficult for people to hear you on it. Stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't hold a charge","review":"The phone comes with lot's of features (and expectations). However, after charging the unit for 20 hours, the battery was dead after 30 mins. of use. Customer service is non-existent. What good is a phone if it can't hold a charge?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Panasonic Phone lacks cordless range","review":"I own the Panasonic KX-TG2267 and thePanasonic KX-TG2593B 2.4 GHz DSS 2-Line Cordless Telephone.I purchased the KX-TG2267 because I did not need another answering a machine, wanted the speaker phone feature on the handset and wanted the lower price.Both phones are two line phones and both handset have acceptable volume and features like call ID, the problem is that the quality of the recption on wirless hand set of the KX-TG2267 is poor. It also has very little range.The KX-TG2593B is a much better cordless phone, I think it is because of the DSS feature. Buy this phone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too many features, but terrible reception","review":"this phone has terrible reception. purchased thinking to use it on the main floor (as a prime phone), but ended up using it as a spare phone when all other phones in the household are dead. even the \\"static reduction\\" device (or whatever its name is) that came with this phone doesn't help much... i finally got rid of it. 900mhz \\"sonies\\" are much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Waste of Money","review":"The battery on my phone, as well as other reviewers', lost its charge very quickly and completely died just a few months after I bought it. I can not find a replacement battery anywere, locally or on the internet. Panasonic can't even replace the battery. Also, Panasonic's customer service is not lacking, it is non-existant. Do not waste any money on this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your money is worth more in your pocket than on this phone!!","review":"We were glad to finally purchase a cordless phone that met all of our requirements. Little did we know that it also required more spending. First we thought that we got a faulty battery so we bought a brand new battery only to find out that the battery wasn't the problem. Now, the phone remains on the charger collecting dust. Should have just stuck with my Vtech 900 MHz, I could have saved myself money and a bottle of asprin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of clarity","review":"I bought the Panasonic because I have one and am very happy with it. This phone also had all the features I was looking for. We are just starting to use the phone and find that the person being called finds the caller's voice very hard to hear. It doesn't matter whether you are using the handset or the speaker phone. Unfortunately, we are now outside the return policy of the store it was bought from and am hoping Panasonic will step up to the plate. I suppose this will turn into another example of a store just wanting your money without providing any service or usable product. Wish I had read these reviews first. It is unfortunate because the combination of features is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something amiss with the battery","review":"I dont know what Panasonic have done here, but I cannot complete a long conversation (say 75 minutes) without the battery going dead. Lately, it has been far less than that. This is starting with a full charge. You would think that in a cordless phone this would be something they would get right. Unfortunately - it makes the telephone worthless - and I will have to return it. What a pity - I thoughtI could rely on Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this phone","review":"I really liked this phone for the first month I owned it. Now it takes 24 hours (or more)to recharge and it won't hold that charge. I will never buy another Panasonic phone. Customer Service is lousy. They know they have a problem, but won't do anything to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good songs but the vocals?","review":"I found the musicians on the recording to be quite good and the lyrics to the songs are extremely funny. However, the singer seems someone more accustomed to opera or madrigals then to bawdy songs. She is a wonderful singer, but seems ill-suited to this type of music. I find the combination of her voice with these lyrics to be un unpleasant one. I am unable to listen to more the 2 or 3 songs at a time unless I am putting it on as purely background music and ignore the lyrics completely, and since the purpose of a CD of \\"bawdy\\" songs is usually the humorous lyrics, I found this recording to be a bit of a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fidelio in Full Score","review":"The material is very good. I can \\"read\\" it very well. I am disappointed that it did not contain the Leonore Overture III, 72a which follows \\"O nameslose Freude. Additionally, It would have been very helpful if the text had contained English translations.The publication does not fall short of the orchestral materials however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this!","review":"This opera, is probably the best opera in the time of Beethoven. This opera is not very long, but her sister Leonore, is longer and much more beautiful, but Fidelio, is much more dramatic. The opera score here, is very good, no dialog, which is pretty hard because the recordings I have, are missing dialog, and I want to see the dialog itself. The opera score contains no table of contents, no instrumentation, and no notes. The opera score which i got, fell apart after two months I have used it, and the scoresmells a horrible smell. do not buy this score, it is cheap, but you get cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-notch chillout.","review":"Trippy, enchanting, soothing, head-bobbin' beats from a relatively new artist - this album is a solid buy if you're looking for business time sounds. Play it and watch what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've made a mistake","review":"You discribe an Alice in Wonderland bank but you picture a Winnie the Pooh bank.You need to check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality kills.","review":"The quality on this album is incredibly bad and pretty much ruins the whole thing. The instrumentals are okay and overall a lot of the songs have a nice symphonic sound, but the vocals are drowned out almost COMPLETELY by everything else. Sometimes I didnt even know if he was singing or I was just hearing a random sound put into the album. I dont think I'll buy anymore Emperor albums, since this was my first- but if I do, I'm going to make sure the quality isnt this bad.I do love the cover art though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I bother?","review":"This was an impulsive purchase to complete my Emperor discography. Yet, I highly recommend avoiding this at all costs or at least hearing it first before making my mistake. Some people love a production that is so poor you can't make out anything worthwhile, I'm not one of them. The entire disc sounds like it was recorded on a 4 track, the vocals are too loud, the drums sound like a drum machine, the guitars you can't make out other than that strange barely audible buzzing through each track.AVOID AVOID AVOID.I'm so thankful this band progressed to much greater heights than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than a romance novel","review":"This review is for the audio version. The narrator was effective although his female voices sometimes sounded more whiny than I thought was appropriate.This book may not contain as much suspense as some may like, may not contain as much action as some may like and may not contain as much about the military side of the story as some may like but these are all just dressing for what amounts to 3 love stories in one book. After reading some of the lower ratings it seems that those readers who didn't like the book mostly had different expectations or just didn't connect with the characters. I felt the characters were fleshed out but with so many important characters they might have been underdone for some tastes.Anyway, I found there to be enough moving and funny parts to make it enjoyable. More enjoyable than any other books I've read lately."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],x={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=m("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",x,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(O,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-dea5fcc4"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/40.md","filePath":"glossary/40.md"}'),j={name:"glossary/40.md"},L=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{P as __pageData,L as default};
