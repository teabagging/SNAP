But the rules are very poorly written. While playing it, my mom and I didn't know how a round ended, what to do if you ran out of cards, etc. We were thinking that if we really wanted to play this game, we would have to add in our own rules!

Can't believe how poorly explained the game play is - we are going to have to make up our own game. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter Quidditch Card Game","review":"The Harry Potter Card Game is based on Quidditch, a game played on broom sticks in the Harry Potter books. The game fairly represents the way Quidditch is playedHowever, the Harry Potter card game is repetitive and boring. You play only on Quaffles, Bludgers, and the all-important golden snitch. Unless you put the point value of the snitch down to five times that of a Quaffle, it is pointless, because whoever gets the snitch will win more than 95 percent of the time. Even if you do that, it still is more boring than reading about it in Harry Potter.As for education, there is very little strategy to it and no learning tools I can see. Durability, because they are cards and are bound to get bent. The flimsey box doesn't help its case.Harry Potter fans, there are much better things to get to hold you over until the fifth book. I don't reccommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONFUSING!!!!","review":"It looks like a lot of fun......if only I could figure out how to play it!

The instructions must have been written by a rocket scientist, because I spent 45 minutes reading them, and still they didn't make a whole lot of sense. It seems to me that maybe Mattel needs to consider that a good portion of the people attempting to play this game are under the age of 12. After an hour of struggling through this game, I threw it in the garbage can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Julia Roberts, but I decided to pick up this book and I thought it was a really fun read. Its light, easy to read and quick. I read it while on vacation and thought it was perfect for the time I spent by the pool. Mark Bego really knows his subject. I learned a lot and am definitely a fan. I will read anything else Mark writes...especially on my next vaction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial rehash","review":"No new information. No new insights. Not even a very interesting approach to old information. The whole book is just cut & paste. The author, Mark Bego, just strings together a bunch of quotes from two movie guides and some popular magazines. There are 40 small black & white photos, about half publicity stills and the rest reprinted from news magazines. The book has no index."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome game for any age","review":"I think that this game is more fun than a barrel full of monkeys! (excuse the expression) Last mamorial day weekend me and a freind went over to another freinds house. While there we got really bored an decided to go out to the store to get a new game. We ended up having my freind's ( who's house we were at) 13 year old sister tagging along, and me my freind and her sister spotted the game. we three had read the books but my other freind had not. Even so we played the game on 2 teams an she had a great time and even guessed a few correctly. We played it the entire 3-day weekend! Now she is reading all of the books. This game is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This is a very good game with some very tough questions. I've played it many times with my cousin and we rarely missed a question because we know Harry Potter so well! Some of the questions aren't accurate with the terms they use. One even said the wrong textbook as the answer. Otherwise, it's lots of fun and I truly think everyone who likes Harry Potter shouldn't be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Make Much Sense","review":"I got this game for Christmas and I couldn't understand it. I've read all the books twice and listened to them. I could not answer the questions. I mean, who really cares what the name of Neville's great uncle is? It's not that important! The layout and rules of the game are very confusing. Do youself a favor, and save your money for better things!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much good...could have been much better","review":"I enjoyed playing this game, but it does have a large number of flaws. You really do have to have read the first Harry Potter book quite thoroughly, because some of the questions are really quite challenging if you don't use the multiple choice. Younger children - my sister at age 10 included even had problems with this game - some of the rules are confusing. Once you have the hang of this game {you should use the multiple choice included, it's much easier if you do} it's actually fairly easy and not a challenge. However, the rules are confusing - I ended up pretty much making up the rules as we went. This game had the potential to be so much better, and Mattel have stuffed it up. If you're really a Potter nut, I mean really a huge fan, go ahead and buy the game. I think it was just a waste of money, personally. It's not a 'you're not a Potter fan if you don't have this' kind of game."},{"rating":"1","title":"i bet it's a great game - if we had the instructions","review":"I am sure this would be a fun game if we could play it. My son excitedly opened this trivia game for us to play on our first \\"family game night\\" after christmas. He was busy sorting out the cards and pieces when we noticed that the game did not come with an instruction sheet. We looked all over the box and finally realized that although the contents listed instructions, our game did not have them. The next day, my husband called the \\"800\\" number, was told that they did not have the instruction sheets in stock and that it would be 4 to 6 weeks before we would be able to get any. How hard is it to copy sheets of paper and send them out, or to put the instructions on a web site for people? This type of customer non-service is why I do not like to buy toys from the big companies in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"How well do you know Harry Potter?","review":"There can be up to 8 players. The point of the game is to get the most charm cards.You get put into one of the four houses. You move around the board and you land on diffrent signs. There are 5 diffrent subjects. magic wizards magical beasts magical places mugglesIf you get the questions wrong you get a curse card. If you get it right you get two charms card. If you get it right with multiple choice you get 1 charm card.It is a fun game. Although you have to have a good memory to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"WB DOESN'T screw up for once","review":"Although I hate the marketing craze over all the new WB products, this has to be one of the better ones. It's very colourful and has lots to do, even if the instructions are a little bizzare/complex. I'd recomend for younger kids to play the first time with a parent or older sib to sort everything out. After that it should be OK, and a lot of fun for everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Trivia","review":"The first time I played Harry Potter Trivia I was so excited. I loved collecting the charm cards, answering the questions and racing to you house.

Now, if someone asks me to play Harry Potter, I will say yes but it isnt as much fun any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sexy Compilation of Vocal House","review":"As with all genres of electronica, there is an overabundance of mediocre house albums circulating. Similarly to trance, house music unfortunately gets more than its share of crappy tracks and compilations. It's always nice to hear a solid album like this one to reaffirm that a house (and not just house, but vocal house!) can be really good with the right track selection. \\"Puttin' It Out There\\" by PC Synergy is the only track I don't like on the album. 12 out 13...not bad at all.4/5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It bored me.","review":"Flat, toneless singing.

Listening to this dreck made me want to shoot the Great Pumpkin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bible - written in stone.","review":"Speaking of 'the end of the world' the author says 'God reserves the right to change His mind'. There are things written in the Bible, specifically concerning the end times of the Revelation to John, that will 'not change'. They are written in stone! Those events will come to pass without fail. No amount of praying or contemplating will change prophetic events spoken of in the Bible. The end of time will come just as foretold in the Scriptures. Christians must be careful, the Bible must be the'only' authority which speaks for God. If we get away from that then we are merely following after what Jesus referred to in the gospels as 'the doctrines of men'."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE !!","review":"The other 1-star reviews are very accurate. For people who are attracted to this \\"Centering Prayer\\" please read books about \\"Lectio Divina\\". \\"Lectio Divina\\" is a true Catholic Christian tradition. The Bible warns about falling into traps such as \\"Centering Prayer\\". The objective of Centering Prayer is a closeness to God. How can we get close to God without \\"works\\". We must love God with our whole mind, might, body, ACTIONS, intentions. We obtain salvation through Christ. It is the Christian objective to become like Christ - in the way we live. We must do the corporal and spiritual acts of Mercy. \\"As you treat the least among you is how you treat me (Jesus)\\". Feed the poor, visit the sick, counsel the afflicted, admonish sinners, clothe the naked, ect."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential guide to contemplation","review":"This book is my first recommendation for anyone interested in exploring or beginning the practice of Christian contemplation. While other writers shy away from offering the \\"how-to's\\" of contemplation, Keating provides a thoughtful guide for making \\"centering prayer\\" an essential element of one's spiritual journey. After growing frustrated with the obtuseness of some other contemplative/mystic writers and works (e.g., Merton, \\"The Cloud of Unknowing\\"), this book was exactly what I needed to find -- a primer on contemplation. I only wish I had found it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Love with Him","review":"If you desire union with God this is the book to read. One of the obstacles to union life is the benigh self or false self that Keating talks about. And indeed as Paul talks about in Romans 7: 14-28 and in 29 he cries out \\"Who will deliver me from this grotesque, evil thing called myself?!!\\". Centering prayer is the practice of letting go of this creature, of denying yourself of leaving yourself to dive into God, to cling, to hug Him closer. It is a practice!! It is is not a high quick acting experience, it talks time, patience and continued practice. Do it!! and it will do you!! It builds the much need element of patience into our character which as James says you need that you may be complete lacking nothing. It also keys us into the deep knowledge of God, \\"Be still and know that I am God\\" and we get to know the \\"God that acts on behalf of those who wait on Him\\" as we wait for the potter to mould the pot."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you're (I'm) ready, the book presents itself...","review":"Phew, after over 20 years of meditating, this Vipassana-like method has done more perceptable, ineffable good for me than all I've attempted before.

After installing the timer with the recommnded feeder it will only feed one time and then the timer goes blank and must be manually reset. They offered to replace it , but only after I send the original back in. I am in the middle of our local season and recommended that they first forward me a replacment and then I would send it in and I have gotten no cooperation."},{"rating":"2","title":"We'll see...","review":"This panel looks very much like the one I am replacing.

STOP!","review":"Anyone that played Rebound as a child remembers how fun it used to be, whether playing against a friend, parent, or just playing around on your own. THIS IS NOT THE GAME YOU REMEMBER! Sure, it's the same \\"game\\", but what comes out of the box is not what you remember.First, the game board comes in two pieces, not the smooth, solid single board that the older version had. This means the playing pieces hit a noticeable drop at each seam.Second, the playing pieces aren't the heavy, smooth rolling pieces of the old set. These are lighter and don't track straight even on the kitchen table.Finally, because of its construction the playing surface isn't level, and skill or no, it's nearly impossible to aim your shots like you could in the old game. It's frustrating, even for my older kids.The game I bought my kids has been repacked and is going back to the store. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have ruined this classic","review":"The two piece board construction does not stay together. The two board pieces don't even come close to aligning so there is a drop that makes the pieces move unpredictably. The boards are warped so all shots fall to one side. The rubberbands that came with the game fell apart before being stretched. The game pieces themselves are so cheap and shoddily made that they will stick. This was a huge disappointment. It is unplayable in this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Science Fiction","review":"Great science fiction.

Not quite in my opinion but it comes to an equal."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok story, but too long and contains questionable science","review":"I would have enjoyed this a lot more if it had been half the length.

Yes, Maggie meddles in other peoples' lives, ineffectually, and to the irritation of her family. However, this aspect of her character is one that endears her to her husband Ira, even as it frustrates him. Ira's crankiness seems less blameworthy when we realize all his self-sacrifices for his own family. The family isn't perfect, but it is all too human, and both Maggie and Ira show their love, each in his own fashion. Breathing Lessons reminded me of Jane Austen's skillfully crafted depictions of the people in her milieu--a small gem, but one carefully polished to reveal great beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Exhausting Read","review":"I couldn't believe this story took place in just one day. It literally wore me out. I had read and liked several of Anne Tyler's books when they first came out, but after a few books, the quirkiness simply got annoying, and morphed into \\"precious\\".I'm reading this as part of a Pulitzer Prize library book club, and frankly it makes next month's selection, The Executioner's Song, look downright cheery. I gave it 2 stars because I know there were examples (none of which I can remember) of a very small comment or description that highlighted a much larger concept of human nature. But Maggie, pleeeeeeeeeeeeese, enough's enough! Most of her escapades were just too predictable. It was hard to see her as a sympathetic character when all I could visualize was Edith Bunker!I recognize that this book is almost 25 years old. Maybe Breathing Lessons, Anne Tyler, or me just haven't aged well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"It was an extremely well-written very boring book. Nothing really happens, it raises more questions than it answers, and is just depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubble Head","review":"The story makes you want to take this female bubble head and shake her. How could anyone be so stupid and self centered? And yet, how do we know we aren/t getting it right.

We're supposed to love Maggie the way we loved Lucy, but frankly I tired of Lucy at an early age--mostly because she represented women as befuddled nitwits who couldn't fight their way out of a wet paper sack. I'd like to see more books on the Pulitzer Prize list with female protagonists who are not helpless, pathetic and devoid of lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopeful but disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this book based on the fact that it won the Pulitzer Prize. Unfortunately, I found a tedious unbelievable story about two boring characters that really had nothing important to say for 324 pages. I read the whole thing hoping something interesting would happen. Instead, as the book progressed I found myself rolling my eyes and wishing for the end. Maggie is a meddler that ruins peoples lives and Ira is a loser that can't control his passive aggressive behavior to bring others down to his level of misery. There is nothing poignant in their lives that even remotely hopes to bring tears to your eyes or make you laugh out loud. This book ranks up there with The Pilots Wife - a book that has nothing to say and is a shameful waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most annoying book I ever remember reading...","review":"This must be the most annoying book I can ever remember reading.

I wanted to quit reading it many times, but I always hate quitting a book before it's done. The book takes place over one day and is way too descriptive. The characters are extremely annoying. They say and do things that are so stupid I wanted to choke them. Besides that, it doesn't even turn out well. I was so bored I didn't even read the last page, I finally gave up on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A KIND OF MAGIC","review":"Breathing Lessons is an absolute delight, a beautiful novel that becomes a tender examination of marriage and the persistance of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer?

So I picked Breathing Lessons, figuring I couldn't go wrong with a Pulitzer Prize winning novel.Well, I still don't get what the big deal about Anne Tyler is, and I'm baffled as to why this novel received the Pulitzer. It's dull and not particularly well-written--an average novel about some very average people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get through it.","review":"Try as I might, I simply couldn't get through this book. The characters are well defined, but that's because it seems to be all Ms. Tyler does. The dialogue between husband and wife on the way to the funeral was darkly comic and mildly amusing, but page after page later, I felt that it was too much of the same. For those reading this review, please keep in mind that my commentary only refers to the first part of the book, as I couldn't get past the redundancy any further than that. Considering this book won the 1988 Pulitzer, it must be worth delving further into the story; I hope you can make it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried very hard to like it...","review":"...but I just could not. The predictability of Maggie's inability to drive the car without running into a truck or a mailbox, her consistent misprepresentation of what other people had or had not done in order to get them back together --- these are just two of the things that made it difficult to care for or even about the protagonists. The book jacket talks about their making 'extraordinary discoveries' about themselves on the road to the funeral. I reached the opposite conclusion - they end up very much as they started, behaving at the end exactly as they did in the beginning. I have the feeling that, if this were made into a movie, and a great actress were cast in the part, it could make a big difference. My mental image of Maggie is that she is a meddlesome, tiresome klutz. I know that is not how other readers see her, but that is how she came across to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a soap opera side-line","review":"The characters and plot in the novel reminded me of the boring families and plot lines in a soap opera--the ones you fast forward through until you get to the ones you really care about. Unfortunately, I wish I could have fast forwarded through this novel as easily. I never became vested in the outcome because the characters and story never really hooked me. I didn't really care what happened to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Credible Characters","review":"So many reviewers have gone over the plot, so I shall spare you yet another repetition. Like many, I was annoyed throughout at the level of dysfunction displayed by all the characters and not just Maggie; but this proves a point. Like most reviewers, including those who disliked this book, Anne Tyler thoroughly involves the reader in her story. I enjoyed this book as I have other Anne Tyler's books, basically because I find them \\"easy reads\\", stories that hold my attention, make me laugh and keep me turning pages. If I am any judge, then I feel that Breathing Lessons comes through as a deceptively simple story, as Anne Tyler is a master in control of her novel which is technically brilliant, humorous and filled with completely credible characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs plot lessons","review":"Each chapter was the same. Yes, there are some bursts of good writing, but without a good plot... it was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Anne Tyler, but..","review":"Several years ago I attempted to read Breathing Lessons but just gave it up because the characters were just too one-dimensional, boring, and unbelievable. After recently reading several other of Tyler's books (Ladder of Years, Patchwork Planet, Homesick Restaurant) and really enjoying them, I decided to try again. Sorry, but this book is a stinker! How it won a Pulitzer is beyond me. Unlike her other books, this one has no real hook for the reader, that is, nothing to keep him turning the pages. I finally (again) became so disgusted with the main characters that I (again) gave up. If you want to start reading Anne Tyler, don't start on this one because you may never read another. Perhaps this book was written as an example of a certain kind of writing for some esoteric literature class, but not for the general reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Loving, realistic portrayal of a Family--A True Gem","review":"Anne Tyler has been praised by writers of the caliber of John Updike for her unique talent to write wonderful \\"domestic\\" novels, and Breathing Lessons is an outstanding example. Rarely have I encountered a writer who manages to infuse such love, humor and observation into their work. In Breathing Lessons, Tyler fleshes out characters that will stay in your heart long after the last page has been turned. With their flaws and quirks, their strengths and weaknesses, one feels Tyler could be writing about our own lives. Maggie Moran, and the world she inhabits with her stalwart husband Ira, is another addition to the marvelous cast of characters that Tyler has given to us in her 14 novels. Read anything by Tyler, she is a consistently top-notch writer (Dinner at the Homesick Restaurant, The Accidental Tourist), but use Breathing Lessons as your port of entry. You'll thank your luck for finding such a gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Have Missed Something","review":"I think I must have missed something with this book. It won the Pulitzer and was also the Time Book of the Year for 1989. I really don't get it. I mean, it was fine. It was just the story of an average married couple, traveling to a funeral and back. Nothing terribly exciting happens. The characters were completely forgettable and felt really cut and dry for me. Not a lot of depth.Overall, I didn't get bored or annoyed while reading the book, but it left pretty much no impact on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept wondering what I was missing","review":"I went to a local library book club meeting to discuss Digging to America. No one liked it much but there was a good ending that tied all the details of the characters together. It was suggesed that Breathing Lessons was better. But it didn't even have the punch at the end. The only person I felt truly sorry for was Ira and would have felt sorry for Leroy but she was largly ingnored by the author. Maggie was what a mother is - not seeing the faults of her son but imagines him as a better person. The book was a good portrayal of a middle class existance, something I don't have much interest in reading as it is mandane. I could understand why Daisy would not want to spend much time at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulitzer Prize Winner......really??","review":"I was irritated by certain aspects of this book, namely, the character of Maggie. She is a self absorbed, interfering, scheming, immature person. Ira was almost unaware of himself and really didn't lend much to anything in the story. Everytime Maggie did something that didn't work out the way she perceived it, it was almost telegraphed; you could see it coming a mile away. It just seemed to plod along. I was expecting these profound discoveries about themselves as a person and hoped that it would evoke a little change in themselves. The characters ended up exactly the same as they had always been. I am a little dumbfounded that this was a Pulitzer Prize winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Did I miss something? I kept waiting for something to happen. I would have stopped reading it but I kept waiting for something to happen. This woman, Maggie, was everything a mother should not be: too permissive, a push over, dim-witted...the list goes on and on. This book is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary does not have to be ugly","review":"This book depressed me. I don't understand what other people see in it. I was thrilled when I finished it. I don't think Anne Tyler is my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts were good but most were bad","review":"The character Maggies is one of the most annoying characters I've read. I kept wishing that someone would just tell her to mind her own business. Definitely not one of Tyler's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Anti Misanthropist","review":"Graham Greene said that the novelist needs to have in his heart a chip of ice. Arnold Bennet wrote that a novelist should possess a 'Christ-like all consuming humanity'. I know to which school Anne Tyler belongs. Her books are, quite simply, funny, wise and sad. Her characters, as G K Chesterton said of Dickens' creations, are such that 'you couldn't forget them if you would and you wouldn't forget them if you could'. Buy them all, read them: they'll improve your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What a disappointing book especially after reading The Accidental Tourist, which I liked. I admired the character Ira for his love and loyalty to Maggie, but both are losers who let life just happen to them. Ira is a depressed man and Maggie needs to get a life. She was so annoying and I was so disappointed by the end. The details just went on and on and I kept hoping it would get better. In the end, I felt so sorry for Fiona and Leroy. Maggie is cruel and selfish. I was appalled that she continued preparing dinner when Fiona just found out that not only Jesse didn't give a hoot about her soap box, he was seeing someone else, all going on in front of her granddaughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"So real it reached out and bit me","review":"The greatest thing about this book, and the most difficult to write, is all the dialogue is so convincing and natural, you begin to feel this could be your own family. Anne Tyler actually writes it the way someone would speak and not the way someone would think, very difficult, indeed, and most masterfully done, in creating and generating an understanding of each character through what they say, and in some cases, don't say. A great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"POINTLESS AND RATHER DEPRESSING","review":"I really enjoyed Anne Tyler's new book \\"Noah's Compass\\" so I went back to reading some of her older novels. I picked up \\"Breathing Lessons\\" at a library book sale for fifty cents. I am glad I didn't pay more. I don't understand the point to this book, it wasn't interesting and didn't have any surprises (like Noah's Compass). I found it to be rather depressing. The only part that was interesting was after Maggie watched the film from her friend's wedding and realized her original feelings for her husband.I don't think I can read another of her novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"maggie, the main character, is really annoying.","review":"The further I got into the novel, the more I disliked Maggie. She's the personification of the phrase \\"The road to hell is paved with good intentions\\". She's a nosy busybody, and I can't help feeling that her family would have gotten along much better if it weren't for her simplemindedness. The only redeeming trait Maggie has (if you can call it redeeming) is that she plugs on with her life no matter what happens. The book is readable, but you can find much better novels by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter, irritating bore","review":"I was recently on a business trip and found myself without a book to help me pass the hours on the plane. I bought Breathing Lessons thinking it would help me feel better about living an ordinary life. I was right all along -- ordinary IS boring. I would have abandoned the book in the middle had I not been captive on a plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"Este libro es el mismo como todos los otros libros de John Grisham.

It has been around a long time. (The 1982 copyright date is just the last time the text was revised for printing. The pictures etc. date back to the 1940's.) The exercises are delightfully challenging.Amazon listed the book's reading level as \\"young adult\\". I have been teaching advanced HS geometry classes with this book for 6 years, and I can report that most bright students find the language challenging without someone to help them along. If you are homeschooling etc, you may want to investigate whether you can get the solution text from the publisher.I give the exercises in the book 5 stars. Again and again I find myself saying: wow I never would have thought of that. The text that accompanies the exercises gets only three stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of fun","review":"I bought this item for my 3 year old neice. She has hours of fun with it. The sand can be a little messy, but I put the play mat in a large shoe box lid and it is not as messy. The sand sticks together great for me. The molds are a little hard to come out, but my neice over fills them and they fall out fine. I find it less of a mess than playdough. Overall she is entirely amused by it and I can't ask for more than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I was dissappointed in the molds that came with the sand, we couldn't get the sand OUT of them! My 4 year old and 7 year old had a blast messing around with the sand, before it slowly dissapeared from falling on the ground (I put it on the table outside) and getting stuck in the molds. If it was as cheap as playdough I would be all for it, but it's not worth replacing in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised.","review":"My daughter begged for this for Christmas and the commercials looked good so we bought it. Two months later, the stuff is gone. Bits of it landed on the floor each time. It doesn't stick together like on TV. It doesn't work well in the molds either. My daugher now likes Playdough better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the Play-doh","review":"Very disappointed in this product. We bought this for our daughter and were so excited for her to try it out. After the first use we are ready to throw it away. The sand is such a mess! It does not stick together well and gets all over the place. It was all over our daughter, not to mention the carpet and everything else around her. The playmat is small, not enough play space. The sand easily breaks apart after molding it. The sand also sticks in the molds and is hard to clean up. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In my opinion, don't waste your money!","review":"What a huge disappointment. After seeing the commercials, I thought what a cool gift this would make for my 3.5 year old daughter. Hmm, how do I best describe my disappointment? Perhaps it's because it's a HUGE mess, the sand doesn't stick together (but sticks to EVERYTHING else), there isn't enough sand to even fill the molds that come in the kit (huh??), you can't get the sand out of the mold very easily, the formed sand falls apart easily, I can go on and on.... Save your money and your frustration - buy play-doh!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much more than isometrics- A complete fitness work.","review":"I received Push Yourself To Power several months ago. I basically collect books such as these and most aren't even worth the postage.John Peterson's book is the best collection of exercises for bodyweight and beyond I have ever seen.The exercises are not isometric but rather involve complete movement of the muscle under tension.The chapters are clearly marked. For example if you wanted to exercise your chest, you would simply turn to that chapter and pick what exercises interested you. There are so many exercises, it is hard to get bored.I have seen results with this method which is pretty amazing considering I have been a gym rat for over 20 years.All in all well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price!","review":"I recently ordered Peterson's book and I must be blunt. This book by no means is really worth the price tag. Most of the book is simple isometrics. If you want to learn isometrics, go to your library or on the internet and you will be able to get plenty of info. Peterson and others here market the book as if it is a comprehensive body-weight workout guide, but that really isn't the case. After giving the book a good look-over I sent it back and decided on Matt Furey's Combat Conditioning. Although I am not overly impressed with Furey's book....it really is bodyweight workout programs....not isometrics. So be wary of some of the reviews here, and understand this book is basically a guide to isometrics. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally useless information","review":"This book is generally useless, with the exception of some items of note.

This book is a great introduction to bodyweight training. He goes above and beyond Furey for a fraction of the price, and is available on his message board to answer questions. This book targets a different audience than many of the \\"bodyweight gurus\\". I am more interested in MMA so the book wasn't exactly what I was looking for.If you want to gain absolute strength via bodyweight exercise, stick with Pavel's (dragondoor.com) Naked Warrior.If you want to condition yourself for mixed martial arts, stick with Ross Enamait's Warrior Fitness program (warriorforce.com).If you want to waste money, go with the crooked Furey.If you are looking for a general fitness program, go with PYTP.

Just variations of the same exercises.7) You have to already be in shape to do alot of the exercises.8) Some of the exercises strike me as down-right dangerous (Neck bridge).The only good thing I can say about this book is that it does caontain a lot of bodyweight exercises.The book should be called, I wish I were Charles Atlas but I'm not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should NOT have listened","review":"I listened to the vast majority of reviewers who recommended this book. Now I am $30 short, and have little to show for it. This book is a basic beginner's guide to exercise, nothing more, nothing less. Matt Furey started the bodyweight exercise craze, and now Peterson is riding his coat tails, even naming exercises after him. Peterson's book is useful to the complete beginner. The beginner will enjoy the book because he can perform the exercises. Anyone with prior training experience will not find anything new from this book. This book is just like most of today's training programs. It is simply repackaged information from past authors. There are much more useful training programs available. It's about time that we judged books based on useful content. This book does not contain any new ideas. The production quality is great, but that is irrelevant when reviewing a book's content."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"I have been doing workouts designed from this book.

That is exactly what I was able to do, 500 in a single day(divided in multiple sets mind you) but none the less is a great accomplishment.

He is over 50 and has a built that 20 year olds would envy.There is just the right amount of nutrition info but not too much.His description and instruction is very detailed, not like others who only have a starting and finishing photo.If you do not collect or spend a lot of time reading exercise books for entertainment, you will have all you need with just this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothng new, but good compilation of exercises","review":"This book combines exercises of Furey, Tsatsouline, Atlas and others but doesn't add anything. I bought these books previously but struggled to combine them into a system that allowed progression from beginner to advanced. This book's \\"transformetrics system\\" claims to do this but misses completely.The progresson recommended is to add a chapter per week, but as the chapters are dedicated to a body part, its a poor way to progress.If you are looking for a system, I suggest:- Craig Balantyne's Turbulence Training 6 month bodyweight manual- Alwyn Cosgrove's Program Design Manual + his bodyweight DVDI give the book 2 stars because the exercises are excellent and its much cheaper than buying the books separately. I recommend it for someone who wants to tryout bodyweight exercies and is already in shape (as there are few beginners exercises)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"If you're interested in learning Charles Atlas type 'Dynamic tension' exercises, than this is the book for you.

I still do negative dips and chins (bodyweight plus weight added) and slow, heavy leg presses as part of my overall training which also includes martial arts. The Hindu Squats, Hindu Pushups and DVR program have boosted my cardio fitness and help me with recovery time of the weighted negative dips/chins and leg press.

The whole anti-humor is a bit confusing to me as I don't think I've ever laughed as hard at a comic strip as with the \\"Jim\\" strips. Maybe the anti-humor thing comes from the refreshing lack of cynicism.Jim's life feels real -- it's like watching another person's life unfold with all of their personal thoughts out in the open. You become attached to Jim as he goes through his mundane daily activities. The humor, weirdness and sadness in Jim's life resonates more because you feel you are connecting to a real person rather than some wise-ass talking cat.If you like 'Pathetic Geek Stories' and 'Life in Hell' you'll love this book.

However it fails to address the key issue, how will multimedia shape and change existing and developing networks.The books omits or treats in a perfunctory manner several vital areas such as digital video broadcasting as well as Cable TV networks, while DAVIC is merely skimmed over.Overall the impression is given that the books is simple a detailed review of network technology with the word \\"multimedia\\" inserted into the title of each chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survey Says.......Projectile Vomit!!","review":"Do you love the Family Feud?Do you love predicting what other people think?Do you love Ray Combs?If you answered yes to any or all of the above questions, do not buy this game.

It took me a year to get through it, and I did so only to say that I finally got through the book. The plot wanders and is improbable at best. The book has no redeeming features, no characters are well developed and the story line is neither believable nor well developed. The only reason to read this book would be to add a new \\"worst book\\" to your personal list."},{"rating":"1","title":"murky narrative","review":"After reading The Corrections, I was ready to jump on the Franzen train, to buy all books that he has ever written and devour all of them. The Corrections was one of my favorite books ever. This one, however, is a quagmire. I was stuck reading an uninspired newsreel for weeks, with too many characters, dry narration, and uncomfortable racism infused paragraphs. Really dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pomo Mystery","review":"Franzen is a great talent, although Strong Motion, his other novel, is a better, more complex book. The basic plot revolves around Jammu, an Indian law-woman who is made police chief of St. Louis. The mystery side of the book is largely pedestrian. What is interesting is the way the Franzen weaves in the theme of suburban seperation from the inner-city. This theme is quite prescient given recent thought-media coverage of emergent suburban \\"pods\\" (see Atlantic Monthly Aug. 1998 for details). This book is ultimate vacation reading for post-modern elitist types."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzz...","review":"Well I'll admit that I only read half of it, but I kept it around for a few months, thinking I SHOULD like it. Finally I gave it to the Salvation Army.Parts of it were fine, and there were some good characterizations (as another reader said); particularly the teenage girl and her folks living that white, UpperMiddleclass life. Franzen renders hum-drumness with amusing accuracy.But the political intrigue was hardly intriguing. It put me to sleep. Literally. I found myself skimming and skipping, then I just gave up.I like Franzen's essays, and I'm a fan of the crowd he runs with (DFWallace and co.), so this isn't the opinion of someone 'outside' the 90's writing thang. I get it. I just want to warn anyone thinking of buying this book to perhaps try another (will amazon really print this? Not that they shouldn't buy ANY books, just not this particular one!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It - Try Another Novel Instead","review":"Jonathan Franzen is an accomplished writer. However, that doesn't stop this book from being a clunker. Having started and stopped several times, I finally got stuck at page 215 and have not had the energy or willpower to go further. His plot is bizarre and the characters arouse little sympathy; the prose does little to propel you on. I would recommend The Corrections for anyone intrigued by his style but unwilling to take a chance on this early poorly-received work of his."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book, far ahead of its time","review":"I'm not sure whether the other reviewers were reading the same book!The 27th City is both funny, enjoyable to read, and also prescient -- Franzen essentially provides a look at \\"outsourcing\\" long before that became a hot topic, except that what's being outsourced to India is the police, corruption, and local politics!Sound confusing and unfamiliar? Sure. But what really good literature doesn't defamiliarize our surroundings? Read the first chapter and you will be hooked. Frazen's premise is tremendously original. This is basically a more readable version of DeLillo's use of surreal plots to comment on very real problems, with a lot of dark humor thrown in to sweeten the p(l)ot."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm confused","review":"I read The Corrections, so I was looking forward to reading this. I've persisted 3/4 the way through the book and am finally abandoning it. I can't keep track of how all of the characters inter-relate. Of the few key characters, the Indian sidekick Singh is just not believable at all esp the relationship he has with the protagonist's wife. Some interesting writing, different perspectives of viewing some things, but not enough to make up for the incomprehensibility of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud","review":"I came to this book with high expectations - the author has a high reputation and his latest book is being touted as \\"The Great American Novel\\". Despite a mild sense of boredom, a plot that did not really grab me, a complexity that makes great demands of the reader (almost every page has a new character and you don't know which ones are going to be important) and a somewhat turgid style I stuck with this for over a hundred pages before giving it up and writing it of as a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad","review":"I loved the Corrections so I picked this book up. It's ambition was admirable, but I have to pretty much agree with the previous reviewer- it was nearly unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Boredom","review":"The occasional passage of skilled description and/or sharp insight - I thought the scene with Probst in the shopping mall was brilliant - do not come close to compensating the reader for hundreds of pages of mind-numbing boredom, nor for all the gagging involved in trying to swallow the ludicrous plot. Save your money and your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"As an avid reader and a fan of \\"The Corrections,\\" I had much higher expectations for this novel. I found it very difficult to get into, in fact, I had to read the first 30 pages twice to have a clue as to what was happening. I found that the story dragged on and was exceedingly unrealistic, especially towards the end. I am not even sure I fully understood the conclusion because the story became so convoluted. I purchased \\"The Twenty-Seventh City\\" in combination with \\"Strong Motion\\" from amazon.com and this book turned me off so much to Franzen's writing that I doubt that I will even read \\"Strong Motion.\\" I think Franzen really missed the mark with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should read this book","review":"I'm suprised at the negative reviews. The book is ambitious, but not overly so. The writing is simple and beautiful. The story is suprising and magical, but not implausible. The character developement is wonderful and the characters imaginative. Read it when you want something refreshing to perk up your brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"No St. Louis I've Ever Known....","review":"In fairness to the author, I must say that St. Louis is a tough city to write about, with its small town politics conflicting with its never-ending desire for national recognition, but this book is the most bizarre departure from real St. Louis I've ever read. When I met Jonathan Franzen at a signing at UM-St. Louis shortly after the book was published, I was excited about reading fiction set in my beloved hometown. As I read the first few chapter, however, what struck me is how little Franzen seemed to know about the city -- its dynamics, history, or social layout. Perhaps Mr. Franzen should write books about New York, his home. This book tops my recommendation of items to read when you can't get to sleep at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent for what it is","review":"Franzen's first novel, like his others, are competent page-turners, if often a bit long-winded--essentially mass-market paperback airplane reading material in the guise of neo-Delillo Literary Fiction. Franzen's gotten some good breaks in the press with the help of supportive publishers, editors, agents, and others. Which is also why the media hype surrounding him is spin, and he falls far short of the two writers he seems to most wish to be--Fitzgerald and Delillo--though if you compare him with his true peers, the Robert Ludlams, etc., he's a captivating read. Just don't read too much into it (pun intended)--it's not there."},{"rating":"2","title":"intelligent, well-written, interesting","review":"I came to this by way of Moody, Wallace, Powers, and company, but Franzen is a very different type of writer. His prose is a lot less brilliant than the others. He's much more of a classical story-teller.It's the plot of this novel that gives it a bit of an edge. I can sort of understand how some people might find it dull, especially if they're looking for suspense, but this isn't that type of novel. In a way, it is the opposite of \\"magical realism\\": instead of using elements of fantasy to tell a realistic story, Franzen uses realism to tell a fantastic story, And he does it very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long and what was the point?","review":"I loved The Corrections. This book, however, had too much unneccesary dialogue and too many accounts of meetings that did not really advance the plot and were often tedious to read. I didn't really understand the motivation for the conspiracy led by Jammu - I didn't see how the illegal actions would have benefited her and have been worth all the effort she and others put in, maybe I missed something. I enjoy conspiracy-theory plots and thrillers, but after a while I just wanted to finish the book so I could figure out why the conspirators were doing all these terrible things. The idea behind it was interesting, but when I got to the end I felt like I had missed the entire point of the book and was disappointed. It also seemed a bit racist to me as well, considering that most of the evil corrupt characters in the book were Indian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"There are snippets here of the writer Franzen was to become with The Corrections, but ultimately, this is a mess. Ambitious, sweeping, blah blah blah. Also, too packed with minor characters that have no bearing on the plot -- and have too little effect on the main characters to be worth the effort. I'm willing to do a little work when I read a book, especially something that aspires in the way this one does, but rein it in a bit, man. Reminiscent in reach of Zadie Smith's White Teeth -- another rambler that at least had some likable characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"By far my greatest song of all time","review":"I've listened to a ton of music - rock music in particular - progressive rock in particular, but nothing can surpass this for me...

I also had a alpine 450 true watt amp that I switched out and compared to the pyles. The alpine without a doubt out performed the pyles. Then I bridged the pyles and compared. The pyles did out perform the alpine....when it didn't cut off...which happened constantly until it blew. Now I have the alpine in there doing the same performence and hasn't blown.

They offered to sell me a new one, but since they are on back order until the middle of next month, they couldn't even tell me what I'd have to pay. This is no way to do business!

Shame on the publisher from deleting verses from God's word in this translation. The King James version, with its Shakespearian language, is a stumbling block for many readers, but fortunately there are modern versions that are much easier to understand and have not omitted verses. Among these, I'd recommend the Revised King James version, the New American Standard, and the Living Bible (not New Living Translation). All three of these contain modern English but do not omit verses. Readers need to be advised to the importance of staying close to God's message as warned in one of Relevation's final verses. \\"If anyone subtracts any part of these prephecies, God shall take his share in the Tree of Life, and in the Holy City just described.\\" Revelation 19 - Living Bible version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shoes, fast delivery.

However Ivie swing hard, and could sing so calm, cool and colelctively. My favorite is Oh Babe Mayne Someday. All the songs on this cd are exellent and feature Ellingtonians as backup. These are without a doubt some of the greatest sessions to come out of the 1930's.

This review really goes for all of the Essential paperbacks that marvel is putting out but this is one I have waited a long time to read because Thor has always been one of my favorite characters.

Snoopy gets caught in a flood, Charlie Brown gets little leaguers elbow. Lucy points out all Charlie Browns faults via a slide show, complete with intermission and whopping fee. Linus has to sing a carol for the PTA against his will, thanks to Lucy. Lucy also has a go at poor Linus, making him and his blanket (and deprivation of) her science experiment.Worth a look for any Peanuts fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"multi-hit CD","review":"this is the one you hope you'll get when you buy a new artist's cd. like a book you can't put down, song after song keeps hitting home. ballads,working-man blues, country funk.great song writting and production, really well put together on all levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Yoga Video for beginners","review":"Lilias makes Yoga easy to learn. I have followed this video for the last 3 months. I feel better, have more energy, For the first time I have even quit smoking without any problems. Great stress reliever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Video quality is so poor--sound is uneven and distracting","review":"Before I purchased this video I read the customer comments. One of the remarks was how inferior the quality of the video was. I should have listened. What a waste of my money. As much as I have enjoyed Lilias over the years, the quality needs to improve before I would purchase another video."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING......","review":"While she seems to be a likeable person she is immensely boring. I was a novice when I purchased her tape but have since tried many others and find that while she does get in all the right moves her choreography leaves a lot to be desired. It doesn't really flow as well as some of the other tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repacks!","review":"This set is just repacks. The Stass Allie is the exact same mold as the Adi Gallia in scene 3, but painted darker. Agen Kolar is just a repack of the Eeth Koth figure released in the Power of the Jedi Line and is in a weird action pose. Shaak Ti is okay, but not great. All 3 characters have new figures in the Revenge of the Sith line. In you don't need to complete the council, skip this set and get those"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent First Entry...","review":"I bought this book due to the recommendations here on Amazon. I had hesitated because I am really fond of Bruce Alexander's Sir John Fielding mysteries and thought it would pale in comparison. I was very pleasantly surprised in that while it is indeed similar to Alexander's series, it actually improves on it in some aspects. I like the protagonist very much as he is a level-headed and fair-minded individual, something rare in that particular era. And I fell in love with Lucy and hope that she will appear in the future books although it might be heard to weave her into any more storylines. This is a great read and looking forward to the second in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"1800's English Thriller","review":"The Thief-Taker: Memories of a Bow Street RunnerAfter reading other English novels, I had expected many minor characters. This book kept them to a minimum and made keeping track of the plot easier. The main character had to prove his innocence before the true vilain was captured a bit of expected plotting. Overall, a quick read that kept me interested until the final page."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"it is what it is, a folding table. drink holders are very shallow and the chip tray is light duty (sags when full of checks) fun for parties, stores nicely when not in use. used some pvc pipe slipped over the legs to raise up to standing height. surface material is okay, screen printed graphics as opposed to dyed felt on regular tables. not full size but easily fits 5 players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not tall enough","review":"You can only deal sitting down.

It is sturdy and seems to be made in a quality way."},{"rating":"2","title":"The beginning of the end","review":"this book was so awesome. definitely one of her best. i'm sad that it's the end however. but it definitely gives you a feeling of conclusion, not like some books which make you feel as if you're missing something. with this book the only thing you are missing is the manga itself. but at least she left us with her whole series which we can continue to read over and over again. by the way chibi chibi is so cool in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spine-tingling!","review":"\\"There should be hopes and battles, life and death, happiness and sadness, they should be born again. Everything is born from the stars.\\" That's my favorite quote in all the SM books. In this book, all the Senshi are dead, except Sailor Moon and Sailor Galaxia. Sailor Moon leaps into the cauldron, and wait...a new Sailor! *gets smacked over the head for saying that.* Ahem, this is a very good book, and I was hardly able to control my emotions at the end. About that quote earlier, I repeat it to everyone now, and they give my wierd looks. Belive me, once you read this book, you'll be quoting it too. \\"Is it my turn to swing the sickle of death? Because it's nessecary...does that make it right?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read!","review":"Sailor Moon and Sailor Galaxia are the only scouts left and...you'll have to find out for yourself. This is very suspensful book and you'll enjoy it. Sometimes the plot may or may not get confusing, but Naoko wrote the book wonderfully. The feelings are so realistic, it gets some die-heart moonies wondering if this is really made up, or if it's real...The last book is a must-have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is the best!!!!","review":"The illustrations of this, Naoko Takeuchi's last Sailor Moon manga, are amazing. I couldn't wait for this book to get out so I got the book in French and japanese. In the book Princess Kakyu transforms into Sailor Kinmoku. She then kills one of the garden Senshi, I can't remember which one. The remaining one then stabs her with her staff. Sailor Chibi Chibi also transforms, into Sailor Cosmos."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very moving manga.","review":"The last volume of Sailor moon was great. The artwork was fantastic and I learned a lot from this manga. Sailor Moon is all alone, the sailor scouts have turned against her and now Bunny can't defeat them! The last few pages made me cry a bit. It's such a moving manga."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got a biased opinion","review":"Although I haven't had the broad range of manga reading that some other reviewers may have had, I seriously adored this manga. I love the illustrations most of all. I hope that Ms. Takeuchi considers continuing the Sailor Moon mangas, she left a lot open for a continuation of the plot-example: coming of Crystal Tokyo? Chibi-Usa's red eyes (Puu?!?) etc...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"The whole series is wonderful, one of my absolute favorite manga series of all time. I know the books have been out of print for some time now, so I understand the high prices. I've been collecting the series via Amazon one volume at a time for the last three years because I only bought a few when it was out, I made the mistake of thinking it would always be around. I've paid anywhere from $7 for a volume, up to $40 and thought it worth every cent. However I must say that every last one of you on Amazon selling this for the prices you have listed are nothing short of a bunch of scavengers and vultures. I'm four volumes away, and this is one of them. I know that's my own misfortune, but really? $200?! TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS?! W.T.F.?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit in 1977","review":"KARM was an average Hit in 1977 during the era of multi starrer and action movies. If the movie was made slightly earlier, it would have seen a bigger success. This movie made by the movie Mogul BR Chopra has Rajesh Khanna playing the role of a man torn between two women. The female leads are played by Vidya Sinha and Shabana Azmi, who do their roles well but the movie centers around Rajesh Khanna and the effect predictions can have. Ultimately predictions are proved wrong and prayer and Karm rule. A good movie made with good intentions and very well presented. The weak link is average music by R D Burman or may be the director did not create situations for a nice song. The lyrics are heavily loaded, however a charming and a good clean movie of the SuperStar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balanced Account of the British Monarchy","review":"This book was written in 1952-1953, after the death of King George VI and before the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. Dealing primarily with the life and times of King George VI, it gives an account of his birth, early childhood, accession to the Throne, and the extreme goodwill earned by the royal family during the Second World War. Intended to be a favorable and sympathetic rendering, the book still manages to demonstrate (probably unintentionally) that some of the British Royalty are pompous, arrogant, cold, and not too bright. Queen Mary, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feng Shui for Gardens","review":"The basic ideas in this book are good and the illustrations are great. However several subjects were lacking complete explaination and left me thinking I had missed something. The biggest disappointment for me though was the over-use of the work auspicious. By the end of the second chapter I caught myself counting how many times that word appeared on one page. I realize the word auspicious is a very powerful word, but in a 217 page book that word appears at least once on every page or at least it sure seemed so? I don't think I will be able to get past this and probably will return the book for another selection by a different author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feng Shui For Garden","review":"Book described as new but it looks old with 2 different colors. The border of the page is yellow (may expose in sun light) and inside is white. Moreover, it has a few of underlined footnotes in blue ink. I decided to keep the book because it's not worth to return it (just wasting time and money)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thule 687 Atlantis Rooftop Cargo Box.","review":"This box is awesome I like the fact it opens on both side it is also very aerodynamic.

While simple, it was probably designed by a Swedish monkey. The part that sits on the cross bar of my roof rack fails at the screw attach point. It is a very weak fitting and held in place by one screw. The monkey would tell you this is not a bearing point for load. Why then does it always fail in this spot?? Get this - the replacement part is $2.60 from Thule direct AND they want $20 for shipping... Now that's a business model!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon fell down on this one","review":"Cannot rate the product, because it arrived nearly 2 weeks after my vacation, which was 3 weeks after Amazon (verbally) and their trucking company (verbally) promised it would be delivered.Amazon could not cancel or change the order the night it was placed, because it was \\"shipped\\". \\"But don't worry, it will absolutely be there on time\\".Trucking company could not track the order for days, because they had \\"not yet received it from Amazon\\". \\"But don't worry, we'll get it to you 2 days after we receive it.\\"When all was said an done, nobody followed through and it nearly ruined our family trip.

It has the looks, weight and features of the more expensive watches. The watch is medium size and is quality made. The movement is visible from the see through back. The 23 jewel movement keeps excellent time. You don't have to take it off in the shower due to its 100m rating. It looks great and I get compliments, even from my wife. Initially the bracelet is unfriendly being new and stiff. After wearing it a few days it loosened up and moves comfortably on my wrist. This is a lot of watch for the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vegas 6 revealed","review":"To me, this book has a very disjointed teaching style that I found hard to understand/work with - and I have a Ph.D. in engineering! Can't recommend it - probably better to look at books/teaching CDs/DVDs by Douglas Spotted Eagle (the undisputed master of Vegas!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid basics. Easy index.","review":"Vegas is a sound editor (music editor etc) with video editing.Say again? Most inexpensive video edit mechanisms edit video. Sound is whatever happens in the process. Very hard to add motion clips to a sound script, a reading, a lecture etc. Real video editing nearly always starts with a sound track which has been tailored to the time allowed. Then visuals go in. That's the way it ought to be. That's the way the big boys do it. That's what Vegas is.But when the product suits the heavy users, how do you wade through the many \\"features\\" (distractions?) to know what YOU need to do? This is a good source. The organization is well suited to tasks rather than spin off from \\"features\\".High end users may want neato pearls in gobs. There's some. But the book sticks to the job at hand. Get the program up and running and get the job done. I like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good buy","review":"I bought this for my 4 y/o in hopes he would enjoy making sand trucks and then crushing them with his creations. Unfortunately, even though he loves trucks, he was disinterested in anything this set had to offer except the sand itself! The set does not come with a sand box or carrying case to keep the toys in so most of the contents of the set cannot be carried together. I would not recommend this to anyone expecting a set such as the Farm Moon Sand Set."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY SON LOVES THIS TOY!","review":"This is one of the best toys for my son, who is three. He will play with it for 1-2 hours at a stretch. He plays independently for long stretches, which is nice. I set it up on the kitchen table on a large cookie sheet to help contain the mess. I will definately be buying more Moon Sand in the future. Beware that is does make a bit of a mess, some usually ends up on the floor, but can be easily swept up at the end of playtime. It does stick to clothes, so I actually have one outfit my son wears when he plays with moon sand. I keep the outfit with the moon sand, so we just quickly change clothes. My son LOVES moon sand. For the amount of time he plays with it, it is worth the small amount of clean-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 right hands?","review":"I was excited about getting this one. I have been collecting Marvel Legends figures for around a year now. The greatest disappointment about this item was when I discovered that the figure had two right hands. That's not normal.

I'm surprised that the manufacturers don't take time to notice these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply priced and cheaply made","review":"I bought this boom box for the price but I did expect what features it has to work ok. Well I am very disappointed to say the least. The minute I got it I hooked it up and it just sounds terrible. I put in a brandnew cd and turned the volume up about 1/2 way and the volume cuts in and out. On the tape mode it doesnt do it. I would also like to point out that the FM stereo reception is terrible. I pulled in more stations on my cheap walkman. In the future I will go with a brand I know and stay away from the real cheap stuff. I just hope I can help atleast one other person in the buying decision of this thing.

Not any issues to speak of until about a year or two into it.However, I now have to enter my code anywhere from 2 to 5 times before the door will open. I've tried changing batteries and codes in different combinations only to have the inconsistency return after a time. My neighbor has the exact same system and experiences the exact problem. His unit is now to the point where you spend a good minute entering and re-entering the code before the door opens - extremely frustrating.In my opinion, this remote keypad needs a design update to improve the reliability of the button entry.Based on my experience with this keypad, I would NOT recommend it.

In light of my hectic travel schedule, I didn't open the DVD to watch this great show until 2 months later, only to discover that the copy I received would not play in my DVD player. When I placed the DVD in my laptop's DVD drive to confirm wheter or not it was my home DVD player or the DVD itself, I discovered that this DVD was not licensed for the U.S. region. My computer at least gave me the option of switching to the European regional classification, which I did. Most laptop's will only allow you to change regions for viewing up to 4 times, unless you have specific software that allows ongoing viewing for all international regional media classifications. My DVD player does not allow you to change regions, which means I can only watch this concert on my computer.

The sling style allows the bag to be slung around to the front of your body so that you can access the camera, lenses, or whatever else you have brought along with you. It is the perfect size for carrying the camera body, 2 lenses (it would be very tough to fit more than 2), camera manual, cords, charger, and extra battery. Some substitution could be done to fit an external flash in the bag, but there isn't much more room than that.

He has been carrying the typical bag (that comes with a camera) for more than a year now. Every vacation and outing he seemed to be the one carrying the camera bag.

The ability to get to his camera without taking off the bag is a plus. We were able to set it up to carry a camera with standard lens as well as a zoom lens in the main compartment. There is still plenty of space for cables, wallet, and sunglasses in the top compartment.

But then I was hauling two SLR bodies, 3 or so lenses, etc.To be honest I recently got a simple Lowepro Top Load 55 AW bag. My main set up is a Canon 60D and under rated but great Canon 18-135mm EF-S IS lens and it fits perfect with just a bit of room for maybe one other lens or flash in the outside pocket.My experience is the larger any camera bag the more stuff I haul :(And taking less stuff equals better photo opportunities at least for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice bag...for a small camera","review":"The bag is a very nice bag. The only problem is that my camera will not fit it with a 55-200mm lens connected to it.

It holds my Canon Rebel XS along with my flash, telephoto lens, filters, lens cleansing pen, and that's just the main compartment. Lot's of space and the zippers keep out harmful dust and dirt. It's compact and light weight so I barely notice it along with the rest of my gear. Best of all this wonderful bag is the most bang for your buck and so incredibly durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This fit my Olympus E500 great. I recently took an overseas trip and this bag was great for traveling and on the go trips. And the weatherproof cover really came in handy a few time when it started to rain unexpectly. The only thing that was a bit odd is the strap that you can wear around your body. It comes up the chest at an odd angle, my husband didn't have a problem with it but I did. So maybe thats just a girl thing.... :)Most times I didn't use the extra strap, just threw it over one shoulder and went. The bag held 2 lenses, extra battery, charger, and I had room for keys, wallet and a few little personal odds and ends. My friend was so impressed with it, he is buying one today.Some one asked if they can attach a tripod to the bag. There aren't really any extra loops on the outside of bag. A stadard tripod won't fit insidde. You would have to rig something up on the outside yourself. IMO I don't that that it would work very well but you can try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Torn on this bag","review":"I am torn on this bag. My D90 with 18-200 lens does not fit in the \\"recommended\\" way. I had to take out all the dividers on the right (bottom) side and put the camera in 90 degrees to the picture on this website so the lens points down. The 18-200 is a decent sized lens but the right hand dividers are just too long to allow the protruding grip on the D90 to go in far enough. I can still remove the camera fairly well but I lose the cool dividers on the right side. I am left with the skinnier rectangular pocket on the left (top) side.I love the design features of this bag. All the ergonomics, pouches, etc. are very well thought out. Which is why I am torn. The Skingshot 200 is WAY too big for at least what I have - the camera drowns in it. I wish there was a \\"150\\" that accommodated the slightly larger setup I have without too much extra space.So I definitely recommend this bag but try your actual setup before making a decision.

It comes with several movable partitions inside that have velcro mating attachment points. The problem is, the bag has only the original strips of velcro pile to attach to and this makes it impossible to create custom size partitions for various pieces of gear. I found a competitive bag that has velcro pile throughout the interior of the bag which allows their partitioning separators to attach wherever you need them.

But not much else did.I barely had room to fit in my flash, filters, wide-angle attachment, extra batteries and charger, etc. There is no room to grow with this bag.The bag seemed to be built well, but I needed something bigger, so I sent it back and ordered the Slingshot 200 Aw.The strap was a little awkward, being female. However, it wasn't enough of a hinderance to stop using it.For someone who doesn't plan on carrying their whole kit with them, or doesn't have a lot of accessories, I think this bag would work well. It's lightweight and durable. I just needed a little extra."},{"rating":"2","title":"a nice and functional bag","review":"Just got the Slingshot 100 for my Nikon D50 with kit lens. Previously, I bought a Nikon bag but as this was just a bag to fit the camera and nothing else, I found this unpractical. The D50 fits perfectly in the slingshot 100, though I had to readjust the velcro camera compartment dividers first. This was quite disappointing as I have almost no free space in my camera compartment anymore!I guess the Canon 350D, which has a smaller body, will fit in this bag better. Anyway I have no other lenses yet (the 18-200 still on order) so that all my gear (battery, memory cards etc.) finds a place in this bag. The bag fits very well, is comfortable and is well-made. Before buying though, do check if your camera and lens will fit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"This is a good product and it fit my need.

I could squeeze my Canon xti with the kit lens and lens hood and a 70-300 zoom...the closure was bursting. I could not fit much else in there, a flash would never fit. The top compartment is just big enough for a wallet. That being said, it looks well constructed and may be useful for someone that has very little gear. I'll stick to my shoulder bag for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top handle tears","review":"The loop at the top of the pack tore while I was bringing my gear from the car to the house.

My mobile/cell phone goes in the outer small compartment.I carry a tripod separately in its own sling bag. After about an hour the full bag starts getting uncomfortable.The main thing about using this bag with its side access is that nothing ever has to go on the ground, great for convenience and security.I tried my friends 200 SlingShot and found it too bulky and much less ergonomic than the 100.

This is an ideal bag if you do not want to travel heavy. I have only used it for a few hours at a time, so I have no opinion on how it is as an all-day pack. I keep an Olympus dslr with a 14-45 mounted, a 40-150 with both lens hoods in one pocket, and a speedlight in the other. It all fits, barely. The upper pocket is great for cables, batteries and such, but if you want to carry lots of filters, meters and so forth, it will be too small. The outside is also useful, but tight and flat; think pens and notebooks. The side camera access is great. If you want a great city bag, this is it, but you will want a larger bag if you go for big lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and chic camera bag","review":"I researched camera bags till I was blue in the face and was left tearing my hair out at the various types of bags out there.

It hols my Rebel Xsi and 3 lenses including a telephoto lens as well as all my charging accessories, extra batteries, cables etc etc with ease. The best thing about this bag is the ease of access.

It is a very well-padded compact bag, and has enough room for a dSLR with lens attached (I have an EOS Digital Rebel XT) and room for two additional lenses (one shorter-length prime lens and maybe one standard telephoto zoom). Additionally, it's easy to quickly remove the camera from the bag because the zippers are on the side of the sling, allowing you quickly swing the bag to the front of your body, open the bag, and grab your camera. Removeable padded areas attached via Velcro allow for personal customization of the bag to better fit your equipment needs. This bag gets a favorable mention in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-organized, compact, includes padding for your back...","review":"My Canon EOS20D is larger than the Digital Rebel - not to mention I bought it with the 17-85 mm lens which is longer than the default 18-55 mm one. It fits. Still room for the 2 lenses (or 1 lens and a flash). Separate pockets for CF cards, cables, filters, with the waterproof cover neatly tucked/hidden into the padded back.It is full, yes. That plus the internal, padded, configurable dividers, keeps everything in place - no sliding around. With well-thought out opening capability, the messenger bag format lets me slip it around front to lift the camera out without taking it off my shoulders or dumping the lenses. I like it and its size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Bag!","review":"I wasn't sure how I'd feel about a sling bag but I LOVE this bag!!! There is enough room at the top I can put my wallet, 2 diapers, some chapstick and mini-sunblock in the top.

We travel a lot and I've taken this bag to Disneyland, Colorado, Mexico and Canada... as well as small day trips around our home like the zoo or beach. This bag works out great. I carry my Canon Rebel, zoom lense, flash, extra battery and CF cards without any problem.The bag fits comfortably on my body (I'm 5\\"4') and on my husband (he's 6\\"2').

It doesn't allow for all that much customization (velcro spots are limited) and by default, there is no good place to put a DSLR w/lens attached. I managed to create a cavity that works for this purpose, but it wastes some space and probably doesn't quite provide optimal protection.Overall, however, the backpack has a lot of space with specialized pockets for various accessories.

On some of the selections, his voice is multi-tracked. Kinda like the Judds country blues. My favorite songs are: Maudie, Breaking Up Somebody's Home, Easy On Yourself, and the title cut.

I went with these new ones because the self-venting nozzle would serve my needs better than a hole on the back of the can, as in the case of the old Igloo water jugs.Looks like I'll have to go Milspec surplus to get decent jugs.YMMV"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for carrying water to a garden.","review":"I bought this container to carry water to a vegetable garden that has no water source nearby.

Since Igloo won't carry parts for that jug, I bought a couple of these. My review is mostly positive.Good - shape is better than the Igloo, shorter and fatter, still fits in my camper storage area, but easier to handle. Spout seems to be tougher than the Igloo, time will tell.Bad - air vents through the spout with a cute little air tube that kinda stays outta the way of the water leaving. Not as good as a separate air vent like most water and gas cans have. Water flow is not as good as the Igloo, because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little flimsy, and not exactly as described","review":"This product is described as featuring a \\"Transparent color (that) allows view of water level.\\" Unfortunately, that is not true. Mine came molded in an opaque blue plastic, and you cannot see the water level.Also, the spout is made from a thin plastic that feels brittle, and both it and the container have poorly molded threads that make it easy to cross-thread the spout when attaching it. Furthermore, the container cannot be sealed without the spout in place and exposed as shown in the product photo. This all combines to make the spout a vulnerable weak point that could be relatively easily snapped off, rendering the container useless.I will keep mine since I don't intend to use it regularly and I think the spout will survive my limited use, but my next purchase will be a genuine army-issue water can. They are much more durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, disjointed","review":"The authors try to convince the reader that since archaeology involves peeling back the physical layers of ancient settlements, then exegesis should also peel back layers of the Gospels. This is not an obvious truth and requires a leap to accept. They then proceed to \\"peel back\\" layers in the Gospels, pretty much at random and without convincing me. They use circular reasoning, biased judgments and some fairly insulting claims about the Gospel writers. It makes a lot more sense and is certainly more intellectually honest to take the witnesses to Jesus's life as serious historians. Where do I go to get my money back?

I decided to bite the bullet again and try a single Verbatim to see how it burns. Surprisingly, it worked on 4/4 of my burners.

Throw in the Gestapo, black musicians, a Japanese fixer-diplomat, Admiral Canaris, António de Oliveira Salazar, Reinhard Heydrich, Winston Churchill, Heinrich Himmler, and all that is missing are the Valkyries. But in lieu of opera, Higgins bases the plot on a kidnapping of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. There are two interesting pieces to this thriller-less thriller; the revisionist casting of the Duke as a deep, romantic, wily patriot and the very sympathetic view of SS-Brigadeführer Walter Schellenberg. The novel is based on an actual attempt by Schellenberg to convince the Duke and Duchess of Windsor to work for Germany. Higgins is on autopilot with this one with a talky book lacking his usual action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christopher Lee rocks!","review":"The story itself is an exciting one, but the very best thing about this audio versionis the dynamic reading given by Mr. Lee.

Step by step, he walks us through the many eerie and remarkable contacts with his dead friend, Michael, sharing his doubts, his fears and finally his hopes and convictions that somehow Michael has managed to cross the void in order to send his Messages of life after death to his family and friends.

When a friend showed me this book by a mental health worker, I thought it would be really clinical and dry. What a surprise to find that it's well written, filled with new discoveries regarding the subject of life after death. I don't usually go for this genre, but the writing flows and the author lets the readers decide for themselves whether the story makes a good case for life after death. The book makes a lot of sense, and it's really exciting to see that science is backing up some of the claims of organized religion, without any dogma, plus it's entertaining reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool look!","review":"Let me say that I really like the look of this toy and it makes nice laser patterns so it does everything it is supposed.

I started to read this book. My initial reaction on one of the pieces was to put the book down. I had to because that particular piece made me cry. I picked it up again, and had to put it down again. The next one had me on the floor rollin with laughter. I picked it up again. \\"Only in my Empire\\", reminded me of my relationship or the one I wish I had. Great book.I went thru so many different emotions during my read. And after I was done, I went back to it to read it some more. I did notice that there were certain pieces that I gravitated to, these are my favorites.This book is shorter than what I wanted to see. Big ups, because it's just that good, that I wanted to keep reading.Beautifully written. Definitely relatable on all levels. A must have for your literary shelves."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Light Breezy Read","review":"Judging a book by it's cover, I thought this book would be a light breezy read similar to the novels of Rachel Gibson, Elizabeth Beverley and such. Instead I found myself with a book about a mother's long ago death and the struggles a young woman faces dealing with raising her younger siblings. Nina dreams of the day she can leave her responsiblities behind but her best friend (whose fiancee ran off to become a nun 15 years ago)asks Nina to make him a daddy before she goes.This book is packed with tragedy amd not many laughs. The tragedy drags on and on as Nina wrestles with the idea of being a mother herself. NOT a fun read. I barely made it to the end. The last few chapters of the book seem very rushed and not very fleshed out, a major revelation seems to be thrown in at the last minute without a lot of background.This book just really seemed to drag. I think the publisher should have chosen a different cover for such heavy reading material."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Contemporarily Good Read!","review":"I found this book as a wonderful contemporary read! Great story line and characters are what kept me wanting to read more.

The story was told completely through dialogue and the PRESENT tense. I've never read a book completely told in the present tense and now I know why. Although the reader might think this would increase the intimacy, it doesn't. Instead, the brain needs to slog through a tense that just doesn't work at all.I've never read a book by Ms. Markham and never will again until she writes on the front that she uses past tenses.Wasn't there an editor at Warner to point this difficulty out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mix of happiness and tears","review":"This is a really fun book to read, a great book to take to the beach.

Hard to attach a tripod to camera with the rubber flopping into the underneath of the camera. Fits like a glove - a baseball glove.

It took a bit of work to insert the camera, but it is worth it. I do not use the lens hood because it falls off. I recommend trying it before attaching the lens cap to it. That is not important to me because I use my old lens hood.The only problem I have is that the attachment for my tripod is over-sized, so I cannot leave it on the camera.

If you are planning to carry your lunch box in this, then this is the right bag. This is outright bulky and large for a camera period. For about 10 bucks I found a much better choice, Lezura Camera bag. Also if anyone thought that Sony made this bag then they are in for a big ride. This bag is probably made by some Chinese company and Sony has chosen them as their official supplier and command a undeserving high price tag.

Not only will it not stay on due to the air vent holes water collects on the top of the cover and in falls to the bottom of the pool. Totally defeating the purpose of a pool cover. Very disappointed with Intex's products at this point. Once again money wasted and the company has no concern for the customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful Account of a Journey of a Person and of Peoples","review":"I have to be honest and say I suspect that \\"Ben Black\\" is not a first time writer but a more experienced and established name who for some reason is writing under a pseudonym. Why do I say this? Because it is rare enough to come across such a well-writen, insightful, humurous & ultimately human account of a journey in one of the world's most turbulent regions - let alone from somone with no experience of writing.Having spent many separate months and years in the Middle East (many during the same periods as Black was there), I can honestly say that he has managed somehow to capture the feel and spirit of much of the region and peoples, and bottled it up in this gem of a book. This should be required reading for anyone thinking of spending any time in or around Israel, and is particularly poignant in the current climate. I can't reccomend it enough.Come on \\"Ben\\", who are you really, and when is your next book coming out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first half of the book alone worth the price","review":"I'm not even done with the book yet, but I have to say, I am really enjoying it so far. When Pastor Weaver describes her life...the troubled upbringing, the poor life choices, the panicked feeling of not being able to help herself...I can relate. When she talks about her approach to dealing with the pain...I can relate. When she states that the solution is in God FIRST, and getting into His Word, I am nodding my head enthusiastically. I feel that this is what God has been telling me for a while now. I'm just a slow listener.Her eight week plan starts off with preparing yourself through scripture first, and I think that that is extremely important. For most of us, the thought of dieting again is filled with anxiety and panic. We try to do it under our own power, and for me, that has never, ever worked for the longterm. I highly recommend this book for Christians, especially women. And for anyone else willing to hear the message in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I'VE MET THE MINISTER/AUTHOR IN PERSON\\"","review":"Her True life testimony is very powerfeul and all that she has gone through. I heard her speak on October 1, 2005 in Virginia and boy was she powerful. Not until she put GOD first did her fitness for life work out. I'm buying the book today and will come back with my result after reading the book. I must say if her book is anywhere as powerful as her VHS tapes ministering GODs work through song, dance, praise and exercise it's awesome. I am now working out with 2 of her tapes and can feel the power of exercising with spiritual music. You have to be focused on GOD first before your Fitness Life will work for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm always looking for ways to improve my life based upon God's ways and that is why I chose this book to help me improve my health.

After the first few chapters, I finally stopped reading the book because it took too long to get to the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Malachi","review":"Levy gives us an excellent commentary that is very practical on the book of Malachi.

Tightward Gazette recommends recycling plastic bags. I have never done so but a sturdier bag would stand up better to being washed. I like the zipper mechanism which works on this model but does not work on the jumbo size. However, America's Test Kitchen found that this type was not airtight and was inferior to the Glad seal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for food!","review":"The gallon Hefty One Zip Freezer bags are constructed of a thicker plastic, with a zipper at the top. It is a perfect container for manuals, papers, and CD's that come with various electronics and computer parts.

Nothing but trouble here. Most of the Mariner flights I've heard of have been power loops into the ground, and since this isn't the most durable rocket in the world, most have wound up in pieces. Now you know what the broom and dustpan are for."},{"rating":"1","title":"below average","review":"The whole title and description made me really want to read this book, but it really disappointed me. The characters really had no depth, and it turned out to really be nothing special. The whole \\"who did it?????\\" concept seems like something that has been used and used and was a little boring. Also I think that the author could have been a little more descriptive with the people and the whole place. I do find myself agreeing with the whole hiding behind the hair thing... I do it myself!All in all I think that the vocab. and flat, 2D characters in the book would be a little more appropriate for someone between the ages of 9-11, but most parents would complain if their 9-year-old was reading about a bloody murder, so I don't know what age group would enjoy this book. So, just take my advice and DON'T READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting plot, but terrible writing!","review":"The book description pulled me in, but Nightmare turned out to be a childish, flat book. The plot was slightly innovative, but the author ruined the book's chance for success by using terrible dialoge (the characters used phrases and words that no one would use in real life) and flat, unreal characters. Basically, the novel read like it was written by one of the high-school kids in my creative writing class."},{"rating":"2","title":"great CD!","review":"This is an awesome CD!

She laughed hysterically throughout the movie, while I was laughing as well, but about a completely different thing. She laughed because she thought it was funny. I laughed because I thought it was ridiculously stupid.The screenplay was horrible. About every other line, I would shake my head in dissapointment. The plot must have been written without thought. The acting was alright. But I am not an Ashton Kutcher fan. If he can become a famous actor, then so can any other average person.I must say this is one of the worst movies ever. Crossroads was a better movie than this. Don't waste your time watching this like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"Whilst we paid for Gold Class tickets to see this movie - the flick was far from Gold.

You know you're getting older when everything you see starts reminding you of something you've seen before, that you liked a lot better.At best, this film is basically a half-assed 'Say Anything' knock-off. At worst, you'll want to hang yourself watch Peete and Kutcher try and \\"out-cute\\" one another. The truth, however, always seems to be somewhere in the middle.Myself ... I'll take Lloyd Dobler and Diane Court any day over this fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"A LOT LIKE A BIG FLOP!","review":"A note to Ashton : Dear Ashton, why do you insist on playing the same roles over and over again? The first weekend out and it only grossed seven million dollars which by all acounts is considered a major flop indeed. Movies that gross over twenty million in its first week is consdered average. I predict this movie will not have the legs to last 3 weeks in the cinemas and will quickly go to video. This was a very tedious, poor written movie starring perhaps one of the most boring actors ever to grace the silver screen. Ashton is no longer, not that he ever was, a big Hollywood draw. He is utterly unlikeable and annoying much in the same vain an adult who carries on like an infant is. Sorry, but you need to start considering other roles or you will be back in Iowa picking corn before you know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow, but decent","review":"The movie itself is a decent movie, but it is very slow moving. On the plus side it is good to see it progress, albeit slowly, through the years. But on the negative side the movie was predictable and didn't evoke too much emotion, which is an absolute must for romantic comedies.All in all, the movie was a good one. Rent it, don't buy, and enjoy, because it is a fun movie (the scene where Emily runs into the sliding glass window is hilarious) and you come away with a smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun!!!","review":"I truly enjoyed this movie....the two main characters have great chemistry together. I do feel, however, that one of the deleted scenes should have been included as it explained more fully what had taken place during the year after Oliver's company received the VC money. Otherwise, I liked the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original story, decent job by Peet and Kutcher","review":"Again, didn't expect much out of a movie with Aston Kutcher, I gear up usually for crude humor and a few brainless laughs, but this movie was different, and he actually showed he could be a decent actor. Amanda peet was perfectly cast along side him. An entertaining story of love that took 6 years to perfect, and along the way they discovered things that were \\"a lot like love\\", but will true love find them in the end. Will Oliver (Kutcher) get his 6 year plan complete, and will Emily (Peet) be paying him $50 for the bet they make when they first meet in New York. It move along at just the right pace, and not overdone or to long either, keeps you hooked. So check it out for a romantic comedy, its not to shabby."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased Customer","review":"DVD arrived very quickly.

Why would the company in NY give money to Oliver's company after that horrid office presentation....The whole idea of a diaper company did not help the movie at all and was not needed, in my opinion.

In the deft hands of director Nigel Cole, \\"A Lot Like Love\\" is more than the typical rom-com fare. Yes, it's romantic and funny, but it's also poignant, subtle, and well-acted, qualities most films in this genre tend to lack. \\"A Lot Like Love\\" sails along nicely, thanks to a smart and zesty script, as well as Kutcher and Peet's fantastic chemistry and nuanced performances. It's no surprise how it all turns out, and the clichéd finale is rushed and a bit of a disappointment, but there is a lot more to like about \\"A Lot Like Love\\" than not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I found this movie to be a bit slow.

Great movie. Love it. Watch it. Ok thats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Though long for a romantic comedy, at close to two hours, this is well done. Ashton's acting is pretty good, even if his mug is angelic. Amanda Peet has the better role and handles it well. They are always getting together at the wrong time, is the movie's central conceit. By the end, you know what's going to happen. Actually, you know that at the beginning.

While ironing, I could see the pattern on the ironing board through the material. Difficult to put on if you like it to look classy. Even after 30 mins of work with two people, looks like a thin, cheap sheet over the sofa/chairs. I'm 29 and if I wanted my living room to look like a dorm room again, this is the type of item for it. I purchased the \\"natural\\" color. Natural is more like a khaki color. The bows do NOT look like as pictured. If fitting taut over the furniture with no wrinkles, there is not even material to tie the bows to have loose, beautiful bows.

It looks like a sheet on your chair, and even with some dryer heat to get it ironed it looks like a sheet. Also the Amazon prompted it could be returned to Target if you needed to return it rather then the normal return process for Amazon. This turned out to be the worse choice. Not only did I wait in a long line, then the Target associate was held up with trying to return this product, but the hassle got worse when the person she was talking to decided I can NOT return it to Target and shipped another one instead. This blocked my Amazon account for days, and I feel it reflected wrong information saying I could return it this way. I refused the new shipment or course, and after a few days could return it to Amazon with customer service and an apology email.

Also, the constant shift of moods and how the characters change their minds about one another does not make any sense nor is it justified. It took me 2 days to skim through this book because it just did not keep my interest long enough for me to want to rush through it to know the ending - a complete waste of time"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Maiden","review":"Not one of her better ones. Having a hard time in deciding what to rate it. The story was decend, but the constaint arguing/yelling and Jura thinking she was right all the time, got to me. She never gave Rowan a chance. There was no give on her side. Her mind was set in the beginning and that was it. I tried to give her the a chance to explain away why she would act like this, but eventually just got of sick of it. Rowan at times was the same way, but he would see when he was wrong and would come around, or even give a little when he wasn't. Jura pretty much never admitted she was wrong until the end.

I agree with most other comments on this one. The characters are completely flat, you can't like them, they are so one dimensional they are totally unbelievable.

I really can't imagine how a company like logitech that is known for keyboards could produce a product with such poor ergonomic design and no tactile feedback at all.

If you watch movies in the dark, you have to use the glow button, guess what, you will have to replace the batteries once a month at least. Also, Logitech has over simplifed the remote. You can't program individual buttons you have to use their program that only allows you to program devices and not the remote directly. If you have to go into the device menu a lot you will not be able to control the volume unless you switch to the device that controls volume. Why not have an option to program each button period... But the remote is useless now because of the low battery life. Do not buy this unless you want to buy batteries every month. Ridiculous. Only remote I have ever had like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor customer support","review":"This is a great unit but beware of customer support.

I bought it and started to use it, and was finding error after error, whether it was in a procedure or in a shortcut key process. The book is helpful in its tutorial set-up, but it does not cover the newest changes in 6.0 as thoroughly as I would have preferred. I am disappointed in it, but will keep it for its tutorials. I did figure out a number of procedures on my own. Maybe it was written with errors to test one's knowledge of Photoshop, but I don't think so. I already e-mailed New Riders about this.

The tutorials spend an awful lot of space on 57 ways to make a drop shadow and neato things you can do with the demo software on the disc. In fact I would say a third of the book is really advertising for other software one can add to photoshop - most of it of very little value.I used Inside Photoshop 4 to convert to Photoshop from Photo-Paint a few years ago and that was a great book. I have the feeling it was fully updated for version 5 and this edition for version 6 was tossed together quickly with the advertorial content outweighing the editorial content at every stage in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginning!!!","review":"I love this book. Gary Bouton's approach is so awesome. The tutorials are easy to follow and fun. I learned more than just how to complete the tutorial. I felt like I could apply the things I learned to my own projects. Having never used Photoshop before, I was really intimidated. It looked so complex. Now that I have Gary's book I feel good about the software. I know which tools are which and I have no problem using them on my own work. I recommend this book highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very resourceful book for the beginner and expert","review":"This book is HUGE.

The authors go on to infinitum about topics that are completely irrelevant to using Photoshop. All instructions are based on short cut keys, not drop-down menus - most frustrating if you are more familiar with the drop downs. I thought so little of this book, and found it so lacking it applicable information, that I actually tossed it in the trash! With all the supplemental documentation available on Photoshop 6.0, this should not even be a consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photoshop Student:","review":"I was hoping this book would shed some light on photoshop 6, but it does fall way short of perfection.

I'm planning to get another one for my right thumb, since it will fit both with no problem. Be advised you may need a very small double sided tape to be able to keep the saddle from moving while playing (a strip about a 1/8 by 1/2\\" will do).

I myself even learnt some things about Australian mammals.I have lived in Australia for my whole life (26 years) and can safely say I have not until now felt the need so strongly to visit Tasmania and explore this part of the world!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best novel about Tasmanian Tigers that I have read","review":"The Last Thylacine is a well written and engaging story. The characters are believable and the plot is engaging. Basically it involves a man who sees a Tas. Tiger and make a report. This leads to the loss of his job. He then organizes an effort to find proof of the Tas. Tiger's continued existence. His associates are interesting and there are many plot twists that are unique and well done. The book includes a glossary of \\"Aussie\\" terms to help in understanding the dialogue. I did not need to refer to that section, but it would be helpful for some who are not familiar with some of the slang from downunder.Overall the book is a good read and to say more about the plot and outsmoe would be to spoil your reading. So just enjoy this book, and let us all hope that it is not The Last Thylacine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniden Pro520XL CB Radio - Very good product and service.","review":"I think probably the best compact CB radio for the price.

It is quite small but has all the knobs and switches that I was looking for in a CB radio. I mounted this under the dash for my 4x4 - it is small enough not to get kicked getting in and out. This has a ANL and NB to quiet the reception noise and a RF gain control to reduce strong signals. No issues with it working at any level. IT works. It's on with the key and off with the key. NO issues.My only complaint isn't about this radio; more of I miss my old radio. I had an old JCPenney CB radio some 35 years ago. The squelch control on the JCP radio kicked in kinda gradually. Not all on at once or all off at once. A nice fade in and out. I wish this radio did the same thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice small CB","review":"I like this CB but haven't had it very long so time will tell.

In short, Murray's argument is foolish.Inflation would eat up the redistributed $10,000, and, unless the \\"gift\\" money were indexed to inflation, that $10,000 would be worth about $100 in a couple of years. Inflation would come in many forms: higher rents, higher food and fuel bills, etc. For example, an important reason for a food stamp being a food stamp is not just to ensure that the money is spent on food, but also to ensure that more paper money isn't loosed upon the economy causing unforeseen inflationary pressures. Food stamps do not cause inflation; Murray's program most certainly would.Buy the book if you want, but be sure to brush up on your economics as you read this absolute and utter nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"Charles certainly has done a lot of research for this tome.

That is much more unique in my opinion. Taking a common popular name like Michaela, or Madison, and changing the spellings to McKayla, Makaela, Mykaela, Madacyn, Madasyn or Madecin is not going to make a common popular name sound or look any less common or popular or unique, it will just look like common popular name that is spelled incorrectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of Missing Pages!","review":"This book is a joke!

While it does taste good, it is not 16.00 or so dollars good, and is not what the labeling leads one to believe. Not a full one star because it is a good quality fish, if you want to pay that much money for it. But again, it is not true smoked salmon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crowd Management","review":"These are just what they sound like; wristbands for events, parties, etc. After having paid excessive amounts at local stores for similar wristbands, the money you save on them through Amazon is awesome.

It's an attempt to bring together: Quantum theory, Doctrines, Religion - World Religions, Religion, Buddhism - General, and Cosmology.It is surprising to see how close the relationship might be. Back in 1962, Murray Gell-Mann began to fit the known elemental particles into a series of eight 'families.' Gell-Mann called this beautiful symmetry the 'Eightfold Way' after the Buddha's 'Eightfold path to truth.' This correlation or merger seems to have continued.In this book, the discussions are far ranging over the nature of matter itself, the experimental evidence, and the nature of the mind and its logic. It is not intended to be a textbook on modern particle physics, but it almost is. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is more about Modern Physics than Buddhism","review":"Although he does say a few things about Buddhist philosophy, the actual role of the Dalai Lama in these discussions turned out to be acting as the perfect \\"straight man\\" for a presentation of some of the bizarreness of modern physics: intelligent but not indoctrinated into the belief that everything \\"scientific\\" is necessarily correct.Most of the material is more-or-less orthodox Quantum Mechanics. Some of the more far-out concepts, as Finkelstein admitted, may not last as long as the end of next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many duds","review":"There were about six defective reeds in my box of ten.

I got the item in the mail & sure enough it was not 4 gauge AWG. Still installed the kit anyway because I knew that & I'm not going for competition sound just good clean sound with 1 12\\" sealed sub in my wifes 2010 Mazda3. Got everything installed without too much trouble & got the sub working & it works just as well as it did before in her previous car & sounds great now. So just to emphasize, if you're an audiophile & you're wanting competition grade products to drive the most power, this is not it. But if you're the average consumer & you want a cheap kit to hook up your amp & sub I would suggest this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading specs","review":"This item is listed as having 4 gauge wire in it. It is no where near 4 gauge, maybe 8 gauge, but that's pushing it. I was replacing my 8 gauge with this 4 gauge to support a more powerful amp, but once I saw the lack of copper, I boxed it up and sent it back. I should have known it was too good to be true, since 4 gauge wire costs $2.50 per foot at the local audio store, so 20ft is $50 and this whole kit is only $30. Don't waste your time ordering this kit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 4 gauge! More like 8 gauge with thick insulation!","review":"The cable included in this kit appears to be 8ga with thick insulation to make it look like 4ga. I compared it to a real 4ga and a 9ga cable I had lying around and the wire is only slightly thicker than the 9ga and nowhere near the thickness of the 4ga. If you buy this, you'll note that there are no markings on the cable giving the specs. Also, a 60Amp fuse will give you ~800 Watts max at the amplifier (60 amps x 13.5 volts = 810 Watts)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is junk....stay away","review":"When the kit arived I thought it looked better than expected. The wires looked nice and as expected (from previous reviews) the wire was not 4 guage. The real issue I have is with the fuse holder and wire ends. The screws for the fuse holder are weak and I am not sure what size wrench you need because my SAE and Metric sets did not fit. The other wire ends are crimp style however it required my vice to actually crimp them. I really had low expectations for the kit when I ordered it but it did not even meet those expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"... it works, but not great.","review":"Okay the good part first. It does include all necessary parts to install a car amplifier. The bad, it's not 4 gauge wiring. It's the correct diameter but 50% of this is the surrounding protective cover. I would suggest this kit to somebody that is installing an amp 500 watts or less. If you're looking for big bandwidth wire, this is not the kit for you. The price and suggestion at it being 4 gauge is very alluring but be weary, it's not what you're expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get what you pay for generally","review":"I'm not complaining.

This study is not merely about Guyana and the Caribbean but mirrors developments in Africa and among African Americans as well. Matthew Quest's introductory essay places Eusi Kwayana in conversation with the thought of the Pan African CLR James. But perhaps Kwayana should be seen as also a kindred spirit to James Boggs, the Detroit based African American autoworker, who examined racism in relation to the class struggle and critique Black capitalism as a myth and irrational basis of Black freedom in the same era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Autonomous Movement of Workers in the Caribbean","review":"Eusi Kwayana's book documents and early 1970s movement of Afro-Guyanese bauxite miners in confrontation with their government and their union.

If you are wanting to read a biography about someone who has had full Enlightenment--this is NOT the one. Because she was affiliated with Sri Laksmana Swamy and Sri Mathru Sarada I took this as an endorsement from them about her, they may be Saints but she is not. One of her teachers was Adi Da which should have told me right away where she was coming from. Sorry I read it even though I couldn't finish it, I sure got what I needed to about her. I kept hoping that it was going to get more inspiring as I went along in the book but for me it just didn't happen. She does have a practice of recording her dreams and has a very active dream life. Her destiny does seem to be about helping women to break out of the gender role of being in a female body but focusing on the third eye will not get her or them to the ultimate goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bathroom rack","review":"Our bathroom didn't have any shelves and I wanted a small shelf to hold magazines, extra TP, etc. This shelf is very pretty, was fairly easy to put together and is working really well.

I could walk to the local supermarket, go inside and still get reception. The only problem is the power pack died. So I figured lets get a Uniden 2.4 Ghz. Well I can't even walk out my front door without this phone getting choppy and making all sorts of noise. If I walk by the microwave, I cannot hear the other person at all. This phone is worse than my 900Mhz. Very dissatisfied, but maybe its just my phone and not the model. Take it for what its worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Basic Cordless Phone","review":"This phone is of very high quality. The sound is increadible as is the range. I live in New York City and am able to walk as far as a full city block without losing the signal. The only drawback is that the signal doesn't slowly drop out. One minute it is at 100% then the line goes dead. It would be nice if it had some type of warning. If you are looking for a simple high quality cordless phone, this is the phone for you. What it lacks in bells and whistles it makes up for in quality.**UPDATE - The buttons have failed several times and I have now discarded the phone. It got to the point where I could not answer a call no matter how hard I pushed the buttons.**"},{"rating":"2","title":"COMPACT - SHARP NEW COLOR","review":"Purchased because of UNIDEN reputation. Color is a silver/gray metallic. Phone is compact. A different feature about the unit is that, when you hang it up on the wall mount, it hangs with the keypad facing you. It seems to be working ok that way but just something different than cordless phones of the past. When you lift it off the base, you have to give it a half-twist to turn it around for its use. The sound on the phone when you first use it seems like an echo but is not as noticable after using it a few times. Am hoping it will give us service as other Uniden products have in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"high quality without the high profile","review":"Never heard of Rado until my wife surprised me two Christmas' ago.

I would find him incredibly difficult and dense to read. However, this book changed my mind about this great theologian.Written at a level the average theologically educated reader can understand, von Balthasar's questions raised in this book are no less penetrating. I particularly enjoyed his insightful expositions of Simon-Peter's human fallibility, as well as von Balthasar's theological speculation why Our Lord would choose this very apostle to be graced with the Petrine Primacy and the gift of infallibility.Nevertheless, as von Balthasar reminds the reader, these gifts are not given to St. Peter for his personal benefit, but rather to facilitate his service to the entire Church.A must read for all Catholic apologists, as well as those struggling with the Petrine Primacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book to read","review":"I may not have read the entire book yet, but it is already interesting.

But, the back of it is very misleading. I thought that it was going to be about a man finding out he was a father after several years But, I was completely mistaken. It was nothing like that.

It's rudimentary and mundame combat sequences. You literally get stomped and jumped at every corner... there are NO DEFENSE mechanisms so if one of those little suckers gets a hit in, you just have to sit there and take the BRUNT of the combos. This makes for a truly frustrating game. The save function [is bad] as it will only save the beginning of the levels that you are playing, so no matter how afr you get in a level and you hit the save function, it will only save back to teh beginning of the level.This game is all hype, no substance totally ...as bad as state of emergency.

The gameplay (MORE LIKE LAMEPLAY IN THIS CASE) is the most important factor. Well that's another story.. it's just so lame. LAME LAME LAME!!

The graphics are not to the level one would expect with Xbox. The story is weak. The most annoying element is the save feature. You cannot save as you go despite the menue and the process leading to this possible conclusion. This ends up being one of the most annoying and aggrevating features of the game.

The book gives a heading for a specific topic then talks about the topic very little, interjecting useless stories and references to other parts of the book that equally as ambiguous/incomplete that just serve to confuse the reader.

Instead, the inarticulate Arquette leads us through a meandering flattery fest (\\"you're, like, so amazing\\"), constantly emphasizing appearance by telling the actresses how good they look, as if her point is that actresses over 40 should be cast in movies not because they're talented, but because they still look sexy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic movie that could have been very good","review":"Some of the interview subjects in this movie are interesting individuals, others self-absorbed adolescents, but Ms. Arquette is essentially inarticulate and doesn't seem to know how to conduct an intelligent interview.

But all I can get from this CB is engine noise. In fact, the electrical interference is so bad, I have to turn my squelch all the way to the right to block it out, rendering my CB completely useless. The noise is electrical interference coming through the air -- not just from my own engine, but from every car that I pass on the road.I installed a high-quality antenna cable and an RFI filter, but that didn't help at all. So the cause of the problem is either my antenna, or the radio itself. I didn't notice the problem with my Midland CB, so the PRO538W seems to have lousy internal shielding.

Bought an antenna that picks up weather-band to go with it, reception is crystal clear and weather-band comes in just as well. Looking for a good all around radio? This is the one to buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CB radio","review":"The Uniden Pro538W is a fantastic radio. The front-fire speaker is very clear compared to my other CB. This makes a huge difference because many CB'ers have an accent and lingo that I have trouble deciphering. The microphone is built for heavy use. It has a hefty coiled cable with a connector that screws on to the radio. You don't need to worry about the mic coming unplugged. The display has an LED meter that indicates the strength of signals that you are receiving and transmitting. I think the meter is too small to look at while I'm driving down the highway. You can also pick up NOAA weather broadcasts. The squelch and RF gain adjustments work great.I purchased this radio with the Wilson Lil-Wil magnetic mount antenna. The combination work great in my mini-van. I've taken this radio on a couple of road trips and have never had a problem reaching other drivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CB radios out there!","review":"I searched and reviewed a dozen different CB radios before selecting this one. It has everything I need and is definitely within my budget. The front facing speaker is excellent for projecting sound and since it faces front you won't get it muffled by the way it is mounted. It has a push button for channel 9 and of course a PA/CB/Weather selector switch. It has 3 weather channels available and on my cross country trip from the East coast to the West coast I almost always had a weather channel available. I have a magnetic mount antenna (Lil something) which I also bought from Amazon and it rocks with this radio. For the cost and features this is one of the best (if not THE best) CB radio available. You can't go wrong with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CB","review":"This CB has the NOAA weather bands on it and almost anywhere in the country, you will be able to pick up the local weather on one of the three channels. The squelch and RF gain dial allow you to tune out weak or staticy signals that interfere with what you do want to listen to or talk with.A good value, all in all, and (I am told) they are made with the same circuitry that Cobras are made with for much less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"I love this Finger Saddle!

I was surprised that it is hard molded plastic with no rubber or cushioning on it. It would need to be taken off each time I put my flute in the case and I am afraid the process of taking it off and putting it on will scratch my flute. I developed tendonitis in my left hand index finger and felt this would help my tendon heal. However, I am not willing to risk scratching my flute to solve my problem. I am looking for another way to cushion that finger.

I can't get 10 feet out my door without enormous static and clicking noises until the connection finally drops. I have tried relocating the phone, and it's no better. I also put it in the EXACT place where my 900mhz phone was, and no better either.2. There is an echo. Not the kind of echo as in a delayed sound, but you hear yourself back through the headset, and it's somewhat annoying.3. Party on the other end compared it to my 900mhz phone, and said the 900mhz was much clearer.Sorry Uniden.

The size ended up being the problem. My son gave it to the baby while she was on her mat a few feet away from me and almost smothered her with it!!!!! The toy COMPLETELY covered her face and is very plush so definitely could have obstructed her breathing.

The origanl French title is Le Bossu, or The Hunchback. If you like romance, action, a good period setting that's done with impecable taste and atistry, and a thoroughly enjoyable and charmingly involving fable, this is one to consider. I really loved it!

This book showed me that all kinds of tomorrows could exist. It was an easy and enjoyable read for me. I connected quickly to the main character and his journey into adulthood.

I have read many end-user reviews and without exception if you are going to use the mixer a lot and mix heavy batches. Regardless of the ratings the WORD IS; Buy a mixer other than Kitchen Aid.

The enamel chips off the sides of the paddle after some minor use. I called kitchen aid and they said I could purchase another paddle for $14.95 + $6.95 S/H. Are you kidding?

Then we read the manual that you have to adjusted the \\"beater to bowl clearance\\". Why wasn't this pre-adjusted by the manufacture. My husband was trying to get the screw off to adjust this but couldn't. Now I am thinking returning this because paint might come off again on the beater or anywhere else on this mixer.

Unfortunately, this mixer hasen't lived up to it's heavy duty name. Even a single batch of cookie dough makes the mixer bounce all over the counter, and bread dough requires you to practically lay on top of it to keep it from bouncing to the floor. Also, the enamel on the beater and the dough hook has started to chip like crazy...can this be safe to eat???This ranks as one of the most disappointing purchases ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put me in the not satisfied category....","review":"This thing is the worst of both worlds. It has all the hassles of an industrial mixer without the power.First of all, the bowl itself goes up and down instead of having a swivel head, so unless you put all the ingredients in at once, it is a pain to add ingredients. I guess removing the bowl is an option, but then you need to remove the mixing blade. Then it starts with a pretty strong kick (even when set on 1), so there is usually flour everywhere. On top of all this it really doesn't have a strong motor. I did less than a double batch of chocolate chip cookies with it, and once all the ingredients were in, it wouldn't go past speed 1. Finally, it comes with very little, and all the add ons are pretty pricey.My advise: either buy a swivel head model, or get one of the professional models with a real strong motor (450+ watts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning how to make pasta","review":"I am now a retiree, and have always enjoyed cooking.

Great twists and turns with enough to keep you wanting more but not so crazy that you feel like you've been tricked.If you live in Washington, or ever have, you will enjoy all of the geographical references. I'm not sure someone who has never lived in the area would get all of the references but that wouldn't hurt their enjoyment of the story - just more fun for those that do understand the link between coal and Newcastle, etc.The fight scene was a little much - too Jean Claude Van Dame for my tastes. It felt like it was written with the movie rights in mind. Maybe men feel differently - I 'll ask my husband when he is finished.

He explores Wesley Crusher and the friends that Crusher would inevitably make and lose while on the ship and gaining perspective into Crusher's life has intrigued most Trek fans. I won't say this one is a \\"must buy,\\" I reserve that for Imzadi, Qinlaw, Qsquared, and Vendetta.

How can you admire Kirby's masterfully detailled paintings when they are only half a page or even one-fourth a page in size?Only buy this one if you desperately need anything sporting the name \\"Josh Kirby\\".

The cameras follow Ellen Minet, rosarian for the rose garden at Long Island's Coe Estate, and her volunteer assistants as they tend the 700+ roses through all four seasons. As they plant, fertilize, water, spray, prune and deadhead the roses, they offer practical advice for the viewer. The garden's collection includes all types of roses (hybrid tea, shrub, old roses, climbers and ramblers) and she explains the different techniques that each rose requires. The photography is exceptional (beautiful tight close-ups) and this is an excellent course for the beginning rose gardener. The dvd also includes a segment on how to sharpen pruners, a photo gallery of interior shots of the Coe mansion, a rose gallery slide show and descriptive text of various rose growing techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Audrey Hepburn","review":"This video is an absolute treasure for anyone who loves Audrey and the amazing life that she lead, and also gardens!

Where \\"Men and Women\\" was somewhat uneven and \\"Life\\" gets a bit dull by the end, \\"A New Flame\\" really seemed to flow as an album without ever losing steam. How could critics ignore the sheer beauty of \\"You've Got It\\" or \\"Again\\"? What's wrong with \\"Turn it Up\\"? The one false note (in my opinion) was \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\"; there was no reason to re-make the original, and Mick Hucknall made no particular improvements to it. But on the strength of \\"You've Got It\\" alone, this album deserved much more respect than it got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Red","review":"This may sound totally pedestrian and vapid on my part, but the remake of \\"If You Don't Know Me By Now\\" is actually better than the original! Please forgive me Blue Notes, but Mick Hucknall and Company manage to update this 70's soul classic with the perfect amount of polish, elegance and soul. The choruses have a yearning, slow burning, gospel feel that makes the love song sound like a spiritual reaffirmation. The rest of this 1989 release shouldn't be neglected either, but \\"If You Don't....\\" is the crown jewel here, a remake that actually works and improves on the original. The guys are terrific!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I never knew such music could ever exist!!!","review":"I purchased this album in 1989. Now in 2007, i'm ordering it again. Why?Because it is perfect.

Her style was really progressive for the late 80's. She does not condescend to teens as if the issue of sex is nonexistent, or pontificate in any way. She is accepting of the differences, racial, familial, and individual, that characterize young adults. I also really like the way the characters never fixate on their appearances. They are self confident while maintaining a sense of reality. That is a great message for kids, and it does not come off at all like a sermon.

I'm through spending a lot for speakers and most other audio/video components; they don't last any longer than less expensive ones, don't offer better sound for our needs, and it feels a whole lot worse when an expensive piece of electronics dies or becomes obsolete. Based on the excellent performance of my Sony SS-B3000 and the SA-W2500 subwoofer,I got these for my stereo and a set of SS-CR3000 center and rear channel speakers to connect to the TV, so I'm all set for surround sound if we ever get a larger LCD TV. The sound from all of these units is crystal clear and perfect for our small home, and the prices are excellent, especially if you watch for sales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I bought these to replace a pair of Presidian speakers. The Presidians just didn't have a rich enough sound. When I received the new song speakers I was worried when I noticed they were quiet a bit smaller than my old speakers, but when I hooked them up to my stereo i was amazed to here the rich deep sound they had. There low range is nothing short of epic I have them hooked up with a Sub but it is unnecessary there low range is perfectly fine for stereo music. There mid range is decent no complaints, and there hi range is wonderful. These speakers are also smaller than most bookshelf speakers which is great for me because I live in a dorm room. I would recommend these to anyone and I have. They have a filling rich deep sound and take up very little area.

I have recently upgraded my system to all Bic America DV speakers. I upgraded one set at a time.These are the last of the Sony SS speakers to be replaced. The reason is these are flat out great speakers.While I gave a not so flattering for the Sony SS-CN5000 center speaker, these really DO shine when coupled with a capable subwoofer (see my other reviews on the Bic V-1220 sub). The only reason I am replacing them is they fell a BIT short when used with our new Bic America DV-CN62CLRS center channel speaker. But only bit...The highs are nice, not brittle, but more \\"natural\\" sounding. Lows are not great, but these speakers are truly bookshelf speakers. Mids sound fantastic.If you are are assembling a budget home theater, then get two sets of these for your fronts and rears, then spend your money on a decent center channel and subwoofer.You can't really go wrong on these speakers!!

They are clearer when run from the sub with the bass removed than when run straight from the receiver, but for $50 and a 5 1/8\\" woofer you can only expect so much.I'm a renter in a small space where I can't blast the sounds, and money is an issue. If I weren't using the sub, I would have tried the Polk Monitor 30's, which are $99 here on Amazon-still cheap for good speakers. Also,if I didn't have the sub, I'd have given these 4 instead of 5 stars, because they're not the best alone. With a sub, they are a real bargain.If money is tight or space is an issue, these are a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent small speakers","review":"These little Sony speakers fit right on my bookshelf and sound great.

They are quite clear and have a fairly flat response. Low end would require a sub-woofer, but that is a given from the speaker size they are.

I'm used to listening to monitors, and compared to monitors they sound muddy to me, depressingly muddy. This could be the fault of my receiver, I don't know. I wasn't as impressed as the rest, but it depends on what you're after and how critical you are I guess. I listen mainly to instrumental and classical. If you're just using for a room I'd strongly reccomend some quality monitors with at least a 5\\" woofer. I prefer things true to the recording I guess. Anyways, that's my take"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect to upgrade HTIB (3 ohm speakers)","review":"I bought these just for the purpose of upgrading my sony HTIB 570 receiver. The front speakers that came with that system were not even 2-way. I was concerned about the impedence rating of these speakers being 8 ohms instead of the 3 ohms on the supplied HTIB speakers. Reading around I was convinced that the 3 ohm speakers cannot cause any damage to my receiver because higher impedence equals lower load. But I was concerned that the output volume is going to be proportionally low from these speakers. BUT it turns out that the sound was only about 20% lower than the 3ohm speakers and this was easlily adjusted in the HTIB systems menu. Now I can use the HTIB system to play music decently. Dont bother upgrading if you just watch movies on htib systems. The supplied speakers are fine for that.Minus 1 star because the main speaker does not seem 5.25\\" wide.

There are good speakers, and there are cheap speakers. These are (decent) cheap speakers. Well made, even color wood and quality grills. I put them on an old Kenwood rig that's driving a pair of vintage Def Tech towers. When I switch to these, the lack of bass is stunning, of course, but I expected that. Out of the box, they sounded terrible, like an AM radio inside a can. I let them play for a few hours, and they improved significantly, but they still sound -very- speaker-ish, crispy highs, 'boxy' mids, and very little actual bass. They are adequate if you have space limitations, don't want better for whatever reason, &/or plan on playing mostly lo-fidelity sources, like talk radio, TV or pirated audio.

It helped of course that I have them hooked up to an equalizer so i could further \\"tweak\\" the sound, but even if I didn't they'd be worth it. They came included with I'd say 10' of wire for each speaker, but I went out and bought 16 guage wire which gave a crisper sound.

Like many, when I cook using a slow cooker, I do so because it's a simple process. A number of the recipes in this cookbook require that you grind your own spices (calling for 6 whole peppercorns, half a cinnamon stick, etc.) - and no measurements are provided for using pre-ground spices. This seems like a very out of place \\"gourmet\\" affectation in a slow cooker cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most delicious recipes EVER!!!!","review":"If you love gourmet cooking made easier and the most tender meat chicken possible buy this book!

I just brown up the meat/chicken in it, throw in some wine, fresh herbs, onion or whatever, cook it down and start the process and throw it on the base to cook.

It's beautiful and has a lot of interesting recipes. I was also excited to use a slow cooker cookbook designed for an avid cooker like myself. The problem is that many of the recipes taste similar or just aren't very good. Some taste terrible and many are poorly executed. It seems like they weren't tested before they were published. I have made the Lumpy Mashed Potatoes, Chicken and Dumplings, Beef and Guinness Stew, Beef Burgundy, Provencal Beef Stew, Chicken Piperade and Italian Pot Roast. The chicken and dumplings is the only recipe I would make again, but I probably won't bother since I have at least two other chicken and dumpling recipes that are vastly superior.

For anyone who loves good food but doesn't have the time to really cook, I suggest you get a crockpot and this book. Many of these recipes require more pre-pot preparation than more traditional crock pot recipes, but it's worth the extra time. My tip is to prepare as much as you can the night before then finish the rest in the morning. Dump it all into the slow cooker and go! My only complaint is that I wish there were more recipes. I like big fat recipe books with lots of variety. The variety was here, just not the quantity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Little Time = A Big Payoff","review":"I never understood the fascination with slow cookers.

I love this book -- although it has too few recipes. You can do the prep work the night before and turn the pot on before you leave the house. The drawback is that some of the recipes require some amount of attention during the day and some of the recipes cook in less than six hours. All in all a great book for those willing to take a little extra time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Cooker Possibilities","review":"I think one of the main benefits of this book is that it makes you think of your slow cooker in a different way. This book is about potential and possibility; it is a good starting point for your imagination. The recipes are well written and the photography is beautiful. There are about 55 recipes.I would have liked more recipes (I don't eat pork or red meat), which is why I gave it four stars. If you are looking for a large volume of contemporary and traditional slow cooker recipes, I recommend Not Your Mother's Slow Cooker Cookbook. It has 350 recipes.

The book is much more readable and digestible if we think of it as a novel in the fairy-tale land of Hippytopia where trains traveling at 225 miles per hour provide no seats or seat belts but cushions on the floor and recycle bins marked Metal, Glass, and Plastic and where passengers relax with a communal joint.

It was crazy to realize that this book was written almost 40 years ago yet some of the technology and ways of living are actually taking place today in 2012. I appreciated the portion of the book that essentially had a fight club in this perfect calm society.

The sections on downloading modules and cgi programming will be a complete non-starter, and thats about half the book.Joe Merlino obviously knows his stuff but the typos are mostly the result of block copying code and then forgetting to make changes - and of course not testing it.So - there are a lot of good books on Perl out there, and a lot of good articles on the web.

Wooden makes no attempt to study his subject. Rather, he regurgitates things read from letters and pamphlets. He describes one stereotype after another and makes very broad generalizations that would get a professional in trouble. In particular, his chapters on Satanism and the Punk movement sound just like a Donahue episode. He never even speaks to a punk. Instead, in his chapter on Punks, he reads letters from parents and others who have been affected in some way by Punk, obviously biasing the research. That is only one chapter I could pick apart. In conclusion, Wooden is very out of touch with the real issues being presented. I am very angry I bought this book and am surprised he was even published.

I was first in line tonight and Dan's face was glowing red as he signed my book: \\"Thanks for being #1.\\" The book is funny, brutally honest and an east sider's analysis of why things are the way they are in Cleveland.

For all his just-as-I-am bravada, Mr. McGraw, in the end, seems destined to drink away his life as a means of running away from himself. I found it fascinating -- and a tad pathetic -- that he writes with such confidence about his so-called life. But like his drinking, it's obviously just a way of ignoring the truth. His \\"drink a beer and do it again\\" life has that swashbuckling feel of life lived boldly. But it's really a selfish life. And I can't help but wonder when he's going to grow up, look in the mirror and ask himself: Is this how I want my daughter to remember me when I'm gone? When she writes her book on me?

The radio is not real fancy, but has enough features to make operating pleasurable. The NB works good at removing electric fence and engine noise too. I am an amateur radio operator and have to say I was really impressed with the receiver sensitivity compared against high end HF radios (note: I don't illegally operate on 11m with ham radios). Yes it is not a SSB radio, but I don't really care a whole lot about 11m SSB anyway. if I want to work DX then I can get on the HF ham bands.

Keane is always making trouble for his team weither it be Manchester or Ireland, he is just a ruthless player who takes the game WAY too far. one time he nearly ended a player's career by directly hitting his knee, not the ball!!! his foot wasn't even near the ball when he hit him. oh, not to mention he is always getting red carded. i just don't under stand how Manchester can deal with such a nasty player. Please don't read this book it isn't worth the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Read","review":"I found this book interesting but not overly so. It covers a period of time I was following Manchester United quite intensely so reading his recollections of that time was quite enjoyable.I did not find the writing style or presentation overly compelling yet it was still a pretty decent read. I'd rate it more of a 3.5 stars because it really didn't keep my interest and that extra interview of his at the end of the book was 10 long pages of reading I could have done with out.I recommend the book to all United fans as a good read. To non-United fans, this may rate 3 stars or less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Direct, like Keano plays!","review":"This book is a candid look inside Roy Keane's thoughts. He freely shares what he thinks about the game, opposing players, teamates, and many other subjects.Keane has been criticized for writing this book because he is blunt in his assesments of people and situations. However, this is the strength of the book, because if Keane had watered it down to be \\"PC,\\" then the reader wouldn't hear what Keane really thinks.Nobody will agree with all of Keane's thoughts, that is a given, but it is interesting to see his development as a player and person. This book provides the football fan with a glimpse into the mind of a superstar, and whether you like Roy Keane or not, it is a very good read that is enjoyable and insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keano","review":"Fascinating look into the life of United legend Roy Keane. The behind the scenes look at the Ireland World Cup walk out was worth the price of this bio alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Enlightening!","review":"I found the book informative but not very insightful. Kalpana's writing is quite engaging and her descriptions are interesting. I liked the content in general, though I would have liked to see her throw some light on what we can learn from the way Dharavi has shaped and grown. It would have been interesting to see some comparitive study with other big slums in India.It is to her credit that she went over Dharavi's history through various angles. The book was a good read. I liked her notes on how people moved, how the industry slowly transformed. In some ways, the growth in Dharavi is an experiment in liberalized growth without any regulations. It can lead to both rapid growth and chaos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game to Play","review":"This is a nice game. I never had a DVD game before so this is our first. My son is 5 and seems to like it. Some of the questions are a little hard for him but I just help him out. Of course he helps me with some to. The board is cute. Has all the characters faces on it. You spin a spinner on the TV and it tells you how many spaces to move. When you move your \\"mystery machine\\" on the board you then program on the TV what character you landed on. That then cues a game that you must play and answer the question correctly. If you get it right you get to \\"Discard a Creep\\". Really neat the way the game was designed.

Compared to the Derale I give these 5 stars. They are both similar in quality and both seem to work well. The difference came with the size of the disc and the end of the plastic rod. Both come with foam pads, (the pads that came with the Derale were firmer then the Hayden, don't think it matters though, both were the same size) but those are dependent on how big the surface area of the disc or rod is contacting it. The Hayden contact area was bigger on both ends, therefore giving more support for the foam which in turn contacts the radiator. While the Hayden does have two flat spots on the rod end as pictured, they are still bigger. Price goes in Hayden's favor, 4.22 vs. 6.25. Like I mentioned I needed more then four of these, so I still ended up using two of the Derales, but will go for the Hayden only next time.Derale 13001 Plastic Rod Mounting Kit"},{"rating":"2","title":"Average kit but...","review":"Just remember that most aftermarket coolers already come with this standard.

This is definitely a book to have if you've ever liked a curry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serviceable and Entertaining","review":"My goal in purchasing this book, which pulls together information about birds, shells, dune plants, and fish was to be able to pack one slim volume instead of the bag of field guides I usually took to the Outer Banks. After two trips to North Carolina in the last year, I have found that I still need to carry a couple of other references because this is not comprehensive in any one of its categories--and how could it be at 148 pages? However, Meyer's guide does manage to cover many of the specimens commonly found along the Carolina coast. Furthermore, it is written in a graceful voice that keeps you reading long after you've put a name to the beastie you found on the beach. It is not childish or simple at all, but it can be used by the entire family. It stirs wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Me an Instant Beach Guide","review":"I bought this and a similar book on Florida beaches to split the difference when I couldn't find a guide to Georgia beaches.

Between the two books I don't think I have been stumped even once when a little kid or his parent has come rushing up to ask about what they just found.The pictures are clear, as are the descriptions and the the book is well organized.

That means no lyrics and no drums. I've read that the orchestral version was a collaboration with Moby and James Newton Howard (who composed the score for \\"The Bourne Legacy\\").

Each feels that they can't do anything right for the generation that follows them. Then slowly they begin to understand each other and each others needs, but with the threat of a stalker hovering over them. They work through old problems and old hurts, but the threat is still there. I enjoyed reading this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone who wanted to spend some time thinking about their own relationship with their mother. Not a book for a quick read. I really thought about when my mother and I were going through this particular stage, when I was reading this book. I can't give the book away, but I was very surprised who the \\"stalker\\" turned out to be. Enjoy this book, it is suspensful, but without all of the gross, really scarry things like in a King novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I would have loved some scary stuff.

Another song that is great is \\"No Puedo Olvidarme de Ti\\" this song is well sang and the hook is perfect. The sounds and mambos in this album are great. Merengue lovers will really love this album because this is what real merengue should be like. Sin Fronteras has rewally established themselves as one of the better merengue groups to come out of D.R. \\"Hay Mujer\\" is a bachata written by Juan Luis Guerra and previously done by the Great Antony Santos, was done by Sin Fronteras in this album and they hit it on the spot. The rest of the tracks are wonderful and this is what merengue should be all about. This is an album that you should defenitely go out and get.

The plot is concise, rich with palpable apprehension. Characters are well defined with credible flaws and strengths, dialogue is smart, believable, with enough irreverence to allow a smile through the tension. This book is well conceived and meets every criteria for a plausible, engaging medical mystery. Reminiscent of Robin Cook or Michael Palmer, David Mucci's style of story-telling stacks up admirably to his predecessors. I was totally memsmerized by this read, not able to stop until conclusion, and,oh, what a cleverly twisted ending it was!!Thrill seekers, David Mucci, is your new best friend.

Clark is a special kind of a book. It is different than most books of its kind in that it goes directly to the heart of the subject, namely, predestination, and uses simple but profound language to convey its intended meaning. This book can change your life. Upon reading it, you will learn that all things, whether great or small, evil or good, have been planned to happen exactly as they have occurred in your life, to the smallest detail. This includes the timing of everything and all the events leading up to it as well. This is not the control of a blind despot, but rather the immutable providence of an Almighty, sovereign God, who works all things after the counsel of His own will. \\" And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.\\" I sincerely hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did.Canella Moore"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"Prior to reading this book, I was a staunch arminian who defended the complete freedom of the will and the sovereignty of man, but upon reading this book, God became the center of my universe, as His Majestic Sovereignty was displayed before my eyes. This book is what assured me of God's infinite love for me and my life has not been the same ever since. I think everyone, whether christian or non-christian should read this book, as it will certainly challenge their view of reality. Clark's use of Scripture is astonishing and his use of philosophy/reason as Scripture's handmaid is equally so.

I never knew about his personal life, and I'm sure not many other people did, and was amazed at what William Hartnell did.

That she succeeds is a tribute to her skills as a writer.If you read this book simply for Hartnell's time playing the Doctor, you will miss out on a fascinating life.

You could take all the entertaining aspects of this film and roll them into a 1 minute movie. That would be worth it, but as is, steer clear. I'd say all in all this movie is a big joke on us the consumer for wasting our time on it. Anybody that tells you it's good is just trying to look like a hipster.EXAMPLE:One scene the shot is zoomed out super far in the middle of the desert.

This film is amateurish from beginning to end. I would not recommend it to anyone and hope that prospective buyers read this so as not to be suckered into wasting money on buying this turkey. If you bother to take the time and check the 5 star reviews, you will quickly see that the only thing most of these reviewers have ever reviewed is this movie.

There are also fun numbers like \\"Give a Little Whistle\\" and \\"My Heart Belongs to Daddy\\".Julie London was her own worst enemy when it came to her musical career; she never felt that her voice was special, nor did she think her overall musicality as good as other jazz singers of the period.

I kept finding something else to do & had to force myself to finish this. The basic plot was good, the rapport not so hot, & the 'action' jumped like an erratic phonograph needle. The mobsters were totally unrealistic. There were just way too many elements thrown together that the story lost its impact.

Both characters grow throughout the book, learning to trust and depend on one another. Jack's daughter Amelia is a wonderful little girl whose rare adult intelligence is amazing.

Philosophers explain that because a culture has a certain WORD - like \\"worldview\\" - it does not follow that it has the corresponding CONCEPT. Intellectual history is good but one must use caution when doing these types of philological (and don't be fooled - this is more philology than philosophy), studies.Also, on an apologetic note - Calvinistic fideism is the rule in this book and it finally collapses into subjectivism (he tries to avoid it in a footnote in chapter one, unsuccessfully). If you have any evidentialist tendendcies, you won't find anything here. When all is said and done all he can say (and does say) is that theists and, say, 'non-theists,' just have different beliefes (shrug shoulders and walk away scratching head); that is what it amounts to.Two stars because it is interesting in some ways, just take with a large degree of healthy skepticism if you are an objectivist."},{"rating":"2","title":"fx 60 crush my system","review":"crushed my system.I upgraded from Fx 52 which was working fine, soon as changed chip, system kept on getting Blue Screen errors, not sure if chip was defective, was out of the country for 3 weeks that's why did not have the chance to possibly return item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Record - I wish to correct the Amazon.com review though","review":"The Amazon.com review of the record notes that Phil mentions the target of his lyrical ire by name -- Jill.

Either the wrong master was used to press the cd or something. I find it hard to believe that the mastering engineer would turn over a product like that.

I am not a fan of today's mastering techniques with heavy compression, limiting and pumping things as loud as it can go, bordering clipping - but this is an extreme in the other direction.

Still possessing a lot of the punk attitude on previous releases only this time given a little more spit and polish by big time producer Tom Werman. Certainly some of the attitude has been replaced with a more cartoon aspect. The songs are basically sing a long party anthems....You would have had to be an ostrich with your head in the sand if you don't remember the hits 'We're Not Gonna Take It' and 'I Wanna Rock' both of which got played to death by MTV and the like. Both had suitably comic videos based around high school life and teenage rebellion. Anyway this set of songs are familiar as an old friend each time I give them a play.

The best song is without doubt the title track \\"Stay hungry\\".

Apparently, the problem lies with Rhino Records. Since I don't see the information posted here on Amazon yet, I figured I would pass it on. Rhino has agreed to replace the disc. [...] I think it is good that the record company is admitting an error, and that they are willing to provide a resolution. I think they should have caught the mistake themselves, but at least they are making an attempt to rectify the situation. As for disc 2, the demos are cool to hear. Very raw and embryonic. The new song, 30, is cool too. Not bad at all for a bunch of SMF's careening toward their 60's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic! (but just don't mind the cover art!)","review":"Altough it possess one of the worst covers ever for a metal album, there is no denial that STAY HUNGRY is a gem of hard rock / metal.The trick here is that Twisted Sister, even with the long hair and Snider's eyelid and makeup, was not a typical hair metal band. THeir lyrics were better, the attitude somewhat different, the musicianship also better and harder. Of course they profited over the whole MTV videos vibe of the time, but that was a natural course to follow, unfortunately.STAY HUNGRY is one hell of a strong album. The nine songs are good, there is no throaway. It's not a masterpiece by any standard, but it's simply very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"you're not going to starve listening to this one","review":"what metal/hard rock collection is complete without this classic in it? twisted sister was a fun-loving metal band of the 1980's along with quiet riot. they both knew how to take their metal seriously while still managing to have fun. if you don't have this in your collection, there's something wrong with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"Although in the last several years I have moved away from heavy metal, I can say that without a doubt this is the best heavy metal album there is.

So, I resorted in desperation to cd's on the rack next to the cash register in truck stops. Stay Hungry was in the bargain bin for $4.99, so I figured, 'What the heck. I loved WNGTI when I was a kid, I'll check out the whole album.' As is the case with most albums, the absolute best songs are the ones that didn't get airplay. When most people think of TS, they think of the anthemic, but sophomoric 'I Wanna Rock' and 'WNGTI'. 'Don't Let Me Down' is an extraordinary song and well worth the price of the album. The guitarists are by no means shredders, but play with depth and feeling. Snider displays a range that puts him on par with the best vocalists. I listened to this disk over and over across Utah and Wyoming (well, I skipped the most oft-played tracks.) and never tired of it. Don't measure Twisted Sister only by their two most popular songs. Their best work is their b-side stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one.....","review":"Well, I thought this was going to be awesome. I thought that it was going to be remastered as it states but if it is it is worse than when it was originally released in quality sound. Now I thought this was going to be a great CD especially with the extra tracks being added on another disc. However, it is not at all what it was promoted to be. I am a fan of Twisted Sister but this disc is not worth having unless and I mean UNLESS you are an avid collector of their music. I mean it is what it is. It was nice to take a trip down memory lane but if you want some good advice buy the Still Hungry cd instead even though it does not have the original sound to the songs. The only thing on this cd that is any good is the new song 30. I mean the demos are not even full songs. most of the songs clock in at 1:44 on the second disc.

I found my self looking for GT3 just so I could get that bad racing taste out of my mouth. I really glad that I only rented it because if I had wasted 50 bucks I'd be really angry. The game isn't all that fun for starters and the graphics don't even come close to the PS2 standards. The crashing in this game is really stupid. And I thought that that was supposed to be the best part. Instead it holds you back for like 10 seconds while all other racers fly away. Another stupid thing about the game are the buses and tractor trailers. On a sharp turn you can actually get blocked off from the race by one of these and there's nother like losing because you hit an 18 wheeler. Also there are only about 5 cars to choose from, and that stinks. So, I gave it one star because really I'd rather play something else than this Midnight Club wanna be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop whining - Cool game!","review":"This is a fast-paced arcade style game (anyone remember Cruisin'???). Sure, if you want ultra realistic car tuning, go elsewhere, but if you're looking for all-out racing through populated streets this is it. To all the reviewers crying about the crash sequences disrupting the flow and taking too much time off the clock, try this -- STOP CRASHING. Sure you lose 5 seconds for crashing, what do you expect? It would sure take more time than that to fix your car, and if crashing didn't waste any time off your clock what would encourage you to drive better? Overall a good game, definitely a great rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"every game comes so close but one thing messes it up","review":"i liked most every thing about this game. cars are cool tracks are rad. but every time you crash you loose controle of the car.the car stops and it shows you the wreck from 3 different camra angles. it is cool the first time but it takes about 10 sec for every crash. in other good games like gta3 half the fun of the wrecks is driving out of them on two wheels or rolling the car and still trying to power out of it. if this game let you keep driving when you get in a crash i would go buy it tomarow. but it is to frustrating to play. so i will take it back before my five days is up. it just makes me mad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im Tired of Company reps writing their own \\"reviews\\"","review":"There's no way this game can be considered as good as many of these reviews.

Once your burnout meter is full you can go to supersonic speed whitch doesnt look or feel any different than when you were going normal speed. The near misses get to be very boring after a while. And there are not enough cars or tracks available. The racing to get to the next ckeckpoint is a little to arcade-like. The good thing about this game is that the steering and control are very tight.

Having got 96 point something percent through GT3 and completed all the main missions in GTA3 I bought Burnout on a recommendation from a friend. I'm happy to say that I was not disappointed, true it's a little short (by no means as bad a MGS2) but I feel it has high replay value. Even now I turn the stereo on (Burnout's music is about the lowest point) and sit down to do a couple of races when I have some spare time. The game is all about gameplay and who cares if the graphics aren't upto scratch compared to GT3, you're flying through city streets dodging traffic like a cat on speed. One reviewer mentioned that the manual is lying about being able to drive a truck, it's not; sometime after completing the 3rd or 4th championship the oppurtunity occurs.

It notes the major sights and even suggests restaurants & bars, tips, sightseeing, and walks. However the map is not complete in any way. It doesn't give a complete map of the Montmartre or the metro and basically is only a map of the major sights along the Seine. It's compact, which is very handy and was what I was looking for. But if you want a more complete map that even shows some of Saint-Denis, some of the Bois de Boulogne, and is just slightly larger but just as portable; go with the Michelin Paris Poche #50.

Comes in a nice plastic tray with snap-shut retainers, could potentially serve as a permanent home for the sockets. 12 point, and just deep enough to keep you from grabbing the deep well set every time. I was able to do all the work on my 2006 WRX without a deep well socket with these moderate-depth sockets.Great addition to a kit, and very strong so far. I even used them in an impact gun to get out some nasty frame bolts, 20mm and rusty from 140k miles and 7 years on the road. One 14mm was extremely stuck and this socket rounded out the bolt head without any damage to the tool. need heat and an easy-out for that one bolt. No big deal.Nice finish, nice case, but the etched numbers are harder to read than some sockets. keep them in order in the tray for faster location of the one you require."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Brand.

I followed the directions to the letter. I kept it up for as long as I could stand it. Maybe it helps some, but did nothing for me. This tapping business consists of you tapping on various spots on your head and face, mostly. I felt ridiculous and it did not help me.

It's about Energy Psychology. It was an easy and exciting read. What impressed me the most is that the technique really works, and it works FAST! So far I have eliminated a long standing fear of heights and there were several painful events in my past that now no longer bother me since I used energy tapping to eliminate the painful emotions. I can still remember the events, but they just don't bother me. Amazing! I wholeheartedly recommend this book to EVERYONE. It will save you time, money, and emotional pain. I hear that the technique can also be used to treat depression, anxiety attacks, and even physical pain like headaches.

The film in general was poorly done. The acting is amateur and the writing was just plain boring! It sounded really good when I was shopping on line, but it did not measure up at all to our expectations. We are giving it next year as a joke to my brother-in-law.

Not only do I find the author's tone very arrogant at times but because the book is supposed to be an introduction for new jazz lovers the highly personal tone and comments the author makes about certain jazz styles and musicians is very innapropriate. How can someone who turns to this book for help in understanding jazz, sort through the biases the author has towards certain artists if this is their first jazz reading? I'm also sorry to say that the book also appears to have not gone through a proof-reading...there are several (10+) spelling mistakes in the first chapter alone. I suggest you browse through it at your library rather than buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but spotty.","review":"Another in the seemingly endless series of \\"...for Beginners\\" books that began with a few Marxist tomes but later expanded into other areas. There are some useful bits and pieces here, but overall it's a rather narrow selection that spends too much time on the politics and history and not nearly enough on the music. Mingus is given a number of pages, and rightly so, given his stature as a composer and bassist- but there's not much about his music or why it's worth listening to. But where's Scott LaFaro? He was possibly even more influential than Mingus in redefining moden jazz bass playing, but there's nary a mention of him. There are too many omissions of this sort.

First, in the topically important subject of Father Flynn's conduct within his parish the audience should be presented with balanced arguments from both he and Sister Aloysius. Instead, we have a dominant/unbalanced presentation of the Sister's accusations over a weaker Father Flynn defense. That would be fine if the movie was entitled \\"Gossip\\". A more objective, albeit challenging movie would present the unfolding events as if to an omniscient audience and let us impartially decide guilt & innocence. In addition, the overindulgent & exaggerated acting only made it the more difficult to gleam the truth as to misconduct.(2.) Second, the movie perpetuates the stereotype of misconduct within religious orders as being near rampant (shared blame with the media) even though the actual percentage of misconduct may be 0.01% and not statistically different than many other professions or categories of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately unsatisfying","review":"I admit I'm not a sophisticated movie critic.

I don't mind books or movies that allow me to use some thought to fill in the blanks and decide for myself what happened, but this movie made me work way too hard. It left almost everything unanswered. At the end, I wanted some resolution, something that wrapped up the plot and gave meaning to what happened before, but instead it left it all up to the viewer to decide.

Hoffman and M. Streep deserves a look. Next time I will be a bit more circumspect. This movie features superior acting and wonderful period authenticity. What it lacks, though, is an interesting story. Basically it's about a tormented nun/head mistresses whose creepy mind creates a totally baseless allegation against her immediate superior (Hoffman). Ultimately her warped sense of \\"certainty\\" is riddled with doubt. This is the first time I have seen a movie whose entire story was captured in the title! I found this flick to be trite but oddly viewable due to the great stars who tried valiantly to keep this non-event alive and moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great film you only need to see once","review":"\\"Doubt\\" is one of thoes films you only need to see once.I have to give it 5 stars for the great acting,but its alittle borning,but you keep watching to find the truth,but you never do.I did laugh alot at Meryl Steep.She is always great,but she hit this charater perfect.We had mean nuns just like this one in school.A week before I saw \\"Doubt\\" our priest gave the same sermon Philip Seymour Hoffman gave about the pillow feathers.I thought this movie wouldn't be a film the Catholic Church would approve,but after watching It,I can understand why they want everyone to see the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Head Fake","review":"A return to respectability for Meryl Streep. (I didn't care for her musical) This is a slow, character driven piece that I was totally head faked into believing that Streep was the unreasonable one. I agree with one reviewer that there are no real good characters here--except perhaps for the little boy. But then again, we see nothing through his eyes. I like Amy Adams but she felt more like wallpaper in this piece. To me, Hoffman didn't bring his A game--but Meryl is the master of the game. It's a good solid movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocking","review":"And embarrassing. The final scene is worth the whole movie. Each actor is wonderful, even the smaller parts. Made me nervous.

Im glad I didnt see it at the movies but got it out on DVD making it easy to do the dishes while the thin narrative plodded along.What was the point of this movie? To make the audience sympathise with the good intentions of the priest (PSH) who took a caring role of an underprivileged young black teenager and to turn against his accuser? And therefore the logical extension of this is that a lot of the allegations of sexual abuse within the Catholic church are factitious or exaggerated claims? That is, to instil doubt in US about institutional sexual abuse? If so then the movie is a disgrace.Even if this is not the message I doubt that there are any other redeeming features to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting, yet Poignant","review":"I walked in to see Doubt expecting a thriller/drama in line with the star-studded cast. They did not disappoint. Streep's performance is excellent, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman brings a haunting cast to the priest accused of child molestation and inappropriate behavior. Amy Adams, on the sideline, plays the role of innocence-lost while Hoffman and Streep struggle for power in the community, with Streep denouncing Hoffman, attempting to remove him from the pulpit in order to protect her students as the sister in charge of the Catholic school. Definitely watch this film, but be prepared for an emotional roller coaster. This does an excellent job, among other things, at interjecting the self-doubt that is present in even the strongest of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!!","review":"This movie is a wonderful adaptation of a really great, award winning play.

As they've noted, this movie only pretends to wrestle with uncertainty and doubt of a profound form. Anyone who entertains no doubts with regard to the big questions has fallen under the spell of an ideology; if you need this movie to be awakened to doubt, you've probably been in the grip of such a spell.The main doubt portrayed by the movie is actually a superficial one resulting from witholding information which would provide closure and meaning to the rather simple plot. The truncated ending (or rather lack of a real ending) is such a fatal flaw that any redeeming qualities this movie has (and there are many) are totally undermined, to the extent that my rating is pushed all the way down to the extreme of 1 star, which is a rarity for me (I tend to be generous with movie ratings).I have no doubt that the 100+ minutes I spent watching this movie were wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitchy Nun","review":"While I thought the movie was very good with a good story line M.

Is the priest guilty of child molestation? Is Meryl Streep's character justified in pursuing without proof? Should there be any grace if neither the boy nor his mother have objections, or if perhaps it was a bond but not a sexual one? What was the proper action for the priest? What was the proper action for each of the nuns? Nominated for five Academy Awards with good reason. Excellent script, excellent acting, excellent production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life is full of gray areas","review":"Meryl Streep portrays an inflexible nun, dedicated to the job of keeping things the way they've always been, and staying fully in charge of the school and convent which she leads. Philip Seymour Hoffman is a priest with great compassion for his parishioners, and especially for a young altar boy whose father beats him on a regular basis. Streep's character chooses this very compassion to challenge the priest and, using an incident reported by another nun, she works to discredit him and banish him from the parish. Streep and Hoffman are wonderful actors and without their performances this would have been a much less powerful movie. My husband and I had diametrically opposed views of what the truth was in the gray areas of the film, which says to me that it was a wonderful springboard for discussion. I did feel that it was a little slow at times and that there should have been more proof for Streep's character to act as she did."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Bonus Tracks?","review":"I own the original release of this CD and I am wondering where the bonus material is? The albums itself is quite good and often forgotten gem in Paul Rodgers long and legendary career. Cut Loose, Fragile and Northwinds stand out for me. You'll also find Live in Peace which was later recorded by the Firm and Superstar Woman a solo version of the Bad Company song released on the Original Bad Company two disc compilation.The album is really solid from beginning to end but my original version doesn't have the best production so this deluxe edition should be an improvement. If only there were some bonus tracks then it would be worth repurchasing it for me. If you don't already own this and you're a Bad Company or Paul Rodgers fan then I recommend you go ahead and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vocals","review":"Paul Rodgers posesses one of the all-time greatest voices in rock music.

TINA ARENA is still the best!","review":"The Roc Project's follow up to the international smash \\"Never (Past Tense)\\" is definitely not a worthy one. I have heard the track and the song is just your typical chill out-house. Nothing special. This features a singer also named Tina but not as beautiful and as sexy as the previous featured singer on \\"Never (Past Tense)\\", Tina Arena. Tina Novak has dreadful vocals, it's dull and weak.

Nothing special. Compared to the international smash \\"Never (Past Tense)\\" which featured the very gorgeous Tina Arena, \\"Deja Vu: It's Hard To Believe\\" doesn't have the charisma that \\"Never (Past Tense)\\" has. It lacks the depth and the emotion that left the voice of Tina Novak quite dull and dead. We know Tina Arena cannot commit to the whole album as Ray Roc has said because he also wanted Tina Arena to do the whole project collaboration with him. And so Tina Novak entered the scene, I'm sorry but Tina Arena is much famous, obviously sexier as she is voluptuous, and prettier and not to mention the voice quality is unmatched, talk about Tina Arena's range.

If I were to compare this Ashurajo No Hitomi CD to any of her previous work I would say that it is like a more classical yet dark spinoff of the Wolf's Rain material. I have not seen Ashurajo No Hitomi but the music is excellent. Kanno spices her music with some latin, jazz, lotsa classical, and many others for this CD. For the most part it is very solemn and a tad experimental but very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A viewers review","review":"My first exposure to Yoko Kanno was thru the Ghost in the Shell series. When I viewed the movie Ashurajo No Hitomi, I had no idea it was her work.The movie is a story of a classical Kabuki actor who falls in love with a demoness and is willing to forgoe his humanity for her love. His disciplined and heartfelt response to the challenges and attacks from the demon world, using his skills as a Kabuki actor, sustain him to the end. No spoilers here.The music blended seamlessly with the movie. I had no idea this was the composer for any anime series, much less Ghost in the Shell.

After all the seal of God is Truth.There is also the question of whether one does not undermine faith by presenting a picture of Perfection which is not realistic and true.Wagschall does not really tackle the questions of the tremendous evils and injustices which are so great a part of Jewish and human history.I wonder if there is not a wiser way a more courageous way in Trust of God, perhaps more related to Job's \\"Though he slay me yet I will trust in Him\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but is it really worth the price?","review":"This brooch is cute online but when you receive it, that's a different story.Since there are so many items hanging from the bottom, the whole pin goes down too.

And they were supposed to have killed themselves out of anger from not being able to lead the sailors on the Argo to their deaths!Well, let's forget all that for a moment. This was a really nice book - I have long been searching for a book that talks about Sirens/mermaids and here's something like what I have been wanting to read about them all this time! The book began on a sad note with the tragedy of Cecilia! (sniff) And I'd thought that Sirena would keep herself hidden from Philoctetes a lot longer than she did. . . .

The only way to lift the curse is to convince a man to mate with them. Then, she will become immortal. Sirena decides to separate from the other Sirens and finds a castaway alone on an island. They are initially afraid of each other, but begin to fall in love. Will Sirena want to be immortal after falling in love with a human man? I found the story dragging a lot, and perhaps because the story of the Sirens isn't as well known as some of Napoli's other retellings, it seemed a bit boring to me as well. I think she has written better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious, Melodramatic Romance","review":"Although \\"Sirena\\" by Donna Jo Napoli is classified as a fantasy, I feel it is much better suited to the romantic genre. There are quite a few problems in this book. For one, Sirena isn't very likeable as a heroine. She spends most of the book dwelling on the fact that her true love is going to die and she's not. Considering how romantic the book is, Sirena doesn't really seem to be trusting or tolerant with Philoctetes. She often complains how he lives on land, wants to return to his home, and collects things.Another major issue is that, considering Napoli's other works, one would expect this to be a retelling of a fairy tale. Not so. \\"Sirena\\" is no fairy tale; it is a romance that happens to involve mythology. Overall, I would reccomend \\"Sirena\\" to fans of Lurlene McDaniel, and for fans of retold fairy tales, the works of Robin McKinley, Cameron Dokey and Tracy Lynn."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting something better...","review":"Well, I love stories about mermaids and I really wanted this book. But I was in for a big disappointment.Sirena is a mermaid longing for immortality. She can only gain this if a mortal man loves her. After a misfortune on the rocks of Anthomesa, she swims to the island of Lemnos. She then meets a man who has a snake bite. (The snakes were sent by Hera, lady of olumpus.) She cleans the wound, and the two devolpe a love.I know it sounds interisting, but really, this is not a captivating story. The ending is too ambigous, and she could have extended the story to make it something better, (and tragic.)I could'nt get past chapter two of the story. It was that boring. I only know what happened because I read the ending and other select bits and piecies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Sing Any More Sirena","review":"Very disappointing. It is very sexual even though it is touted as a YA book. I remember reading this at 13 and my friends and I were quite shocked.It has a decent grasp of history + culture but the execution is off. It had such promise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Read","review":"I got this book from my school library. At first it took me a while to get into it, but it was wonderful nonetheless. Then as I got more into it, I brought it home and couldn't stop reading it! I fininshed reading the book today, and it is definetely, without a doubt, one of the best reads I've ever read, and that there probably is out there! It is probably my favorite book. It's full of mystic, myths, and love. And I absolutely love the ocean, so I loved how the main setting was there. I also found Sirena, the mermaid, a great role model that many can relate to. I highly reccommend this book to everyone. I am definetely going to get my own copy! It is absolutely astounding...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A++++++++!","review":"I have read Ms. Napoli's books before and I happen to just fallin love with them! She has taken fairy tales (and myths in this case)and re-written them in a way that makes you think. I love the way she wrote this book; she wrote it so that you saw in the siren's point of view. If you have ever heard the myth, then you tend to think that they sing purposely to destroy people; but in this book she shows that Sirena doesn't want to sing, she just wants to be loved. This is a great book and deserves to be read more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Napolis best","review":"This is without a doubt my favorite of Donna Jo Napoli's books.

I remembered it from middle school and still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most refreshing comic series in years!!!","review":"I found this book at my library. I thought it was Batman on the cover at first, but a closer inspection revealed it to be a cat. I checked it out that very day, and spent all night reading it again...and again...and again.All I can say is \\"WOW!\\" Mr. Canales's story is so engrossing, and Mr. Guarinido's pictures are wonderfully done. I feel a personal connection to Blacksad and his search for Natalia Wilford's killer, but mostly to Blacksad himself. When I showed it to my aunt, she said he looked like Stacy Keach. Thing is, I don't know who that is.That aside, this is a wonderful book, and I heartily recommend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mediocre writing but amazing and nuanced art","review":"This is the first time I've across Guarnido's art and I'm very impressed. His characters have such mobility of expression, such humanity of every variety, such plain veracity, . . . you forget they're actually animals. The storyline, unfortunately, isn't really anything out of the ordinary. John Blacksad is a black cat private eye (emphasis on \\"black\\") hired by a school teacher from the wrong side of town to locate a missing student. This gets him caught up in local race politics and in family secrets, centering on Chief of Police Karup, a very large, very dangerous, very white polar bear with an embarrassing past, and he likes things run his way. Much good it does him, though. Think small-town Alabama in the 1950s. Now I'll have to try to find Book 1 of Blacksad's saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best graphic novel I've ever seen","review":"A black cat detective? Don't think it is just a cartoon for kid. The auther uses anthro characters to symbolize and emphasize personality. The leader character John Blacksad is a black cat, and he really makes reader feel alone and cool, just like a black cat. The main characters of #2, Miss Grey, Dinah, and Jezabel, are deers, and they really let reader think them small, weak, but strong.Totally beautiful images , totally moveable stories, and totally feeling words compose the greatest graphic novels.

I will keep this as a reference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick.","review":"This book is poorly constructed (physical binding) and is made of cheap paper. The illustrations are not very good, and often do not even depict the story accurately. Two examples are when 1) the story says a mermaid has legs, yet the illustration is of a mermaid with the usual fin and 2) the story says a character has tattoos on his face, yet the illustration does not depict them. The characters in the illustrations also look like stock white faces, regardless of the origin of the story.For a much better book, both in binding and illustration, I would recommend Mermaid Tales from Around the World by Mary Pope Osborne. The pictures are large and colorful in that book, emulating the style of the area of the world from which the story comes.Don't waste your money on Serenade of Mermaids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product to have","review":"I had it for about two days before I noticed the window mount is broken and had to return it but within that two days I must say it was a very good purchase and very handy.I was not able to see a very clear movie on it but I didn't have it for long to play with it.The GPS part itself worth the total price of the device.

The book was light reading and would be something to read on vacation but though provoking it wasn't. I found the premise of the story not very believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother opening this book.","review":"This was, by far, the silliest and most unlikable book I have ever read. I'd never read Johansen before, and I must say, this book book did not encourage me to try.

The concepts are not new, the \\"Vision\\" is poorly presented, and lack of a usable index make this work useless as a stand alone reference for someone interested in Six Sigma.

The books were absolutely useless. Consisting mostly of pictures originated 10 years ago at Motorola, they provided little insight and in most cases were of no value at all because without sufficient text, the intent of the pictures is unclear. I'm sure Mr. Harry can use the pictures for his own presentations, but I've never known anyone else to be able to use them.

Charlie is challenged by his hosts to learn all about their culture; through his eyes, the reader also discovers the brave new world (to borrow a phrase) of the Ledom.Sturgeon covers Ledom technology, religion, history, anatomy, and education. He includes an ironic parallel narrative about an ordinary 20th century human family; this second narrative frequently comments on our own culture's obsession with gender.\\"Venus\\" is a compelling story of love, loss, and knowledge. It is part of an intriguing science fiction tradition of deconstructing societal ideas on sexuality and gender; for companion texts in this vein, try Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"The Left Hand of Darkness\\" and Carolyn Ives Gilman's \\"Halfway Human.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of Sturgeon's Best!","review":"I first read this amazing book 49 years ago and decided to revisit it now. WOW - from a more mature perspective it really blew me away this time! While some aspects (as slowly revealed throughout the story) may seem revolting, Sturgeon is using that to make a point. He actually acknowledges his debt to Philip Wylie's \\"The Disappearance\\", both by having a character mention it and including a reference to it in his Afterword. Humanity has focused too much on the differences between men and women instead of the vastly more numerous similarities and commonalities.The world of the Ledom created by Theodore Sturgeon is breathtaking, and his description is once again a glorious thing to behold. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agenda Driven","review":"I felt ambushed by T. Sturgeon after I finished this book. It starts out as a fun, interesting time-travel adventure, but as the novel goes on, you get the uncomfortable sensation that Sturgeon has a sexual/gender agenda, and he certainly does. I liked a lot of the inventiveness of the little bubble-world, but stepping back from the book afterwords, it really is a perverse little bubble world. After finishing the book I went back and read his introduction, and Sturgeon strikes me as a bit of a nasty man. And what was the deal with the ending? Was that actually a nuclear war that was dropped like an A-bomb on the final page for no reason other than send the reader off with a bad feeling??I'll give it two stars for colorful scenes and events but I felt Sturgeon purposely laid a downer on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good WHEN IT IS NOT BROKEN","review":"I was so excited to get this steamer and it did everything as advertised - magically cleaned so much so well and without any chemicals. BUT, the machine is absolutely the MOST UNRELIABLE, expensive appliance I have ever owned. Within the first few months, the entire boiler went bad and had to be replaced. Then the connection hose was leaking, and had to be replaced. Then the entire body of the device developed a crack and had to be replaced, and low and behold, a year later, the boiler went bad again. And all this after using this maybe twice a week here and there. They have good customer service in terms of fixing things, but really, should anything break this many times??? And then there is the hassle of shipping the thing to be fixed again and again and again.. I love what this machine can do, but for the price, it is truly a complete piece of garbage in terms of reliability. I would never recommend this machine to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong film, wrong time, wrong rating: WRONG!","review":"The cover shown here is correct, but the description is not. None of the actors listed are in the film, the running time (on the delivered box) is 90, not 75-mins as listed (the actual uncut version is 99-mins according to imdb, anyway) and finally, this film, as delivered, has no rating anywhere on it - certainly not \\"X,\\" as listed.

Patience and correctly-sized beads will yield some gorgeous results.First, you are tempted with a colorful photo gallery of projects. Then you'll say, \\"I really want to try these projects!\\" When you page back to the instructions and diagrams, you've got to enter with some boldness and existing skill.This should not discourage you from attempting some of the easier projects. Barrettes made with gathered ribbon and beads might be an easier project for starters, as is a simple but effective choker tied with ribbon or leather.One of the prettiest projects combines a bracelet and ring, so that a beaded butterfly sits on the back of the wearer's hand.

I was so impressed with the first one which I use in our great room area, that I bought a second to use in the theater room. It's wonderful to press one function button and have all the components that you need be prepared for whatever it is that you are wanting to do. A \\"TV\\" button turns on the set, the receiver, the cable box, and even selects the proper input for that action. The same goes for \\"Watch movie, Listen to CD, etc. The programming is a little time consuming, but easy, as it is all done on your computer. You simply take note of all your components, their model numbers, and how you want them to coordinate and fill in the blanks on Logitech's website. It then programs the remote via USB cable and you are ready to go.This is so much faster and easier than playing hide and seek with several remotes.

This button surface is a thin circular ring around the \\"OK\\" button. You tilt this ring in the direction you want to switch; up, down, left and right. Members of my household were frustrated that the button movement is so sensitive one would often accidently end up pressing a direction you did not want. If you have any trouble with fine hand movement as one relative of ours does, do not get this remote.I returned this to Amazon within the return period but have yet to receive a refund.I have since learned that the equivalent button on the Harmony 550 is shaped more like a disc than a ring which enables successful button presses. If the directional button on the 676 is a problem for you, get a 550.I highly recommend that you try out these remotes in person before ordering since a return of this item to Amazon has been problematic for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does everything I wanted to do!","review":"I've been a long time JP1 remote users which is very capable.

It's not very intuitive and can be frustrating sometime.Another thing that I dont like about this remote is the directional arrows. It's a metal ring that's really hard to press and get it right.

I've been through three in that time, for a total of $370, this model 676 being the last.When they work, they are wonderful. But each of mine only worked for a few months, then, I guess the buttons wear out. I am the only one who uses it so it's not as if it's gotten extraordinary use. Logitech's tech support is very poor, even though I made it to \\"Level 2\\", they still put me through the same troubleshooting paces I had done myself, over and over again without success, and even though it's still under warranty, they refuse to replace it!

More frustrating thing is after such manipulation, it becomes more confused and I have to go back to my old 3 remote control to start out of scratch... sigh...

He was so excited to recieve it and when he did the set up he said it was a breeze compared to the old universal remote we have. It really only took him about a half hour.

I found myself \\"teaching\\" the Harmony new commands which were not on the pre-programmed (web site) list.

It was the 2nd order I placed for Thomas Moran's Watercolors within a month, and the other book was also principally black-and white, with a few very bad color images. I don't want either one.

It is way too long, and basically a rehash of Tom Clancy's Debt of Honor. If you want to read a book about how economics causes conflict, read Larry Bond's Cauldron. Ever wonder why Hagberg's(or Flannery's) books have never made the bestseller lists? Now you know. When you compare his books to authors like Tom Clancy or Larry Bond, the novels of Hagberg are no-brainers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hagberg gives us more good reading - a lot of it!","review":"Our former CIA agent, Kirk McGarvey, returns in this modern epic of countries setting up to turn the tide on who is in charge. Through a complicated story line, in which a Japanese radical team sets up events to reassert its power and the Russians are involved, we see McGarvey hired in the private sector. The book is another in the McGarvey series and while the tale is interesting, at 830+ pages, it is too long by a lot and the story kind of meanders at times. Included are some side stories and events that seem to just be there. But Hagberg has a way of writing that is entertaining and keeps you slogging through. One minor complaint is that our hero, McGarvey, is not as prevalent in this plot and in the book's pages as he is in other books to date in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hagberg scores again.","review":"From the first Hagberg book I ever read, I have been a fan.Every book he writes grabs your attention from cover to cover.Not being an expert on all things Military or Intelligence, I don't worry about so called errors that may appear in books of this genre, after all it is a novel, and Hagberg, can get really close to the truth in his writings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Live in Hollywood Highlights from the Aquarius Theater Performances","review":"I think that this is an excellent concert CD by the Doors,a fan of any age would like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first and only notebook.

If you've seen Zombi, then you'll love this flick for sure. This one takes a different direction from Zombi, and it's more of a surreal nightmare than a traditional zombie film. I will admit that the zombies don't show up until the final 20 minutes of the film, but make no mistake, the entire 95 minutes of this film are full of fun OMG moments.

Bob plays Don Bolton, a pampered, smartaleck-y movie star who latches onto marrying Lamour as a way to to avoid the draft (\\"I'm not a coward,\\" he says, \\"I'm just allergic to bullets.\\") The trouble is his would-be wife is also the daughter of a bristly old-school Army Colonel, and she shares daddy's distaste for shirkers. Their love-hate relationship slowly tilts towards love, and eventually he proves himself worthy of her hand. The sketch-oriented script has episodic laughs, but is pretty predictable and sluggish: it might have been funnier at a time when universal conscription was becoming a reality, and civilian America was ramping up to meet a total war economy. In that regard, it's an interesting cultural relic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big bubbly analogue electro","review":"Hailing from Toronto Canada, this is Lowfish's second full length release on Suction records.This album is large. The sound is very full and rich, and laden with big analogue pads and 808 bass. The sound is sort of similar to Boards Of Canada's \\"Music has the Right to Children\\" except that it tends to lean more towards an electro sound. This album is certainly different sounding though, and doesn't really follow any of the concrete formulas used in most electronic music, which is good, seeing as how there is an abundancy of cookie-cutter \\"musicians\\" in beat oriented, danceable electronic music these days.The majority of the tracks on this album are quite happy and quirky, with the exception of \\"flatBlex\\" which has a darker, more gloomy sound.

I used to recommend this book but can no longer do so. Call me old fashioned but it's because I've got this thing about the character of authors, the same reason I can no longer recommend William J.

That said, I also found his writing style difficult to follow- too much rambling- and the logic did not seem tight to me. I highly recommend two excellent alternatives: So- Why Do You Homeschool? by Mimi Davis, and Upgrade by Kevin Swanson. I found the arguments and logic in favor of homeschooling much more persuasive in both of these well-written books. Both of these authors are Christians, and their writing style is more gracious to those still considering the option of homeschooling, than what I found in Sproul's approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for it to grab me - it didn't","review":"While I agree with many of his reasons for homeschooling, the authors writing style was confusing, rambling, and sometimes sounded abrasive.

Fortunately, I have purchased two more books. I will keep this book for a very few reasons, that I feel I have to state them: the stationery gave me ideas for other invitations, the twig ball on page 91 gave me an idea of how to use pot pourrie, the twig arbor on page 123 is fantastic for Christmas and the directions of how to make a wreath at the \\"Staging a reception\\" section.

Fee's discussions of Spirituality, glossolalia, worship and life in the Spirit are technically investigated in the synthesis section (pages 799 to 903) of the earlier volume.

My neice will never get any of these worthless dolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Cool","review":"When I first saw this doll I was shocked at how ugly it was. But as time went by and I looked at it some more I began to see how beautiful it was. I like the gray streaks and her clothes but I dislike the way her hair bends. It shows way to muck of her forehead. I would really like to have this doll, but it is a bit exspencive.The theme is cool because it shows girls can be rockers too, and that a punk look is awsome. To everyone who thinks this doll is ugly, please look at it more and I guareente that you will see its beauty.Also though I like Bratz better than My Scene they are both cool. They are just dolls, so STOP FIGHTING over wigh is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shes rocking hot and rocking my world...","review":"The firts rock anglez doll i got was cloe, so when i went 2 buy my 2nd i picked up jade. What iut was that made me pick her over yasmin was her striking hair. Silver and black its amazing. Jade is the only rock angel with the open mouth mould on her face, and she is super cute.When i got home and took her out of her box i was amazed she had ankle boots on unlike the other rock angelz thers are all knee high. So it didnt go very well with the skirt she has. But Jades hair was super soft shiny and styling. Her clothes were awesome and i enjoyed her 2 trrack album.I would reccomend this doll because she is great fun too play with and you get great value for her price.PeaceEmma xxx"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bratz Dolls Are the pits","review":"I think Bratz dolls look like cheap hookers and everything you would hope your daughter would not grow up to resemble or admire.

My second graders were able to list the names of the helpers, but seeing the real-life children dressed in uniforms or typical dress for that helper really attracted attention. Not only does this book list the helpers, but it appealed to my children because the models were about the same age.

Her thesis is the \\"most books\\" assume policy should be rational and analyze when it is not. She argues that policy is INTRINSICALLY a paradoxical, conflicting process where (to greatly simplify) some people see A and others see B and others see C no matter how much data and rationality are tossed about, and that is HER starting point for discussing \\"policy making.\\" I found it very stimulating and see wide ranging applications in my work and even outside work for these ideas.

But this is an exceptional album, one of Torme's best. Though there are several arrangers, the songs flow together nicely, and every chart is bright and sharp. Torme is in great voice, improvising effortlessly without drowning the lyric; listen to how he subtly alters the refrain of the phrase \\"autumn in New York\\" or works in a very exciting scat before the instrumental break of \\"Let Me off Uptown.\\" Get the Bethlehem cd of \\"Mel Torme and the Marty Paich Dek-Tette,\\" and you can compare his earlier version of \\"Lullaby of Birdland\\" to the one here; both are unique and terrific.Even if you wouldn't live in New York for a million dollars, this is an indispensable cd from one of the immortal singers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mel Torme Swings New York!","review":"Well this album must be the ultimate Sunday summer drive album around.

First of all, this is a great piece of gay cinema history that I first saw in 1977 and thought I would never see again...so I'm very grateful this DVD is now available. Apparently the DVD was transfered from a print that had English subtitles and someone who thought they were too hard to read came up with the idea of the new large orange subtitles that are now superimposed over the original ones. The original subtitles are not THAT hard to read and the new ones take up way too much of the screen.

More than two weeks after Christmas he is still playing with it every day. In terms of manual dexterity he needs a little help from an adult to set up the tracks, but conceptually he is totally engaged, imagining and figuring out new systems to build. I was afraid that this set might be too basic/limited, but even within this set we have built exciting variations, although we are looking forward to getting some expansion packs now that we know the toy is a hit.

The solid wood construction makes all the difference, avoiding the frustration of more cheaply made toys.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quadrilla Marble Run","review":"We gave this to our 4 year old son for Christmas and he and his 6 year old brother love it.

Our students who began using the new 4th ed. complained that there were NO references to Bontrager in the anatomy and positioning sections. We use Bontrager as our primary textbook and the elimination of this major radiography text as a reference is disappointing and puzzling. Our students are also encouraged to buy Merrill's and the majority do. The students use the 9th ed of Merrill's and the refs are for the 8th ed. Merrill's has been out for over a year. The majority of refs were for a new book by Cornuelle. How are students suppose to find information in a text that is only in the library and one that is not a major textbook in use at this time (at least we know of nobody who uses it)? The author has done a major disservice to radiography students.

The manual looked like it kept theelements of the original games (which I even went back andreplayed last summer). While replaying the old games broughtback the enjoyment of playing them on the Apple in seventh grade,games of today are far too many and more fun to waste a lot of time on a game that in today's terms could only be considered repetive at best, and boring at worst. As with some of the previous reviews, the graphics and sound harken back to the daysof Wizardry four - the first \\"graphical\\" Wizardry. In other words, pretty poor. When I got the game I noticed that Sir-Tech did not produce it and assumed they had been bought out by this company. However, Wizardry 8 on the PC is out, and its produced by Sir-Tech.

It took me a little while to pick up where I left off with \\"Wizard Abroad\\" but once I did, I experienced Kit and Nita's troubles just as vividly as any of the other books. I especially admire Ms. Duane for not making the mistake many authors make. They make everything sweetness and light and the heroes tie up every loose end, often saving others against incredible, unbelievable odds. Besides the obvious elements, this book was very believable, partly because the character's lives aren't perfect and there is a bittersweet taste to even the happier endings of the series. Because this ending isn't a perfect one for everyone involved, it makes the book that much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but ther was an element lacking","review":"I was so glad to hear that there was going to be another in the wizardry series, after reading A Wizard Abroad I still had some questions that weren't answered in the end.

When she's finally ready to help the doctors in surgery (magically), she has passed a number of tests within the practice universes.

Granted, he is not a puter whiz but he had a hard time getting the record function to work. Usually, I can show him something and it will work fine for him thereafter. He kept coming back asking me whether he was recording or not. Not a good sign. It is pretty cute, but the toggle buttons are very hard to operate, especially for my husband that has larger fingers. Basic tasks like moving thru menus are a little hard to navigate with the tiny toggle. And we often found ourselves entering a function we did not want because of that.

My hair is so bad from the iron that I have to put my hair in a bun after using it to make it appear less frizzy. It was a good product at first, but after a while it made my hair worse. Note: I only straighten my hair one day a week and leave my hair curly the other 6 days, and my hair still gets fried. This straighten does, however, work well for my best friend who happens to have wavy hair. I suppose what I am saying is that get 100% ceramic plates(this one is not 100% ceramic) if you have culy hair like mine, or invest in this one if your hair is just wavy. This straightener does not straighten really curly hair.

It still works fine, but seems to take longer to heat up and the blue coating is starting to come off at the ends (this is probably due to my not taking good care of it, I'm pretty rough on things like this). Now that I'm shopping around I'm debating between buying this same one or a CHI. When I bought this one years ago it was MUCH cheaper than the Chi, but now there's not too much price difference. I've used my mom's Chi and felt it worked pretty comparable to this HAI. I like how the HAI has a setting dial, and it also seems to feel more substantial than the Chi. All in all, I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best flat iron!","review":"The product is great especially for the price!

I followed the instructions in the installation guide to no avail. It seems as if you have to \\"activate\\" the receiver on at least three different sites, none of which tell you that you are actually activated and none of which seemed to activate the receiver.

I have had the pleasure of hearing him several times at Middletown Bible Church, and have found his books to be well written, well sourced, easy to follow, and a great blessing for those who wish to learn God's Word deeper.Doctor Shower's book, MARANTHA! OUR LORD COME is surely the best defense of the Early Church believing that the Rapture was an expected event in their lifetime. While we now know that it did not happen, the teaching is clear from Scripture, and Doctor Showers proves it: The Doctrine of the Rapture is sound and expected that we should be a believer in it for each generation of believers; the immanent return of the Lord Jesus Christ to take His church away before the tribulation.Doctor Showers books are a must for any serious Bible student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed With Scholarship--Best Rapture Book, By Far","review":"Subtitle's right, this is a \\"definitive\\" rapture study. Far more than the typical Daniel, Revelation, Thessalonians, I Corinthians stuff here. Hundreds (thousands?) of verses are cited as Showers scrutinizes the entire Word of God for inferences supporting his view that the rapture will be before the 7-year tribulation. Detailed analysis of the various birth pangs references, the Day of the Lord (narrow and broad), use of the word tribulation, significance of the Revelation 5 scroll...and that's all preliminary to getting to Part II! I'm unaware of any scripture stones Shower's left unturned to present both the big picture and the details. By far the best of the many rapture books I've read, 'Maranatha' is for the serious student, but so well-organized that even one not so familiar with the Bible can benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended reading for both Catholic clergy and laity","review":"Deftly written by Donald Cozzens (a Catholic priest and teacher of religious studies at John Carroll University), Sacred Silence: Denial And The Crisis In The Church is an unflinching examination of the Catholic Church and its current troubles that even as this review is written has resulted in the removal of the American Archbishop Cardinal Bernard Law from his post. Addressing not only issues of sexual abuse allegations, Sacred Silence expands into the question of why the church is so controlling, and how it needs to change to become more responsive to the people it serves worldwide. Sacred Silence is very strongly recommended reading for both Catholic clergy and laity, as well as non-Catholics with an interest the administrative and public relations problems of clerical misconduct to wreak upon their own religious communities and institutions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the answer","review":"I am also a Catholic priest. Here is a man who was rector of a seminary. Yet he takes no responsibility for the current problems. Instead he dares to offer advice. Penance would be more appropriate.

The answer to our problems is more fidelty not less. Fr. Cozzens is part of the problem not the answer. For the real answers we need only look to Pope John Paul II.

The intro uses a great voice over and better graphics to make you get in the mood of the game.Here is where the problem starts.After all the cool cinematic and cool voice over you finally get to the colony building stage. This is the game you have been waiting for. Guess what? It's terrible. I had no idea what I was doing, if I was doing anything right.

Possibly one of Stephen Still's better songs.Special Care is another great song by Stephen Stills.

It is like the Beatles White Album, in that each member of the band did songs on his own. If it were not for the production of Messina, it would not have been finished at all. He and Furay dominate the album which is like having a Beatles album that is heavy on Ringo and George. Still(s), it is a fine listen, equally introspective as their earlier work, and a prophecy of where, not only these particular musicians, but also pop/country rock in general, was going. Here we see where the Eagles came from, Loggins and Messina, Poco, CSN and Young."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Soup Is Made From Scraps","review":"Ah, what could have been. The final Buffalo Springfield album comes up slightly short of their legendary second lp (Buffalo Springfield Again). If you didn't know any of the history of this record, you would find the breadth and scope of this record to be truly amazing, rivalling the Beatles White Album. Smart pop (On The Way Home), latin bounce (Uno Mundo), stadium rock (Special Care), beautiful country (Kind Woman), and Neil Young (I Am A Child) to name a few. They sould like different bands, almost.To know the story is to know that essentially they were 3 bands at this point. Stephen Stills did most of his songs by himself with studio musicians. Neil Young had little to do with the record except his tracks. Richie Furray and Jim Messina worked on their tracks.Be that as it may, throw this in your cd player and cruise on down the road.

The same goes for the faith of millions who have lived and died in the last 2000 years.The book is an easy read while at the same time being very engrossing and informative. It is sensible, and no educated or intelligent person will find it below their standards of argumentation or of exposition.

He was a radical liberal (even the New Testemant--written centuries after Christ's death admits to this), who challanged notions of church bound hierarchy's.It's a shame that organizational religion (like the Southern Baptist Convention) promotes disdain for what Jesus taught--individual personal relationship with Jesus and God.

My son has been walking for several months and could use this right from the beginning. When he was really unstable we did have to hold the front to keep it from flopping back though. You can lock the wheels to help prevent mishaps when you are not helping.My only real issue is the blocks. I like them overall, but it gives you 12 cylinder shaped blocks and only 6 rectangle blocks. Unless you are building a Colosseum, this ratio seems off to me. You can do a lot more with rectangle blocks and they are easier for young ones to stack. Also the pant can mark floors and walls - also the \\"natural\\" blocks have colored marks all over them. I find this happens with safer paint though and am okay with it.Overall I love and would buy again. Just wish the block ratio was updated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love IT!","review":"This walker is great! My 12 month old loves to walk back and forth with it. He loves to stop and pick up/remove blocks and any other toy he has placed on the wagon part. The blocks that come with the walker are well-made and plentiful. The height and sturdiness are great. My only issue is that it cannot be turned around easily but I haven't found any other walkers that turn easily either. Overall a cool find!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful toy but dangerous for new walkers","review":"They call it a \\"Baby Walker\\" but it's really only for toddlers who are already walking. My 9 month old daughter is pulling up on everything and can cruise, but when she tried to pull up on this, she fell over. This is very dangerous. I am buying a Radio Flyer Classic Wagon, which is much heavier and can withstand being pulled on or pushed or whatever way a baby moves. I have to say I regret buying this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection!","review":"We have tried out other walkers, and this one is by far our favorite! It very well made and sturdy. It's taller than some of the others, which works for us because my daughter is tall. The blocks that come with it are wonderful as well! LOVE this company!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great at 22 months","review":"Grandma gave this walker to my son for his first birthday, when he was thinking about walking but hadn't quite made it yet. At first, he only played with the blocks (mostly chewing on them or knocking them over), but he slowly started to use it as a walking aid. Now that he's been walking well for six months, he still loves to push the cart around, taking all the blocks out and replacing them with toy cars, books, and other items he wants to move from one place to the next. These days he also likes to stack the blocks into towers. Love the bumpers on the front corners - they definitely prevent him from marring our furniture and appliances when he smashes into them..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful for learning to walk","review":"We borrowed this from a neighbor to help our son learn to walk but it's so tipsy that it's pretty worthless as a walker. There's no way my little guy could use this to pull himself up - when he grabs the handles from a sitting position, the thing just topples over."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This is such a cute and classic walker. My son only used it a few times as a walker itself, but thats ok, he was and is very much into the classic wooden blocks. He uses the handle to hold on as he moves about. But I really love the blocks and so does my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 9 month old and 3 year old!","review":"This is really a great walker. If you've had one of those plastic ones you know how quickly it can take off from your baby even if they're ready to walk. This one has adjustable resistance which I don't remember reading about when I bought it but it is a great feature. It is really sturdy and you can't beat the price when you compare it other wooden walkers. Plus you get a great set of wooden blocks that my 9 month old and my 3 year old boys both love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to finish","review":"If you are a child of the 50's or simply love Blues you will love this CD.

I found that the methods lead to OVERTRAINING. I discovered another user who also required physiotherapy for his shoulder after independantly using this method. I did make the gains, I don't deny that. NB. I was experienced with weights and practiced good training form... I personally found the method very damaging to my shoulder, and have only just returned to lifting light weights this summer (2001), but still having minor problems with my shoulder (which is improving).

I would think it was a rare case, or just a certain warehouse, but there are reports all over the net about this happening from multiple sellers, not just amazon. If you order this, I would recommend opening all boxes, checking contents, and moving to sealed airtight containers, so that you can return any that might be infested.Dispite the issues with the Bugs, the non infested ones I bought at a local store are a favorite of my 9 month old, he just loves the stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY UNLESS YOU WILL USE WITHIN A FEW DAYS!

I had no knowledge of Brazilian Pop Music before I bought this album.This album is canned, processed, easy-listening music.

It is fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emerging goddess of expatriate Brazilian music","review":"Marisa Monte is the 90s answer to Astrud Gilberto and Elis Regina.

The arrangements, the songs and the choice of songs, the production, and of course the voice--everything is in place like a finished puzzle. I was fortunate enough to see her \\"ao vivo\\" three times on the \\"Barulhinho Bom\\" (\\"Great Noise\\") tour, and she is absolutely amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, haunting voice","review":"I first heard this singer while visiting a friend in Recife, Brazil, and was immediately hooked. Although I don't speak a word of Portuguese, I was drawn to the sound of Marisa's voice, which is crystal clear and very haunting. The music combines jazz, pop and traditional Brazilian rhythms into a wonderful melange that downright forces you to sway. With each listening, this album grows more complex and more engaging. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!","review":"This CD is awesome all the way thru. The voice, the instrumentation, complex and subtle at the same time. This CD could not be done any better in my opinion. I've listened to this title over and over and over, have gone out and bought all other titles (all are fantastic, I like R&C and Mais the best).

The students love it! I use this with 3rd-5th graders. We are running W2K on our machines, and once in a while, the program will freeze when switching lessons. I end the program, and re-open it fine. It does save all the work when it freezes, so we are able to pick up where we left off. Also, I stress accuracy over speed with my students, and the games allow you to work on accuracy over speed. I have my students working on a goal of 15 WPM (higher if needed) and the games are much too fast for this typing speed, even when they are set to focus on accuracy. Many students get frustrated. If they can type at least 25 WPM, they have no trouble with the games.Overall, this is a great program for the price. I even use it to practice my own skills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dvorak support","review":"I specifically bought TT12 because of the other reviews and because it supported the Dvorak layout keyboard.

We home school and our kids, ages 11, 9 and 7 are using this CD as part of their daily curriculum. It's easy to use, with straight-forward, clear instructions and has greatly improved each child's typing skills. Several points that are ideal for us: we can set personal parameters for each student; the program is designed to track progress; the typing is random, so it cannot be memorized, which makes each lesson new and challenging; the great typing games; the broad expanse of skill levels available means even I get to use it to master those pesky numbers and symbols that I didn't learn back in high school. We highly recommend this program to anyone who is seeking to develop and improve their typing/keyboarding skills!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good preparation program","review":"I did not like this product. It was very particular (you accidently hit the space bar twice and you have to correct it or it counts everything after that as an error). Not only does this slow you down, but it ill-prepares you for official typing tests (i.e. at college or a career center) where you ignore your mistakes and keep going (which is how you are supposed to type; you should not edit until you are finished).Also, there were some errors in the program itself (i.e. four spaces between words) and you'd really lose a lot of time trying to figure out what you were doing wrong. A few times the program made you type a letter \\"doubbble\\" or more before it would register. (Mistake intentional to show what I'm describing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"After all these years,I can't do without this.","review":"In this album they proved that they knew how to put words on a jazz solos.And they did it so elegantly.When I first heard this,I was at a loss what to say,and got speechless for a while.This album is less poppish and less commercial,however, I must admit that this CD is the tribute to JOHN HENDRICKS.A MUST ITEM for all the fans of JAZZ CHORUS GROUPS.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!No one can escape being swept away by their awesome talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz Pleasure","review":"I've wanted the digital version of this album since I lost my vinyl many years ago.

The game play is much faster paced and far more exciting. Team play is easier to do as many cards take into account games where more then 2 people are playing.

I requested a replacement from Amazon and when I got it, it did the same thing, freezing up at the 20 minute mark and refusing to advance any farther. So I wound up sending the defective discs back to Amazon and I guess I'll wait awhile before getting it again in hopes that FoxConnect has pressed a new batch of dvds that don't have that defect...and I did contact FoxConnect to let them know of the issue, too.

Defender's movement and \\"physics\\" are all wrong - very poor indeed.Robotron is unplayable because there is no way to lock the direction you fire in (ie you can't fire backwards) - Jeff Minter came up with the simple idea of holding down the fire button to lock fire in a certain direction - shame these guys didn't copy the idea.Joust seems like the most faithful reproduction, but maybe that's because I play more Defender.

The MAJOR problem is that you dont have the dual joysticks like the arcade, thus a game like Sinistar(which I popped a lotta quarters in, by the way in the arcade you have a short life in that game!), is almost unplayable. You have little chance in Robotron , and you can't fully enjoy Joust. If I could'nt enjoy them on the PS, I'll pass on the GBA with a tiny unlit screen!

It was a mix of so many great things: mystery, money, friendship, adventure, theater, and more. Anyone who has read Nancy Drew books before will love this book. Even for people that have never read Nancy Drew this is a good choice as long as you like mystery or adventure. It is a great read for a class assignment because of the amount of flashbacks, foreshadowing, and predictions that are possible in many, many places. Also, the characters are brilliant. Though they don't change much, they do seem to run into trouble! However, I don't have only good things to say.

Seriously, this thing could not possibly be flimsier and be made of metal. The saw is so flimsy it bends in one's hand. The \\"hatchet\\" head is about as sharp as scissors we had in 3rd grade (and could run with). The case is super-thin material. This is good to give your kid to play with on the beach.

THIS PRODUCT IS CHEAPLY MADE. I bought this because some reviews said it was decent, but they were wrong. The hatchet is a piece of crap (could barely cut through cardboard) and after using the shovel a few times the pin that holds all of the tool heads on the handle becomes loose and makes the entire tool useless.

This guide is perfect for any level of believer! It provides examples for everyday life, encourages readers to think of God in modern terms, and re-emphasizes basic truths for more mature believers. I love this series and look forward to more books covering topics such as Prayer, Worship, God's promises, etc. I'd also like to see more books for teens on dating, relationships, etc. Bruce and Stan have done a great job at portraying the real-ness of God!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As The Others...","review":"Let me start by saying that I am a *HUGE* fan of Bruce and Stan's work...that is why I was so disappointed by their \\"Guide To God\\". True to form, it contains the same easy lessons and self-deprecating humor that has made the other books so wonderfully entertaining and popular, but the content is -- to put it simply -- very dull. The book itself doesn't actually reveal anything that even the \\"youngest\\" Christian doesn't know, though people who are relatively new to the concept of the Lord might benefit from it. Unfortunately, I didn't really enjoy reading it as I did \\"Real Life Has No Expiration Date\\" and \\"Guide to The Bible\\". Truthfully, the authors' attempt is noteworthy, but the overall result isn't anything special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"When I first had purchased this book my attention was that this was going to be a good present for my boyfriend. The book stated that it was in new condition at a very reasonable price so I ordered it. Upon receiving the book, The book was in used condition! Not only was the cover of the book covered with black goo to show that this gift couldn't possibly be new but I was very disappointed that I couldn't even give this book to my boyfriend for his birthday. It should have stated that the book was USED. Therefore, I would have never ordered the book in the first place. I wish it hadn't turned out the way it did, I don't mean to put the seller in a bad position. Just hope that the seller in the future will make sure they are accurate about the quality of his or her products that are being sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Others Were Better...","review":"I really enjoyed the previously work by Bruce and Stan like \\"Guide to the Bible\\", \\"Real Life Has No Expiration Date\\", etc., but I can't help but whine a bit about this particular book because it wasn't really all that fascinating. They try to cover a lot of ground in it, which is nice, but tends to be distracting to the matter at hand. Unfortunately, Bruce and Stan are still clinging to the old teachings and doctrine (for example, they still believe Moses wrote the Torah, that Satan was once an angel, that there was an angelic fall, and so on and so forth...) and this tends to spoil the overall enjoyment of the book as most of the older information lacks sufficient evidence and support. Still, it might be useful to younger people discovering God or anyone who is curious about the subject in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show","review":"I just watched this on PBS and it was great.Great story about about a great American woman.

With the arrival of the newest Crash on GC, this seemingly impossible alignment of the planets has come to fruition. The controls are Crash with the requisite jumps and spins joined by dashes of flying, swimming, and Marble Madness-style gaming to spice things up. The framerate dips occasionally which detracts from the otherwise smooth gameplay.Graphically, this version is slightly below the recent Xbox release, but in line with the competent PS2 iteration. The levels are colorful, and Crash himself looks as nutty as ever. The games's bouncy soundtrack is pleasant, but nothing new for veterans of the wily marsupials adventures.The Crash Blast game that downloads to your GBA is a nice bonus, but feels like an afterthought. The Wrath of Cortex gives fans more of what they want, just nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad game","review":"This game stinks.

Unfortunately, it's unbearably slow, so that every time she's even remotely near a ditch, you hope that something comes by like a stray football player or an eighteen-wheeler and kicks her in. This film is sentimental, horribly filmed, and punctuated with dialogue that is far from engaging. Read Thomas Hardy's Tess of the d'Urbervilles before you see this dishonest thing.

It never lost my attention for an instant. The first book, I though was wonderful, but this book exceeds it in many ways. This book answers most questions that you were left with after A great and terrible beauty. This also held your attention more. And this book wasn't predictable. There were a few things you could guess, but you always had your hesitaions. I recommand this this book to everyone, except to those who are disturbed by ghosts or supernatural elements. Or to those who are uncomfortable with blood and murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend it","review":"I read this because I work in a bookstore and am often asked for recommendations. Based on reviews here, this is wildly popular.I may have grown up on Nancy Drew and Laura Ingalls, but I realize times have changed. Even so, I won't be able to recommend a book where one father is a child molester and the other an opium addict. This book could have stood without those subject lines. The trouble with bringing in the molestation issue, is that it should have been resolved in some way. Instead, the victim makes her friend keep her secret then they just go on about their business, and each go on back home. You can't mention a subject like that and then just let it fade off as if the author forgot she brought it up. I just found it disturbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ohh what fun","review":"This second installment was much better than the first in my opinion. There was much more action and excitement, and absolutely more intrigue and mystery. I also liked that there was a love interest for Gemma. Well, maybe 2.

Since I was in a reading slump and have sworn off vampires for a month AND nothing seemed to peak my interest I decided that I would give the Gemma Doyle trilogy another go.Rebel Angels was okay. I liked that it explained much of what was missing from the first, why Gemma is the most high, who the other members of the order are, more details of the Rakshana and more description of the realm itself. I like the gorgon, Kartik and think Simon was a very respectable suitor for Gemma. I like the struggle between good and bad, those with power and those with out, and the whole destiny versus choice argument. BUT, it just is not my cup of tea. Go figure.Will I read the last book in the trilogy, The Sweet Far Thing? Yes, but I am not sure when. I really would like to see what becomes of Pippa, Ann and Felicity and the relationship between Gemma and Kartick."},{"rating":"2","title":"one in a million","review":"one of the best follow up books ever written.

This is a great follow up and i just wish for more and more... I have not yet come to finish it cause i can not think of myself being through with it and there being nothing more for me to read! Libba Bray is such a fantastin writer and has inspired me so much!! This book really is one that gets you involved and makes you think. Her details are sooo percise that you could imagine the \\"The Relms\\" as if you had seem them before. I encourage any teen and older to read this book it seriously is worth your time. This is a book you can not put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, engrossing sequel","review":"Wow, what a wonderful, thought-provoking novel. I really enjoyed this book. Libba Bray is indeed a huge talent--the way she combines humor, magic, drama, and suspense will keep you wanting more. After reading the first chapter of A Great And Terrible Beauty, I was hooked. When I finally got my hands on this sequel, the same thing happened. I couldn't put it down.The characters are becomming more layered, more complex. You begin to learn more about each of them. When you discover Felicity's secret it is astounding, and it's intriguing how her personality is so opposite. Ann, who is always yearning for acceptance and attention, learns more about herself in this book. I also loved how this book opened with Kartik as the narrator...you begin to understand his role in the story more, and by the end, how much he is beginning to care for Gemma.I loved everything about this book. I recommend it wholeheartedly! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for Teens","review":"I really enjoyed this sequel. I know it is in the teen fiction section, but only because it is written from a teenager's point of view. Adults will enjoy this book along with the young adults. It is a wonderfully inventive fantasy story where girls are the heroes. They are not perfect, but heroes nontheless. My only negative about the book is that it ended too soon. I wanted to know what happened after she...well, I don't want to give anything away. You should definitely pick up this book if you've already read the 1st one-- A Great and Terrible Beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sequels","review":"Gemma Doyle has had to face much since she discovered her magic.

Along with all that she still has to figure out her feelings for the hansome Kartik. Again with the help of Felicity, Ann, and Kartik she must bind the magic to save the relms and defeat one of the most powerful enemies even if it is one of her friends.

Simply put, it was spellbinding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent. Now when will the next one be released?","review":"I will confess that it was A Great and Terrible Beauty's cover that drew me to the book. Then I found out it was a young adult novel. I groaned and put it down. Then I became a librarian in a high school and began reading notable books.Beauty blew me away and Rebel Angels was no exception. The writing is solid and is masterfully done. I will confess however, that I expected the ending. I believe I know what will happen in the next book but that does not detract from this novel. I still highly recommend it.

I thought the story had great potential but that the execution could use some work (a common problem with first time authors). I have to say that with \\"Rebel Angels\\" Libba Bray more than outdid herself. This book goes deeper into the interesting story she started in the first book, is well-written, and very imaginative. I say it is better than the first one. Also, her villians are very ingenious and the lines between good and evil are tenuous, both of which lead to a really tight, exciting story. Definitely a great book and I can't wait for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you just finished reading \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty,\\"","review":"then you would already own this book. It is a great sequel to the first novel by Libba Bray. The story of Gemma and her friends and their ongoing struggle to gain knowledge of Gemma's powers grows with this novel. Once you read it you too will be awaiting the third novel. I originally bought \\"A Great and Terrible Beauty\\" for my daughter and started to read it in the car.

It has been instrumental in my assimilation of biblical Greek and I recommend it for the beginning Greek student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used in Seminaries!!","review":"I am in a 500 level greek class right now and we are using this book for our text and it is working wonderfully. This is my first interaction with greek , however I am picking it up faster than any other language I have attempted. I have studied both Spanish and German and Greek has been easier than both of them. This is not to say that learning greek is easy, the preface of the book says that the only way to learn is by continuous study, AND HE'S RIGHT! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the bible in its original language. Get the Workbook too, its a big help!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Biblical Greek","review":"Reads like a textbook; Covers the Greek language from Alpha to Zeta; recommend reading for those interested in learning the language!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Grammar","review":"Having studied German, Arabic, Akkadian, Hebrew (in modern and ancient forms), and several Aramaic dialects in addition to Greek, I feel that I should say that this intro grammar is not only the best New Testament Greek grammar there is, but it is the best intro grammar that I have every seen for any language that I have studied. And I have used scores of them written in both English and German. Huehnergard's Akkadian grammar comes in second. Though Mounce's techniques are not fully applicable to all the world's languages, every author of any intro grammar for an ancient language should adopt as much of his methodology as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"More then a Greek Grammer","review":"This is an awesome book. It teaches you more then just how to read Greek. You also learn why it is important to understand Greek Grammer. At the beggining of each chapter there is an exegetical insight that shows you why this part of Greek grammer is important to a true understanding of the NT.Dr. Mounce does more then just teach you, he fills you with excitment and love for God's word in Koine Greek!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn more by memorizing less--this book delivers!","review":"When I started studying Greek, I read two standard grammars, then this one. I never went back to the other two, and I read this one three times. It is so easy to read, and so unique in its approach, that I don't know why anyone would use any other. Every college and seminary library I visit uses this grammar -- it is the new standard. If you use this book, you will not have to memorize near so much as the other grammars require. After taking eight hours of Greek at seminary, it was obvious to me that I did not know Greek at all, and so I turned to Mounce's book for help. Mounce's approach is so revolutionary (using morphology), that my previous Greek knowledge had to be scrapped. I had to start over with Greek, and I can't imagine a better way to learn than with this book. This is the book to get if you want to learn Greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Course Companion","review":"I bought this text for a four-week intensive seminary class. With any other text the course would have been impossible. But following Mounce's easy-to-understand layout and user-friendly terms made the intensive format manageable. In addition, I anticipate keeping the text as a reference tool for future exegesis classes, it's that helpful. One word of caution: this is probably not the best book to buy if you're looking to learn Biblical Greek on your own. There are several other resources out there geard towards helping the layperson get a handle on koine Greek. But for the Bible College or seminary student, this one's the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book is good as in it covers all the basic functions of Greek sentence structure (e.g. nouns, adjectives, verbs, etc.) There are alot of helpful hints to help the brutal memorization process. My only complaint is that the explanations are really, really short - usually within a paragraph or so. For a subject as difficult as Greek, I would have thought they would have expounded a bit more on the explanations. Other than that, it's a good book and I would reccommend it to anyone who is new to the Greek language. The workbook is essential for practicing though, since there are no practice problems in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am actually LEARNING the language using this book!","review":"Well, I am not nearly as smart as the other people posting reviews here. I am just an average guy. I am a driver for DHL, married with two kids - this means I don't have a lot of time to learn a language... with that said, with this book (combined with the workbook) I am actually LEARNING the language. So much so that I bought myself a greek new testament and am able to read more and more of it as I continue in my studies.Take it for what its worth - this book is helping me, and I think it is doing it well. I am not feeling confused or lost. Mr. Mounce seems to be a good teacher, and a good writer. I recommend this book.Take care,Rob"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Beginners!","review":"I bought this book knowing nothing, absolutely nothing, about Greek. I spend about 3 1/2 hours a week working through the workbook and textbook. It's really enjoyable, and the included CD really helps (especially with pronunciation). Be prepared to commit, thought, for this is no laid back subject, but a very disciplined one. Prof. Mounce is funny and lighthearted, but gets right to the point - he doesn't waste any time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best . . .","review":"I can not offer enough praise for this book. It transformed Greek from an archaic and difficult language to a living language in just months of semi-strenous study. Mounce makes learning Greek interesting, exciting, fun, fluent, meaningful, and even edifies your faith in Jesus Christ. I wouldn't hestitate to reccommend this book to anybody who is serious about learning the language, the pastor or the laymen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mouncey goo","review":"I am currently a sem student in the city of Chicago and have been studying out of this text book now for three weeks. To sum up... it is a piece of market driven textual goo- Zondervan strikes again! Do not believe the hype. Do not buy Mounce's text book! Croy's \\"Primer...\\" from Eerdman's is much more to the point and dare I say academic and much more helpful. Croy even provides a systematic way of learning unlike Mounce's approach of throwing everything to the student at once but then holding off essential elements like saving verbs for chapter 16. Croy is great also for his inclusion of excercises from the LXX. Mounce is a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never received ITEM","review":"I have tried numerous times to find this order under my recent purchases and have never been successful.

However, this book simply uses too much real estate to decribe a concept that could have concisely decribed in half of the space provided. There isn't enough color examples to illustrate how to take readings in real life situations. A substantial section to describe individual camera operation is not that useful since it duplicates what should have provided from the owner manual of the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute beginner","review":"This book can be good for 12 to 14 year old children. What this book explains in 166 pages can be explained in 2, if you have some brains. This book makes incredibily stupid comparisons to explain simple matters. Chosing a Reference Tone is explained by moving a stool from one room to another, dhah! The 18% gray card is compared with the way FedEx used to work. The author even starts with explaining what percentages are. Photografy is and will always be a quit technical thing. It's very nice of the author to try and make Photografy accessible for everyone. If you've had any proper education or technical background, please don't read this book, it's a big waste of money and there's tons of information on the net, that will teach you much more then this poor book, and it's for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy-Paste from another book by the same author","review":"[...] Actually if you have bought \\"Confused photographer's guide to photographic exposure and the simplified zone system\\" - you bought _MORE_ of the very same content, which is available in \\"The Confused Photographer's Guide to On-Camera Spotmetering\\". This book looks like a subset of the previous one, with very little additions, concerning the spotmetering. Please, don't get me wrong. It is not a completely bad book. It is acceptable as long as you haven't seen \\"The Confused Photographer's Guide to Photographic Exposure and the Simplified Zone System\\", where the content fits much better.

If you want you can also change to a \\"desired\\" exposure. The way you explain it is very very simple, and it was so fun to read, that I read it in just a few Sunday afternoon hours, without putting the book down.

I have been taking photos for 20 years and never knew how to do it correctly. I bought high end cameras and used them in Programmed Auto mode. I went digital a few years ago and did the same thing....Programmed Auto. I recently purchased a Nikon 5700 and have been stuggling with it. I was ready to give up. Then someone told me about this book. It has made all the difference imaginable. I had to reread some but finally the \\"lights went on\\". For taking digital or film photographs this is a book that everyone who picks up a camera should read. Actually I bought both of his books and don't regret it for a moment.You can have all the camera technology money can buy but if you don't know the basics.......why bother.Don't get me wrong...I am not Ansel Adams. But I do know how to take photos in Manual mode, spot meter and make correct exposure decisions all because I read these books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"For years I have been wanting to learn to take good photos and this book has been a tremendous help in teaching me techniques to use.

Thanks for writing such a great book that is easy to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on the Subject of Spot Metering!","review":"Too many photo \\"how to\\" books slide right over the importance of metering, especially spot metering. You wonder why your photos lack the detail and color that your remembered when you shot that picture. This book is wonderful. It is the only book that I have come across that explains in great detail how the camera works and how to determine the exposure you desire using the spot meter. You will be amazed at how much better your photos will be if you turn off that automatic stuff and let your brain decide what your exposure should be. After you have read those books about aperture, shutter speed and depth of field (they all seem to read the same), read this book to learn how to expose/meter correctly. I am so glad that I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotmeter, yes. Zone System, no.","review":"The information in this book would be a good 5 page appendix to some camera manuals. I used to cover it in about 30 minutes of class when I taught.While this book is obviously useful for many people who are totally new to photography, it is not a view of the simplified zone system as it says. People who learned that they have a spotmeter from this book will need to read a lot more for any understanding of the real zone system.The zone system can only be practiced with a combination of exposure and development. It is not child's play.The basic message is correct. You haven't a prayer of knowing what your black and white picture will look like unless you are already an expert or turn off the automatic exposure gizmos and get to know your subjects through a spot meter.Color is another matter, of course, and the vast majority of people make color pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"I understand!","review":"This is a wonderful book for those who do not understand the basics of photography. I found the book very helpful and finally understand how to measure light for my photographs. The book provides several examples and comparisons for the reader...everyone thinks differently....and even provides cheat sheets for several camera models...I highly recommend this book for the beginning photographer. Thank you Bahman for showing me the \\"light\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is an overkill.","review":"I didn't know much about the spotmetering and graycards before I bought this book and I don't regret buying and reading this book but... After reading the book I could rewrite the basics in just one sentence or with detailed examples and sample photos on just 10 pages. It seems like the author either underestimated our intelligence or tried to get a bigger number of pages for the (more costly) book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamentals of SPOTMETERING.","review":"Bahman Farzad has written the all-time reference BOOK on SPOTMETERING. He has explained indetail 'what metering is' and then gone on to explain SPOTMETERING, where, how and when to use it. Although I use an OLYMPUS OM4T which is not mentioned in his list of CAMERAS with built-in spotmetering, this book and its progressive chapters clearly re-taught the correct way of using it.

HIGHLY RECCOMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning the art of correct exposure","review":"If you are new to photograpy or simply want a refresher on the concept of obtaining correct exposure and the importance of using a spot meter, this is a great book.

Overall, I found this to be very informative and well written with helpful illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Until I had this book one takes photographs that the camera takes. After reading this book you can be in control.

My children benefited immensely from it, and even their much older siblings loved to read it to them.It's a great way to deal with what children inevitably notice: parents make mistakes.

The graphics are bland, very bland. The characters are stiff and the animation is very jerky. The moves aren't as easy to pull off as you might think, and yeah they take practice to pull off, but they could have been made much better.

I should kick my own tail for doing something of which i should have known better for. Graphics and sound are great, but thats were it ends. Special moves like scorpion's spear throw work maybe once in 25 tries, ai is a joke being too hard or too easy. Really, if you want to win, just run at your opponent until they back themselves in a corner, then wail away; they won't block or even try to get away. Fatalities r easy to pull off, but they're bland. The game book says you're supposed to do the classic sub zero's head pull, nope, you really send out a blast of frigid air which freezed your vic, who then falls back and shatters.

The graphics are barely above bad, there is not nearly as much fun in the gameplay or moves as there is in MK Trilogy(which I plan to get for my big computer), and the sound and character design is atrocious. I think that this game belongs on the shelves except if you either have no love for yourself or if you want to pay a jerk back for something rotten he did to you. What was Ed Boon thinking(no offense to him) when he made this waste of mechanics? Man, oh man, don't waste your cash on this game. Buy MK4 or II or a really worthy MK game."},{"rating":"2","title":"mk never looked so good","review":"This game is the best when i first got is i thought it was dark but it is no at all the contrest can be changed in options and the game difficaly also the game is hard buy not impossiable p.s. megamanis harded by far for example megaman and bass.The game has 23 charecters and three secret they are shou kan motaro and human snoke the fatalitys are easy to pull of and so are the moves. I recomend this to awry mk fan and if your not a fan your dumb"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they even bother","review":"When Mortal Combat hit the arcade, it was a fighting game worthy to be played. It was followed up by Mortal Combat 2 which was also a worthy fighting game. After MK2, the game became a joke. Today, MK is a joke because they haven't even incorporated a good combo system like any capcom fighter or SNK fighter. Acclaim needs to give this title a frikin rest. They are just as bad as George Lucas releasing Episodes 4,5, and 6 again.Bottom line is, if you played a single MK game in your life, then you arent missing out by not playing MKA. Go get a real fighting game rather than this lame piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"MKA = UMK3","review":"Its umk3 potable and ruined. It could have been so easy to finally come out with a good mk game on gameboy. the graphics and sound are incredible, and the number of players is nice, but pnce again the game play is sooo bad. It is extermely hard, and very boring. The people move so slow and its almost impossible to win. They should take the old mk2 for the old gb and port it to gba with color and bloo(sorta like the gg version) that would be a thousand times better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a prop for your wobbly table?","review":"If you want horrable controls, 8-bit nes sound, as much animation as a atari 2600, a way to torment someone by locking them in a room with this game and only this game, or even a prop for that pesky table that wont stop wobbling this is the game for you!!! Mortal Kombat Advance is one of the worst games I have ever played. In fact im still debating as to which game is better E.T. for atari 2600 or this chunk of plastic they call a game. Save your money for something good and just use something less expensive for that pesky table. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!! STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This is without a doubt the worst Mortal Kombat game I ever played in my whole life!!!!! The characters are too small, the moves are hard to pull off sometimes, and the bossed are too easy for me! To beat Motaro, just keep doing the low kick on him (hold foward and press A) and to beat Shao Khan, Keep throwing projectiles and he'll block them all, destroying him! This is an extremely bad game and I advise you all to STAY FAR FAR AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Mortal Kombat, BUT...","review":"I know a lot of people like myself enjoy the MK games. However, this game just doesn't live up to expectations. The control is absolutely horrendous. It's a challenge just to pull off basic moves like a sweep or jump kick. There are a lot of bugs in the game- for example listen as Sub-Zero jumps, he sounds like Kitana. A lot of the sounds don't even work half the time, and I've even had opponents in the corner and it won't register hits. They have obviously rushed this game out the door for Xmas, without finishing it. What a disapointment with Street Fighter for the GBA being great. Overall, check this one out only if you are a big MK fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Controls are terrible!","review":"I was looking forward to a complete packing of MK for GBA, but the controls and gameplay was horrible.

This game is a total disgrace to the Mortal Kombat name.It's basically just Ultimate MK3,but IT IS HORRIBLE! You only got two buttons to work with,along with the d-pad of course,but it is SOOOO HARD!..and as I said,I'm an MK vet.I could not even get past the first fight.All Scorpion did was just block.Every punch or kick I tried to hit him with,he would just block.Another thing.It is almost impossible to pull off a special move.The cpu just kicks your ass,before you even have a chance to attack.Bottom line.This game sucks.You're better off just picking up MKII for the original Gameboy instead.Stay away from this worthless piece of little plastic!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I truly enjoyed the whole Williamsburg series that ends with Homing.

It looks nice, but the water level is extremely shallow. I know my dragon doesn't need anything more than just a puddle to lick up, but this isn't even 1/4 inch deep. This item has to be placed on a perfectly level surface or all the water can rest in the back of it making it inaccessible to FartZilla. I suppose if you used a sand substrate you could compensate for this and angle it a little more. I use a slate tile substrate and needed to shim it up a little bit. I didn't have to do that with an open water dish. Speaking of that, the opening of this item is just barely an inch wide.

Still, young and old alike were apt to strive for the higher things in life: honesty, trustworthiness, studiousness, and the like.The book does not attempt to moralise, yet through the witty writing and warm descriptions of the Old Squire, Gram, and the cousins (and their actions), Stephens manages to paint a picture of living life well. It still takes hard work to achieve one's goals and to aim for the higher things in life...

Plus I doubt people actually live like that. If you want a real good story about rich teens try Gossip Girl, the Clique series, or The Pretty Little Liars series.

I loved the movie enough to get the DVD only to find that for one of the most beautifull movies ever made it is one of the worst DVD transfers I have ever seen. First, I don't know why Hollywood cannot get it screen format act together. This movie is not wide screen animorphic ( to fite wide screen TV's) nor is it surround sound, as it says on the back under special features. You have to look closer to see the word \\"Stereo\\" after running time and color. The first release of The Last of The Mohicans had the same screen format problem but thank God they came out with what they then called an enhanced widescreen version that fixed the problem. Please Mirimax restore Restoration to true wide screen dolby 5.1 surround sound and I will give it an easy 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful period piece!","review":"You probably will not find many more beautifully photographed historical films than \\"Restoration\\". Robert Downey's acting is very good, although I am not a fan of Meg Ryan...she always seems so \\"self aware\\" in her roles.The film has an inspiring message as it stresses the virtues of human kindness and self sacrifice over a life of self seeking indulgence.

Robert Merivel enters as an immature, self-absorbed goofball, with an irrepressible spark of the man he could become glinting through the coating of muck. He gets dragged through a series of harsh refining situations and emerges with the dross burned off. The final act of restoration (and you thought that only referred to the historic time period) is a solid two-tissue moment.Robert's friend Pierce is a charming jewel of a character who doesn't make anywhere near the drastic developmental leap that Merivel does, but doesn't need to -- he's a perfect balance quiet integrity to Merivel's extreme dramatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"I do not buy many DVD's or videos.

Phil Collins spent his time alternating between his solo career and playing with Genesis, until the solo career won out. Of course, during this time, a lot of Genesis sounded like Collins' solo stuff as well. Hired for his drumming, and not his singing, although now he's known mostly for his singing.All of the songs on this album are good. Collins is a good songwriter, and has a very fitting voice. He's just fun. Great hits came off this album like the nonsense word title \\"Sussudio\\", which gave way to many little girls being named such. \\"\\"Don't Lose My Number\\", \\"Take Me Home\\", and \\"One More Night\\" received tons of airplay, and still do.

The lightsaber control is cool too. The graphics and voice-overs could have been better. I hated contolling the cycle through your weapons like the sniper rifle and binoculars. Why doesn't the sniper rifle have an adjustable scope? And why can't you carve your name or symbol on the walls with the lightsaber? And, why, when you fall down the waterfall you hit the sky you look like you fall on the floor? And why can't you force-pull clubs and sticks? This game is pretty solid and challenging though.

First of all, the graphics are so bad, the characters' lips don't even move and This game's structure is so bad you'll die for no reason, and this game has a tendency to glitch like crazy during two-player mode. This game is a compleate mess. Lucas Arts must have put it together in one weekend. They just slapped a title on a piece of pitiful junk! They just needed some game out just to have it out. This is a sorry excuse for a game and a waste of money, money that could have been spend on something more useful, like toilet paper.

However, this game was so ... terrible that I had to take a stand. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is a waste of time and money. This game is just another sorry effort by the folks at Lucas Arts. They are fraudulently using their brand name to sell a shoddy product. Controls are horrible, and the graphics under-utilize the power of the Xbox. Fusion Frenzy is a better game than this one.

Buy yourself something more useful, like a paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucas Arts Does it Again..","review":"I promised myself I wouldn't buy Lucas Arts games anymore.. but of course I was a sucker for this game when it came out on Xbox. I've tried twice to play this game and both times grew bored of it within 15 minutes. Compared to other XBox games I have this game doesn't even come close. Game control is tedious at best and load times are terrible. The graphics are decent I guess.. but based on games like Halo, they really aren't up to par. To top it off, for whatever reason, Lucas Arts has made Obi-Wan's voice sound like a bad William Shatner impression! Honestly, anyone who says this is the best game for XBOX hasn't bothered to play Halo, Max Payne, Madden, NHL Hitz, etc..SAVE YOUR MONEY! Rent this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, But LucasArts could have done better.","review":"I dont own this game, But I have rented the game three times and I have almost beaten it, the graphics are great, music score is wonderful, character movement is also a wonder, but the only two things that i have found wrong with this game, first, was the voice over for obi-wan, it was terrible, Lucas Arts could have hired someone with a more convincing obi-wan voice. It didnt sound good at all. The next thing that was a problem, was when I de-activated obi-wans lightsaber, there's a quick pause in the game and then the game resumes. Over all, it is a good game for star wars fans to rent or purchase..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Sub-Average Game with just a few nice surprises","review":"Aside from some of the really cool things that you can do with the \\"force\\" and decent controls, everything else about this game... The graphics look out-dated and non-Xboxish and you fight the same monsters over and over and over and over again in a very repetitive game. The voice-acting and CG movies are just plain bad.Avoid this game -- get Halo instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent It, Don't buy it.","review":"This game is a really good rental. Fun aspects like force powers and light saber battles make it interesting for about an hour. After that, the bad graphics, glitchy gameplay, and akward controls ruin it. The tutorial is the funnest part of this game. That's where you learn all of your jedi abilities.The camera angles are ridiculously frustrating. At one point you are forced to jump down a series of levels onto another platform. There's just one problem, you can't adjust the camera angle down. How stupid is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is so awful, that it even puts the Xbox to shame","review":"Repetitive gameplay, horrible framerate, out-dated engine, ugly graphics, frequent pauses, it is the worst game to hit the Xbox. It is just terrible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming","review":"I played a demo of this a few weeks ago and found the game to be rather lame. The animation had to be the worst part. I thought it would at least be a beefed up fighting/quest game taking advantage of the xbox's power but came away from it utterly disappointed. Obi-Wan's movements are rather choppy, almost robotic and not fluid in the least bit. Like what was said earlier, not just the plot but the actual gameplay and movements are almost identical to TPM for the psx and pc, with better graphics and shading. From everyone I've talked to, Obi-Wan is shaping up nicely to be one of the worst xbox titles out there. Beware of the dark side of the force, as well as crummy games from Lucas Arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"gamerX review","review":"I played the x box and the first game i wanted to play was obi-wan but it was the suckiest game of all time.

And remember rent them before you buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy, Ugly, and Repetitive","review":"This game crashed twice on me in my first day of playing it. There have also been several points where the character gets trapped in weird shaking sequences that are hard to break out of; major object detection problems in the engine. The game gets repetitive real quick when it becomes obvious that you'll be wandering around monotonous corridors waving your light saber at enemies that look exactly the same. Speaking of looks, each character in this game is made of about 11 polygons. Obi Wan has a flat spot on his head that you could set a coffee table on. Animation is ugly too, arms don't seem like they are attached to torsos. Voice acting is horrendous, the fake Ewan McGregor voice sounds like it belongs in The Rocky Horror show. I would avoid this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very upset","review":"I bought this game because of the Star Wars name like im sure most people did.

Somehow, George Lucas dove right into my brain and took the scraps of my imagination to whip together a movie.But there was always one thing missing -- I never got a real light saber to play with. Well, now I do. And for that reason alone, despite some flaws, Obi-Wan gets five stars. And most of my free time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OBI-WAN","review":"Obi-Wan for X-Box is a one player game in which the actions and events take place in Episode I. This game is packed with action and an actual plot. Far out idea huh... a game with a plot. I would recommend this game to anyone (that includes people that are not fanatics like me who cant stay away). Qui-Gon Jinn comes into play with a few apperences. The only bad aspects about this game is the repititive droids that become annoying and the accasional freezing. The force powers also aren't the best. The power of doing a force jump with a backflip into a over-head strike on an enemy makes up for these imperfections.(You can trust me on this one.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok game, terrible graphics","review":"I sure expected a lot more from this game than what it offers. The game itself is ok but the graphics are terrible. This game was obviously not built from the ground up to take advantage of the Xbox. Rather, Lucas just took an existing graphics engine and packaged it as a new game. I'm suprised that Microsoft allowed this game to be one of the early Xbox titles. With so many other games that have good gameplay and fantastic graphics, I just don't understand why this one was released except as a fill in until other Star Wars games come out. With the power of the Xbox this game could have been fantastic if it was built to be a top notch game like Halo. Instead we are left with a ok game and 1995 type graphics for the same money that a game such as Halo costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obi-Wan","review":"I have played the X-box, and it's great. But Obi-Wan for Xbox is just...[bad]. Lucasarts have already done 10 Episode 1 games and all of them, except racer, were failures and should been avoided.Obi-Wan are an exact copy of Episode 1:Phantom Menace (PC,PS). What they'we done is just highened the graphic one level. You play 1 level, and you put it away.

You play as Obi-Wan with his lightsabre and all and a load of force powers, such as push, pull, defend jump, and so on. The handling with this game is easy and the storyline is great. So of the reveiws for this game that I have read, people give reasons, but their reasons are not that great. I mean come on people, do you expect every single game made is perfect? Give me one game that has no flaw at all, that everyone in the entire world would like! You can't! I'm not say this game is perfect, but it's most fun I have ever had on a game... any ways back to the game, It's story star before episode 1 and over laps it. Jedi battle arena is alot of fun too.

The story of the evolution of the repeating and later self-loading rifles weaves together divergent and often conflicting priorities, biases and technologies.It's nicely covered and makes a fascinating story - assuming you are interested in antique marshal arms. Detailed photographs are a plus. The author has another volume that covers German rifle development up to 1870 - apparently though not available in English.This book suffers from an awkward, probably too literal, translation into English that could have used another heavy edit or two.

I've often felt like I needed to go back to college and get an engineering degree to learn how to work all the new-fangled electronic equipment, but the Harmony is easy to program (and I'm no computer whiz by a long shot!)and even easier to use. Contrary to another review I read, the batteries in ours last a looong time and my husband is a channel-surfer, so no issues there. It didn't take but a couple times to teach the grandkids how to use it. Whenever a problem is encountered, just press Help and it fixes it. What more could you ask for? It's worth every penny and I can't recommend it high enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective out of the box; poor support","review":"Right out of the box the remote failed. It was supposed to include a CD, but the CD was missing. The firmware failed to update from both a Mac and a PC. Online support was useless, and when I called tech support, the non-English speaking tech didn't even ask me what model I had or what the problem was, but started asking questions about what my TV and DVD models were. Once they heard that the firmware couldn't be upgraded, they queued me up to level 2 support, at which point the call was disconnected. Three (*three*) days later, I received an email with a 10-step procedure (honestly, 10 steps) for how to reset the firmware. At that point I boxed it up and sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase I ever made.","review":"Wasted two days working with this remote.

I would suggest finding out if your components are already known by logitech. If the remote needs to learn anything it can have problems.

It's easy to program, easy to use and a great, small erogonimic design. My only problem with it is that the top optional buttons around the screen have given up. They gradually became harder and harder to push to make work until they stopped working altogether. Logitech's support was completely unhelpful in resolving the issue.

I love having one remote that can replace my current 4 remotes. The only complaint is that their tech support is poor. I spent quite a bit of time on hold waiting for an operator until I was forced to leave a message. I was told that I would receive a phone call back by the end of the day only to receive a call the next day. I was pretty upset that I am expected to try and get the remote to work during THEIR schedule. One must question whether the instructions are too many issues, the instructions are not always clear, or they just don't want to staff their support correctly. It is a great remote as long as you are confident that you won't have any problems....otherwise good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do what I want","review":"The good things about this remote are:- Its shape and feel are nice- Programming via USB/Internet are very nice.However, it is not COMPLETELY programmable. You can only program the specific buttons \\"watch tv\\" or \\"watch a movie\\", and thus I never get the combination of buttons I want. For instance, the \\"POWER\\" button at the top of the remote cannot be programmed, nor the \\"HELP\\" button. In addition, it's far too difficult to navigate back and forth between device types. I can't even figure out how to change the volume of the TV when I'm watching a DVD.While not as attractive, the Sony AV3100 works far better than this remote. I just wish the Sony AV3100 looked like the H-659.Bottom line:- Average users shouldn't buy this remote because it is too difficult to navigate between device types.- Advanced users shouldn't buy this remote because they cannot have complete control over every button.Not recommended. Try the AV3100."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it had a charging cradle","review":"This would have probably been the coolest thing our living room had ever seen if we had ever been able to use it with regularity. Everything about it works well, and I spent the better part of an hour when we first got it \\"teaching\\" it how to tune our various devices. Unfortunately, this remote went through batteries faster than any piece of electronics I've ever owned. At least once a week, we would pick it up to find that it appeared to be on, but didn't have enough juice to send an adequate signal to one or more of our devices. The cost of the remote was hard to justify to my wife, and the cost and hassle of constantly replacing batteries was worse.

Before I even bought it, I was able to use the Harmony web site to check that it knew about ALL of my Audio/Video components. It did! Using a PC to program the remote and having that setup saved at the Harmony web-site is a great way to do it. As mentioned in earlier reviews the tech support is superb. I was on hold for no more than 10 seconds and they kept me on the phone until it was verified that my problem was fixed. This remote even has the codes to directly set my TV to one of its 10 input sources rather than toggling through them (which is all the remote that came with the TV can do.) Finally, the idea that you use the remote to say what you want to do (e.g. watch TV, or listen to music, or watch a DVD) and it sets up all the components for that activity is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Logitech Remotes are Very Good","review":"I would STRONGLY recommend against it based on the current price point.

The Harmony One is newer, has a rechargeable battery, is more ergonomic, and is selling for less.That being said, I have been using my Harmony 659 remote for 5+ years now and have been very happy. It works as advertised and I was able to consolidate many remotes to just one. Over the years the screen isn't working as well, I've found that I've hard to push down hard in the center of it in order to read what the buttons will do.

The \\"soft\\" buttons may be programmed to do anything and you get to pick the label--but I had to find the command to change to all six buttons being usable. The \\"next\\" button lets you get to additional \\"pages\\" of soft buttons in a single mode while each mode has its own set of one or more pages.

It can also help forge emotional connections between them on a daily basis, which can sometimes be a challenging task for fathers. Daddy Hugs is a great book for this purpose, and one which is appropriate for infants as well as young children.The book begins with the arrival of Daddy in his baby's room, and he proceeds to hug his baby with all kinds of hugs numbered from one to ten (\\"eight dancing on daddy's feet cha-cha hugs\\") as they get ready for bed. The large, colorful illustrations will be engaging for both infants and young children, and the text encourages closeness between fathers and kids while also teaching basic counting skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: if you like MESHUGGAH, don't buy this","review":"that's all I can say.I'm a MESHUGGAH fan and I got this out of curiousity-- to see how they are influencing other bands. to say I'm disappointed is an understatement.the problems:- poppy singalong choruses that you don't want to sing along to.- tons of sugary backing vocals that change the target audience to 14 year nu-metal girls.- there are some Meshuggah-influenced parts, but they are ultimately uninteresting, both melodically and rhythmically.- after you've heard Mesh, mnemic guitars sound like wimpy imitations. they're quiet in relation to the drums.- I just don't like the guy's voice.I'm not against Meshuggah-clone bands, I'm very interested in them. especially if they're taking it to a different level. but these guys just water it down and sell it, there's no depth whatsoever.if you dig mnemic that's fine, I'm just saying:don't be suckered by the \\"if-you-like-Meshuggah-you'll-like-mnemic\\" line. you will want your money back like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REALLY IRRITATING BOOK...","review":"...within the text there exist so many arbitrary statements (such as Dr. Ps' belief that he has been chosen by God to lead the world into a scientific era of revelation, that modern science is dogma, ect., ect.) and arbitrary number tricks(that Plichta has stolen from old math-game-books, and claimed authorship of), that Dr. Plichta can be generally considered a fanatic without any merit at all. The mathmatics within, though completely unrelated to the prime number code, are interesting enough to make the reader come back out of no reason more than interest. However, Dr. Ps' negative attitudes towards modern physics and his delusions of being the greatest mind of all time, tend to irritate me. I recomend this book only to extremists who have completely shut the doors of open mindedness toward modern science."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must say I very much desliked this book","review":"It was with the most interest that I started reading Mr Pllichta book, as I am by nature very interested in all controvertial subjects. What I found was a very pompous writer, that just speaks of himself during near 2/3 of the book, boosting about his doings and telling us nothing about the famous secret he says he found!. When he tries to explain us the famous secret, his explanaitions are extremelly confuse and hardly perceptible.Nothing is evident, or clear, and every conclusion seems to me to be forced on the reader.Not a book I will recomend to any friend, neither one I will keep in my Library."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 Dollars Wasted...","review":"I took a chance on this book, picking it up for 3 dollars from the bargain rack at a local bookstore. After leaving the store my friend asked me what I got, I told him, \\"I don't know.. I think I got a para-science book.\\" Obviously I had no idea that there was absolutely NOTHING scientific about this book. I read the first few chapters, and have never read anything that was so full of grandiose claims yet so utterly devoid of substance, all from an author who is unbelievably full of himself. I don't know exactly how book publishing works, but I always assumed people actually read the books before publishing them. After this book, I no longer believe that. There is no way that anyone read this book before it was published, or else it would never have been printed. This is the first book I ever threw in the garbage. But don't let my experience deter you from buying this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Meets the Eye","review":"This is a difficult book; partly because it was written at the request of the publisher as a \\"popular\\" exposition and partly because Plictha is somewhat full of himself. The 3 Volume set, Das Primzahl Kreuz is easier to understand but is only available in German (amazon.de). He is a highly competent chemist and his observations about the two \\"missing\\" elements must be understood before much of his work can be understood. Much of what he puts together in number theory is well known in pieces, but his conclusions are fascinating. I would not recommend the book for someone without a fair grounding in chemistry and number theory, unless it's for casual reading. I would give the 3 volume set 5 stars just for it's attempt to explain the patterns of nature in a comprehensive and interesting way. Whether or not Plichta is correct in all or some of his cosmography is for the reader to decide."},{"rating":"1","title":"amusing junk","review":"Sometimes the ramblings of a man whose ambitions are beyond his talents are nonetheless educational. You will have to be the judge."},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say that hasn't already been said . . .","review":"This book really has only two flaws: 1) The author is extremely full of himself, and 2) The entire book acts as a kind of prelude for some \\"earth-shattering\\" discovery concerning prime numbers - a discovery which the reader is left anticipating after finishing the last paragraph. All that egotistical buildup, but to what end? Don't waste your time on this one. (Not to mention, the silver lettering on the paperback edition rubs off quite easily, my spine looks like God's S____e_ ____ula, even though it spent only one day in my hands)"},{"rating":"1","title":"For God's sake, don't waste your time on this drivel!","review":"This book is nothing more than the ravings of a bitter man who obviously thinks quite a lot of himself. There are two possibilities: 1) Plichta is a genius beyond Einstein and nobody else on the planet is smart enough to see it, or 2) he is a pathetic, average-intelligence man who believes that he has solved all of science where the rest of humanity over all of history has not. I am putting my money on #2. This book is, however, an interesting case-study on how humans can delude themselves into seeing patterns everywhere and in everything when they have no real significance. Plichta takes several numerical examples from physics and biology and attaches all sorts of divine and mystic significance to them. Essentially it is worthless 'numerology', and shows how, in a large enough sampling of items, you can always find the odd example to support your wild claim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter garbage","review":"I read this book about four years ago and still wonder what it was actually about - Joan Miro makes more sense to my mother.

I'm never going to find out what it is by reading this narcissistic rubbish.

This is worse than rejecting inerrency - it is rejecting the NT as a primary source for the first century! Even if Dunn's reinterpretation of Paul were true (which it isn't), he would still have to account for the woes pronnounced by Jesus in Matthew 23. Sounds like legalism to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Community Service","review":"In books like Rich Dad, Poor Dad, the author wrote about returning to society what one has reaped. In this book, Mr. Graham attempts to do it the other way round - almost. Build your brand from the community side. Market yourself as trustworthy and let the word of mouth spreads and presumably good things will come to bear.While the examples were very inspiring, many of them African Americans, the concepts and ideas are not new. One get a sense of deja vu if you have read 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and the likes."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A vital part of ones ongoing journey of success\\"","review":"Stedman Graham does an excellent job writing on a virtually un-noticed aspect of being successful. This book is very reader friendly, and informative. Our life brands should be just as important to us as Coca-Cola is to its makers. It really boils down to standing for what we believe in, and getting ourselves known by as many people as we can. Mr. Graham focuses on public speaking, service work, advertising, etc.. My only qualms about this great book is the authors redundant use of anecdotes. If he would have used less examples and more of his great teaching abilities, I would have surely given this book five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid information, well presented","review":"A friend loaned me his copy of The Coastal Kayaker's Manual, 3rd, and I later bought a used copy from Amazon for my own library. Washburne presents the material very clearly and very concisely, not in-depth, but touching on all the multiple aspects of kayaking. He gives referrals to other authors who offer more detailed discussions of the topics he only touches upon. This book would be a good primer for the beginner who wants a complete overview of what sea kayaking is about from an iconic source for more than 40 years. The latest copyright date on my copy is 1998, but the information and advice Washburne is presenting is timeless, so the publication date doesn't really matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"feels real..","review":"this movie gives you an inside view into what it feels like to live in the germany of today, between old hate and new hope.

This product solves the problem.Tips:- I hold the vessel with one hand and the device with the other, using my thumb to press the button on top.- It sometimes does a more thorough job when the blades are just a little below the surface and a bit off center. Maybe it's incorporating more air. But keep the blades away from the sides and far from the opening.- If the recipe includes more water than oil, a thickening agent may be needed to combat separation.Here's my reduced-fat sodium-free recipe (makes one cup):- 1/4 cup olive oil- 1/4 cup red wine vinegar- 1/2 cup water- 2 tsp Spike salt-free seasoning- 1/4 tsp Xanthan gumAfter emulsifying, the mixture turns light green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 days!","review":"I give it 2 stars because it does mix beautifully but I stop there because the dang thing broke from falling off the first shelf in my refrigerator.

Justine O'Rourke is a lawyer with compassion and humor and the sense that justice should also be fair. Walt Madden has created a team of believable characters in the tradition of beloved shows like Perry Mason, Matlock, and Burke's Law. The dialogue is great and it's not a legal textbook above my understanding. I enjoyed reading the story because I felt like I could be their friend as well as their client. I found the book locally when visiting Washington, D.C. Don't know if it's available everywhere yet, but at least it's on Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laced has something for everyone","review":"Walt Madden's writing style brings the reader in, and then shakes his or her hand.

This story is about a beautiful family and you will really be surprised at the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for the entire family to enjoy","review":"Laced is a wonderful story that blends the best of the legal world, basketball and education. Based on his own life experiences, Lefty Madden's book portrays a cast of characters that many if not all parents would love to see their children become in their adult life.

I returned it hoping to get a good copy of this wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Brother' is a Gem","review":"'Brother From Another Planet' is a gem of a movie from director John Sayles. Yes, it's low-budget (typical Sayles), and yes it sounds like b-grade science-fiction at first (alien lands on Earth, pursued by other aliens), but it's so much more than that. First off, the alien (played by Joe Morton, who does not utter a word througout the movie) is black and, luckily, lands in Harlem. Slowly but surely, he finds a way to not only make a living (by fixing electronics), but also manages to help out those who live around him. No offense meant to Mr. Morton, but this is probably his best performance to date.Meanwhile, he's pursued by the two other aliens, who are white (one of whom is played by Sayles himself), and have their own interactions with the Harlem community.In this little, very underplayed film, Sayles manages to say a lot about community, race, charity and mankind itself. Endnote: Keep your eye out for the 'eye out' scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is one of my favorite films of all time. Like many really good Sci Fi tales, it is ultimately a very human story. I love so many of the scenes - the character interactions in the bar scenes are great. And Joe Morton is terrific.They didn't have much budget for this and there are obvious clumsy mistakes in the movie. Some of the mistakes are even pointed out in the director's comments, but it just adds to the enjoyment. (But my DVD copy is just fine. I don't understand the quality complaints in other reviews here.)For all the rough spots, I don't miss the million dollar effects one bit. Effects might even push the story aside too much. This DVD will always have an honored place on my shelf and I will enjoy this many more times. (And I could never say the same for Matrix Revolutions, for example.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"No special effects required","review":"This was the first John Sayles movie that I experienced, I am now a rock hard fan of his.

This was Clavell's first international success, and it drew on the author's personal experience as a prisoner of war.Beautifully rendered, the film presents the humanity and inhumanity of people placed in extaordinary circumstances, and the spirit of survival inherent in us all.You simply don't want to miss all the insights into human nature the film brings to its audience.

A brutal depiction about a Japanese concenttration camp and the way the British and North American soldiers confined in this prison have to deal with the everyday existence.Many bet for evassion, but what really counts is the central character of an opportunist, unscrupulous and selfish soldier portayed by George Segal in a stand-out performance that it might well regarded as the best of his lifetime confronted against another vision of the world given by the British soldier James Fox. From this clash will emerge a solid friendship among both of them.An epic, courageous and bravery film that must be seen. This is my top choice, between my five cult war movies of this decade (The Longest day, Dirty dozen, The Blue Angels and The Hill.)Acquire it and watch it. You will be rewarding over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yasmin as a modern day witch!","review":"I was watching a show on the town of Salem, and there are actually modern day witches there!

I wish the \\"Bad Company and Led Zeppelin\\" sound could go on forever with new material offered every couple years but that wasn't meant to be. Thank God for Pink Floyd and Jethro Tull.

He is of royal stature because;1) He was a tremendous guitar player;2) He was a terrific song writer and3) He was a great arranger, musician, producer, and perfectionist.This 80's, overproduced, fluff is way below Jimmy Page.At the same time, while I respect Paul Rodgers, he's nothing unless he's singing quality material. He was a great fit with Bad Company but he's lost outside of that well-suited-for- him bandIt sounded like The Firm could be a super group but Paul Rodgers cannot step in the shoes of Robert Plant.

This is one more; the author severs \\"psyche\\" from \\"spirit,\\" then has trouble placing Jung and Grof and many others clearly writing about \\"both,\\" or rather, refusing to make this separation. A more basic problem for scholars in religion, psychology and cultural studies is the author's wanting to have his cake- an intrinsic, essential, trans-cultural core of \\"spirituality\\" that is more primordial than any religion - and eat it too, by incorporating specific cultural/religious constructs into his definition of the above. Frustrating, and the charts and diagrams to not help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effort, but not for amateurs","review":"Good effort , but not for amateurs.

They have a historical edge to them, but these are simply great stories. South of Deadwood involves a mission in which Chick Boadry must escort a prisoner, Curly Star, who is the leader of an outlaw gang, from Deadwood South Dakota to Texas. One of the gang members' sister also travels to Deadwood to plead with Star to testify that her brother, alledegly a member of the gang, was not a member of that gang. She has a low opinion of Chick and fears he would kill Star before he can tesitfy on her brother's behalf. She discovers that Boadry is a kind and gentle man and that Star is also someone with an unexpected personality. The trip back to Texas exposes the reader to western lore and a classic, honor bound ending.

Not since The Hobbit did I enjoy a fantasy book so much. The story is compelling and real, drawing you into it and bringing the world to life. You can feel the struggles of the characters and understand them on a deep and personal level. The horrors they face make you shiver with fear and cheer when they triumph. I have always been an avid reader and I place this book among my top 10 favorite books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is full of action, loyalty, sacrifice and character development.

But I found the book to be lacking, maybe it was after the RA Salvatore into for it that left me wanting. I found the characters shallow, very lacking in depth. The plot good, yes, but the rate of killing the NPCs...that gets a little old than just the masses of enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice attempt at a novel","review":"As has been mentioned, Niles does have some good characters. The plot is also somewhat intriguing...but his poor writing skills leave the reader with the strong stench of melodramatic cheese. Poor sentence structure (\\"The wolves stormed the northmen. For they had come to destroy.\\" For Niles was a bad writer.) is all too prevalent in the book, and Niles amateurishly reveals the entire plot with his poor use of foreshadowing. His vocabulary includes some interesting words, but is limited in its breadth; thus one gets the feeling that they are reading the same paragraph over and over. Tristan, Robyn, and Darryth deserved better than Doug Niles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cappella's world","review":"Hhhmm, great song, fine textures. A must to hear and to have this cd-single.

They are distinctly different.I have been enthusiastic about Robbie Fanning's sewing books since the first, 1980, edition. Be sure and look up her books on machine embroidery--they're also the best and pre-date the 'lazy' method of embroidery by computer machine.As the Fannings illustrate in these books, anyone can machine quilt. There are few fancy color photos and many showing basic techniques, along with countless line drawings. The strongest reason for purchasing either edition of this book is the obvious enthusiasm that Robbie Fanning communicates through her writing. I haven't seen this style in any other machine books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth adding to your quilting library!","review":"I love the down to earth writing style of this author. I purchased this book after finding an old version of this book at a yard sale. New versions of a book can sometimes be a disappointment but that certainly is NOT the case here.Like most quilters, I have far too many quilting books. I decided to only purchase new books that really WOW me, this book is one of those.

This is the first book that I fully endorse and the only one I use in my beginning sewing classes. Every level of seamstress, from beginner to very advanced needs to have a copy of this book in their homes. All instructions are very clearly written, the pictures are beautifully done and the information is correct. If you are new to sewing you need this book to help you figure out how to start. If you've been sewing for years, you need this book as a quick reference. This book is \\"Simply the Best\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good as far as it goes...","review":"This book was widely anticipated and loaded with high expectations among the 124 (E-class chassis) community. I pre-ordered a copy months in advance. Why? The factory shop manual on CD is very difficult to use. A Haynes manual is only published in Europe, and covers only European models. This means there is effectively no aftermarket shop manual for these cars, where many other MB models have one available. I think we were all expecting a \\"Bentley Grade\\" shop manual (and all that this entails), like the stellar ones produced for BMWs and Audis. What we got was essentially an enhanced owner's manual, or a buyer's guide.If you just bought a 124, this book makes for a good orientation.If you are considering buying a 124, this is an excellent buyer's guide.If you want to actually fix something yourself, forget it!The Haynes manual from the UK is still the best bet for an aftermarket workshop manual. (ISBN: 1859602533)Anything really serious requires the factory CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"E-Class Owner's Bible - Disappointing","review":"Maybe I was expecting too much.This IS NOT a repair manual. It covers very basic, mundane areas like oil change. The coolant change procedure is incomplete and many maint. areas were not covered at all. The guide on buying one of these cars is nothing more than common sense.If you're looking for repair info, buy the MB CD-Rom and join one of the MB web lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a repair manual","review":"Read the other reviews...as a repair manual, this book is practically worthless.After relying on Bentley's BMW 5 series guide for 3 years, I was shocked. This is a coffee table book. Bathroom reading. What the owner's manual would look like if the glovebox were bigger.If you want to know how to remove the shift knob, how to get the sparkplug wires in the holder, or how much to torque the distributor cap, look elsewhere.It does have a chart describing all the available paint colors, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful maintenance info","review":"I think this book would have been better received if it wasn't labelled \\"Owner's Bible\\". This has raised expectations that weren't met.The review on the cover of the book describes the contents accurately - its intended to help prospective owners purchase a vehicle, and owners to perform routine maintenance. It does both of these things very well. A third objective was to make the owner better able to discuss complex service issues with their service facility.If you want to rebuild the transmission, this is the wrong book. If you want information on making a purchase, performing maintenance, trouble shooting common problems, and insight into complex repairs this is a great book. Enjoyable to read, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty useless for the average owner","review":"I have a 1989 300TE and had bought this book quite a few years back for reference information if anything went amiss in my car. It turns out the book recycles a lot of technical information about the car and its various systems (engine, electrical, lubrication, etc., available probably through the user's manual or books on the history of the Benz). There is little useful information or tips beyond that. My engine started overheating about 2 years ago and there is no information in the book on what the reasons may be and what steps to take. I also had my suspension changed recently, but it still feels a little rough; the book has no information of any reason why this is so, and what places to check.The scope of the book seems to be aimed at the professional mechanic, but the level of details is very skimpy. If you are a weekend do-it-yourself and want to do your own maintenance on your Benz, this \\"bible\\" would be a very uninformative and incomplete guide indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs a book like this?","review":"If you consider fixing your car yourself, this book is not going to help you. Well, I should have known... it covers the 6-cylinder, 8-cylinder and the diesel engine, which means that the book would have to be at least 3 times as thick to be any good. So if you are curious to know how things work in your car, but plan on having your repairs done at a shop, this book is great. But then, why would you even bother reading about it? I still wonder who could get any use out of this book... Any ideas?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Manual. Not the be all end all","review":"I'd recommend this manual for a shade tree mechanic (home DIYer). If you need to save a few dollars on Maintence cost this is a good manual to have.It covers the standard stuff (Routine Maintenance, Brakes, Filter changes (Oil, Transmission, Air, Fuel). Has lots of pictures which are nice. The manual is broken down 12 Sections, Intro, Buying, Maintenance, 6-Cyl Engines, V-8 Engines, Diesel Engines, Fuel Injection, Transmissions, Suspensions Brakes Steering, Body, Electrical, and Performance and Mods.It not a shop manual, but it's a lot more than the owners manual that you'd find in the glove box.Overall I'm not disappointed but wouldn't solely depend on this manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expansive and profound","review":"Where else can you find a book that is simultaneously a cross-cultural survey on the myth and philosophy of the afterlife and a strange adventure tale about a man's gradual introduction to the strange customs of the other side? Well written, philosophically rigorous, and very entertaining, this book will definitely influence your world view if you approach it with an open spirit.My only qualms were that Leland sometimes hedges his bets too much in making his arguments appeal to scientifically-minded people who probably won't be interested in the book to begin with, and that the important concept of the \\"cosmic normative balance\\" isn't explained in enough depth when it is first introduced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a learn on the go program","review":"I finished the Pimsileur Spanish II, and got this course for further study rather than Pimsileur Spanish III . I had hoped that this course would be like the Pimsileur course, namely that I could just listen to it in the car on the way to work. However, I found out that the tapes really need to be used with the book. Many of the recordings seem to be old, and sometimes are difficult to hear with the background noise in my car (Pimsileur was much easier). While the information was certainly complete, this course required much more effort to learn than the Pimsileur, and was not nearly so fun. I do think it helped me learn more Spanish, which was the ultimate goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A load of rubbish","review":"A book that condemns abortion without managing to incorporate a single fact.

Christian families would not want their young children seeing this movie. It does have a very dark side to it. If you like Bleak House, you'll like this one. Much shorter though. My family has watched this movie several times since we purchased it. Very interesting and intriguing story line. Definitely wanted to see the ending, and did not expect the ending! I don't know how this compares to the book, we have never read it. But it is one of our favorite movies. We have lots of friends that like movies from this time period, and they have all watched this one and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"This is a lazy, monotonous production of a Charles Dickens novel that has captivated and frustrated reading audiences for over 100 years. Our fascination with the novel, albeit an unintended fascination due to his death while writing it, is that each reader can imagine how Dickens would have continued the story. We all get to ponder whether Jasper killed Edwin Drood or just thought he did. This Masterpiece production should have focused on the unfinished, yet still substantial novel; should have given more time to the memorable minor characters; and should have allowed the viewers to decide where the story should go. Instead, an unaccomplished script writer, Gywneth Hughes, ineptly chooses an ending that she thinks would be appropriate and rushes the viewers through to the end. The second half of the Masterpiece production by Ms. Hughes overplays the gothic motif to the point of absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly bastardized","review":"The sets were good and the actors did the best they could, but Dickens' story was truly bastardized -- along with most of the cast! It started to get comical -- who would be revealed next as a bastard?And blaming poor Mrs. Crisparkle for Jasper's addiction was unfair to a delightful character.And not only did they provide a very mingy ring to represent Edwin's mother's ring, they changed the story and he gave it to Rosa!I could go on and on, but this production was really a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks everything","review":"I could not bring myself to finish watching this piece. Acting was unimpressive-the story line was very disjointed. Did not grab my attention in any way! Big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"I never cared about the money.\\"","review":"That line from this production given to John Jasper near the end of the film sums up just how dreadful this \\"completion\\" of the unfinished Dickens novel is. Ridiculous soap opera conclusion tacked on to the story ruins an otherwise excellent production. I loved the acting, the visuals, and the first half of the film. The final thirty minutes or so make it all a bad joke, and I felt like a fool watching it until I turned it off five or ten minute before it ended. I was in Rochester last year and watched them film some of the scenes done in the cathedral graveyard which is immediately adjacent to the cathedral, so was hoping that I would enjoy the film. It's better to watch the film without the contrived ending, just as Dickens left his story - unfinished. Sorry.

The 688 easily switches from the TV input to the DVD input, but when you want to switch back to the TV it seems to have trouble going directly back to Component 3 from Component 1. Instead it goes to the VCR input, and requires manual manipulation (I use my dedicated tv controller) to select the correct input.

My biggest problem with this book is that I feel it wasn't a closed chapter. I was left wanting to know more about the fate of Josef Nana Njike's surviving children and grandchildren after they escaped from Cameroon. The Njike descendants could technically carry on for eternity. Did they return to Cameroon after the bloody insurrection or after multi-party democracy was introduced in 1990? I was also intrigued by the fact that the author used the German spelling of Kamerun throughout the story.

But overall a hugely entertaining read and one of my favorite African novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disciples of Fortune opened my eyes","review":"What I like about this story about Africa by Janvier Tisi is its historical significance, larger than life characters, and sweeping scenarios.

They fit and look great and are very stylish. I highly recommend them to anyone looking for a nice pair of slacks. My only compliant (not the jean's fault, of course) is that due to my weight and body shape, the side pockets are not as cavernous as they could've been. Losing a few pounds, of course, would be good for me and it'll make these jeans fit and feel even better. So, overall, the jeans are extremely nice and I'll be purchasing a second pair soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"My son loved his new jeans. It's hard to find nice Levi jeans in the size 18 slim. They are a bit big in the waist yet, but nothing that will fall down without a belt. I'm hoping they will shrink a little when I wash them.

However, be aware that the third novel in the book is pornographic. You may want to consider paying extra to buy Lonesome Dove all by itself. It's a good book. One of the best novels ever written. It's just that for some reason McMurtry got his start in writing by writing about sex.

YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE"},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make movies like this anymore","review":"It was so refreshing to see a masterpiece of storytelling transferred to a brilliant film. The special features with directors et al was very enlightening into the integrity and balance of the film. I never thought about the great acting I kept thinking of them as real people and felt like I was a fly on the wall of this incredible and terrible series of events in the life of Serpico.I think that is the key - if your not reminded of their acting ability because you are so involved in the story it has to be great.Pacino was totally believable and authentic in this role and I personally find this my favourite role for him. So to wrap up the waffling all I can really say is regardless of the fact this film is 30yrs old (approx), it stands with precious few as remaining a brilliant and topically relevant film. Bloody fabulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia for the Good Guys","review":"I came of age with this movie. Learned to trust myself being the only good guy (even \\"saint\\") among the many bad guys. Pacino may be remembered by many as the cool-head, cold-blooded gangster of Godfather series, but as Serpico he remains my hero as the uncompromising, opera-loving, ballet-dancing, intellectual (also womanizer) who \\"fixed\\" the corrupt system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"As a criminal justice & law student with many friends in law enforcement, and some of them with the NYPD, I found this movie amazing. It was pretty realistic, and kept with what really happened in real life pretty well. However, Frank Serpico never got handed his gold detective shield while lying in the bed at the hospital after he got shot. He actually just went into a police precinct and picked it up from a surly desk officer. Besides that, it was a great movie, and it's one of the movies I own that I'll definitely be watching more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serpico","review":"What Al Pacino does in this movie as in any other is great, Serpico while looking like some smelly hippie is one cool cat minus the ballet,he's a good cop in a force full of dirty ones. I love this movie,time to bust criminals!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired by true events.","review":"This story was inspired by true events and tells a heroic tale of a police officer who refused to give in to the corrupt practice of taking bribes. Serpico just wants to be a good cop and do his job well, but this is difficult when you have to watch over your shoulder for a bullet that might be coming from one of your fellow officers. There's also a great book by the same name, so don't just watch the movie. Great story!Chrissy K. McVay - Author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"It is rare to find a film as good as the book upon which it was based, but \\"Serpico\\" is just that. The screenplay is an excellent adaptation of Peter Maas' outstanding book. Al Pacino shines in the title role, one of his best ever. This film is gritty, hard-hitting, and thoroughly entertaining, and as the viewer from Atlanta noted, the soundtrack is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie that put Al Pacino on the map","review":"Of all the films that Al was nominated for and never won, he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for Serpico. One of the most realisticNYC cop films of the early 70s because of it's grittiness and locations (Check out the old Yankee Stadium in the background when the cops confront Serpico). The music by the Greek musical director will stay with you long after you watch this classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Al Pacino home town","review":"it's the city as it was. before there was a Starbucks on every corner. with Al Pacino early in his career giving a performance all he's got. I had forgotten about this movie but I saw a news item with the real Serpico in it then I went to Amazon to order. the story shows how bad corruption can get and how we should be glad for people like Serpico who had the guts to speak out."},{"rating":"1","title":"dated","review":"I bought this dvd based on the reviews I read, well let me tell ya, this movie is very dated. The direction is very poor. Time in this movie moves very fast, the only way you can tell that a year has passed is by the length of Pacino's beard or the growth of his dog. The story is boringly (is that a word?) told. It would make a great re-make done by a better director. Maybe in the 70's this was cutting edge, but I found it as interesting as an episode of Matlock. Now with that said, Al Pacino is the bright spot in this black hole of a movie, his acting is the only reason I could stay awake. So if your an Al Pacino fan....and you have to own all of his movies then and only then get it, but if you just want to watch it once to see a great preformance by Al, RENT IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pachino was the only character","review":"On first viewing this film I did find myself plunged into a mass of confusion. Ok, so I'm not the brightest of people but I am good with my films. The problem with this film for me was the weakness of the other characters. Serpico was the only person we were truly aquianted with. This made it difficult, for me anyway, to get into the film. I had no emotional attachments. The story line was bland and too realistic. If i wanted to watch real life I would sit in Safeway all day. This is not what I would like to see at the cinema. If I wasn't studying it for media I would never have stuck out the whole film. However, I don't have the best attention span."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie was not what I expected from Al Pacino","review":"I am a fan of many Al Pacino movies including all the Godfather's, Carlito's way, Scareface, Heat, and others. I expected this movie to match the caliber of those movies but was greatly disappointed. The movie lacks a lot of action and is extremely predictable. To me it was extremely boring, with the main focus of the movie dealing on police corruption. Sure it was corrupt back then but so are so many other organizations and businesses, I really do not think it was necessary to make a movie out of something that lacks exciting material, maybe the movie would of been much better as a documentary rather than a feature film that really has very little content. The movie dragged on and on and could of been summarized in 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it !","review":"Hi..Let me start by saying to those who haven't seen this movie yet: Just avoid it, and don't be fooled by all those positive reviews.I was fooled by the posiitve reviews in here, and i thought a movie with Pacino must be as good as these reviews, well, its not.I can understand that people who saw it back then (70s) must've found it a great movie, and im sure it was. But we have entered a new mellinnium, and this movie cannot compete with today's modern movies.Don't get me wrong, cause i like alot of 70s movie, but this just is'nt one of the good ones.This movie has aged, it had a poor plot, a poor editing, it had multiple characters with no goal, and a boring plot line.The only good thing is Pacino's acting, he was good as usual, but even his acting could'nt save this movie from sinking.I gave one star only for Pacino's acting, but for the rest, well a fat Zero. Take my advice and avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to wonderful","review":"I did'nt like this one to much. Al Pacino's character is ok.

I've vacuumed twice tonight and finally took away the bottle and sand and told her she had to play with just the dolls. Maybe an older child would get more out of it. I disagree that it would teach a child responsibility for cleaning up after a real cat. You can't control when a real cat pees, and real cat pee has a smell. Perhaps if the sand was stinky, then it would be the MOST obnoxious toy on the market right now.The doll is nice though.

The laundary bag was a pleasant surprise also"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet and Sour","review":"I bought this book because of its reported resemblance to the Parker novels of Richard Stark. In reality Vachss' hero, Burke [those acquainted with Cockney rhyming slang will prefer the spelling Berk] is a million miles from the formidable, self-sufficient Parker. He is entirely dependent on an unbelievably politically correct group of people who display a dog-like devotion to the egregious hero. Members of the ethnic minorities thus patronised will be irritated by this device. As far as I know there is not yet a collective noun for such a group so let me suggest the coinage \\"luvvies\\" which is current in London for disgusting media folk.The author misses his target which is the excellent hardboiled American detective style by such a wide margin as to have his book sink in a morass of glutinous sentimentality."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Burke I've enjoyed in a while","review":"I respect the heck out of Andrew Vachss' ideas and his issues, but those things are not why I read mystery novels. I loved the first few books in the Burke series-- found them taut and edgy, dark and smart. Lately though I had the feeling that the medium had gotten lost in the message and I'd found the books harder and harder to read._Dead and Gone_ takes Burke in a new direction and takes a little bit of the crusading hero out of my favorite anti-hero. The death of Pansy and his new face force him in a new direction and into the reach of new characters in a different part of the country. I liked the character of Gem (even if I'm a little jealous of every other woman in Burke's life :)) and I found Burke a lot more interesting this time around.It isn't perfect, and the plot ends up feeling a bit contrived, particularly at the end. But the mood is pretty close to right on, and that's what I read Vachss' novels for anyhow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great \\"Burke\\" novel!","review":"Vachss' great anti-hero Burke returns in this latest adventure. While the book may cause some confusion for readers who haven't read all the Burke novels, for die-hard fans there are plenty of \\"inside\\" references to Burke's earlier escapades. As always Vachss provides a gritty, hard-nosed and unflinching look at the evil that men create, and allows Burke to use his less than legal approach to try and set things right. A worthy installment in the continuing saga of Burke.

The Playtex Bottles with the liners are said to be ok, though the hard plastic shell of the bottle is made using Bisphenol-A, the plastic liner that touches the baby's milk is not!

The major problem with them is that you have to mix the formula in a regular bottle because it will ooze out through those vent air holes. Then the formula is all bubbly so you have to let it sit for a bit and then you can finally feed the baby.The only advantage is that it helps you feed the baby in a more upright position because of how the bottle is titled.I highly recommend regular gerber bottles. They are much cheaper and way better!!! That is what my mom used with me and the formula flows out nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"you need a super sucker for these!","review":"My foster baby went through many kids of bottles as he was very anti-eating.

I couldn't get ANYTHING! I know someone who use them and she said you have to be careful because many of them don't work~ she had to keep taking them back and exchanging them until she got a few that did work. Well that is more than I care to do. One of my 6 worked properly and once I put it through the dishwasher it was no good. I threw them all in the trash because I didn't want any other baby to have to scream and cry out of frustration by being teased by a bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems with these!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I was looking forward to these bottles and what a disappointment!!! First of all you can't use them in a bottle warmer so you have to warm up the formula by other means and then put formula back into bottle. Second of all they do leak!!!!!! I have followed instructions to the T- making sure all the parts are dry and making sure vent is in properly and without fail twice a day I am cleaning the top shelf to my fridge from formula running everywhere. Too many parts to worry about. A new mom just has enough to worry about without fighting with these constantly for one reason or another. I am returning two other packages of these I have and going back to the Gerber bottles I had when my daughter was little. The fact that the bottoms come off of these opens up the risk of a host of other problems. I would not recommend these bottles to anyone.

The bottle claims to hold 9 ounces, but you cannot fit 8 oz of water plus the formula into the bottle. Unless you mix your formula in another container, these are useless for a baby drinking more than 6 ounces. The bottles occasionally leak...but that's not the major issue.

How is a little baby supposed to? I thought maybe the nipples were defective so I poked a bigger hole in the. Big mistake. The bottle didn't work at all and bubbled really bad. I tried to go to size 2 nipples to solve the problem and they flowed to fast. Also if you plan on filling a bottle and taking it somewhere they leak out of the bottom terribly.

When I would warm them in a glass of water, it was impossible to get them completely dry at the bottom, and the water would leak all over the baby. They were hard to clean. The nipples were also awful. My son would suck like crazy and get very little liquid out of them.

The shape is great and seemed like it would make feeding easier... we are about to take a long road trip and wanted an angled bottle that would make it easier to feed our son in his car seat if we didn't have a safe place to pull over. We have, unfortunately, been very disappointed. The Stage 1 nipple is too slow for our 14-week-old. The Stage 2 nipple is way too fast. The nipple collapses easily and the bottle leaks frequently. Also, the size, shape, and flow of the nipple would make it very difficult to switch between breastfeeding and bottle.

As many others said it takes time for your baby to adjust to the nipples but I don't recommend using the stage 1 nipple. It needs to have a bigger opening for a faster flow. Also a few times the nipple collapsed and then I had to take apart the bottle and stretch the vent. These bottles definitely require a lot of work.

They recommended Dr. Brown's and so I rushed out to buy them. They have been a miracle. My son is now eating his full amount of formula in 1/4 of the time it was taking with the other bottles.

When you have a newborn baby and you're trying to feed him/her every three hours, these problems should not be occuring!! A problem with a bottle should not even exist! I never even thought to look at the reviews before I bought them because who would have thought a bottle would be a problem! My baby would get so tired from me messing with these bottles trying to get them to work that she'd fall asleep before finishing her feeding, which would then mess up her whole sleep/eating schedule.

The fast flow nipple was so fast she would choke. There is not a happy medium. You can't make the hole bigger in the slow flow nipple because it is silicone and will tear and boiling doesn't make the fast flow hole smaller.The bottles have 5 pieces and are a pain to clean. Also, you cannot use a bottle warmer to heat them up because of the silicone bottom piece.We did have a couple of leaks, but this was because the bottles were not assembled properly...another downfall of having 5 pieces!!!We ended up using the playtex disposables and have not had one problem.

We tried several other bottles, and these were the only ones that didnt give her gas or cause her to chock/throw up. Dispite other reviews saying they are hard to put together and leak, we found the opposite -- especially compared to other bottles such as advent or the ones w/drop in liners. I would suggest a practice run in putting the bottle together so you are not fumbling when your infant is needing to be feed immediately. Cleaning is not difficult - just make sure to have a few extra bottles on hand that are already cleaned and assembled, incase you need an emergency feeding. We are currently expecting twins and will definately use these bottles with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very complicated and expensive","review":"I bought this system for my son because I was looking for a very low flow nipple to help prevent his gas. The primary problem with this system is the vent: 1) As a sleep-deprived parent, the simpler the better. I in a sleep-deprived haze have forgotten to put the vent in when assembling the bottle and have gotten formula everywhere as a result; 2) the vent and the bottom piece assembly must be very dry when assembled (so you have to dry everything with a paper towel before assembling because even a dishwasher with a dry cycle doesn't make them dry) or they leak--and you get formula everywhere; 3) you can't buy replacement vents anyhwhere except from Playtex. This is a problem since the vents will fall out of many dishwasher baskets and 4) You can't use an electric bottle warmer to heat the bottles. All in all, the Dr. Brown's system is better. This system isn't worth the expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!","review":"I bought 8 of these bottles for my daughter before she was born, and received 3 more as gifts.

I called the company to make a complaint, and to see if I could get replacements .. but nope, they said I would have to ODRER and PAY FOR replacements. I'm sorry, but if the product is that faulty, no one should have to pay to fix their mistakes. Oh, and if you have to feed your kid one of the thicker formulas .. it barely flows out of the stage 1 nipples, and comes out of the stage 2 nipples so fast that my daughter practically chokes.

I never used other bottles besides Dr. Browns so these could be excellent...BUT I found Dr. Browns work a lot better, are less likely to break and are around the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I agree with everyone else. The stage 1 nipple is too slow and the Stage 2 is too fast so you are left at 3am with a baby who gets frustrated because they are sucking so hard on a stage 1 that it collapses, then you have to unscrew the bottom, only to find yourself and everything around you covered in formula. I've been alot happier with the Avent bottles. There are just too many things that can go wrong with these bottles that most moms don't have time to troubleshoot. If it's not the collapsing Stage 1 nipple, then it's a leaky disk that ruins your clothes and furniture. Very disappointing product from playtex."},{"rating":"1","title":"great concept, poor delivery","review":"I've found the other reviews true, the nipples just didn't work for my baby. There was no milk flow. So, I switched to the playtex disposables & they work great. So, when playtex came out w/ the ventaire naturals (9oz), reluctantly I tried those, & surprisely they work great. I'm not sure if they improved the nipples, or if the milk flows well because it's a stage 2 nipple.Either way they work fine. It is good they the bottom comes off for easy cleaning. I will say I have 2 friends that love this bottle, & it's all they've used it's always worked well for them.So, you may just want to buy the single bottle, if you're buying it yourself, so you won't waste alot of money if it doesn't work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical, unlike Dr. Brown's!","review":"My baby and I love these bottles. Initially the nipple's flow was very slow but I pierced a bigger openning and they work wonderfully.

However, the Playtex Vent-Air work wonders and are so easy to clean. Just open the bottom for easy washing, leave them in hot soapy water for 15-20min.(as recommended by our pediatrician)and the sterilization process is completed. Very practical. We don't have to boil any bottles or deal with any leaks. I highly recommend them!I highly recommend these."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THESE","review":"Do not buy these bottles, or even put them on your registry. My son, who is now three months, still can't use these. Every time we try, the nipple collapses, so you have to unscrew the top or bottom four or five times in one 4-ounce feeding.

They're super!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"Our first feeding with the Ventaire was a solid hour of nothing. No formula got to the baby. We called and got information not included with the set. We made the adjustments and still my 1 wk old got nothing even though sucking with all her might. Another reviewer mentioned that it took two weeks for her newborn to learn to suck differently. The customer service from Playtex said to only allow the baby to suck on the tip. What?!! Baby's don't naturally do that. ...As for me, Ventaire was a waste and I am going back to the bottles that work."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like this bottle","review":"I never felt like this bottle was sterile. I could scrub every other part of the bottle but the bottom vent part always seemed like there was \\"something\\" in it. I had great success with the Avent bottle and the Playtex bottle after I quit breastfeeding. I only had one Avent bottle that leaked and the company replaced it for me.I don't recommend this product. Once the bottle is disassembled and clean and sterile it isn't so easy to reassemble and like another review, it has to be all dry. It seemed too cumbersome to put all the pieces together especially when I had a crying baby. Often we both got soaked because the bottom wasn't quite right. It does seem like a good idea but I wasn't pleased with the actual function.

So I tried Ventaire and the expirience was better. Not just because the bottle had fewer bubbles, because may baby could drink without making a mess of himself as it was with avent bottles.If your baby is taking a lot of bubbles I suggest you to try Ventaire, buy a single bottle to try but you will be pleased that you'll come back and buy this kit, as I did.

No gas no spitting up. I plan on using these bottles for my new little boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad for our baby","review":"These couldn't be heated with a bottle warmer, leaked, were hard to get suction going, caught so much air that the milk looked like it was cappicino froth, and our baby had so much gas with them. She would get frustrated trying to eat because it took so long. Now with the Dr. Brown bottles she eats faster and has much less gas. Plus you can see there is no froth. We are much happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice new moms!!!!","review":"These bottles work no differently than plain old fashioned Gerber bottles. IF YOU ARE A NEW MOM DO NOT GET THESE. You have enough to worry about. You don't need to be worrying about putting these bottles together... they DO leak at the bottom if you don't assemble just right! Also the nipples ARE impossible to get formula from. I have been using gerber nipples instead and the bottles work just fine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bottles","review":"These are the worst bottles I've used yet. I am a new mother and the last thing I needed was to hassle with a bottle. These are supposed to reduce air and they let just as much air in as regular bottles, that is when you can even get anything to come out of the nipple! Playtex wanted me to try to squeeze the nipple as if I hadn't already tried that! Nothing I tried worked, we still couldn't get formula out of the bottle. The other problem was sterilizing, you're not supposed to boil the bottle, I have no dishwasher and the instructions say not to steam the bottle either! So what are you supposed to do to sterilize them? These bottles have too many parts to deal with, I'm through and sending them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bottles I found","review":"I used the playtex bottles with liners for my daughter when she was really little (0-3mos)but buying new liners all the time and having to squeeze the air out while she was screaming to eat was frustrating. I found these bottles and got one mostly because I wanted to know how they worked. I tried them and they were great, no air bubbles so no tummy ache for my daughter. I also liked that the nipples seal so they don't leak when you're travelling. The only problem I had was that the nipples wore out more quickly than other ones and I had trouble finding replacements. I'll definatly use these for my second child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Wouldn't Take","review":"My newborn wouldn't take this bottle. I was pumping and trying to feed out of the bottle so I could go out, and he just wouldn't take it. The nipple is a terrible design, nothing like my nipple. It is very hard and a unatural design. I bought the medela brand instead, which he took right away. I would not recommend this bottle to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"clean up","review":"These bottles were only ok for my 4 month old son. I don't know that I noticed a big enough change in him spitting up to make it worth it. There is to many little pieces to take apart and clean after each feeding, it takes enough time to clean normal bottles!!! I suggest if your baby is formula fed to use ENFAMIL LIPIL AR. This has reduced his spit up fits by at least 60%"},{"rating":"1","title":"mom of twins","review":"these bottles are not worth the money.. they are so complicated to put together and they always leak. my daughter could not drink one bottle without spilling the formula out of the sides. please think about using another bottle, I suggest dr browns , i threw away all my ventaire once i purchased the dr browns bottles > they are definitely the best on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bottle Ever!!!1","review":"This bottle is great I used it for my son when he was first born and he never got stomach aches. Now I am pregnant with my second baby and I am going to use the same bottles. I never had troble keeping them clean and they are easy to put back together. I would deffently recommend these bottles for years to come. Also my friend just had a baby and she was using the Avent and she also switched to Vent Air bottles because her baby kept getting tummy aches from the Avent. All I can say is you be the judge of the great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier on the tummy!","review":"My daughter had cholic for the first three months. Gas drops helped, but when we switched to the Playtex VentAire bottles she had a much easier time. Cholic won't be cured by gas drops, bottles or anything else, but these VentAire bottles were much easier on her tummy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE BOTTLES","review":"We bought these thinking about the gas problem. My son had horrible gas for the first few months. We used these for a few months and finally threw them away. They do not work and its a pain in the butt to put them together for nothing. So we went and got the New Traditions Nursers with the 3 different nipples. The wide nipples keep the air out and I love em. I highly reccomend them. DO NOT BUY THE VENTAIRE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"These bottles were great at first, but later discovered a major flaw. Somehow a vacuum forms at times and my baby is unable to suck milk out of the bottle. I would have to unscrew the bottle every once in a while in order to release pressure. I'm sure this was incredibly frustrating for my hungry baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craptastic Bottles","review":"These bottles are a pain and a waste!! Either they don't allow food to flow at all, or they leak all over you. I found it impossible to get the pieces situated properly - i.e. to get them to work as advertised. This is the last thing you want to be dealing with at 4 am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breast Fed Baby Loved It","review":"After purchasing two other newborn gift sets and trying EVERY nipple I was wondering how long it would be before finding a bottle system that worked. My daughter took the VentAire nipples right away and even fell asleep just like she does when she nurses. Unlike, the Gerber bottles we tried, the VentAire nipples are soft and a bit thinner. The bottles are even compatible with my Pump In Style, so I can pump and prepare bottles at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible. Thank goodness I check to see how much he drinks","review":"I got these for my baby and they were horrible. Nothing was coming out. So what is supposed to reduce air GAVE HIM THE WORSE CASE OF GAS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating feedings","review":"We thought these bottles would make our 4 week old son have less gas. They are attractive and very easy to clean. However, they have been the most irritating bottles I've ever used! The stage 1 nipples come with virtually no hole so you have to poke larger holes in them. Not only that but the nipples collapse. I would have to unscrew the top in the middle of the feeding to release the suction so my son could get some formula out. He seemed to work so hard at trying to eat that he would get tired and fall asleep making it hard to burp him and resulting in him not eating enough. He would then want to eat more a short time later. I eventually threw all of the stage one nipples out and packed the bottles away. Hopefully they will work better when the baby is a little older. If you want a good bottle, buy the Dr. Brown's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated these!","review":"Like many of the other reviewers here I tried these because my son was spitting up a lot. With the Stage 1 nipples he wouldn't get anything out and end up getting so frustrated that he was nearly inconsolable. With the Stage 2 nipples the milk came out so fast that he choked. They need a Stage 1 1/2 nipple. I didn't use them long enough to see if they leaked or not. Very frustrating product. I solved his spitting up problem by using the orthodontic nipple by Medela."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these bottles!","review":"I can't believe everyone is having such problems with these bottles! I love them...they take all the bubbles out of the formula. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND them. I have not had one problem with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts must be dry to work","review":"We have been using these bottles along with the Dr. Brown's bottles with our 3-week-old. Several nights ago she started spitting up a lot and getting fussy while feeding with the Playtex Ventaire. The problem? The bottles weren't venting properly. Because the vent is at the bottom, it needs to be completely dry in order to work, otherwise it will stick and not vent. Our bad for not drying them well enough after washing and before before assembling them, but we decided to switch exclusuvely to the Dr. Brown's because they are also made to vent, but via the tube in the middle. No spit-up or fussiness since we stopped using the Ventaire. Good concept, but requires extra effort on your part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ventaire Bottles","review":"Attempted to feed my three month old daughter with these bottles, it was a very disappointing outcome. It is simply not compatible with my bottle warmer, and my daughter was sucking so hard to get her milk, I thought she was going to starve. The only purpose it served was to make it a more comfortable hold for feeding, and that was about it. Maybe I will try to use these bottle when my daughter is older and wants to have juice or water."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow flow","review":"I received these as a gift and they do keep the gas to a minimum except the nipples keep the milk from flowing at a reasonable rate-- it's either too slow(which takes 45 minutes for my baby to finish or he doesn't finish a bottle at all or they flow so fast that my baby chokes). He now knows when he's being fed with those nipples and cries unless I change the nipple. Luckily, regular nipples work on these bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice for Babies with Reflux...","review":"My 5 week old has Reflux and excess gas only caused more problems for him. We have found that adding cereal to his formula and switching to the Ventaire bottles has helped tremendously. Honestly, the bottles and cereal helped more than the Zantac has.I haven't had any problems with the bottles leaking nor found it terrible inconvenient to wash them. I really like that the nipples don't collapse at all. Before, with regular bottles my son would be half asleep and as soon as he would stop sucking on the bottle to fall to sleep the air going back in to the bottle would scare him and he would wake back up. It's definitely not an issue with the Ventaire bottles.I only have one complaint (which its only a personal preference anyways) I would like if the bottles were packaged in colors for each gender. For example, I'd really rather not give my son a purple bottle. Like I said, that is only a personal preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Our 12 week old became so frustrated while using these bottles because the nipples would constantly collapse. The directions instruct you not to use an electric warmer or sterilizer. With a total of 6 parts per bottle cleaning, warming and sterilizing are completely inconvenient. I'd suggest buying an individual bottle to try it out first. In our case, these bottles weren't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"These bottles are awful. The nipple holes were too small and my son could not get anything out of them. He worked so hard to eat that he fell asleep because he was so tired from sucking and not getting any food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nipples Collapsed after 4 days!","review":"I read about these bottles in a magazine and bought them to use for my newborn daughter. For my first child, I used the Dr. Brown's bottles and loved them; though I did not like washing the extra pieces. Since the concept here was similar and there weren't so many pieces to the bottle, I thought I'd try them. Big mistake! I tried them for 4 days. It took over an hour just to give her a bottle each time with this system. On the fourth day, 4 of the six nipples collapsed! It was ridiculous. A six pound newborn should not be able to do that to any nipple - never mind after only 4 days. Don't waste your money. I went back to the old reliable Dr Brown's bottles. They are the best and I decided that she was more than worth the few extra minutes it required to clean them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collapsing and no flow nipples","review":"I had received and bought many of these playtex bottles before my daughter was born. Lesson, try a bottle and nipple first. I have wasted about $60.00 dollars on these bottles. I have a whole cabinet full and they are not being used. The nipples collapse terrible, I had to pull it out of her mouth every few sips and inflate it, also,a very weak flow. My daughter eats a lot and fast, she could'nt be satisfied with these bottles even when she was a newborn. Very dissapointed and a waste of a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible product!!!!!","review":"I truly should have read the reviews before purchasing these bottles. They are HORRIBLE!! I absolutely agree that the stage 1 nipples are almost impossible for the baby to get any milk. The stage 2 nipple is even worse for a newborn because of the fast flow. Unfortunately there is no in-between. Another problem we experienced is milk leaking out. I'm sure with practice we could eventually figure it out but with caring for a newborn who has the time to try and figure it out? We switched to the gerber bottle set for newborns, works much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I used these bottles for 4 days. They were the worst 4 days I have ever had. It took my daughter 45 min. to eat 1 or 2 ounces. She fussed the whole 4 days. Nothing barely came out of the nipple. I tried the stage 2 nipple thinking she could get more. Well, she did get more but most ended up on her than in her mouth. I had bought so many of these bottles and had to buy new. My husband and I decided to try nursers. Our daughter has been so much happier. She has not fussed since we switched her over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems","review":"I got this set of bottles for my son when he was born, being attracted to the \\"less bubbles\\" slogan it sells. But it actually ended up being more of a hassle than anything else. The nipples would always collapse, which meant you either had to take the bottle out (always good to do to a hungry infant) and release the seal from the top, or try to be coordinated enough to unscrew the bottom portion, while keeping the bottle in the baby's mouth. Not only this, but as time went by, I found that no matter how much I cleaned the bottles, a very fine film seemed to develop. I ended up switching to the playtex nurser system with the disposable liners. Much better: less parts of have to be concerned with keeping clean and less bubbles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute to look at and that's about it!","review":"My mom started buying me these bottles when my son was about four months old because she liked how they looked and the ones we were using were allowing him to swallow too much air. I tried them for awhile, but they quickly grew old with me. They constantly leaked and he swallowed way too much air. He got colic and was very crabby at night time after his feedings. I tossed out these bottles and went out and bought Mr. Brown's bottles instead. Those are a God sent item. I love them and that's all we use. My son, now 6 months old, sleeps all night, hardly ever spits up, isn't colicy anymore and never swallows air. You don't even see air in the milk because of the built in air ventilation tube. They require more cleaning, but your baby will be so much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money.. heres why....","review":"your having a new baby chances are, so why make more work for yourself than you need to? these bottles are junk! i thought they would work well because they have the vent in the bottle.. NO WAY.. they leaked everywhere.. some would, some wouldnt.. then the little plastic piece in the bottle, you have to put it in the bottle right or the bottle will leak. it got all over my son. after the third time trying to feed him with the bottle, i brought them all back and got the avent bottles. those are wonderful, no leaking, just put the nipple on and feed... im glad i brough them back. theres too much cleaning with these bottles, too many parts.. these bottles are almost sure to bug the heck out of you, if not.. lucky you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it...","review":"I did not like these bottles at all. They leak all the time. I followed the directions for use, and they still leak. Also, the Stage 1 nipples flow EXTREMELY slow. I had to make the holes a little bigger so my son would get enough milk. I feel that these are poorly designed. There are definately better options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"I think that the idea of putting holes in the bottom of a bottle is the worst idea! These bottles will leak everywhere! After spending 15 minutes trying to express breast milk this bottle suddenly sprung a leak and the milk when all over the floor. Save yourself clean up time and get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine","review":"So far, I like these bottles just fine. These reusable bottles beat drop-ins any day! My husband and I were a little bummed to see that we should not use an electric bottle warmer with these. I had recieved a warmer that is electric but uses steam to warm the bottles; we did numerous trial runs with these bottles and that warmer and everything was fine. No leaking or anything. Granted, we are still awaiting the arrival of our first born, so we don't know how he'll take to the bottles. That's the reason for the 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these","review":"I bought these bottles for my 6 month old baby. I hate them!

They're a hassle to put together let alone get clean if you sleepily leave any formula or breastmilk in the overnight (and if you're a normal, tired mom, you will). I did notice that he was a little less gassy when he used these bottles, but there really wasn't that much of a difference. I ended up buying a stock of Nuby bottles with medium flow teether nipples and a few Playtex Insulator bottles. If you're going to buy expensive bottles and don't want the hassle, buy Insulator bottles or Avent Vias. Insulators and Avent Vias have the breastfeeder nipples and they make it easier to switch back and forth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like these bottles at all","review":"I agree with all the others out there, the Stage 1 nipple is way too slow! Tried the Stage 2, but the flow was too fast for my baby, she seemed to be choking.

They leaked often and required a lot of work to put together. One wrong move and they either leaked right away or several hours later in the refrigerator.

I was thrilled when I threw them all in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starving Child!","review":"DO NOT BUY THESE BOTTLES!!! Why isn't there a choice for zero stars? I registered for these bottles because they were the cheaper bottle suggested by my lactation consultant (the first choice being Avent). They were awful! My son would scream when I would give him this bottle and I noticed that after quite a bit of sucking, the level of milk was not decreasing. I then tried to suck the milk out myself with no luck! Like some of the other moms, I too used a needle to create a hole (even though it says not to in the directions). This was a temporary fix, although I assume it was at the detriment of it's gas-lowering properties. Guess what I did next?!? I returned those suckers and spent the extra money for the Avent bottles, which my son (now 9 mos) is *still* using with the sippy cup attachment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I thought that the ventair bottles were a great idea to keep the air out of the bottles. I was totally wrong. My daughter could not get anything out of the nipples, which made for a really fussy baby.

I also didn't like how if you don't have the bottom rubber piece in the bottle exactly right, they leak. Making bottles was such a hassle. I ended up giving them away and buying the good \\"old fashioned\\" evenflo bottles. They work great, and no fussy baby!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly surprised","review":"I had purchased a set of these bottles to use on road trips, thinking the angle of the bent-neck bottles would be easier for bottle-feeding my son while he was in his car seat.

I was surprised, though, to find that the nipples kept collapsing every time my son tried to drink, & he would end up getting frustrated every time.

My baby seemed to be spitting up quite a bit, so I thought they would help. I read the instructions and followed them to a T. My baby couldn't get anything out of the bottle, so I tried myself. The baby (or you) have to &quot;bite&quot; the end of the nipple to release fluid. I called Playtex, and they said that to make the nipple work, your baby should only use the tip of the nipple, not the rounded area closest to the bottle.To me, this is a little backwards, since I just spent all this time teaching my newborn not to take just the end of the nipple. I'm not quite sure how you teach a 5-week old baby to &quot;bite!&quot;Needless to say, if your baby has nursed, it may be hard for him to figure these out. I simply use other bottle nipples with the bottles I couldn't return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the Butt!","review":"These bottles really do require a lot of care.

I don't know what the problem is, but we could never get them to work.

I really like these! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Flow and Leaky","review":"My wife and I bought the VentAires when our first child was born. They appeared to be top of the line. They certainly were marketed that way and priced that way. We found the nipple flow to be way too slow and they leaked! No one likes a leaky bottle at 3AM on a December night in New England. It is also difficult to tell if the infant/new born is actually taking the formula. We ended up donating the six VentAires that we bought to a local daycare center and bought EvenFlo bottles, which have been great (and less money). All-in-all, we give this product a POOR grade and state, in our opinion, that they are not worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun to clean or assemble!","review":"I love the fact that my son takes well to these bottles. Unfortunately, they are such a nightmare to wash and assemble.I don't have a dishwasher, so I have to hand wash each piece. I feel like my life revolves around washing, drying and assembling bottles. My son is gassy. He burps often with them, but he feeds well.Beware of the nipple not tightening properly when you screw it on. Many times I have been sprayed by an improperly fitting nipple. Also, it's near impossible to warm this bottle up if you have cold formula. If you place it in water the bottom collects it, only to pour out when it is inverted.I give them 3 stars for my son...I give them 1 star for myself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL BOTTLES","review":"I bought these after my Avent bottles started to leak. At first they were okay, but then my son had trouble feeding from them. The flow was too slow and when I made the whole bigger it was too fast. Also you have to check every new nipple to make sure there is a hole at all! IF you tighten the bottom too much, the baby can't get any milk. Whenever I used these, I kept having to stop my son from eating to make sure he was not just sucking air. Also the nipple collapes ALL THE TIME. Try the Playtex Premium Nurser. It works much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hated!","review":"I brought my newborn daughter home from the hospital yesterday excited to use my new VentAire bottles instead of the little disposable similac bottles that they give you at the hospital. BIG MISTAKE! She struggled with the nipples hardly getting anything out of them. I tried both the stage one and two. I then tried the Evenflo Comfi that we received in out hospital bag. She loves it and I love it because I don't have to watch my 5 day old baby struggle to eat! I went to Babies R Us and returned the VentAires that my husband thankfully did not sterilize and bought the Evenflo Comfis. The VentAire sounded great but I am very disappointed and caution everyone who decides to use them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottle Leaks","review":"The bottle design is great but the nipple leaks a lot.

I hear this a lot from people who have used the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy Nipples - Hazard","review":"The hole in the tip of the Stage One nipple split open after just 2 1/2 weeks, causing my daughter to take in too much formula. She suffered from vomiting and horrible gas pains after only a 2-oz feeding (she usually eats 5 oz). When I checked the bottle and rinsed the nipple, it had split so far that the nipple brush went straight through! I immediately changed back to my Avent bottle and she's had no problems. My Avent nipples have never split, caused gas or vomiting. The air flow design of the VentAire bottle may be a great concept - but beware of the flimsy nipples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hassled feedings","review":"I like the shape of the bottle because it makes positioning the baby slightly easier during feedings. That's it. I bought these bottles on the recommendation of three other mothers. I am very unhappy with them The stage one nipples are too slow, and the stage twos are way too fast (for a newborn). I followed the heating directions and removed the nipple during warming, but the nipples collapsed pretty often anyway. These bottles were a very difficult transition from breast to bottle. To save the cost of buying an entire new set of bottles, I bought the Nuk nipples to replace the ones that came with the VentAirs. The Nuks are much easier to eat from. The icing on the cake is the time it takes to wash the extra parts. Of course there are only two extra, but doesn't everyone feel like they are ALWAYS washing bottles anyway? Who needs the extra parts? My baby still has gas and spits up."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED","review":"I had heard many great things about these bottles so being a first time mom- I went and bought 10 small and 10 big. I brought my son home from the hospital very exciting about trying these out.- It's been 2 weeks now and he still hates them. He can't get anything out of the nipples- and the bottom is constantly leaking- in fact they've leaked all over the house the diaper bag.. etc..... Since I had about 80$ invested in them I decided to switch nipples and bought cheap regular nipples- he can now drink them but the new nipples defeat the purpose of the Ventaire system. So after 2 weeks my son is still at his birth weight- I finally got frustrated 2 days ago and went and bought all new bottles- I chose the Dr. Brown's- he's doing great with them, they don't leak, and are much easier to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"bottles were so frustrating to use-switched....","review":"WE heard these bottles were great, but boy were we in for a surprise! After using them for a week, the vents stopped working properly-even after boiling them once a week like you're supposed to do. WE called playtex and they had an answer for us right away-probably because others have had the same problem??????? Well, they were very friendly...Playtex told us to pull on the vents to open the holes before each feeding. Well, it didn't work. We had to open the bottle every few minutes during feedings to let the air out. Sucking on the nipple created a vaccuum and made the nipple collapse and nothing would come out. In tears, I went to the store and bought the playtex premium nurser with collapsable liners. MUCH BETTER! We called playtex and told them about our situation and they sent us a refund for 8 bottles and extra nipples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gas Free System","review":"I babysat a boy who used these bottles and I love them. I plan on getting them whenever I have kids. I never had to burp him and had no complaints on putting parts together or the parts deteriorating. We are getting the two year old bottles ready now for baby girl due in January. The bottoms are easy to put together if you spend an initial thirty seconds looking at them and realize that the big plastic tabs go in the big plastic holes. Of course, if you don't close something all the way it will leak so make sure to snug the bottoms. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these bottles","review":"I really do love these bottles. My son was exclusively breastfed until 3 months, and these were the only bottles he would take. We tried Avent, Playtex Nurser, and a few other kinds. This was the only type of nipple that he liked.I've seen complaints of nipple collapse. The reason for the nipple collapse is if you warm the bottle with the nipple on. It says right on the bottle \\"Remove nipple to warm.\\" Also, with the vent at the bottom, I haven't had one problem with it leaking. Just make sure it's in good. If you are breastfeeding and are starting bottles and choose this one, I would recommend stage 2 nipples. That's what I use for my son, it has a faster flow.The only problem that I have had with this bottle is because of the curved neck, my son can't figure out how to give himself the bottle. But at least he's taking a bottle! :)I love the VentAire and highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH! Not for Breastfeeding Moms!","review":"If you're trying to breastfeed--and either getting ready for daycare by pumping and filling bottles with mother's milk or supplementing with formula--you do not want to get your child these bottles. The baby's latch-on and use of the tongue (not gums) to pull down milk supply will not work on these nipples.The only way to get anything out of these bottles (both newborn and the next stage, which I bought to see if it was any better) is to BITE DOWN on the end of the nipple. OW! What Are They Thinking?!?After using a lactation consultant and getting a recommendation to try different nipples, we settled on the Playtex Premium Nurser set with wide-mouth bottles and silicon nipples that were shaped more like real breasts and more flexible like real skin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy These Bottles!","review":"These bottles are terrible! My son could not get a drop out of them! I really thought that these would be the best bottle for my son, but they ended up just being a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!!!","review":"These bottles are awful. My 1 month old that breast feeds couldn't even get anything out of stage 1, and stage 2 was too fast and he was gassy and spitting up.

Dr. Brown's is apparently the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for about 8 months, then throw them out!","review":"What a waste of money! I feel had with the marketing gimick! These were fine for about 8 months or so! I purchased about 50+ because I have twins, and needed multiple bottles. I learned that I totally wasted my money on these as they leak all over! I am so tired of cleaning out my fridge!!!! Do yourself a favor and purchase something else! I am personally throwing ALL of them in the trash and starting over with something else, maybe Dr. Browns. I am expecting again in a few months and don't need the extra aggravation of the mess to clean up and the assembly.Hope this will be useful to those contemplating these bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"VentAire Stage 1 Infant Bottles by PLAYTEX","review":"I cannot believe how angry this product has made me, I'm writing my first product review, I never spend the time to do this type of thing. My wife and I are arguing incredibly over these bottles. She used one this morning and said it worked, but I've tried these bottles and even today in 2 HOURS, my baby ate less than 1/2 OZ! My baby has reached exhaustion on these #$%@^&*!!! bottles and I believe may be at risk of losing weight. My wife won't exchange them because they were a gift and she doesn't want to hurt her friends feelings. Additionally, my baby is crying ridiculously after feeding on these, and I believe it is due to gas. I DON'T THINK I HAVE EVEN BEEN SO DISGUSTED WITH A PRODUCT IN MY WHOLE LIFE. The bottles we used at the hospital worked like a charm, only thing is, they were clinical bottles that cannot be purchased by consumers, only the hospital uses them. AVOID THIS PRODUCT LIKE THE PLAGUE."},{"rating":"1","title":"To much work!!!","review":"I'm a mother of a two month old. These bottles are to much work to put together. To much of a hassle. Just to keep less air in. Does it do the job for your baby to have less gas?? I don't think so. My baby would cry with all the gas he had!Waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"after a certain period the bottles leak around seals on bottom!!!","review":"I have found that after a certain period of time all of the bottles began to leak!!! Around the bottom!! The seal just was not efficient enough even changing the disc did not help...I had used them for about six months and then all the bottles began to leak... The only ones I have not had leak on me arethe red ones which have different discs!!!!!! My son like them but I did not!! Way to many parts and the parts all began to leak!!! That Sucks!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Delivery From Target Direct","review":"Nine days from MN to PA seems too long; perhaps Target Direct got process problems. I AM NOT SATISIFIED...got the same three pack of bottles which I bought at the same time as this gift pack at my local CVS for $1.50 less and did not have to wait nine days for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"My husband and I weren't sure which to use,plain bottles or bottles with the bags in them. We chose the VentAire bottles. GREAT choice! They are wonderful! Our daughter has had no problems with these bottles! We decided not to breast feed and started her on the VentAire bottles right away, NEVER had a problem! There are different stage nipples to buy and they are perfect! Honestly I can't say enough about these bottles,we love them. We tried one other brand that was given to us as a gift. We tried the \\"other\\" brand before she was 2months old and she wouldn't take the bottle at all!We have learned there is nothing you can do about gas, all babies have it but you can cut down on it! Use the VentAire and you will see!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated, we didn't use it","review":"My daughter is 6 months old now. She is breast fed when she is with me, but I have been working 3-4 days a week since she was 3 months. These bottles were too complicated, too many pieces and I wasn't sure if I could boil them or not. The baby didn't go for the nipple. We ended up using the nuk nipple and regular bottles. Hope this review was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disks LEAK and IMPOSSIBLE to replace","review":"The disks, required by this product to vent air through the bottom, very quick. I've been searching EVERYWHERE for replacement disks - I even checked the playtexproductsinc.com site - nothing. I'm getting desparate. Out of the 12 bottles I have, I'm down to 6 functioning disks. The start set I bought had two extras, so that means that in 3 months time, 8 of the disks are already worn out. I discovered that to get more, you must contact Playtex by the 800 number, they will send you through e-mail or fax an order form. The completed order form must be MAILED to playtex with a certified check.. and you must wait 4 - 6 WEEKS for replacements. At the rate they wear out, I won't have ANY working disks by then! I'll be purchasing a different brand and WOULDN'T recommend this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles","review":"These bottles are great. My son is 2 1/2 month old and hasn't had any gas bubble that much. He drinks very good with these bottle. Just have to remember to put the plastic part down and around on the bottom part of it will leak!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New mom loves them","review":"I'm a brand new mom, having just adopted a newborn. A friend recommended these, and I'm so glad she did. My daughter has no problems feeding from these bottles and practically no gas (sometimes we don't even get much of a burp out of her when the bottle's done!) They're easy to clean and reassemble. No mess. No spit up. I'm happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Easy to clean, helps with colic","review":"The reason so many parents are having problems getting milk out of these is they are perforated nipples... not already opened... you need to open them yourself!!! This is very easy to do just pull opposite sides of the nipple to get the full x shaped open.These bottles are great!They come apart easily for cleaning, they help with colic and gas, and they are easily interchangeable.Truly a great bottle! I recommend to any parents... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!!!!!!!!","review":"I spent alot of money on these bottles because of all the hype they receive. I was so disappointed. The nipples collapsed constantly, my daughter couldn't get anything out of the stage 1 nipples but choked on the stage 2. The bottoms leaked on some of them, and they are a pain to clean. I personally think that a hard bottle is a hard bottle, angled or vented or whatever, gas and bubbles just happen!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"I bought these bottles when I was pregnant thinking they would be wonderful. The bottles always leaked. I cleaned like recommended, but that didn't effect the leaking. As a new mother I didn't have time to boil bottles and try to fix the leaks. I bought the old fashion Evenflo and they were just as good. I don't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for cleaning, poor for feeding","review":"I purchased these bottles because of the name brand, turns out that means nothing. The nipples have such small holes in them, I had to poke new ones and my newborn son still can't suck hard enough. I just use another nipple which I'm sure completely defeats the whole purpose of the bottle. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks","review":"I have had these bottles for 2 months. They were great for keeping air out, but the nipple is small. It's great for a new born not older than a month. After that, my baby seemed to be sucking with a little more trouble. Later the bottom of the bottles started leaking as soon as I put warm milk in them. It was frustrating. I had to throw them away. There was no use in having them anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for hard to burp babies","review":"I bought these bottles when my baby was 6 months old, after having a problem with spitting up, reflux, and not being easy to burp. Using the Ventaire bottles I find that my baby spits up a lot less, and is less restless when I put him down to sleep after a feed. Previously he would kick his legs in his sleep, until I would pick him up and burp him. This no longer happens. He seems more relaxed when he is dinking as well. The air really does go out the bottom of the bottle. YOu can hear that the baby is sucking up just liquid, not air.I would recommend these bottles. Much easily the best bottle that I have tried.Two and a half years later; We are still using these bottles (another child) and still love them the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"so tacky, it's a must-have","review":"The sole (but mighty) justification for the purchase of this item is that it's so crude that it will almost certainly become a classic (and discontinued, of course) collector's item. You scoop the poops, the dog then eats then, et voila: more poops.Caveat emptor: get extra \\"food\\" items early on because they're almost certain to disappear into carpets or into real poops when kids eat them themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barbie and her dog","review":"This Barbie is the best present I could have gotten for my granddaughter.

Mattel continues to excel in their toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous Toy","review":"Dangerous Toy: I just got back from the emergency unit of my local hospital after my three year old son swallowed a few pieces of tanner's poop. I threw the toy straight to the thrash can. It could be an educational toy but definitely not worth the risk to have around young kids. The following is the manufactures info regarding this toy:Hazard: A small magnet inside the \\"scooper\\" accessory can come loose. Magnets found by young children can be swallowed or aspirated. If more than one magnet is swallowed, the magnets can attract each other and cause intestinal perforation or blockage, which can be fatal."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't believe it!","review":"The dog eats \\"dog biscuits\\", then expels them through a hole below the tail. Then the dog \\"eats\\" the expelled dog biscuits again. What is this supposed to teach? That dogs eat their own excrement? This is gross. My granddaughter picked out this Barbie in Toys R Us. Unfortunately, I did not read the discription of the toy on the package, if there was a description of a dog eating fecal material. I bought the doll because my granddaughter had earned a special treat and so far, I have had no reason to not trust Barbie. But this? I can not get over this disgusting toy. Everyone who sees it thinks it is totally gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda gross","review":"I have to say, what was Mattel thinking? Cause serously, a dog that poops? Maybe people and dogs do in real life but this is a doll which brings to the point it's not real, and if you take a look, the dog is eating it's own poop, seriously, that's kinda nasty, and a lil bit of a dumb idea, cause they don't even let poop to be shown on TV and yet they let it come with a doll, Mattel has got to do a better job then this, this is just my opinion, if someone doesn't agree with me fine, I just said what I think, and this doll I'm not sure I would approve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this doll for our four year old daughter after she hounded us for two weeks. Within 10 seconds of opening the package, a \\"biscuit\\" was lost, then two more followed. A few minutes later the lid on the trash can/dog food container broke. Also, be warned that the doll's arms only move from the elbow down, not at all from the arm sockets. And last but not least, she played with it for about 20 minutes and never touched it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scatological Dog","review":"My daughter asked for this toy for her birthday...I bought it only because I couldn't believe someone could think up a toy like that.... The dog that eats its own feces... over and over again.... This toy should be called Barbie in The Dante's Hell of The Scatological Dog....besides, the little pieces of fake poop are kind of easy for a child to swallow, or stick them in an ear canal or nose... the pieces are little, slick and heavy... This toy is weeeeeeird!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!!!","review":"If you think about it, this is a really gross toy. The dog eats, the dog poops, and then you use that as food again! haha That said, my daughter loves this.

The over-the-top, forced politics really detract from the storyline.

Lightweight reading, unless you really hate liberals, Hollywood, etc. However, if you think the only good liberal is a.....well, you may be able to guess the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"one star for two good songs","review":"I have been a strong supporter of the Crowes since the debut album. The following releases were not quite as strong throughout, but genius nonetheless. Chris and Rich have strayed too far from the melodies and chorus approach. The riffs are unconnected on Lions. Chris's voice seems labored, and the lyrics are silly for lack of a better word. Two songs are very good, but the rest is almost unlistenable. I am surprised at the reviews thus far. We are struggling to find real roots rock n' roll, but I cannot blindly support this album as many self proclaimed critics have found necessary. The Oasis/Crowes tour would have found me in the first row three years ago. Now,who knows? Just a theory, but I think the lead singer of Extreme had a hand in this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it...","review":"I've been a Crowes fan since the release of \\"shake your money maker\\", and always found something listenable on their disks, even on \\"By Your Side\\"...this one, \\"Lions\\", just plain stinks. I don't know what they were thinking of, and it certainly isn't their best work. \\"WarPaint\\" is better; \\"three snakes and one charm\\" is better, even \\"by your side\\" is better.

I'm just glad I got it used and cheap, I would have hated paying full price for it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is even worse than the album cover","review":"I love the Crowes.

Just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting to say the least....","review":"Of all the Black Crowes albums I own, this has to be the least favorite. Given it has one great songs like Miracle to Me. In my opinion this album may have just been an excuse to pump one out for the record label. The Previous Crowes albums had songs on them that told stories of love depicted and described with music that was either catchy, great for driving, or just plain awsome. This album will take many listens on the cd player to acquire a love for it. THe songs are very repetitve lyrically and the music does not fit Robinson's lyrics. Not much else to say but to listen before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album - give a chance to sink in...","review":"It has taken me at least five full listens to get into this album. That is rare for me and the Crowes. I was on these guys from day one. Lions is very different. That's is exactly why this album is so cool. I just listened to Soul Singing loud in the headphones and it gave me goosebumps. I am telling you, if you are a fan, buy this album now! If are looking to explore The Crowes, buy Shake your Moneymaker or Amorica and then buy this album. Either way, give a few spins to sink in and enjoy... Sun, stars, earth, moon, sky, tide..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the most Underated Crowes album","review":"This is an excellent album. The band is in fine form...especially after that Shake Your Money Maker retread(which is what you get working with a caveman LOL). Although I personally miss Johnny Colt and Marc Ford...their replacements are slouches by no measure. The songwriting is quite good...some fine, fine...soopafine material here. Lickin' is one of my all time faves. The glossy, almost poppy dance mix production really freshens an sging sound. Most of the tracks run into eachother, making the album hard to turn off. So take me down to the Greasy Grass River Baby...just make sure you bring some Crowes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Send Off","review":"If this is indeed to be \\"The Crowes\\" last album, it's a good note to go out on. The entire band seems very at ease and you can tell. \\"Midnight From The Inside\\" has Rich Robinson's guitar fuzzed out to the max and sounds like an actual live take(I think it was). \\"Lickin'\\" is the catchiest song here, sounding like Skynyrd at their sleaziest, with Chris Robinson rasping where he never has before. The mellow numbers are where the Robinson Bros. really shine. The gospel sound of \\"Soul Singing\\" and the weepy \\"Miracle To Me\\" recall Zeppelin in their prime, without just retracing steps. Of course, when The Black Crowes are involved, they real question is \\"Can't we all just get along?\\" If only they could..."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST","review":"One of the best albums in the world! evry damn song is like a dream...by it take it home gett..."},{"rating":"1","title":"where'd the Crowes go","review":"Well after I heard \\"lickin'\\" I thought this could be a cool cd to get. After listening to it several times I'm not sure I will listen to it again anytime soon. What happened to the melodic Crowes from the early days? This to me is a mess, it's not horrible it's just not what I like to hear from these guys. Not much of it rocks,...i.e. Opening track \\"midnite from the inside out\\" is really cool til the background melody grinds this puppy to a near stop. Not the best songs in the world lyrically nor musically, not compared to what they had done up until this point. Best advice, listen to all the samples and decide if it's what you like from them. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for all the great music Crowes!!!!!!!","review":"...The Black Crowes are hands down the best band of the 90's.

Following two so-so albums, \\"Three Snakes and One Charm\\", and \\"By Your Side\\", the \\"Lions\\" CD re-energizes my belief in this band and their contribution to American rock and roll music. There are 9 really outstanding tracks on \\"Lions\\" with the strongest being \\"Lickin\\", \\"Midnight From the Inside Out\\", \\"Soul Singing\\", \\"Young Man, Old Man\\" and \\"Miracle to Me\\". The only thing that keeps me from giving \\"Lions\\" five stars are a few songs which a good A&R person should have axed including \\"Losing My Mind\\", \\"No Use in Lying\\" and \\"Cypress Tree\\". I hope they don't waste any of their great live performances playing these songs. Do buy it though, skip through these tracks and experience one of the finest rock and roll bands of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done Already!!","review":"This c.d. by the Crowes is subpar.

Funk, Rock, a bit of 70's metal, with a 90's grunge attitude, its hard to catagorize.

My personal favorites on this album are Ozone Mama (funkish), Soul Singin (soulish)', Cypress Tree, Greasy Grass River, and Cosmic Friend (very Beatles-esque.

Back to the stinging soul that defines albums like \\"Southern Harmony\\" and \\"Amorica\\". Unfortunately this is not the case. This album is nothing but a sad attempt at reinventing what didn't need to be. It is almost cliche. The songs are as utterly uninspiring as Chris Robinson's new found lack of soul.

Conley is just a stooge for the liberal elite who wanna keep that garbage alive about \\"white privilege\\" and the need for affirmative action discrimination programs.

I guess I am just one of those people who likes a good story, well done, that makes me care about the characters and THE GUITAR just didn't do it for me. I assume many movie critics would go \\"ga-ga\\" over this because of its \\"artistic\\" imagery but I just found it somewhat painful to get through.

In comparison \\"The Guitar\\" is a cold bland sandwich. It looks good at first until you actually taste it.A story about a character's death usually explores emotions. What are they feeling? Why (other than they're dying) are they feeling it? So this woman never learned to play the guitar and then uses the last few months of her life to do so. (Yeah right.

Those first 30 minutes were excellent. But, about the middle of the film, it all went downhill. The film tries too much to make everything too perfect.

This happened every few minutes after awhile, so it got exchanged. I was willing to give Magnavox the benefit of the doubt and try a new player.

Fortunately, we have quite a number of non-BluRay DVDs that we've collected over the years, so we still have plenty of choices.

I have never seen a game that has so much to offer. The graphics and gameplay are second to none and the game is just plain addictive.

The bullet time is over rated. I got tired of it after a while, there's no action (think the opposite of serious sam). There's no puzzles, Max enters a room and says \\"the letter sat on the table like a letter sitting on the devils table\\". That's a prompt for you to read the letter.

But as it turns out, Max Payne [is bad]- for many reasons.Bullet time is a gimmick that is cool for the first 10 minutes, but almost seems designed as a coverup for the otherwise awful gameplay. Add this to the absurd level design (bad trips and tightropes, anyone?), shoddy graphics, those ridiculous comic-book cutscenes, the contrived plot... Max Payne is garbage. And to think, the ripoff that they call an ending leaves the door open for a sequel. Lord help us."},{"rating":"1","title":"O-V-E-R-R-A-T-E-D","review":"This game was not that great, after hearing so many great things about it, I expected to be hooked on it, I so WASN'T hooked. The bullet time gets old after a while, and the gameplay is not much other than running around shooting bad guys, and finding a key here and there to unlock a door; wow, big deal. I think Dead to Rights will be a better game.For nonstop action, I'll stick with Devil May Cry, Dante is cooler anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"It's an old XBOX game that wouldn't work on my XBOX 360 console.

Overall....Great Game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard boiled third-person action!","review":"3 1/2 out of 4 starsPros: Third-person shooter inspired by action movies like \\"Hard Boiled\\"; bullet time works well and makes firefights feel more cinematic; great film noir tone and atmosphere; beautifully drawn graphic novel cut-scenes; stellar voice acting.Cons: Following the blood trail during the nightmare sequences; lots and lots of diving and shooting; can't walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A game worth owning.","review":"Max Payne is a man with nothing to loose, and with his mind set on revenge... Really, this is a great game! I enjoyed it from beggining to the end. This game features bullet time and its not just a cool feature. It helps you out during the game and is essential to your success. Max Payne also has many different types of weapons including grenades, guns and a baseball bat. The story isn't really amazing but the main focus here isn't on the story. Its on the action, baby! This game has plenty of action. The storyline isnt all that bad and Max Payne faces some stunning revelations in it. The length is under fifteen hours, but that isn't too bad considering the price of Max Payne. You can get it for under $20 and considering DVD's cost as much as that and they are usually only about two hours, its a good value. So go pick up this awesome game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game that makes you want to play all night","review":"All I need to say is this game kicks [rear].Yes, the graphics are awesome. The story line is one of the best that i have seen after years of playing computer games. And the action never ends. Right when you wonder where the action is, suddenly you can find yourself getting shot to bits.The dialogue is awesome. tha parts where they use simlar to comic book blocks to help tell the sotyr aand show some dialogue is defiantly kick [rear]..Although i have it for the PC, its still just as fun"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one funk-up","review":"The only thing I would have changed if I was the game producer would have to be hunting down the baby and mothers voice.

Good controls, excellent visuals and sound, extremely detailed. But how many mobsters say \\"freaking\\" instead of the real word? The \\"M\\" rating is supposed to correspond to a movie's \\"R\\" rating, so I guess the programmers didn't have the guts to put the real word in there.The \\"TRANCE\\" sections, in which a baby constantly cries and you have to run along a thin trail of blood surrounded by a black void, [is bad]. But an awesome game nonetheless. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max Payne rivals Halo","review":"If you like Halo then you will like Max Payne. Much differet game in terms of scenario, but wow, more exciting. it is also very violent, which is OK wil me. If you are buying this game for a child then you may want to think again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this!","review":"A terribly good value in the realm of overhyped and priced games. It's selfish, good shoot-em up fun with responsive controls, fine graphics and decent replay. One of the few games I couldn't walk away from since I began playing. The story is secondary to a series of shooting scenarios that are enhanced by a slow motion control that actually adds to the action. This game is far superior to \\"Dead to Rights\\" which it is often inaccurately compared to. The comic book cut-scenes are surprisingly well done, while the oft mentioned dream sequences are interesting if unfortunately annoying. Well-worth the minimal cash outlay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frickin Awesome","review":"this game is frickin awesome. one of the best frickin games you'll ever frickin play. i recommend this frickin game to every frickin one with a frickin xbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Splinter Cell is MUCH better","review":"Max Payne would be great, if you have never played Splinter Cell.This game requires no strategy - other than jsut blasting the living guts out of everything in sight. If you like that stuff - this game is great.But - if you like to think - even just a little bit - Splinter Cell is FAR SUPERIOR.Max Payne's movements are very limited - he cannot hang, jump, bounce off of walls, or sneak around the way Sam (Splinter Cell) can.The slow mo effects are very impressive - but if you jsut blast everything in sight, you can get to the next level without using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"matts review","review":"I think this game is meaningless, and has no piont but to just go around killing people.

But I really don't like too much talking in a game. I want to get into the action at once. Good thing you can skip these things. I also hate playing with Max Payne finding his way out of the maze.And after I finished the game, I tried playing it again but was disappointed by the time limit. There is not enough time to explore and find weapons and ammo.But overall, the game is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it were a movie, I'd call it a \\"rental\\"","review":"When I first played this, I thought perhaps they initially were going for \\"the Matrix\\" and just gave up. The moves are pretty cool, but it gets weird in that some levels are just \\"odd\\". The action is really cool, the weapons are good, but after playing a great action packed level, you run into this weird drug-like maze thing which just ruined it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun dies quickly","review":"its a very fun game, i suggest not using the cheats or it will ruin the game (until youve beat it that is). the matrix-esque style and storyline is great, but the game is very short, and it leaves you feeling just that , short. for [the money] you might want to get eldeer scrolls 3: morrowind which has virtually hundreds of hours of gameplay, or UFC: tapout.... this game gets a 1 out of 5 stars for replayability. i beat it once and havent been back since.... it would have been cheaper to go to the arcade and spend ... bucks anbd i would have got more fun out of that. my advice, look at the other great games for xbox and skip this one... (the graphics kind of [are bad] as well, as this game was intended for PS2 and doesnt take advantage of the xbox's full power)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New York Style Game","review":"Max Payne is great game. At times the story mode w/ the horrible voice acting can get annoying, but the suspense and horror while playing the game, all make up for it. The worst part about the game though, is that it is way to short. The best part of the game would easily be the awesome control of bullet time and how your allowed to dodge bullets. With all that said, the pros are more overwhelming than the cons, so I believe for any teenage or older gamer this is a great and rewarding buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun game","review":"This is a classic game for xbox and i love it. it plays so well and has a good story. There are lots of guns and lots of bad guys, how can u go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"This game was better on the PC, but the Xbox version was really fun as well. I loved the action sequences and the storyline is top-knotch. I did not care for the ending, and the part where you are drugged up and have to walk through the maze is a miserable experience to say the least. Other than those incidents, this game is incredible. Enemy AI is great, and the graphics are fantastic. You MUST experience the 'bullet-time' to appreciate this game in its fullest.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for something that is different than just \\"shoot 'em up.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!!","review":"This game is highly original and really fun. I'd have given it 5 stars but the beginning wasn't very fun and the sequences where you have to get through that maze and when you have to walk on that rope and follow the screams were pointless, tiring, frustrating and stupid. But besides that, it was awesome! The bullet time shooting and dodging is great. The guns rock as do the molotov cocktails! Once you play for around 1 hour, the game gets so frickin' fun!!! At the halfway point, when you're in the mansion, it's some of the most fun that I've ever fun! The shootouts and dodging around corners in slo mo while unloading on some punks never gets old! The end's great as is everything! You'll absolutely love it and it's worth a buy but believe me, it can get hard to get through that maze. I hate that part!!! That wasn't fun at all!But, believe me, buy or rent this and you'll be in for some great shootouts and nonstop fun. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"plenty of violent action","review":"This game has taken up plenty of my time due to the engaging storyline, good graphics, and intense action violence. I would give it 5 stars except for 2 things 1: there is a problem with the save, when I use it and then beat a level instead of playing the next level I get started from the begining of the level I just beat. 2: jumping is a straight up pain in the a__. When you have to jump from one ledge to the other if you don't time your jump exactly perfect you fall and die and have to do the whole area over again, and you wouldn't beleive the frustration this causes. Over all though I'd say this is one of th most fun and addictive games i've ever played."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

When I started out, I had about 200 dollars in my savings account (no checking account)and poor to outright horrible credit. Although it took me more than 18 months to make a million dollars, I eventually did. It wasn't easy, but it definitely is possible. Success depends on the person and their perserverance.

The techniques that Whitney offers in dealing with bankers- simply will not work.Similar to other snake oil salesmen, Whitney discusses the OPM (other people's money) or no downpayment techniques to purchasing real estate.These are great techniques in real estate markets that are so depressed that bank financing is not available.

I keep the boat onboard.Some suggestions for the next edition.- Include more advice for single engine sailboats docking in a strong crosswinds.

I have not read many mystery books before, mainly because they sound boring to me, but when I picked up this book I knew I would like it. I mainly like books for young adults, like the Princess Diaries and the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, but Twisted Summer is a mix of those and mystery!

It's great to hear soulful singers reinterpret these classic Van tunes, and emphasize the blues/soul/gospel influences inherent to Van's music.

Many of us have been disappointed by less than stellar \\"tribute\\" albums (\\"Blues on Blonde\\" comes to mind)but I think any Van fan would respond to this.

It would be good for any not-for-profit organisation. I got one of the earlier editions out from a library in Wellington, New Zealand; it was so authoritative that I then ordered four copies from Amazon. The 10th edition is greatly improved, both in terms of greater clarity and scope. It is the best authority I could find anywhere in the world. It is adapted from early English parliamentary rules.Robert's Rules is wonderful if you need to instil order in an unruly organisation meeting. In my case, it enabled us to run a successful AGM, where before the AGMs had been very unpleasant for all involved. Robert's Rules is both concise and complete. The writer had good common sense and the rules are persuasive and easily adaptable to any given situation...I would recommend this book to any organisation requiring strengthening in its meeting procedures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is the \\"POCKET GUIDE\\"","review":"I wanted the whole thing, the complete book, but this is the \\"pocket guide.\\" If you look hard enough on the web page for this item, you will see that it is the \\"Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies.\\" I didn't look hard enough before I bought it, but I should have figured the entire book wouldn't be available on Kindle for $0.99 when the paperback is $12.

Compared to the 1970 (or even 1981) edition, it hardly qualifies as a real book. The pages of this \\"pseudo-book\\" are no longer bound in signatures, but merely glued to an inflexible spine. It cannot possibly be made to open flat, and so is useless as an open-book reference. Instead of being printed on opaque coated paper as before, it is now printed on paper that allows the print on the reverse and even following page to show through distractingly. The page margins are so narrow that the text next to the spine can be read only with difficulty. Forget this edition and buy a second-hand 1970 Scott-Foresman edition.

I totally disagree.First, the only reason the 'Empire' seemed original to so many North Americans is that hardly anyone studies philosophy anymore, especially of the continental varieties.Second, the whole thesis of 'Empire' never really gets at the reality of the US that I would assert: basically, how does the US thrive as the dominant global political economy when its society is a libertarian funland for an economic elite, and its foreign policy amounts to fascism against anyone who gets in the way of US militarism and mercantlism."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master, On Swimming...","review":"James E. \\"Doc\\" Counsilman, in his long tenure as swim coach at Indiana University, trained a small army of collegiate and Olympic-class swimmers.

Steve Howe stands both above and with the classic rock band \\"Yes\\" and as an artist all his own.Don't just listen to this album, put it on and listen to it \\"forever\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for dress up","review":"Wonderful shoes! Bought these for my daughter to wear for Halloween with her Mermaid outfit. They worked great! Easy to keep on, no problems with things falling off of them. Has worn them since Halloween with no problems. Would recommend them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it but yes I'm biased","review":"Just this day received my newest purchase, by Robert Adams, wonderful dreamy and poetic, yet gritty and real.Someone paid me the best compliment ever recently when they compared my own art to Mr Adams'This book will take a proud spot beside my bed for the next few weeks it will be a joy to fall asleep with it in my hands dreaming of the impending spring and summer light that is soon to reach us here in the southern hemisphere.I must admit I was pleasantly surprised to see that it was almost exclusively images, I was expecting another collection of essays similar to his recent book \\"Why People Photograph\\"Crikey I'm not complaining"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Given the raving reviews I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book after waiting for it for over a month! It took me less than 5 minutes to leaf through it - what a disappointment. Expecting outstanding photographs, they are mediocre, bland, uninteresting subjects. What are the subjects? Hoping to find breakthroughs in lighting, subject treatment or composition, I wonder why certain areas are overexposed and bothersome to look at in the photographs. Nothing stands out as innovative. I'm amazed people praise him as being so much better than Ansel Adams. It is undeniable that Ansel Adams' work is more esthetic, dramatic, fascinating and of a quality far beyond this. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Public School Book","review":"What a delight! Don't change one word. This book should be in every Public School Library where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again...","review":"To be honest i would not buy this item again. It looks cheap and it feels cheap as well. This is a good example of buying something online that appears to be the perfect item. Unfortunately appearances are decieving sometimes.This item might be pretty neat for a younger person although? It just doesnt have a professional/adult look to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ate 10 gifted children and nothing =(","review":"I ate 10 gifted children and the only thing i got was diarrhea.Seriously who would buy this book with such a fail cover?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny","review":"If this were a book about any other unique population of students, it would be villified. The gifted community does have quite the sense of humor, and if it were something sillier like 'clone their brains' or 'get their brains to rub off on you', the sarcasm could be funny. But killing them to eat them, NOT funny. These are precious human beings, too, whose brains just work differently. This is about as funny as saying that we should raise everyone's IQ by killing off the mentally handicapped. NOT funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg--and a stupid expensive one at that","review":"This is totally a bootleg, and it's ridiculously expensive. Just buy the official boxsets. If you really want to buy a bootleg and get bad quality picture and subtitles, and support shady businesses, you should spend about $5 on it. $70 for a bootleg is laughable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't an official release!","review":"If this is the entire series on 12 DVDs. then it isn't the official US or Japanese release. It is purely up to you if you want to buy it or not, but I have heard of too many people being burned because they didn't realize that they were buying a bootleg."},{"rating":"1","title":"VCD quality DVDs..probably bootlegs!","review":"I got burned with this copy of Rurouni Kenshin Complete Collection. The printing on the cover and discs are subquality as well as the resolution of the videos, VCD quality to be precise! I guess the price was too good to be true. WARNING!! Be sure to know what you are buying before you do..don't get burned like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I own the real complete collection, and this isn't it!","review":"I hope no one get's burned on here, or buys this thing because this is not the real complete collection. The one I have are 2 fold out CD cases with something like 6 CD's per case. This is boot legged bull crap.Wait, I just found out the one I got is a bootleg too! what the heck is going on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ILLEGAL BOOTLEG","review":"This product is a BOOTLEG. If your going to watch this show illegally just do it online, but DONT THINK THIS IS LEGIT. This very box set was one of my first anime purchases years ago, imagine my disappointment years later when I realized I had a bootleg!To check what is legitimate and what is not go to animenewsnetwork and look under releases in the anime encyclopedia! Amazon can be trusted when you buy from them directly, NOT THE MARKETPLACE."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOTLEGGED!","review":"This anime DVD is all regions, which is a tell-tell sign that an anime is bootlegged. US licencing companies are required to limit the region to the US regions, 1. All regions just aren't allowed. This is bootlegged. Trust me, I've seen over 400 anime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenshin","review":"OK, for starters, this dvd collection is obviously a bootleg. I dont mean obvious as in quality, it's just that there is no FBI warning. Aside from that, this dvd collection is only a small step below the official release. If you want to pay an extra hundred dollars or so for that little bit of quality, you should go buy the official release of all three seasons. If, however, you are like me, and just want to see the show, get this. The only downside is the disks are shipped in a VERY cheap dvd case, so you might want some sort of dvd storage (ie. dvd cases, dvd folder, dvd binder, etc.) that will hold 12 dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best anime seris in my book!","review":"I love this series! Best ever, next to Yu Yu Hacksho (forgot how to spell). A true original. Such a great story line, not just all action, if you like story line with action, buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is great","review":"I just purchased this for a Christmas present and it was perfect. A beautiful cover, ALL 12 discs as promised, not even opened. I played them on a dvd player xbox and playstation worked on all. has English and Japanese language, and the quality is absolutely beautiful. The people below me must have gotten something different, but my copy is awesome. And it's not a bad price for what it actually is. These go for over 120 dollars in any anime shop. It's a great gift to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Ten years after the start of the Meiji Era, a Rurouni wanders into Tokyo to find a new life with new friends.
