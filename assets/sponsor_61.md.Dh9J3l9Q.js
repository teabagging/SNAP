It had no impact on my level of alertness, and I was just as drowsy as ever. I don't know if it's just me, or if the product itself doesn't have the proper concentration, but the product was a complete failure for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment","review":"I bought two preserving books at the same time- this one and Hilaire Walden's Sensational Preserves. And there was no comparison. Everything I tried from this book was run of the mill. And all those pouches of pectin. The emphasis seemed to be on meeting all the technical requirements to enter your preserves in the county fair---not to put them on the home table. The other book--Sensational Preserves was inventive, beautiful and practical-- and everything we made from it was just as the title said- sensational."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a great canning recipe book - especially for beginners like me. She shares all the info you need at the beginning of the book about how to actually enter your preserves into the local fairs, tips on how to get more points, etc. But I bought this book for the information she gives about canning, why you have to do the things you do for SAFE canning and the excellent recipes. She covers off the normal things like pickles, applesauce and tomato based recipes (all excellent) and then also gives great recipes for the more exotic chocolate sauce, butterscotch sauce and also how to make oils & vinegars. It gave me the confidence to start canning & preserving and gives me more curiosity to try more & more types of preserving recipes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book even for a beginner","review":"I haven't canned anything in--OK, I'll admit it--decades. And then I was only a beginner. I've never made jam or jelly before. But I decided I wanted to start canning this year so I bought all the equipment--and Blue Ribbon Preserves. Only problem was...nothing is in season yet. Fortunately, Blue Ribbon Preserves has several recipes you can make with frozen or canned fruit. So I selected a recipe from those: Coconut Pineapple Conserve. Sounds good, doesn't it? I went to the store and got the 2 20-counce cans of crushed pineapple, a bag of dehydrated shredded coconut (Bob's Red Mill, of course), and the other ingredients. I made the conserve and it turned out...awesome!If a rank beginner can make Coconut Pineapple Conserve from this book, and have it turn out awesome, you can make great stuff from it too. Even if you're a beginner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless! A MUST HAVE. GREAT Recipes.

Roberto Cantoral wrote many fine boleros, but the way they are rendered here is disappointing. It's not the arrangements, which are OK, but the singer, whose voice is mediocre and fails to do justice to her father's compositions. When it comes to singing, she's just another pretty face who can't carry a tune. Music lovers are advised to look elsewhere for these songs. Indeed, it's hard to find a bolero collection without at least one selection by Roberto Cantoral, usually \\"El reloj\\" or \\"La barca.\\" Good renditions of his songs are readily available on CDs by Luis Miguel, Victor Yturbe and Alberto Vazquez, among many others."},{"rating":"1","title":"This machine does not work.","review":"I tried to stitch on my daughter's school patch.

Awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Let me say that I am a Robert Parker fan and have read every one of the Spenser books. In fact, I picked this book up after having run out of new Spenser books to read. I ought to have just gone back to The Godwulf Manuscript and started over again, because Wilderness is an extremely poor offering from an extremely talented writer.

Is this a sign?As whisks go, this one is decidedly average... best for mixing but not for aerating.

The focus was almost solely on male pleasure, with virtually no time spent on the female orgasm. I would be far more likely to reccommend _The Magic of Sex_ by Dr. Miriam Stoppard as a comprehensive sex manual. That which is good in Comfort's book is not unique and that which is unique isn't that great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three books, three hits --- a home run!","review":"This book was part of a package I bought to improve my sex life. The New Joy of Sex turned out to be a lovemaking primer - or a lovemaking refresher, in my case. Another book, 101 Nights of Great Sex, was just for fun. Great as a gift, great to spice up a boring sex life. Great games to play.Finally, a somewhat more serious approach is \\"Five Minutes to Orgasm Every Time You Make Love\\" which I wanted because the promise was an easier, faster orgasm which most women need, at least some time. Although the book deals with difficulty reaching orgasm, the approach is light-hearted and fun. The technique worked for me and my current lover. Each book presents a different approach, all very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for Misogynists","review":"This book is awful if you are looking for a book that explains how to have mutually fulfilling sexual experiences. Though its brief discussion of anatomy might be useful for people who've only had high-school sex-ed, the rest of the book focuses on how women can please men, and says almost nothing about what men can do for women. It advocates \\"pretend\\" rapes and tells women they should have sex whenever their men want them to, even if the women don't. It focuses on the tiniest details of what women can do for men, and says very little about what men can do for women. Even if you're looking for a book on the book on the basics, skip this one- it's biased, uninformative, and sends unhealthy and incorrect messages about women's sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is a disappointment for the 90s reader.","review":"Comfort's book is a disappointment for the 90s reader because it lapses into language and commentary derived from a less sensitive and \\"politically correct\\" era.

In addition, Comfort makes derogatory comments concerning relationships between Middle Eastern males and overweight American women in the back section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid....","review":"The first 2 volumes were amazing.

The timeline is non-existent. Storm now has short hair, along with Bishop. But, it all grows back by next volume?? Rogue is a tramp, and so is Remy all of a sudden?? Then back to in love by vol 7?? Literally nothing makes sense about this volume. Skip it. Forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"The Nino Rota \\"La Strada\\" CD is exceptional.

I have to keep the others lying around as backup for when the new one will break and I have to wait for the new pair to ship. Great if you will only listen with them once a week.

Since I only wanted a backup, I didn't want to pay too much.I thought these would just get me through a week or so if my Gumy headphones broke.They arrived sooner than I anticipated, and I wanted to try them as soon as I got them. When I started listening they were GREAT. The sound quality was muchbetter than I ever would have expected. The sound was clear and I didn't have to turn it up loud to hear certain parts of any of my music. If it were only basedon sound, I really would have given these five stars. But alas! It is not.The only complaint I have about these is that they are not made to fit your ear. I am fine with this because I'll just get used to it, but for those whojust can't stand uncomfortable headphones and won't give them a chance, your money would best be spent elsewhere.Pros:~Good sound Quality~Inexpensive~Pretty Color~Good PackagingCons:~Not designed to fit your ear"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for runners","review":"Maybe my ears are too large but the buds keep falling out of them when I run.

I will say this, that as long as I don't smile, they're comfortable. xD When I smile or laugh, they kinda press against my ears a little tighter, so it's a pain.

When I took them out of the package, they felt exactly how i thought they would; cheap design and a flimsy cord. When I hooked them up to my computer, I went through a variety of music with high trebles, smooth mids, and deep bass. The treble and bass are WAY out of balance. Sometimes the treble is almost too shrill and soft bass doesn't even register. If you are used to Sennheiser or Audio Technica like I am, these are not for you.So in summary, great as a pair of headphones to beat up but if you want even a little bit of sound quality, get something else.Pros:Low priceFairly comfortableCons:HORRIBLE sound qualityFlimsy cordUgly design"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't stay in my ear.","review":"These things just don't stay in my ear like the ones that came with my ipod.

Sure, Expect is great ( and thank's for this tool, Don ! ) but this book isn't only about Expect - it's about almost *everything* you'll ever need to program interactive scripts using Expect. It talks about Tcl, zombies in UNIX, regular expressions ( really *in depth* talk ), \\"\\\\r\\\\n\\" vs \\"\\\\r\\" and \\"\\\\n\\" and hell knows what else ( fortunately, I have many more to read ) !

However, I will give Don Libes a 2* because of the effort. Too bad there is really no alternative out there.

Instead, this book reads like a novel. The only way to understand anything is to read from start to finish. And without a companion TCL reference it's hopeless. Many keywords are used and discussed in passing, but never defined.The index randomly references word matches within paragraphs instead of topical sections. (Someone must have used a blind \\"find\\" function since the index was obviously an afterthought.)A language with such a narrow purpose and small command set shouldn't require nearly 600 conversational pages. I admit I didn't give this book much of a chance, but as my only available reference to this subject, I am very frustrated. I loved the O'Reilly Perl book.

After seeing how practical it was with automating command line sessions and I decided to get this book.The book covers many topics relevant to developing Expect programs along with a good introduction to Tcl, which made it quicker for me to ease into writing Expect code. The book is self-contained and after reading a few chapters, I was able to automate FTP and SSH sessions with Expect programs. The book is very useful if you are a beginner Tcl/Expect programmer. However for some advanced topics, I found myself searching for answers on the man pages and the Internet.In summary, I recommend this book for people, who need a good introduction to Expect but don't want to start from Unix man pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"These lamps are very cute, but they don't stay lit for very long.Maybe a couple of hours at the most.

So thankfully, the guys at Cartoon Network gave us junkies something amazing to tide us over. This microseries bridges the gap between episodes II and III, and fans who have only seen the films will learn a great deal more about several characters from the films should they choose to watch these.In Volume 1, fans get to know the brave Clone Troopers of the Old Republic a great deal more than in Episode II. Several planets are visited, and the Clone Wars are fought on several fronts. On land, sea and in the skies. Anakin goes off on a solo adventure to stop Count Dooku's newest lacky, Asajj Ventrece.(Or however you spell her last name.) But he is playing directly into the hands of Darth Sidious.So pick this one up.

It's everything you hope and want it to be.This is the bridge between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith. This chronicles the Clone Wars and the actions of the Jedi and the clone troopers who do the fighting. It also introduces General Grievous and Asajj Ventress as new and exciting characters.This collection of shorts go together smoothly and make for a great watch. The best segments include the ARC Trooper and the battle between Asajj and Anakin. Great animations and exciting story telling. I can't wait to get Volume II.Don't pass this up just because it is in anime format. It's a great addition to the Star Wars expanded universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed!","review":"Volume One is the best Clone Wars you will ever come across. This is the set of 3 minute episodes that originally aired on the Cartoon Network between the theatrical release of Ep 1 and 2.

If you love Jack, you will love SW Clone Wars Volume 1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Begun, the clone war has.","review":"This emmy award winning series picks up right where Attack of the Clones left off. In the course of one hour, audiences will have battle after battle thrown at them. There is small character development, nothing compared to what we get in Vol. 2 but there is some. Mostly this is one big action movie portraying many different battles during the clone wars. I found this whole volume to be very enjoyable. The animation style used is very captivating and never grows old because it is so rich in detail. The bonus features on this dvd are very nice to say the least, trailers, a making of, and a playable xbox demo for Republic Commando. If you are a fan of Star Wars I strongly recommend this dvd for you along with Vol. 2 (which you can check out my review for) Both dvds together complete the story between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith.

I wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I at least expected a plot. It's just a bunch of ludicrous battle sequences. Basically the battles are ten times as big as any battle in the movies (in terms of combatants), but the Jedi are about 1,000 times as powerful. An entire hour of watching each Jedi take out droids by the dozen was a little much. Ignoring all of that . . . battles aren't nearly as cool when it's a cartoon.Overall, this isn't worth wasting your time on. However, my wife and I did get a good couple of laughs when we noticed that one of the Jedi the shown at the end of the battle with the banker's guild looked like Michael J. Fox from Teenwolf, and that the cameo by Jedi Master Shaggy as part of the group battling General Grievous. It's just too bad he didn't have Scooby and the Mystery Machine to aid his cause..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I enjoyed all the Star Wars films, but this cartoon is all over the place.

I certainly won't buy this on DVD after seeing it for free on Cartoon Network. Also, I can't beleive that this series won an Emmy.Bottom line for me: May 19th, 2005 is worth waiting for to see Revenge of the Sith.

It focuses on the lesser known battles of the Clone Wars and is fun to watch for anyone.

The last trilogy was a mistake, an artistic disapointment, and a failure to maintain continuity.This series was an effort to bridge the gap- to maintain continuity- but by that point no one really cared anymore other than diehard fanboys of whom I used to rank with.Save your money.

There's really no point in purchasing this series, unless you want to finance Lucas's kids after his death."},{"rating":"1","title":"All right, but hardly great","review":"I don't understand all the 5 star reviews that this received, especially those saying that it is \\"worthy of the originals\\", as this, in my opinion, suffers from the same thing that the \\"Phantom Menace\\" suffered from, and that is being too childish.I also did not care for the animation (not the style I'd have chosen for Star Wars), but that I could have lived with it if the story itself was more mature. I could not help but feel, however, like I was watching an episode of the Super Friends instead of a Star Wars show."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disapointment","review":"I was hoping that this movie would give additional insight into the Star Wars Saga.

If you like watching fighting and shooting the you may like the movie but if you are looking for some dialogue and interesting tidbits of info then you will be disapointed. My three old who is crazy about Star Wars stopped watching after 1/2 an hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"The force is not with this one...","review":"This animated perversion of Star Wars is an insult to one of the best Sci-Fi epics of all times. The characters are utterly rediculus (seriously, if the jedi were that actually powerful, why did they need the clones?), there is no plotline to speak of, and the entire thing is badly animated and has crappy voice acting. If you want a good build-up to Episode III, I suggest playing Star Wars: Republic Commando and reading Labyrinth of Evil and the other Clone Wars novels. Don't wast your money on this, it's not worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"star wars never gets OLD!","review":"Great DVD. This isn't one of those star wars screw-ups that makes the saga look bad like many stupid and randomized series of books out there about the star wars universe. Must buy for any fan. A little short. Enough said. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The way Star Wars should be","review":"Amazing that Tartakovsky could portray the Star Wars Universe more akin to the way I always pictured it in my mind than George Lucas and all his Special Effects.And that was done in 3 minute shows (pasted seamlessly together for this DVD).If you are a Star Wars fan and felt disappointed with the 3 first episodes, buy this and feel elated."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved Anniken's victory yell!","review":"I liked this movie. But I think it wasn't as good as Clone Wars Volume 2. It had one excellent part -- when Anniken yelled in victory after he killed the assaisin on the moon of Yavin 4. His victory yell went like this \\"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH\\"! I'm six. My Dad and I liked this dvd. But, again, Volume 2 is better.Also, the sound effects in Volumes 1 and 2 are great. Especially the light sabre battles.Also, the animated general grievance is great. YET AGAIN VOLUME 2 IS BETTER."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Great Cartoons of My Childhood","review":"This series as a whole was a big part of my childhood. Excellent animation and a story that definitely doesn't talk down to the kids who watch it. Far better than the series they have going now. Definitely check this out for you little Star Wars fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids","review":"This cartoon is amazing. I am looking forward to Vol. 2 indefinitely. It really shows the skills of the Jedi and Sith very creatively. To be honest, without the force, I would not care about Star Wars. Look, Obi Wan is the best Jedi ever, but my fav part of this was Wendu vs. the droids and huge crushing thing. That machine was devestating but he just took his time breaking a bunch of robots and then went and owned it in his down time. Awesome. Definitely don't pass this up thinking its for little kids!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This anime was freaking awesome!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie really shows off what the Jedi's are actually capable of. It was really groovy. Definitly worth buying......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clone Wars!","review":"After the fairly duff ewok cartoons released in the 1980s, Genndy Tartakovsky's fantastic, action-packed CLONE WARS is a delight to watch, with the great characters, fast-paced space battles and lightsaber fights aplenty. Some have argued that the action in CW is superior to Attack Of The Clones, and while the series does have its flaws (Mace Windu is way too powerful, Padme's story is slow and un-involving), there is still plenty to get excited about. The main two storylines concern Obi-Wan and his clone trooper army battling the fearless droid army leader, Durge. And Anakin faces his most dangerous enemy yet, the deadly dark Jedi, Assaj Ventress. Other Jedi such as Kit Fisto and Mace Windu have episodes devoted to their battles, which are impressive, but lack the enthusiasm of the main story. Overall however, this is definitely worth buying, and I can't wait for season 3 to be released!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF you like the Series get this!","review":"This is a very good DVD, personaly I think the best feature is that they bridge every chapter so that you dont have to watch that anoying Star Wars Clone Wars opening thing twenty times. Also at the end of all twenty episodes they have real credits (who is the voice of who etc.). I also like watching trailers for things and this DVD has three - The Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the SIth TEASER TRAILER ( not the theatrical trailer which you saw after the O.C. on the tenth of march or saw in the movie theaters with Robots, the Episode 3 video game trailer, and STar Wars Republic Commando's trailer. In addition there is concept art, \\"Bridging the Saga\\" with interviews from George Lucas, Genny Tarkovsky, and various people who made the Micro-Series, two different menus (one for light and one for dark) which come on at radom, good sound and picture quality. Their are more features than that too. It is worth every pennie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"Don't expect animation like the Clone Wars movie, but the story lines are good.

It is great to see that the details of the films were so closely followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clone Wars Glory!","review":"I deducted 1 star because these episodes are too brief. They're over in a flash. But just watch 'em back to back and its cool. (And I say that as an avid Adult Swim fan.) But, it's not THAT much of a problem because Clone Wars ROCKS. This here is Star Wars at it's most glorious.What a shame that the films seldom got this good. And what I'm talking about here is the action and drama that the Star Wars galaxy can really be about when a worthy team is in charge of brining it to life. And I sure dig the style of animation. If future Star Wars stories are told this well, then I guess I'll be into Star Wars for years to come. If we get more prequel level stuff, forget about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Episodes 1 & 2?","review":"A couple days ago I was in Target and picked this DVD up and was intrigued. A Star Wars cartoon....looks pretty cool. I threw the DVD in my cart and continued shopping. When I got home I popped the DVD in and was absolutely and immediately satisfied with my purchase. My daughter loves it as well. It was great to see the different \\"Clone Wars\\" stories being told. I loved watching the ARC troopers sequences and as a side note, I love the Xbox game Republic Commando. This DVD is a must for anyone that has a Star Wars DVD collection or plans on having one. I don't have the Cartoon Network so I can't wait for Volume 2 to be released. General Grevious is amazingly cool in this DVD and I look forward to seeing what happens in Episode III. I've watched this DVD at least 5 times since I bought it 3 days ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Starwars ever!","review":"I'll keep this simple and short. Gendy is a genious with animation, style, and story telling. This adaptation of the starwars universe from the eyes of Gedy is just stunning. He packs more story in just a few min of on screen animation than the entire starwars movies ever did. If you are not really a Starwars fan, Pick this up and give it a view, I think you'll become a fan of clone wars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A powerful exploration of friendships between women.","review":"Small Change is a beautifully written, emotionally challenging book of linked stories about friendships between women.

You will see the subtle tactics and that your anger is justified and that there is hope at the end of the road if you have the courage to be your self!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everbody Wins Here","review":"The core of this film involves a teenager and how he copes with the world around him. There are no simple answers here but a refreshing look at a young man with an abusive and manipulative parent who runs away to a grandfather he's never met. A lawyer takes over his guardianship in an informally way and things evolve in strange and wonderful ways. It turns out that the lawyer coaches wrestling on the side and that his young ward is a champion wrestler! No, this isn't a sports film - not at all - nor is it an \\"angry young man\\" sterotype. The young man is in the simple sentence time of life and we don't hear as much as we feel about him. What is amazing in this mixture is the humor when we least expect it. There are scenes or just snips of dialog that are screamingly funny. The literalists might question if these things would actually happen in real life.Probably not, but who's counting?Curtis Stotlar"},{"rating":"2","title":"a GEM **********","review":"After watching this movie, we want to dig up all the works of T Macarthy. Anyway, how can this movie be \\"R\\" rated? No FRONTAL nudity or devil-may-care car explosions or glorifying thugs gunning it out. All the actors in the movie did well and brought the HEART of the movie to life. For those who hesitate to sample this GEM, do read all the 5 STARS reviews - they described WIN WIN so much better. Because of them, we've discovered WIN WIN amongst the recent not-so-good hollywood dished out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, naturalistic dramedy","review":"One of the more naturalistic movies I saw in 2011. This is, in a large part, due to the fantastic performances all around. It's not an overwhelmingly complicated story... more a slice of life. If you're not a sports fan, don't let the fact that it centers on a wrestler and wrestling coach turn you away. It's about wrestling as much as last year's \\"The Fighter\\" was about boxing. It's only a means to tell the story. What you get instead is an excellent dramedy with a world populated by interesting, well-drawn characters with real-life struggles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming Family Movie; should be PG13","review":"I cried several times. Several were for laughter, and a couple were emotional. Almost every line of the movie was exceptional, either in acting, writing, or both. We were looking for a movie to watch on Christmas day and the kids vetoed some \\"flipper\\" movie that was PG. This had one \\"mooning\\" scene and several four-letter words, but nothing to fast-forward through.The story was absolutely inspiring. The movie plot can be surveyed many places, but please don't let the PG-rating gestapo keep you from watching this!

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Film of 2011 So Far","review":"Paul Giamatti is probably the smartest actor in Hollywood. From \\"Sideways\\" to \\"Barney's Version\\", he chooses (mostly) very good roles that rely simply on smart acting and writing. \\"Win Win\\" is one of my favorite movies in a while, as it evokes the small town joy of \\"The Station Agent\\" with an original story that is accessible to all audiences. Having seen it twice in theaters, I look forward to owning it on Blu-Ray upon release. It's worth every penny. If the people giving awards at the end of the year forget this movie, they are to be shamed - Giamatti, Amy Ryan, and everyone else involved did something special here, and you really should watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg copy of Win Win?","review":"I think it was a fake copy.

This is a really nice movie. Probably not one you're going to want to watch over and over, but a very good story, well written, directed and acted.It is just a very nice evenings entertainment.Watch it, you will like it, then trade it in for credit towards another!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable movie.

I went to stick it on the refridgerator to deal with later and the thing started to slide down so I can't even use it as a magnet. The chrome is thin, leaving it super lite, so it must be that the magnet is not the best. Personally, I would reccomend a completely different brand. That is what I will be doing.

THEN, after using it maybe 2 weeks (but not frequently, only for things I didn't especially care for exact times!), the ringer stopped alarming when it reaches zero at all.

After a week after the delivery date was posted for I received the package and I found out I was fooled. This is not American Idol David Cook this is a Jazz CD. WHATTF IS THIS. I am sooooo mad. Do not order if you think this is David Cook. This is a David cook playing piano and not singing at all. They are making you pay an outrageous $23.00 for a dumb jazz cd that nobody has ever heard of.

For years, I had been searching for a spiritual practice that would augment my art form: poetry. Vivian Laitwood's charming, enjoyable text does just that by enabling one to learn how to do conscious, lucid dreaming. Such dreaming stimulates the imagination, fuels creativity, and allows one to dedicate their artistic efforts to something beyond mere ego gratification,--to a greater spiritual whole.Extremely wise, practical, and humourous by turn, \\"How to Dream Magically,\\" is, for example, helping me appreciate how potent a tool a dream web can be. Another exercise I am finding particularly useful is \\"Befriending your Subtle Bodies,\\" a sensible way to take a weekly reading of one's state of being. Finally the vibrant, sturdy cover is a plus as \\"Dream Magically\\" is getting carried around in my backpack...something I do with the books I really take to heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yup, it's a Koyo ... easy to install, perfect fit","review":"Came nicely and safely packed in a Koyo box. Very easy to install. Only decision is how to handle the side rails. You can either remove the mounting studs and mounting bolt grommets from the rails on your old radiator and install them on the rails on the new rad (will require some prying out of the old grommets and removing a C-clip for each stud, or, simply transfer the old side rails (studs and grommets and all) from your existing radiator to the new one using just 2 bolts each... either way, pretty easy. Then you just transfer your existing fans from the old radiator to this new on (take the old rad and fans out of the car as one unit, makes it easier, 4 bolts per fan, and drop the new rad with the fans into the car .. nothing to it ... one of the most cost-effective and easiest improvements I've made to my '95 Miata ..

However, on the NT workstation/server platform, the ability to perform even simple tasks at a file or data level is very difficult/impossible. MKS toolkit gives you the power to perform almost any unix level command within the windows environment.MKS comes with the VI editor, so you can perform all sorts of wild and crazy editing that is often required for system developers (adding ; to the end of every line etc). It also allows you to execute command level tasks like GREP, and simple things like TOUCH (very useful for web development). All of these commands can be executed from the DOS command line just as if you were in a unix shell (and this product also supports a number of shells)., or build a script and execute it from within windows.In a word, MKS is a must for software developers who know unix, and need the same power on the windows platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"does it's job","review":"While it would be nice if this charged the battery, I still find it useful.

But he is not even a fair writer. Hired to be Robert De Niro's technical assitant for the making of the movie Backdraft, Cosgrove's prose resembles that of a love-sick tween describing a back-stage encounter with a pop music star. Other than knowing that De Niro is famous, and that movies are made, Cosgrove shows no deeper knowledge of his subjects than was presented to him during this experience. Thus, no analysis or depth - strictly a chronological narrative, without any insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book in action","review":"This is not an animated video. It is the book \\"alive\\". Some people hate the primitiveness of this type of format, but little ones don't need high-tech animation or special effects. I must admit that it took me some time to get used to it, though. I like it because I can read the book to my son at bedtime or pop in the video while he eats lunch, and it it the SAME. It is consistent with the original book. This is important because it helps children learn patterns and cause-and-effect. Sometimes if you have a book-inspired video, the video alters the original story. This does not. My son loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for every Muslim - Young and old!!!","review":"This book contains detailed information about items and other things you dreamt about.

Well written/translated this is a wonderful collection of the meanings of dreams.One complaint that I have heard some people have had with this book is that one entry can have numerous meanings, take for example rabbit; it can either mean a coward man, a wife, an evil woman or someone who talks continuously about unimportant matters! Some may see this as a major drawback to the book but you have to look deeper into 1. What the person or object was doing in the dream 2. What the book goes on to say about the person or object and how it can be understood in both the context of your dream and daily life. It is no point reading a dream book and just looking for the 'best' meaning and using that one rather to try and understand what it means to you.A very good book, over 500 pages in all. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ibn Seerin's Book","review":"It is a good book with a collection of lots of traditions within Islamic cultures for dream interpretation.

Interestingly enough, Ms. McClain got signed to MCA at Patti La Belle's instigation, the company's executives had high hopes for her and everything seemed to be in place but the album was poorly promoted and few people got the chance to hear it--which is sad because she is obviously very talented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - devious female","review":"No Spoilers...This is the first Sherryl Wood's book I have read.

When I purchased, I did not realize this was the third in a series and for those of you who have not read the second book, \\"A Slice of Heaven\\", this book does a quick review in the book and may spoil it for you.There were lots of characters and little sub-stories in this book, but none of the storylines were well developed. I particularly had an issue with the main story that featured Helen, a lawyer who is touted as being ethical and highly respected. She does something devious that as a woman I found hard to stomach.

And then there's \\"Wish\\", which makes me think of spooky piano bar music. It's nice to hear that somebody is breaking new ground and NOT releasing a record where every track sounds EXACTLY the same.

What that dear woman managed to figure out back in the 1960s still amazes me. And her words convey a strong, sweet, compassion that Dr. Bourne's \\"Workbook\\" lacks.

I think he rushed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious spoof","review":"I first watched the Godthumb at my friend's house, and although hesitant at first, found that it was a hilarious spoof. Even if you haven't seen any of the Godfathers, this should still be funny for you (but you should know main points in the original film such as the horse's head). The Godthumb, his sons and his enemies all deliver great humor and make fun of the stereotypical gangster, as well as exaggerating conecepts such as Robert Duvall as the Irish adopted son, or Sonny as a \\"hothead\\". I would highly recommend this as your first thumb-action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Being There","review":"If you ever wondered what it would be like to trace the steps of Mark Twain or Huckleberry Finn this is your chance.

The Taureg are the deepest black and to try to relate them to the Celts, well that was quite interesting. In this book, the author aims some sharp jabs at the Romans, British, and the English royal family including Prince Charles. I think those comments also may have been uncalled for.I learned a little about the Celts, but I think I may have to read The Celts by Nora Chadwick to get an objective view of the Celts.

However, Sleep No More can definately hold its own. 'Winters Going' is one of the more powerful tracks, where DJ Signify uses patient constraint with his samples, not falling into the old trap of using the same sample over and over again.Definately a worthwhile purchase.

When you're done, take out the two USB cords (yes, two have to plug in at once), put it back into its box, and store somewhere until you need it.

Previous USB portable drives frequently would not work on some of the notebook computers because the USB would not deliver enough power to run the drive even the drive was advertised to be bus powered. This drive offers 2 USB plugs (one for power only) - therefore on one of my notebooks that would not power the drive with one usb ports plugged DID work when I plugged into the second port on the notebook. Great option if you need it.

After about a quarter of the book was behind me I found myself wondering why I should continue, because the heroines were just as cranky as the supporting cast, and even the cruise ship setting, which had some great promise, lacked sparkle.Unless you have an interest in reading everything in this particular series, I'd devote my time elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick a Fork In It","review":"I've read this series since the first installment, and unfortunately they keep getting worse.Renie, who used to be somewhat amusing, keeps getting more and more annoying. Way too much time is spent on stupidity such as her stuffed ape being \\"kidnapped\\" and her rabbit dressed in a tutu. Her mouthiness and attitude are also no longer entertaining -- the character has become unbearable. And Judith isn't much better -- people talking to her because she smiles warmly at them has long since gotten ridiculous.When you run out of feasible reasons for your characters to be involved in murder and the reasons become as convoluted and lame as they have with this series, it's time to stick a fork in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Man Docking","review":"Well, this was a mystery I had a hard time reading.

After reading the book, I realized that my first thoughts about the book were correct and it was too complicated to be interesting and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Narrative","review":"A nicely produced reprint of the first volume of Runciman's famous series on the Crusades. Runciman was an excellent writer and as a narrative account, this book is hard to beat. Clearly and concisely written with a nice eye for telling vignettes and character summaries. A good complement to this book is the opening section of Thomas Asbridge's book on this topic. Asbridge has a nice explanation of the European politics that led to the First Crusade and the psychology of the Crusaders. Essentially all books on this topic suffer from the fact that the primary sources are largely european, so accounts of the First Crusade are very much accounts of the progress, politics, and personalities of the Crusaders. Runciman, like other historians, stresses the crucial role of the Byzantine Emperor Alexius Comnenus, and the relative weakness of the Muslim states in the Near East. The absence of maps in this edition is a drawback."},{"rating":"2","title":"100 Stories, 8 Stinkers","review":"This is a very DROLL collection of humorous tales...yes, that is not a misprint, it is 2005 and i used the word DROLL.

(The above reviewer who said this CD is reminiscent of Morton Feldman is mistaken. Only the CD's final track -- the most interesting and rewarding track on the CD -- sounds like Feldman.)

I opened the door and noticed that the meat thermometer had SHATTERED in my roast in the oven. Glass was everywhere. On my roast, in the pan, in the bottom of my oven. I was so disappointed in the product. First of it ruined my $15 dinner. Second of all a meat thermometer should be designed and tested to operate in the conditions that occur in the oven.

His words: \\"It's not just for actors, it's for directors, writers.... oh I think everyone should read it!\\" Having logged 25+ years in stage production I would agree: It's a shot of reality I could have used when I was just a snot-nosed kid starting out in the business (although I probably would have chafed at it at the time).

It is so convenient having the current temperature displayed in my system tray at all times. Detailed information for your home location (and for any selectable station as well) is only a click away. The key feature making this product useful is the instantaneous alert for hazardous weather. Once the weather service enters an alert/warning, WeatherBug starts chirping. This has obvious benefits from changing your commute time/route for the day or, in severe cases, taking protective measures before the weather becomes life threatening. It is well worth the small investment.The photos and video sections are a great way to entertain yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Back Guarantee?

My email was answered by an automated email, with a 'Case Number'. I waited 29 days for a response. On the 29th day, I contacted my Credit Card company and disputed the charge.

In sum, it is NOT ad-free insofar as I can tell, and customer support has turned out to be useless. Perhaps all Plus-versions have some advertising despite their claims.

Bully was one of those exception to this. I am very please and happy that I didn't wait. The game is truly entertaining...one of the best games since God of War and Prince of Persia. Granted, those are quite different from Bully in terms of story and action, but nonetheless, it is a game worth buying/playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"different, and good","review":"Bully isn't your typical video game. I can't think of another game like it, in fact. It's sort of violent, but I don't think the violence is anything to worry about. I like the idea of the main character (named Jimmy) having to gain respect from his classmates by pulling pranks. You can perform pranks such as the slingshot (long-time favorite!) and even a bomb in the toilet, if you wish.The game mainly encourages you to fight the bullies head on. This is pretty interesting for those who grew up being picked on. Hey, if you're attending school now and you're having trouble with a bully, check out this game to fight back!Anyway, this game certainly has interesting gameplay. It's unique."},{"rating":"2","title":"YEA!","review":"Thought these days were over til i find my brother in law's PS2 sitting around & i knew i had to take this chance to play again with my top favorite games EVER (this and GTA san andreas) I give it 5 stars, brand new and total badass"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun and addicting","review":"This is probably one of the best games i ever played. It's just like grand theft auto only for 13 year olds. Usually when i play grand theft auto i just kill people and steal cars and such and don't really bother with the tasks. But when i play this game the tasks are really fun and they are not to hard like it is in grand theft auto. i would recommend this game to anyone who likes grand theft auto and to anyone who has young teens and doesn't like a lot of violence. It is very well worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just As Good As GTA","review":"This game is so easy to get into, you don't even have to be a fan of other Rockstar games to enjoy \\"Bully\\". There is just so much that this game has to offer. This game not only features a compelling story, but it also has it's share of minigames in this game. Rockstar has proven that a game from them with no blood and death can still be very addicting and fun. Going to the carnival is probably one of the funnest parts of the game. There is just a lot of variety that will keep you playing for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid piece of game.","review":"Rockstar does pretty well with making little cities to run around in.

If Bully is anything like it im kinda sad I didnt go. It has every aspect of being a kid (slingshots, wedges, kiss and dont tell). The graphics are good for a Rockstar Grand Theft Auto-like game.Could have made the mini games a little more in depth. Also could have made the area a little bigger, but then you would have to come up with a better means of travel.Overall Bully is a very note worthy production by Rockstar. I cant wait to beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun without the \\"terror\\" factor","review":"It's great to have an adventure game without all the blood, gore and terror found in games like GTA.

Definitely a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bully","review":"I really enjoyed this game. It has so many challenges and you can clock in many hours playing it until you have completed it 100%I also enjoy the free roam aspect of it. I like all the little side challenges. The only part I don't like is the bike racing parts. It is not because they aren't well done, It's because I'm just not very good at them.If you liked parts of Grand Theft Auto where the world is your oyster so to speak then I think you'll love this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best video games you'll ever play!!!","review":"I loved this game when I laid eyes on it.

I said \\"I'm going to get BULLY!\\" The person that sold me the game, sent me everything that the original game would have in the box[game case]. I have to thank two people. One, my friend, and two, the seller. Thanks so much guys! Anyway, the game keeps you busy for a good amount of time, it's fun, it's fun, and it's FUN! Down right, straight up, plain, fun!

I expected more... I don't know, pictures, descriptions and more knowledge from a writter with suck skill in the craft. WHat I got was a lot of warnings and cautions (all of which were valid) but not much else to actually guide my learning except to advertise the need to join a group, meet with someone who knows more then me or find another resource that would actually teach something. Really disapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not what I was expecting","review":"Although the book is well written, it was not what I was expecting. Being that it was an \\"bondage handbook\\" you would think it would have more than just a single diagram for different kinds of knots and ties. Nope.

This books talks a lot about what not to do when you are playing with bondages. This is good for those hardcore people who can possibly go out of control and hurt the partner. However, there is only about 15-20 pictures on this 300 pages of book. So, don't expect well detailed pictures and brief explanations. I have a busy life and a long-term partner. I was looking for a book that is easy to follow with many pictures and demonstration of variety of bondage styles. If you don't want to read a 300 pages of lecture about bondages I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor graphics","review":"I bought this book in Kindle version and I read it on iPad mini.

If I were as impressed with Jay as he is, I would not have returned this book after reading only the opening parts. I know from his previous publications that his self-congratulatory writing style irks me, but I also know he has much experience in this topic, and that he brings the added perspective of an emergency medical technician. If ever there were a topic that would greatly benefit from extensive illustration, this is it. The illustrations in this book, as in his others, are few and lacking in detail. To learn complex tyings requires sequences of detailed pictures, and these are not here. One would ecpect to find the very interesting category of shibari, Japanese classical methods, but this is not covered.The veriest beginner could find this book useful, but the advanced person will not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"Very disappointed with this book. It's hard to know exactly how to tie the knot, if there isn't any illustration of how the knot should look. It was hard to know how to correctly do any of the knots or restraints. There was some good safety information in the book, but it was otherwise useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, a little overboard with the safety issues.","review":"Jay did an excellent job with this book. The only problem I see is his overemphisis on safety. I agree that safety is a very important, if not the most important, aspect of BDSM play. But Jay dedicated nearly a third of this book to the subject. He felt it necessary to include a safety note(sometimes paragraph or page) in every chapter of the book. Most of the safety information is relatively common sense. The important safety issues could have been condensed into a small chapter.Bottom line: Good book, very informative. Excellent description of knots and techniques. Over emphasis on safety."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll figure it out eventually....","review":"I found this book to be very informative about the \\"ooh's and aah's\\" of bondage, and a strong emphasis was placed on safety. But I was very disappointed in the lack of direction given. Being new to use of erotic bondage, I was looking for more how to and less conversation about the perks. The product description talked about the illustrations but failed to mention that they only show the end results and don't show the process of tying the knots. I guess it's up to me to figure it out for myself. I just hope the wife doesn't get too bored in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knot what you expected...","review":"With only a half dozen or so illustrations (and not a single photo), this book left a lot to be desired. For someone new to bondage and unfamiliar with knots, it's impractical to think they'll glean a lot from this book, before getting bored.

Her father is also in the drug business, as is his best buddy, and his girl friend.....etc. An honest guy sneaks into the book, but the author does him in quickly so that he doesn't make the other characters look too tawdry.So, what's our Key West, trailer trash heroine (with the attractive feminine nickname of \\"Al\\") up to? She's moving a computer disc with some Vietnam secrets from one bad guy to the next, and she runs into trouble. There are three ho hum action scenes in the book separated by great gobs of filler.I didn't care about any of the following elements of the book: the heroine; her friends; her family; the tedious, hackneyed Viet Nam atrocity plot; the soporific action scenes; or the writing. This, indeed, is one of those books that once you put it down, you will have trouble picking it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic debut for Jenny Siler","review":"Jenny Siler's debut novel is fantastic!!! She writes the thriller genre better than just about any writer I've read, and she gives us an action hero lead character that's a woman -- FINALLY. It's been said there are really only two kinds of stories: the journey, and the stranger come to town. Women have largely been denied the journey in western literature. Well, with \\"Easy Money\\", Jenny Siler gives her beautifully written, haunting heroine the journey, and what a journey Ali Kerry's cross-country odyssey is, filled with colorful characters and tense action. I can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed!","review":"I'm beginning to wonder if I read the same book. Everyone is touting Ms. Siler as the next great author and this book as terrific. I just don't see it.Yes, it does have quite a bit of action from beginning to end. But, the action is so cliche it's just riduculous.The book is told in the first person which seems to be a mistake. As a result, we never get to know any of the other characters in the book except Allie. The story could have been decent with better character development and less Rambo scenes.Overall, this was one of the weakest books I've read recently. I can't believe Im going to say this...I'd rather read Grisham."},{"rating":"1","title":"The heroine should be in jail.","review":"In Jenny Siler's Easy Money, 1998, the \\"heroine\\" is a drug runner, and everyone around her is also involved with drugs. Siler is a good writer, and the dark, moody Key West setting is well done, but I'd have enjoyed the setting and the writing more if Easy Money had been a traditional good guy versus bad guy mystery, in which the detective or police round up all the Key West drug dealers, and put them in jail. I couldn't bring myself to care what happened to the \\"heroine,\\" or her associates.Pros: Good writing; good setting.Cons: The heroine is a drug courier."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Wish I Read This Book When I Started Work","review":"An excellent guide for college graduates starting out in large companies.

The hedgehog is a hard animal to use as a main character since it is not in the farm animal lexicon familiar to small children. I am sure my baby will like this book eventually, but even now at 14 months, it does not hold her attention and she wants to turn the pages much too quickly to get through all the conversation on each page.Update: My litle girl is now 20 months old and has really loved this book since she was about 17 months.

It even goes as far as to have a truck that is the same color in both the film and novel. I'm surprised that no credit was given to this book for the storyline of the movie.

Boys Life was mesmerizing. The Five was invigorating.Stinger...Stinger...Stinger...Not so much. The long-winded chapters at the beginning that painted a stereotypical portrait of a small town populated by a cast of characters out of central casting, centered around the arrival of a mysterious object from space felt like a forced bit of writing whose sole purpose was to educate the reader about who lived in the town and what the core personality of each person was. The story ends up not being told in a fluid manner, and instead of learning about each character through the story and their actions, we're given all their foibles ahead of time and therefore know how each person is going to react in times of trouble.This was poorly paced and a chore to get through."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"Well... i read this book awhile ago, and i must say it was prettygood.

One of the best!","review":"I am a HUGE horror novel fan and I just had to place my input in for this book. I absolutely loved it! Stinger is one of my favorite books of all time. It had all of the right ingredients to make it a classic in the horror genre. The suspense in this story is what I remember most of all. I was literally gripping the pages because I did not want to let go! If you are contemplating reading this book, it is a must! I honestly don't understand any of the critisizm's that some of the readers have posted. I disagree with all. I thought the characters were all well developed and I did not think it dragged along in any places and the story line of the gang war was interesting and original. Well done!! Do yourself a favor and start this book today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down horror-tinged book.","review":"Continually interesting, well-written, reasonably good characterizations.

Intresting Pictures.I would recommend you to buy this after you buy Hitler's U-Boat War by Clay Blair (5/5)(theres two volumes). You read them first to give a good overall (very detailed) (even if you can't spell u-boat) knowledge. This book will add to that knowledge with specific knowledge of specific u-boats. Basically, you want to be an expert to u-boats. Buy these books (mention earlier). You will be on your way. You will blow peoples MINDS.Its a must for the (WW II) history buff's library.

I first picked this book up and read it in 1982 while in college. Some years later I saw this book on a client's office bookshelf...that company was later acquired with a big payoff for this VP. I reread it in 1994 when I spun off my own consulting practice. I have used so many of the tools in the book, they are a big part of my business repertoire. Anyways, I quickly switched over to a niche I found using the Market Gap Analysis (in the book)...raised $18MM over 2 years and the company was acquired for a decent harvest in year 3.

In fact, I have nothing as good on my shelf even today.Much like Dale Carnegie's books, Richard White's book stands the test of time. Anyone starting up a new company will have plenty of advice.

You MIGHT be able to get this as an individual CD. Ghost, included in Systemworks, does both image and partitioning. If you use this product be very cautious about automatic drive letter adjustments -- it's not 100% and definitely not foolproof, nor does the UNDO feature work very well. It does move whole applications easier than, say, cleansweep--but large aps and suites and copy-protected aps are definitely a caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works - if you put (too much) work into it","review":"I live within 7 miles of the transmitter, with a hill and many buildings in-between.

I know he's done some remakes but it's the voice that catapults the song above and beyond the original singer. I just hope that he continues to enrich us with his blend of music and fire for years to come. To anyone that as not heard his music you should buy his 1993 cd titled Marc Anthony -- Otra Nota to get a glimpse into his style he is truly great.

Could be disappointing to some who had PIGMARTYR (under the guise of WATTS) repeatedly on their cd players (like i did) this year. It sure is fun & exciting to hear some new stuff from the Lord of LaRD himself and this disc will probably appeal to new and old hog-listeners; giving a chance to some who missed the first incarnation of this album.

There should be more people like this mensch. This director and Richard Dreyfuss, dare to tell the story of a great man such as Meyer Lansky? Oh Please!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"please!","review":"Who wants to see Richard Dreyfus in a mafia movie? Of all the actors who could have played Lansky, why did they select Dreyfus?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mafia","review":"I found the film interesting because it portrays a mafia boss of another origin than those I have seen in other movies. Lansky is a Jew of Russian origin. This is during the pogroms in Russia, and Meyer's parents decide to escape when the rabbi is being killed while the mob put houses on fire. The Lansky family emigrates to the USA.It is here Lansky meet up with other children in one of the ghettos where immigrants live. It starts with gambling among children, and gradually it goes from there to big crime.I found the film interesting, and mainly so because I find Lansky's story a bit different than most other Mafia films I have seen. Lansky was not of Italian descent (on the contrary to other people I have seen portrayed), and he seemed quieter than other Mafia characters in films.Still, in this movie it is obvious that he is intelligent and one of the leaders of the cartel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"The price reflects the quality of this film. Too many things are wrong with this movie to name. First of all, the script is HORRID, and most of the acting is HORRID, its very boring. Secondly, the actor looks nothing like Lansky. The best part of the movie was the beginning when they showed Meyer and Bugsy as kids. It was all downhill from there. I recommend the BONANNO movie instead of this crap, THAT even had more details and interesting bit about Lansky than this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read The Book Little Man Instead","review":"This film is well cast but this movie fails in doing what it was supposed to do which was be the life story of Meyer Lansky.

This film is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lansky","review":"This video gives very little insight into the life Meyer Lanky led. His is portrayed as a harmless old man who was a product of his time, and simply a gambler.The truth is that he was a murderer and did far more harm than just helping organized crime with his \\"financial Wisdom\\". His actions over the course of his life were far more sinister than this DVD depicts."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Disappointment!","review":"As a big fan of mafia related movies, I was very disappointed with this movie.

It took 9/11 and an axis of evil speech to clue me in but I can remember the faces of boys- and they were just boys- back from Viet Nam.

His Momentum Stock Selection Strategy, and related variations, are quite simple to understand and implement and are really top notch in supplying all aspects of a complete trading system that one needs.His emphasis on money management/risk control using charateristics of the strategy itself make this book more complete than most and Bernstein's gift with the pen insure that every serious reader will come away with new insights into market dynamics.After just one reading I'm amazed at how many MSS plays seem to jump off my watch list of stock charts.

Saw them at a concert a few months ago and was hooked. Didn't even realize Toussant wasn't an original member until I started to look for their past albums. I got turned onto the band from their new sound, and bought past albums and liked the uptempo funk/jazz sound also. Bands should always try to improve and experiment with their sound. As they progress, music in general progresses. The best bands make music b/c they love to play; not necessarily to sell as many records as possible (like all those 'pop' stars out there). Anyways, my favourites on this album are definitely 'Mary', 'Callin', and 'One of those Days'. I will admit, the instrumentals on this album are nowhere near as good as the ones on the past albums(Turn it Out, Doin Somethin, and Soulive are the best). The bands sound now definitely matches its name and I hope they make more albums like this. Vocals intermixed with instrumentals. Great job guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"Soulive is an amazing group of musicians! When I got this album I expected it to be all musical selections; however all but one track has vocals. I understand the need to want to try new things and experiment a little, but this album really leaves the listener scratching their head. The music is great! The vocals...well...you decide. The previous albums had vocals, which in those cases really seems to add to the musical elements, but I'm not sure the vocals and the music jive on this one. I was sadly disappointed with this album, but others may love the new direction they've taken."},{"rating":"1","title":"straight up... no groove","review":"So, Soulive fans get steamed when reviewers don't like this cd because they are comparing it to either live shows, old studio work or preconceived expectations. How about this review then: IT'S BORING!From beginning to end the album takes me nowhere. I don't listen to music to be bored. I listen to be moved, and when this new effort is finally over... I didn't go anywhere.The best thing about 'No Place Like Soul' is the name.For me, it's not the fact that there is now a full time vocals, it's not even the sound of his voice, it's the uninteresting/watered down song writing and composition. I'll listen to just about anything as long as the songs are well written and well played.This seems to me to be a phoned in effort by the brothers when it came to constructing some tunes.Terribly unfortunate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not soulive","review":"Although it's not bad, I am extremely disappointed because this is not Soulive.

First, I looked in all the major retail stores and could not find any Corelle Coordinates bowls like these, at all. So, I was please that Amazon not only had them but had a selection of them. I chose this pattern for its simplicity in design. The bowls arrived unbroken, very protectively wrapped, and the lids fit fine.

We ordered this because the price looked so good and we thought it would be a nice set to have. The first time it arrived the delivery person advised us to open it- sure enough it was SHATTERED beyond recognition (though it made a pretty sound). So we rejected the box. We decided to give it a second go, thinking they couldn't possibly botch the packing twice. Lo and behold the second set arrived - at least recognizable as cookware this time - but broken again. It is so clear from someone who packs and sends items that whoever packed this assumed it was a box of bricks. Many of the packing airbags were FLAT in both cases, but there wouldn't have even been enough to stop breakage even if they were all inflated.

The bottoms were actually pretty comfortable, but the buckle in the front was the ultimate reason I got rid of them. It dug into the front-top of my foot and hurt throughout the day.

I immediately unplugged it and it was several minutes before the iPod cooled off enough to come back on.When I bought it, there weren't that many negative reviews.

I even tried putting a rubber band around the plug and my power strip and that wouldn't hold it on because of the design. So basically, the item isn't worth the $2.97 is paid to ship it to me.

And the clever cable arrangement (with retracting wires) is easy to store in the smallest glove box. I keep my set handy (and out of sight) in my car at home and so am rarely out of a charge on my Iphone.The usb connection to the wall plug allows you to connect many different kinds of usb items to a US outlet.note: a fitted case might be a helpful and more attractive alternative to a small plastic bag, but a bag works just fine, keeps things together and takes up no room at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap price cheap quality","review":"I was excited about this purchase because I really needed a charger for my ipod.

Very disappointed. Predictable ending after the first several pages. No suspense, painfully obvious plot, much of the wording and actions seem out of place for the period. Lacks the clever and astute observations and dry humor I was expecting from a novel compared favorably to Austen. Only the setting and subject (marriage/young aristocratic English ladies) were similar. Superficial character development. At least it was short. Otherwise I would have given up after the the sentence describing a pleasant afternoon pleasantly engaged in ... blah blah blah. I spent a tedious evening tediously skimming this tedious tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incognito","review":"I was a little disappointed in that it copied Jane Austen's style and yet it didn't follow the rules of society in those days.If you love Jane Austen, you might like this book. my recommendation is not to expect too much and its very enjoyable.

Parts are absolutely hilarious, and the author's prose is lovely and crisp. The only real problem I had was that the feelings (even the funny parts) are very modern, and certainly do not bring to mind Jane Austen as some reviewers have mentioned. But like I said, this is short and sweet and you can very certainly do much worse. I will be interested to see how this author develops because I think she has potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASANT...BUT NOT NOTEWORTHY","review":"A pleasant, short and forgettable read.

It talked mainly about how teachers should approach teaching students with multiple intelligences. One thing I did like though, was that Gardner described his seven intelligences. This was more of what I was interested in. It gave me something to personally relate to. For teachers, this book would be excellent, but for an ordinary person, I wouldn't recommend it. It's wordy in the middle of the book, but the beginning catches your attention by describing the intelligences. They also give examples of the intelligences. The examples make it easier to understand and possibly relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that all child educators should read","review":"Although this book came out in 1993 it is current and should be mandatory for all who are involved with human behavior whether in schools or in the workplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but. ....","review":"great bag, but the velcro and flap, and even the straps leave me really confused on how this thing rolls up.

With Johnny's passing, this book takes on a deeper importance and this effort will not disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff!!!","review":"Hi-yoooooo! This book is something every Johnny Carson fan should have. I loved it. The color photos alone are worth the price. It's a fascinating look at Johnny's 30 years as the king of late night TV.

They had a great upbeat sound and Dr. Frank's voice was perfect for singing his astoundingly clever lyrics. I don't know what they were thinking on this album, but all that is gone. The songwriting, while trying to sound more mature or sophisticated, has lost all its charm. Worst of all, Dr. Frank's singing is so bad that even the halfway decent songs on the album are unlistenable. This album is a major disappointment since all their albums before this were becoming consistently better."},{"rating":"1","title":"They slipped off in my ears!","review":"When I first got the headphones (E3c) I tried all of the sleeves, trying to find a good balance between comfort, ease of use, and sound quality. It is important with all of them to insert them correctly to get a good seal, and therefore good sound.I really liked the Ultra-soft sleeves because they were simple to put in, had a good seal, and were confortable to wear. Unfortunately they are so soft they slip off of the stem if they are in too deep. This happened to me twice (I know, fool me once...)! My wife had to get in there with tweezers to get them out. I have read that I'm not the only one. Others have had to go to the hospital to get them out. Beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but could be more intense :-)","review":"Jen is a favourite instructor of mine. Her routines are fun and energetic and this is the same. It's an intermediate workout with basic choreography and lowish impact. It does get your heart rate up a bit and you do sweat a little, but it isn't quite challenging enough for me.It's a combination of classic aerobics and fun latin moves. You learn a basic aerobic move, and then she adds the latin flare to it. I personally have only done this twice but never felt sore or tired as a result of it. I'd use this on a day where I can't be bothered doing much else but still want to do something. It's certainly going to burn off some calories, but advanced exercisers won't be overly impressed with this. Jennifer is motivating and personable like usual, but I hope her next workout will be a little harder and more challenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is dreadfull","review":"I am a fan of Jennifer and I like very much all her videos, the ten minute solution with the band and the one without, and the dance off the inches hip hop party. Unfortunately I didn't like the crunch videos and I really prefer the others. I see my level as an intermediate and a bit of a dancer and this wasn't fun to me because I hated the music it seamed that I was in an arena bullfighting instead of being dancing and this videos have also to many people in the background you get distracted when the camera changes from one person to another. I did it all once and by the end of the video I was lost because I was tired to think about the moves and in this one you really need to pay attention. I tried to do it two other times but the music really didn't got me going."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Instruction!","review":"When I saw the preview to this video, I thought it looked like something that would be fun and fairly easy to follow. It's Not! There is absolutely no instruction in how to do the different dance steps involved in the routine. If you already know Latin dance, you could probably follow, have fun and get a great workout. But for those who don't, don't waste your money. The workout team obviously spent a LOT of time learning the routines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series","review":"Crunch has by far the best series of home DVD's for exercising. I rotate through them almost every day when not going to the gym, and have yet to be disappointed. The moves are often similar, but the teachers mix it up just enough to \\"feel\\" like it's different, and it makes for quick, painless exercising.Jennifer is an excellent instructor, always cheery and enthusiastic but not annoying like some can be. The routines are easy to learn and fun to do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Jen! Her stuff is the best!!","review":"This is an awesome workout. I also have her ballet dvd which is incredible. I have a lot of her stuff - she is by far the best! =))"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst workout dvd ever!","review":"I have used lots of other fitness dvds and this one is the pits. It feels more like the instructor is showing off the moves rather trying to get the viewer to do them. There is no learning time for moves, no repeats and definitely non-encouraging. There are tons of fitness videos out there to try..take my advice stay away from this one. The Dance of Inches \\"Ballroom dancing\\" is excellent so is the Hip Hop party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of Crunch","review":"I'm a huge Jennifer Galardi fan and I own almost all of her DVDs... but this one immediately went in the closet with all my other rejected workout videos. I don't know what it is about Crunch, but I just can't get into their DVDs.

I read a number of reviews about this DVD before finally purchasing it. I am having so much fun working out to this DVD. The moves are sexy yet I still get quite a work out by the time am done. The steps are very easy to follow and am also learning some basic latin moves as well. i will be puchasing other latin moves DVDs for variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never give up","review":"This book is a good book about highschool football, and how good players separate themselves from the not so good players that make up the scout team. The message that came to my mind when I read this book is just because your not as good as the starters and are on the scout team doesn't mean you have to live your life scared of the starters. Stick up for yourself, eventually you will build enough anger and aggression, to stick up for your beliefs and give you enough confidence to lead the varsity squad to a tie for first in the conference, like the character of this book did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely misleading Title","review":"I love international folklore and legends. This book, however, was unable to hold my interest. Too many references to things I don't yet know about Korea and very poor \\"readability\\" made reading a chore.

For all others, rent it once, and then only if you happen to have been stationed overseas at an Embassy. Besides the abysmal writing, the high-school level acting, and the plot with holes so big you could drive a movie through it, the movie has few redeeming qualities other than the vision of an Embassy that was really run like that.You have been warned ;^P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Head Light will lead you into unexplored territory","review":"The world was lucky to be blessed with Trance Mission. This collective of consumate musicians has crafted some of the funkiest dream time ambient world music ever to be recorded. This is music with a distinctly organic flavor due to the use of instruments such as the didgeridoo, bass clarinet, tablas and the human voice. Don't misunderstand, Trance Mission utilize electronic samples and create \\"digital atmospheres\\" on this and other discs, but the music all seems to well up from some deep and primal place despite the use of modern recording technology. Listening to the music of \\"head light\\", I often feel that I am in touch with something vital and ancient.Each track on this disc, from the groovy bump of \\"monk fish\\" to the swirling aboriginal chant of \\"their hands are blue\\", is wonderful. I cannot recommend this disc strongly enough to anyone interested in exotic, world, or ambient music."},{"rating":"2","title":"their best","review":"I fully agree with the other reviewer. Actually, I have little to add to his comments, except to say that of Trance Mission's several albums, this is clearly their best, and the best starting point for appreciating their music. One thing I might add is to note that for a group that falls pretty squarely into the techno-ambient mold, they produce a lot of drama. This is not at all sterile atmospheric stuff, but music with a lot of grit and bite."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is worth buying!!","review":"Alright so I put it in my player after hearing the tidbit tracks on amazon, and I'm in love! The tracks are awesome, from beginning to end. Play it all the way through.The CD defenitely has a jungle feel. The musicians who put this together back in '96 obviously loved what they were doing, and the end result is a MAGICAL masterpiece.I've gone through so many artists sample tracks on amazon, and I must recommend this cd to everyone!! The Didgeridoo is an amazing instrument originating in Australia by the Aboriginee's, and the musician who plays on several tracks on this album is very very good.You will not be disappointed.

This has got to be the worst of the bunch... it has nothing in common with the excellent A+ Exam Cram, except for a few republished questions. The book contains several errors (both factual and typographical), as does the CD-ROM. Some of the practice questions have little or nothing to do with their supposed subject matter - there's a question about printer corona wires on the DOS/Windows exam, for example; many others are horribly worded, ambiguous, or simply irrelevant (CompTIA does not care how many icons are in the Control Panel - they want to make sure you know what they do).With quality practice tests available free for download, why pay good money for four inaccurate ones?

That is, the packaging is minimal, yet safe for the discs, and the menu for the episodes and features is simple, easy to use, and avoids all the stupid gimmicks as though I were a child (i.e. it's a simple list of the episodes, and when you click on your selection, the episode merely begins. No special effects or pretend wormholes to travel through first. This has great value to me). These things alone compelled me to give it five stars.If I were rating the episodes alone, I might sneak the rating down to a four star. Most of them are pretty good, a few are outstanding, a few verge on silly. But this was a very good buy for me. I love anthology shows, and this one is entertaining.

However, when we tried to use the appropriate attachment to fit the IPOD Nano it would not line up to the connector. This means that in order to connect the IPOD it has not support to keep it secure. This becomes an issue when you want to use menu options and put pressure on the IPOD. Very dissappointing to sold something like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for music enthusiasts","review":"Cool features, but just not ready for prime time.

I live in a large metropolitan area (Houston) and there is no dead air and this product needs an empty radio station to work properly. Any loud treble comes out as static if you turn up the volume.

In a plastic bag with a crumped cardboard instruction sheet. SOOOO Disappointing! If this wasn't used, it sure looked like an open box set. I couldn't be more upset. Especially since this arrived only days before Christmas and I had no recourse but to give it to her. She likes it, but said it definitely was NOT in the original packaging - since she got one off the manufacturer's website that came in a box (and for less money than I paid). I highly recommend against purchasing this as I did!!! Bad purchase on my part.

I had a very hard time in installing this device and finding the right way to mount it so that it does not obstruct the gearshift.I encountered a very strange problem in finding the right frequency. The device works fine in the morning hours where I could play my ipod at 85.1. But during evening, though I was able to find many unused frequencies, the transmitter just wouldn't work. I got a lot of static which was unbearable and I had to finally return the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work for me","review":"The item looks sharp, particularly with it matching the white Ipod.

I am quite good with electronic devices, and I can read instructions. I tried this product in 3 different cars, and it did not work at all. The cars were late model Porsche, BMW, and Toyota.My older cars had tape decks, and I was able to use an adapter that worked in the Tape slot for my I-Pod to work, and it worked very well, with very good sound quality. The newer cars only have slots for discs, so a fm transmitter is necessary to use I-Pod or mp3 player in car. Most fm transmitters got very poor revues for sound quality. This one did not work at all. Worse yet, It was returned to Buy Accessories, an Amazon seller, and I have not heard from them or Amazon since. I am very disappointed with the product, the service, and Amazon for the lack of follow through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the money","review":"I have had this product for about six months and have had no issues.

It's very easy to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Older I-Pods","review":"I have an old 40GB I-Pod Photo and this works great for it.My ONLY complaint if I had any so far, is that you have to turn it on/off each time you start the car.It should turn on automatically.Anyway, I-Pod fits like a glove. It charges perfectly. Plays well and sound wuality is good for price.I paid approx $12 and sompared to the $80 dollar comparable items, this is far better and cheaper.Also FYI, this needs to plug into cig lighter so if you dont have room in your car or access to i-pod will be limited, may want to consider another option. There is no extender plug.

I mean, everytime I passed through mountains, or hills ( which were not even that big- I mean, I DO live in L.A. not some remote island), the static started creeping back again). It was so frustrating to have something that finally plays what you want, but to stll not be able to hear it with 100% satisfaction. I returned it the same day I bought it. Hopefully, Apple will acknowledge this problem and come up with some kind of device that fixes it. I'm not wasting my time again with fm transmitters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I bought one of these about a year ago, and use it pretty much every day in my car. About six months into it my right speaker stopped working with the dock.

The sound quality is HORRID; The maximum volume is only about 1/3 of what I can play a CD (or an iPod with headphones at), and the amount of static is very frustrating. I will never use this again. It is so disappointing. Much rather bring CDs in the car. BEWARE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound quality & easy to use","review":"Overall, I am very pleased with the Roadtrip. The sound quality is fantastic! I was previously using a Griffin Itrip and thought the sound quality from it was good, however after using the Roadtrip for about five minutes I noticed parts of music that I normally only heard through headphones. The setup for the Roadtrip is pretty easy. I do agree that the one drawback is the size, it was much larger than I expected. However, it is fairly easy to manipulate into the position you need it to be in and it is nice being able to see the face of the Ipod while driving down the road (in a safe manner of course)."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be okay, but it didn't work well for me","review":"This worked, but the sound quality was very disappointing.

But then it mysteriously stopped transmitting a signal one day, and there seems to be no way to fix it. The thing is poorly manufactured, and for the price you are better off getting an itrip or a cheaper 3rd party radio transmitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning, my ipod stopped working not too long after using it with this device","review":"I had about two good weeks of using this adapter in my car. I used it with an auxillary channel in my sound system and the quality was superb. Then, all of a sudden, my Ipod stopped working after undocking from this device.

I get zero interference. It just works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value for Money","review":"I got this product couple of weeks back and it working as how i wanted it to be.

It got great reception and I had very little trouble with static. After about the 3rd week the screw came loose on the adaptor. Now it turns off all the time without even touching it. It is very frustrating while driving! I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Perfect! Cheaper than having the expensive systems installed.","review":"This is a perfect and inexpensive way to enjoy your iPod during travel. It has extensions to adapt to any vehicle and is really simple to use. I live in the Berkshires and the roads are rough but it has not affected the music at all. My mother spend $130.00 on the installed ipod unit and I only spent $14.99! Her mistake. I can not tell the difference between the sound quality of her system compared to my little inexpensive Roadtrip. I highly recommend saving yourself the time and money to have the installed systems put in and keep it simple with this little device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not again for an ipod touch","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend to use with his ipod touch (3rd generation I believe). He was really excited to finally have one, but right out of the box it wasn't living up to its potential. The sound quality was pretty good, but everytime he hit a bump or took a turn the ipod would fall out of the docking station and onto the floor. I can't manage to contact the seller to try to return it, but luckily it was only $18! Now looking into another car charger/adapter, my mom has one just like it and loves it! Great reviews too!!

And when turning the car off it will start the Ipod if it was already off, so you have to turn the Ipod off again. For $5 or $10 that i paid you could say, what did you expect. But i would rather have paid $20 and got something that works the way it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transmits fine but doesn't recharge iPod 3G","review":"Just bought this for the car. It seems to transmit fine over the radio, akin to other MP3 player FM transmitters I have used in the past. Minimal static/noise and good signal transmission. Controls are easy to use and intuitive. However, the iPod 3G gives an error message saying the device does not support recharging. I will return it since that was a crucial function and main reason I purchased this item. Otherwise would give 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"Seriously, even at $15, it's not worth it. This is just junk.I tested it in three different cars and with my home stereo, and across the spectrum of the FM band. Signal strength is not a problem, but the quality of the sound is pitiful. FM radios used to have a mono selection for when the stereo signal was weak, and that got rid of a lot of the noise at the cost of losing the stereo. This sound quality is like bad FM stereo."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!","review":"My husband bought me one of these for my birthday.

LOVE LOVE LOVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I recently bought this and used it for the first time on the road trip this past weekend. I absolutely loved it. I travelled from Detroit to Indiapolis and I never had to change the station. I preset the FM Transmitter to 88.3 and it worked great with occasional disturbance (like one or two on the 300 mile trip). It also provides a nice plave to hold your iPOD and charges it as well.Loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"Very disappointed in this product, although I don't know if there are ANY good FM car solutions for an iPod. The RoadTrip looks good but I found it very tight with a 30G second generation (I believe) iPod without any insert. I've only found one decent FM setting that works in my neighborhood in the suburbs of Columbus, OH, but lost that about 3 miles from my house. To me it isn't worth pulling over to find a different frequency, if one even exists, that will work, retune the radio, retune the RoadTrip, etc. Way too much hassle for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I gave it five stars because it works great, in the car and at home.

I'm very happy with this purchase. It was a wonderful investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than Nothing, but not much","review":"I am disappointed in the quality of the sound. I have used it in two different cars. One has an average radio, the other a Bose radio. Neither car sounds very good. There is distortion from the signal if you turn the volume to an inspiring level. If quality of sound is important, do not buy this. The transmitter is simply not strong enough.I am not satisfied and regret spending the money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coolest iPod accessory","review":"This transmitter makes your car iPod-friendly in a most painless way. The adjustable attachments make it possible to set it up with just the right angle to read your screen. I have used it in both my cars - one needs the extra length attachment due to the location of the power outlet. You can change fm stations to get the best reception. I tried another device that only tuned to one station and it did not work. I live in the Seattle area and have no problem finding a good station. In keeping with the clean white iPod design, the device looks good. Unlike the other transmitter I tried which had the iPod dangling at the end of a power cord, the roadtrip seats your iPod securely. I am very happy with the performance of this product and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well - I will look for other options","review":"I've read several reviews about this item needing to be at full volume on your radio to work. I've tried it in 4 different cars. In each car, the transmitter actually broadcasts at a slightly different frequency than selected (for example, if you select 100.1, the radio actually picks up the signal on 100.3) and the volume is extremely low with poor sound quality. Some reviews say it works great - my guess is the production process is very low quality and you're taking a gamble by purchasing this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product for ipod nano in a case!!","review":"I purchased this product and promptly returned for the following reasons:1. The only way my nano would fit in this product is by taking it out of its iskin which is not fun to do and totally defeats the purpose of protection.2. I have a Jeep Liberty and where the cigarette lighter is in my car prevented me from being able to use the RoadTrip and putting my vehicle in Park!! Even with the extending arm it was still awkward.I ended up purchasing a Belkin tuneFM which just came out a couple of weeks ago...it seems good so far and is very user friendly as well as compatible with an iskin or case that has an opening at the bottom for the USB and headset jacks. Also, this product does come with a car charger so that you have the option of charging your ipod nano when necessary!!This product seemed like a good idea since it charges it and holds the unit all in one but it just wasn't compatible with my set-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Pitch Hum Unbearable","review":"I have two major beefs with my unit, which I've had for about 7 months:1) About 60% of the time, there is a low-pitch hum that occurs independent of the frequency, ipod being used, or vehicle being used. The noise makes my music unlistenable. The noise is accompanied by the frequency display flickering.2) As the unit has aged, the support arm and all of the pivot points have become loose and the thing flops all over the place.I have sent an inquiry to Griffin support and have not heard back yet (only been a day or so). When the unit works, the sound is as good as expected for FM. But I only get it 40% of the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I needed...","review":"Not being an audiophile, I find the reception on my Griffin I-Trip to be quite good for me. I like the extension arm, as my minivan's lighter outlet is at an awkward position. The sound is great, and my husband likes it much better than his Belkin transmitter. The price is significantly lower than on either the I-pod site or the Griffin site. Definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be doing something wrong","review":"I bought this along with my Nano and I am severely disappointed in it. I read all the reviews posted here prior to my purchase. I live in Tucson, so I figured it would be okay since we certainly don't have as many stations as LA, Boston, NYC, etc.Well, I have tried EVERY station on the transmitter, and there's static on every single one of them. I cannot imagine I'm doing anything wrong, and the Nano works fine with my portable speakers, headphones, etc., so it's gotta be the unit.I guess I'll try another transmitter - this one isn't working for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for audiophiles, but very convenient!","review":"I was very pleased with the quality of construction. Seems pretty sturdy and durable. Works perfectly as intended. There is only one negative, and that is the sound is not the full range. It lacks the depth and clarity of a CD by alot. My best workaround is to adjust the EQ on the ipod to the \\"classical\\" setting (although I listen to all kinds of music, mostly metal). Still, not perfect sound, but, hell, it was only $9.95, and at least I can get all my iPod tunes on my car stereo now!

I shopped around and this is by FAR the best deal!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but difficult to use","review":"I love that this product works great through the radio and charges the ipod at the same time. The thing that's most difficult is that my outlet is in an place that makes the itrip really inconvienent to use. It's extremely bulky and doesn't fit right. I actually had to give mine away."},{"rating":"1","title":"i got a used one???","review":"I got this Roadtrip system with a pretty decent price, however, this again is a lesson learned that do NOT trust something with a price out of market range. If it's too good to be true, it's not true. First impression on it is it's definitely not a new one. With a crappy box and stained product, i think it must be a refurbished product which did NOT note or mark anywhere in the description. Instead, it marked \\"new\\". Haven't got a chance to test drive it yet, i hope it won't let me down again with its quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice unit","review":"works well, clear sound and power to overrun FM channels, holds the i-pod very secure fits in most places"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful, but Narrow","review":"There are other places for the information in this book. I was disappointed and would recommend other references over this one. More detailed information in softener operation, RO operation, etc. would make this book a definite plus. I won't call it useless, but, it could be improved. Handbooks should provide detailed information in a ready format. On a few occassions, I found water treatment data in this book. But, not in any depth. I found myself going to vendor data which defeats the purpose of a handbook. Also, detailed worked out examples would be highly useful in the next edition.

They played in clubs, bars, and then one day one man named Brian Epstein asked them to play their first concert in Hamburg, Germany. The Beatles ran into a few problems like fighting over songs. Paul is my favorite Beatle because he is the lead singer and guitarist.I can relate to the feelings of success. When I learn a song without the book on my guitar, I feel successful. I like the book because it is about a band and I want to be in a band.I like the book because all the characters were interesting.

Refreshingly, nobody in this book is an \\"angel\\", altho there is a devil. The characters are allowed to be human, to screw up, to mean well.

It was very nice while it lasted, it has 3 timers with 3 different sounds so you know which one has gone off, but the magnet is much weaker than the old one.

Not any more!The West Bend 40053 is a cheap (read China) imitation of the previous model. The method of setting the 40053 timer is user-UNfriendly, whereas the previous model was simple and straightforward. The magnet and clip on the back of the 40053 creates more problems than it solves - i.e. takes two hands to set the timer, it is unstable on a countertop, the magnet is small and inadequate for vertical mounting, (I could go on and on.) And the icing on the cake -- it malfunctions right out of the box. The clock resets to 12:00 AM when the beeper goes off. The only way to reset the proper time is to remove the battery, wait a minute or two, reinstall the battery and reset the clock.In a nutshell, Do NOT buy it. You will be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"good timer, i like it","review":"it is a good timer. it works very well.

If you use TurboTax, and then get audited within 7 years, you probably won't be able to reprint or modify your tax return - since it is likely that you'll be using a different PC by that time.

Tax Cut has been an easy transition and they have no activation/spy ware programs that stay active.Note that TurboTax's web site still does not disclose that their activation software stays resident in your computer's memory.

The Stereo MC's clean the track to straight-up funk quite spectacularly, with a groovy bass that loses none of Jhelisa's non-chalant vocals. (Supposedly, this track convinced Madonna to let the Stereo MC's remix her.) The Headrillaz go for big beat breaks, incorporating a sample of a woman who is--quite literally--crazy. So instead of everybody jumping off, when they hear this track, they'll more likely be jumping up."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"this seemed like a good idea for when it was bedtime for my puppy until she could be completely housetrained.

Problems varied from not staying powered on, to forward and reverse buttons turning off the unit rather than doing what they are supposed to, and also the memory malfunctioning so that when I turned it off or paused it and turned it back on, it picked up at a totally different location.

So I got a replacement.This current one was fine for 10 weeks until it would shut off even before I could fully power it on. This only happens 75% of the time, but that is definitely inconvenient, since I don't know how to prevent the incidences.Aside from my negative experiences, its wonderful versatility is suitable for most activities... providing it works.The problems I'm having are seemingly unrelated, and since I've followed the manual for usage since day-1, I doubt its my fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 6 months","review":"I bought this MP3 player in March to use while working out.

The short of it is that this album is the epitome of pure electronica: Sundial is a work of beauty. It swirls and sweeps, slowly building to the point that it invites the listener to consider what she/he is hearing without ever destroying the boundary between the work and the listener (which contemporary electronica does not do, with its insistence on immediacy).

I have taken this camera everywhere. It's gone cross-country, parties, close-ups (flowers) and generic people pictures and everything comes out great. It's a great transition camera and gives you lots of room to grow. You can have it work as a point and shoot and it will do basically everything for you, or you can use the dial and it will adjust for close-ups such as flowers or distance suchs as mountains, etc. It also takes a beating, I've unfortunately dropped and banged it a few times and is still ticking...with no problems. Basically, this camera is easy to use, takes awesome pictures and gives you plenty of room to grow. I found a uv lens is a great add-on and helps protect the lens. The 70-300 ultrasonic lens is also another great add-on. This is one of the best toys I've ever bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"um","review":"I love my new camera .

It would take a much more expensive camera to make a notable difference in picture quality. I've owned Nikon cameras all of my life(and still do) and love them, but Nikon doesn't really have a comparable camera to the EOS in this price range.

I give 4 stars because and only because it comes with it. I strongly recommend the potential buyer to purchase the body only package. I am sure you will soon get frustrasted with the 28-80mm lens although it is cheap. When you want to take a further step in photography, it would be locked into your store room as it has no longer suit your need.In addition a lot of useful extra feature is embedded such as a built-in flash, various programmed mode.

It depends what you are looking for in a camera. I wanted one that would be strictly for shooting people like a professional. It has a lot of features that I don't exactly need, but turned out to really enjoy. It takes absolutely excellent photos of animals. I tested it out at a dog park, catching greyhounds running full speed. It froze their action. What I don't like is the way it shoots people. Once you figure the zoom out, it is so clear, that it's unflattering. It's sort of like not the ultra expensive professional camera, and not the point and shoot simple camera. I would definitely recommend it if you want a sharp camera that does a wide variety of shots. It even has a twilight mode that you can shoot when it is near dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant experience.","review":"This is a very versatile camera, it has all the features that me, as an amateur photographer needs, the shots can be adjusted as you desire and it allows you to play with it, so let your imagination fly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter camera for the serious.","review":"Great camera for a beginner photographer who wants to do serious photography.

I also felt the plot was thin, but that is generally true of Golden's books. They are mostly one tiresome fight after another arranged along a predictable story line with no characterization at all.

The surprise at the end was that the doctorswere wrong and she was in fact three months pregnant. Surprises like this area poor trick used to enhance the main characters' problems and instead ofresolving the problem by coming to grips with a very difficult situation,instead dissolve them so everything is solved without any real personal growth.This book uses the same sort of trick with the claim of hero's death.I could forgive this, except the people in this book don't act like real people: it ishard to sympathize with people who don't move on.

It was actually quite boring. Not the plot, but the writing. I don't even know how I feel about any of the characters because they were all so...flat. Julie had no personality whatsoever. Shelly, her daughter, was dramatic and therefor quite annoying at times. The only person who had any feelings, or who we ever got to see into their mind really, was David, and he's taken out of the story because of the surprise ending. The story, though, jumped a lot in time, and I eventually just gave up because I couldn't keep going back and forth so often. It caused a struggle to make sense of things going on in the present.

I do love how my daughter exclaims \\"They want to hold the baby!\\" when she sees the picture of the adoptive parents greeting the Tummy Mummy and baby with outstretched arms. The prose is a bit stange to me. Sometimes it rhymes, sometimes it doesn't. I do like the calm 'feel' of the book, but I think it borders on somber.

I read to the end hoping there was something to love about this woman and at the end there was one small glimmer of hope that she would find some happiness but the reader knows in the end it will never be enough to save her soul.Everything in this novel is graphic and ugly and I am sorry I purchased it.

This is a quietly spectacular novel about a brief but life-defining moment for Sabine, a young American exchange student in Paris. Struggles in class, language and culture, and the juxtaposition of personal history with the present, are the makings of this character-driven story, and it makes for a wonderful read. One of the themes that makes this a haunting and relatable story is the loneliness of a young person making adult decisions and living with the consequences. I found myself thinking about it for a long time the book was finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"book review","review":"I never ordered or received this product. I do remember only viewing it. I have always been satisified with amazon book purchases in the past. My book club rejected this selection for a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Paris","review":"I was disappointed with this book. To begin with, the main character is unsympathetic (even after finding out about her awful upbringing), uninteresting and most times stupid. She sleeps with anyone and everyone she meets. They could basically run into her and she'll let them have their way with her. She's attacked several times while walking all hours of the night. Every man in the book is a vile, disgusting person (except for Abe, but we never find out what happens with that). I am all for flawed main characters, but I don't care about Sabine. I never root for her. I actually end up feeling like she deserved the mess she got into and she pisses me off. The whole thing is depressing and a bigger story never pans out. The author has a talent for putting words together nicely, but storytelling is severely lacking. The book is also too short to be taken seriously. It's more like a novella. Unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This may be the worst book I have ever read. I am an avid, open-minded reader who reads many different genres. Every book I have ever read has captured my interest in one way or another, carrying me through until the end. This book, however, did not. I could not finish reading Failing Paris, putting it down 25% completed, never to pick it up again. It is one of the most poorly written books I have ever had the displeasure to begin reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful","review":"Worst book I've ever read. It was slow starting out but many great books are, so I kept reading. Half way through I kept asking myself why I was wasting my time but I kept hoping for a miraculous ending. It never came. The main character is troubled and struggling to find herself and her place in the world. That in itself is ok and could have great potential, but it was never developed into anything great. The writing was not particularly good either. Everything in the book just seems to drag on and on and on. I highly recommend focusing your efforts on something more productive and engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed to Read!","review":"Failed to read Failing Paris when the first paragragh reveals the heroine is up for an abortion.

It wasn't really what I expected, with not much of a story/plot. There was a lot of French words/phrases, but the author usually included the English translation."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Impressed","review":"This book is an unsuspected jewel!Heartbreaking disillusionment on discovering that speaking French as truly as a native Parisian, which all her young life offered the certain promise it would unlock wonderful doors in the Paris of her dreams, is not the key. For by the time this New Mexican girl arrives, she is emotionally no longer in any condition to enter via the front door, but slides instead as one dead, from one sleazy encounter to another through the back door of Paris' basement.This description in no way describes the absolute beauty of the writing, the format, the lyricism, the seemingly endless number of words and phrases that run and slide like a waterfall onto each page. Contrasting life-episodes almost collide. It is so well done. A uniquely,carefully, evocatively written book with no false notes.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book","review":"I felt that this book was rather boring.

The narrative style keeps you at arm's length from the character, and after a while you want to shake her and say, \\"Snap out of it! You're in Paris! Get a grip!\\" Sadly, she never really does.

It is the view of a character that embodies all of our own self-doubt, risk-taking, self-destruction, re-evaluation, and eventual reformation whenever we find ourselves thrust into a situation far from our comfortable front porch. A view of a young person struggling to find the correct/moral/survivable path when faced with a personal crisis far from home...This first novel speaks very forcefully to those of Dunn's generation, with images/questionings easily taken from their own life, resonating with their own personal trauma at being born at this particular point in history in this country that is struggling to find an artful way of living in the blur of post-TV white noise, and global culture babel.The fact that this is a first novel, makes us glad for those to follow. Truly a contribution to the art that makes our lives worth more than the sum of our daily activities.Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris on the Edge","review":"This is a wonderful, if hard-edged, story of one young woman's experience in Paris. Unlike the myriad books out there painting a rosy picture of (name any European country here), this portrait is more intimate, more gritty, and much better written than most you will find in your local bookstore.Here, the character is unsure, struggling to find herself, some friends, and her way in the world. She hides a lot from others and herself on this journey of discovery, but each scene is truthful, compelling you to go on. This is a coming of age book, with all the clouds of vacuousness gone. It's the real story of a real American girl in Paris, lumps and all. I loved this book and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's An Okay Read","review":"The book is okay, it's not what I thought it would be.

What I find so intriguing about it is that the author, Palle Yourgrau, writes a very scholarly exposition about how Godel viewed time to be ideal rather than real against the backdrop of Einstein's concept of the universe as a four dimensional manifold.

I have had it for probably 6 months now and did further research before using the recipes in the book. A lot of the \\"stew\\" recipes call for pasta (which we all know is a simple carb, not found in nature) and only a small amount of meat compared to the rest of the ingredients. What I've done is adjust the recipes I choose to use by upping the meat amount by 3-4 times and eliminating all pasta from the recipes. I include all the veggies/legumes/brown rice as suggested as these add essential vitamins/minerals/antioxidents. I also feed this as my dog's PRIMARY diet, without the kibble that the book suggests. For breakfast, my dog (16lb bichon frise) receives 1/2 c. of stew and for dinner he receives 1/2 c. of stew plus 1/2tsp a powdered dog vitamin supplement that I mix in.

The cord grip seals at the cord but around the outside where the cord enters the transformer it allows water to get in. The transformer is potted with a black tar mixture, but it is poorly done and water gets into the electronics and shorts it out. At about $100.00 each this becomes expensive. Buying just the raw transformer means you have to make some kind of container to put it in. Since this option still costs about $65 you don't save very much. If I could buy the raw transformer for around $20 (which is all it should cost), then it would pay to make a container to put it in.

Even the violin in the slow pieces give a rendition feeble, devoid of strenght and intensity, and also in the fast piece is a little strange; but on the other hand it's a considered and refined choice that could be appreciable.

In two of the cans I found multiple pieces of bones, just straight little pieces that really hurt if they jabbed your mouth. In the third can I had what appeared to be an entire round fish scale.

I saw my first Peter Lorre film at age 27 (and fell hopelessly in love with the man) but like the author says, the book is mainly about her childhood and adolescence. Sharp writes about love, old movies, divorce, friendships, sex, families, Catholic schools and various obsessions with a great deal of humor, wisdom and sensitivity. Whether or not you're a Peter Lorre fan isn't the point -- if you have ever longed for a lover who is always there for you, who is real and yet mysterious and uniquely attractive, you will relate to these stories. I found I couldn't put the book down. Highly recommended!

I have always had larger stereo speakers, and I was afraid that these 3.25-inch drivers would not produce decent sound, especially at higher volume. I was pleasantly surprised by the sound that comes out of these little guys. They are well-made and they have a lot of power. They produce great midrange for being so small and the sub rounds out the bottom end well. I've turned the volume up much louder than I normally like to listen to music or movies and these speakers still sound surprisingly clean, without the distortion and muddiness you would get with lower-end speakers.

I couldn't tell the difference between the Polk RM6750 and the RM705 so I couldn't justify the added cost, Sure the RM705 kit looked cooler but worth the extra $200 i would have spent.I am using my Polk RM6750 kit in my 13.5' x 14.75' living room which opens up to my kitchen and this thing is perfect especially when I am on my couch with the speakers around me.

Despite her lack of success, I respect how she humbled herself to shower praises on other artists, including Aretha Franklin, who she accompanied on numerous of her classic recordings. This book also shows the struggles that she endured as a struggling performer raising a family.

What is worse, it is clear that some of the authors -- William Irwin chief amongst them -- who simply do not understand Seinfeld, even within the context of the show itself. Far too flighty for the serious student of philosophy to treat it as a valuable resource, it is also too obtuse for the lay reader to gain a good amount of insight. What is worse by far, however, is that too few of the authors find a way to use the show to bring a lighter touch to their own writing of the material covered.

Thus, to advance yourself, you have to get help from your neighbors ... who, never forget, are also playing to win. Thick skin and good sportsmanship are necessary to deal with the inevitable treachery, but having to stay on your toes at all times is what makes Diplomacy so exciting. As for the educational aspect, it got me interested in the history leading up to World War I. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A better Risk","review":"This game is what Risk wanted to be as a kid. NO longer will you have to watch as your massive army melts away due to bad dice luck. However, you better watch out and make sure your \\"allies\\" dont turn on you. Diplomacy is a wonderful strategy game. Its emphasis on negotiation and international intrigue makes it fun time after time. Just dont play with someone who is annoyed at you! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Strategy Game Ever!","review":"I have long been a fan of strategy games such as Risk, Axis & Allies, etc. I've been big into them for close to forty years. My only problem with them was that I am the most unlucky person in the world when it comes down to rolling the dice. I love that the combat in this game is based completely on numbers and not on the luck of your rolls. It's all about your ability to read people and your powers of persuasion. We usually have a pretty full game of 6-7 people, and we devote an entire day to it. It's the kind of game that doesn't feel like it takes that long because you're constantly talking to different people, gathering intelligence, and crafting backroom deals. Overall, if you're looking for a group strategy game, I have found none better than this gem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A kids version.","review":"This is the best board game i have ever played, it is educational, it is realistic, and everyone should have the oppurtunity to play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sobriety, sobriety, what have you ever done for me?\\"","review":"I picked this up just because of the CD cover which shows a sexy but scorned (we can only guess) woman who looks like she's just been dumped, scolding a man who's walking towards us out the door of a diner.

The technical support for this product is inferior as well. You have the option for pay-per-incident (which means you pay for technical support even though you already paid for the worthless product) or you can email tech support for free but it takes a minimum of 2 days to receive a reply and the quality of service through email is horrible.

I like the filtering and time restrictions, but thats where the pros end. The internet time usage feature does not work and customer support have not been able to offer any help. When I enable this feature the internet is totally blocked upon logging in. Also this program is an all or nothing program, meaning it completely blocks all internet use at the times you plug in, which maybe useful for a family with young children less than 8. Myself I prefer a program that will allow access to the inetrnet for specific programs that I allow for homework etc and then restricted all others. This is not possible with NetNanny at this time. This coupled with the non functioning options within the program and annual subscription rates prompted me to rate it at 2 stars.

I normally like Fern Michaels, but this was almost unreadable. The main character was a despicable person - shrewish, nasty, petty and weak. She cried all the time, was mean to her father for no reason and had no backbone. In terms of the love story, it was just ridiculous. Olivia and her love interest, Jeff, were engaged inside of 2 weeks - the majority of the time of which was spent sleeping. Pretty much every evening ended with \\"and Jeff was sound asleep on the couch when she got back into the room\\". The story had so many holes in it, and was completely improbable. I wanted someone to just shake Olivia and tell her to stop acting like an idiot the whole time. To cap it all off, the writing style was juvenile and superficial. Overall, one of the worst books i have read in a long time. Do not let yourself be fooled too - avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"How about no stars?","review":"This was one of the worst books I've ever read, and I LOVE to read.

Don't waste any of your life reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is my first selection from this author and I'm weary of choosing another book. I found the whole plot a little ridiculous. The writing style was not what I would have expected from someone who has published as many books as Fern Michaels has - maybe a first-time author, but not an established author. I think this book could have used a couple of edits before going to print, because it did have potential, but I won't be recommmending it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much like a previous title","review":"While I have been a fan of Fern Micheals for many years, I found this book to be predictable and improbable. The story line did not seem well researched and the main characters fell in love way too fast. Also, the plot had too much in common with her previous novel Annie's Rainbow. While Annie's Rainbow was unique and interesting, this book seemed to be rushed and poorly written. It smacked of being written to make a deadline. Fern Michaels is a much better writer than this and I was quite disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finished","review":"Ok, so I love books, but not this one. It dragged on and on... The story is a cute one, but the writing is awful! I'm had a hard time concentrating and liking it at all (and I usually find the best in everything or at least good in everything).Also, the author doesn't know how to write dialogue very well. The conversations between the characters in the book are so unrealistic; I haven't heard anyone talk like that over the age of 3 or 4 years old. Very quick and to the point, not believable at all.Don't read this book, it is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pick me up book for broken hearts who happen to love dogs.","review":"This was the first Fern Michaels book I had ever read. A friend gave it to me, insisted that I read it, and then let her know what I thought of it. I had just ended a long term relationship. It was a tragic ending to nine years. I also had other unforseen tradgedy occuring in my life. I believe my friend knew that this book would help me. It took me from my own problem infested world and brought me into another world.

Good thing that I only paid a quarter for it at a used bookstore otherwise I would not be very happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Editing","review":"While I suppose the story line is good enough, the major bloopers in the audio book were very distracting. Supposedly the ring leader bank robber and deceased mother of our heroine, was named Allison Matthews. She married Dennis Lowell. Yet, at one point in the story, a baby bracelet is found that says \\"Baby Matthews\\". Since Allison and Dennis were married, the baby bracelet should have read \\"Baby Lowell\\". Shortly after this mistake, the audio book refers to Dennis as Dennis Matthews. Verrrrrrrrry distracting!!! I don't know if the written novel contains the same bloopers, but even if it does not, this is not a well-written novel. I agree that the minutia we had to hear about (related to Olivia Lowell's day to day, breath to breath, mundane chores) was boring to the point of frustration. I have enjoyed Fern Michaels' books in the past, so it leads me to wonder if this was one of her first novels that was just not published until later. Either that or the editor fell asleep at the wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Must Have Been Late on a Deadline","review":"This book reads more like a first draft than a finished product. Perhaps the author was late on her deadline. For example, the main character calls a near stranger at 11:00 at night and demands that he come over to discuss a dog, without much of an explanation of why she decided to do such an outlandish thing. Shortly after that, she loathes that she isn't assertive enough.This isn't the first book by Fern Michaels that had me asking myself why I am still slogging through it despite the dry delivery. Before, the plot was intriguing enough to keep me interested. This time, I should have stopped.This isn't the first book by Fern Michaels that had me asking myself why I am still slogging through it, despite the dry delivery.

She is compelled to repay a debt for her mother and tries to track down 2 of her mothers old friends and accomplices in a bank heist. Why she does this is beyond me, the crime happened 40 years ago.

We're both reasonably intelligent people, who play chess, bridge, and other involved games. We do enjoy a challenge.But this game was beyond reason, with pieces that had powers that could only be used if an unlikely set of events occurred and others with such a hideous appearance that we didn't even want to use them. Maybe if someone had a huge interest in the grotesque or had nothing better to do than to spend weeks learning a board game with over 205 characters, each with different moves, powers and abilities, they might enjoy this very strange game.I wish the rating scale had contained a zero, so I had not been forced to rate it as high as one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the FLintstones","review":"Looking forward to ordering another season.

This tool looses it's ability to pick things up when the rubber tips break off or are lost. I called MEDLINE several time thru customer servive but you think I was asking if cows flew!!! They HAD NO CLUE. All I wanted was replacement tips for their pick-up tool. Yes just two little rubber tips for their tool. AGAIN THEY HAD NO CLUE. DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THEM. So the result is a great product but cannot fix it when broke!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"I received this reacher as a gift when I broke my ankle and could not reach things very well. I find it very awkward to use and it feels clumsy. The very tip of the pick up part does not meet when you close the jaws, making it impossible to pick up very small items. It does not have a locking feature which is helpful sometimes. I purchased a \\"Pik Stik\\" which I find to be far superior. It has a gun type grip and it has the locking feature. It is strong with an aluminum shaft and the jaws grip well including the tips which close and allow small items to be picked up. It also comes in several lengths to suit your particular needs. The jaws can be rotated and locked increasing it's usefulness. The Pic Stik is also less expensive. I do NOT recommend the Medline reacher. Go for the Pic Stik and you'll be much happier with your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Hold Up","review":"I have had two of these Medline reachers. At first they seem like they are heavy duty, but I have broken both of mine with seemingly ordinary use, that is not trying to pick up things too heavy or too large for it. I use it exclusively in the kitchen to retrieve things I can't get with my PicStik.First of all, the rubber tips came off the first one, reducing its usefulness. A short time later one of the grabber arms broke.Since I liked the style of the device I bought a second one. In less than a year the plastic bar that you pull on to close the grippers cracked and pulled out of the bar that attaches to the grabber arms. Maybe I can scavenge enough parts from each to make one complete one.I have had other grabbers far longer that have not broken. It is too bad these Chinese-made grabbers are so cheaply built, because the design is useful to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO GOOD!!","review":"I broke this reacher the first wk I bought it:(:( My PIC-STIK is still on the road.

They've just revamped the mission system, making them more challenging and visually interesting.There's also a thriving social scene--people actually go to clubs to hang out and to dance. And despite the game's mascot, the fuzzy little dweller of the newbie zone the \\"leet\\", the game is populated with largely intelligent people not given to d00dizm.There's no question that while still overlooked, Anarchy Online is among the best of the MMPORPGs along with Everquest, UO, and Camelot."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could you do this to me","review":"First the origional game is bugged. now the booster is riddled with bugs too.

The battle system can be a bit confusing and they lack clarity when explaining it to some extent. It is a difficult game but nothing overly hard.The game's real downfalls are its graphics and music. The background music will get old fast. After an hour you'll want to hurl your gamecube into a wall. The graphics, while some think otherwise, aren't that great. The game does not use the gamecube's power.All in all the game is a let down. If you really wish to give it a go I suggest renting it before you buy. It is by no means a game that is a must have.

You can capture anything(except bosses) in any level in the game(monsters also vary by level). The graphics for the summons are excellent.

I will admit that I thought the graphics were pretty good and the sound was nice too. The gameplay was horrible though. Your only way to attack in this game is by using magical playing cards. This was a big drawback for me. It would have been really cool if the cards were used for bonus attacks and specials but not for everything. The one thing that I really didn't like was the fact that you can quite easily run out of cards. If this happens then you have no way to fight.

The writing though seemingly well-researched (as far as the cast of characters is concerned) is simplistic and insulting to an adult reader with more than a 6th grade education. Her theory on the mystery is contrary to most published accounts and so offers a fresh perspective, yet it is an improbable and honey-coated approach to a great mystery and likely terrible crime. Her lead character Nell's freedom of movement and accessiblilty through all barriers, borders and boundaries is absurd.

Low and behold after about 20 dry-fire shots, the line busted with an ear-shattering pop, and was slowly leaking air. I've used other brand remote lines on my Tippmann A-5 before, I've just never owned one of my own. And those worked great. This however was a sore dissappointment from a great reliable company that I've come to love in my 8 1/2 years of playing paintball. Bottom Line: DO NOT BUY THIS REMOTE LINE. Tippmann's markers are about the only thing you can trust from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional remote line","review":"For those wondering, this is tippmann's H0-1 remote line, not the connex.This remote line works great if you know what you're doing. You will blow an o-ring out of the quick disconnect if the remote line isn't completely degassed. I have blown a few o-rings, but no use in complaining, you can get a 10 pack of any o-ring for a dollar. It's also hard to screw in the on/off asa to the rank. Other then that, I haven't had any problems yet. It acts as a great regulator for CO2. It has a solid build, I haven't had any leaks yet. I wish tippmann had provided instructions or some sort of owner's manual, even though usage is pretty self-exclamatory. I do not reccomend usage of a remote line to speedball players because it restricts mobility.Overall, the remote line is great, but 4 stars because there's nothing special about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This item is HORRIBLE !

So they can't call it \\"green\\" when PTFE is known to be a carcinogen. Stay away from ScanPan unless you want to cook your food on a carcinogenic surface.

The non-stick lasts no more than 3 months if you are a typical user. Was able to go no where fast calling their tech support number. They just kept me on hold forever and had to give up. Plus these pans contain PTFE in their non-stick coating, which is on the EPA list so buyer beware. Don't overpay as you will be stuck as I was outside of the 30 day Amazon return window, on hold forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"These pans are temperamental","review":"For what you pay (a lot!), my pans didn't remain stick free. My pan developed patches of discoloration and stayed that way. Eggs started to stick, even after having followed directions. I don't think I used the pan on too high a heat, but the pan seemed to have reached a certain temp that's just a little too hot for it, and eggs starting sticking like glue. Nothing suggested helped. To me, this pan seems temperamental and unforgiving with regards to temps. A few degrees too high and it loses it's non-stick qualities (my experience)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"My girlfriend has cystic fifrosis and is understandably cautious about her health. She wanted a nonstick pan that didn't use teflon and release the toxin PFOA. I did a pretty extensive search on line for green products and consumer reviews. This pan does not use teflon and tied with two other makes in Consumer Report for the highest non-stick rating. I bought the smallest, least expensive one for a trial run. This pan has been great! We have cooked eggs, onions, even cornbread in this pan and nothing has sticked. We have also used conventional metal utensils with out a mark. This pan has deivered on all it's claims. We couldn't be happier and plan to buy more to add to the set. The only downside is that these are expensive but is worth it since you don't have to treat it delicately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrades a great deal with use","review":"I gave this pan a 5 star rating when I first started using it. I was looking for something instead of Teflon pans that I had to keep replacing as they degraded with use. Initially the pan performed beautifully. I noted, for example, how I had to chase eggs around the pan because my spatula pushed them rather than slipping under them. It was not much later, however, that I noticed that it did not cook omelets well. They tended to stick and I still needed my Teflon pan for those. Overtime the situation has gotten much worse. Now I need to use it as I would any ordinary pan with olive oil to keep things from sticking. It's still an ok regular pan, which is why I still give it two stars--an ok pan but no longer does what it is supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome pan","review":"i love the Scanpan Professional.

Since all but the bottom is covered by nonstick there is no problem with aluminum to food. Heats quickly and evenly. Makes beautiful pancakes. The non stick is very effective. I got it for my daughter but it didn't match her smaller all clad stainless non stick, so I got her the all clad and kept this one. My daughter preferrs the all clad handle and I agree.

I love not having to use much, if any, fat when cooking in it. I don't recommend frying eggs in it cause they get a little rubbery, but plenty of other things are great like frozen gyoza, veggie burgers, shrimp, vegetables, chicken, etc. It's an especially great pan if you're looking to healthy-up your cooking. Take good care of it, don't scratch it, and wash it very gently with a small amount of soap.

Use it every morning to make breakfast for wife and 3 kids. Use it very often for omelets and general cooking. Still has a non-stick surface and very happy with it. Just have to use common sense.

We'll buy another one if/when this one dies."},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't last very long","review":"I bought this pan about a year ago, and in the beginning it was great but after a year of moderate use it's surface becomes very sticky basically garbage.

There, I said it.I typically go through a new (10-12\\") non-stick frying pan in less than a year. I bought this one to test it out...I heard the Scanpan line was awesome and needed a smaller pan to cook my own personal diet foods (while the rest of my family hogged down on spaghetti bolognese and pasta dishes).It is perfect to cook a few eggs, a piece of fish, your own personal little stir fry, and whathaveyou. And here's the kicker: you don't need hardly ANY oil. I use an olive oil spray and that's good enough! And here's the OTHER kicker: the clean up ROCKS. You don't HAVE to clean up because 99.99% of your cooked food will wind up on your PLATE instead of stuck around the sides of the pan. Imagine that?!!Once my 10\\" and 12\\" pans die (I might accidentally drive over them) I'm going to invest in the next sizes up in the Scanpan Professional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pan!","review":"After hearing rave viewers I just had to try out this pan. It lived up to everything I had heard. This in the BEST fry pan! I absolutely love it. It makes cooking a dream. The handle is comfortable, nothing sticks to them and they are easy to clean. The ceramic surface is amazing and doesn't feel rough like other nonstick pans. I feel good knowing that there is no teflon that is flaking into my food.

It try's to download the entire installation from the SnapStream web site, even though there is a installation disk included. If your web connection fails the installation trashes your system and you will need to reinstall Windows. I have Windows XP SP2 with a flakey internet connection. Although I am computer literate, after two attempts to install this product I have chucked the whole thing out the window. P.S.

There is a good user community that is doing a lot of cool things with the Firefly. Set up is simple and the range is good. It \\"just works.\\"The only suggestion is that the buttons are not backlit so it's hard to use in the dark. Adding to that problem is that the remote is pretty much symmetrical so you can be holding it upside down and not really realize it. If it weren't for that I'd give it five stars, and if they came out with a version that had backlit buttons I wouldn't hesitate to upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Firefly Remote","review":"I have used a few remotes with my PVR system but none as quite as nice as this one. Most of the PC remotes I have used are either too large, clumsy or tiny and get lost easy.This remote fits well in your hand, weighs enough to feel comfortable and has a very nice layout. The large firefly button takes a bit to get used to. I have hit this button a lot by accident bringing to life an unwanted application. Once you get used to the large button being there you can avoid it. If you could change the function of this button to something useful like the application of your choice.. or perhaps the TV guide in SnapStream's Beyond TV product.On the plus side -Responsivelong battery lifebuilt ruggedGreat fit for your handsmall and compact without losing any functionalityOn the negative side -The big firefly button does not allow you to change its function to anything useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"A \\"Non-book\\" is right","review":"This book does not offer much. It is a loose collection of weak anecdotes, impertinent and out-of-context quotes, and references to data and articles one could easily collect from the internet in a few hours. Entire chapters are simply quotes from news articles. Chapter 8 quotes a 2002 article from People's Daily and an essay by a law school professor - that is the entire chapter. Chapter 12 quotes an article by the editor of The Reaper newsletter - again, that is the entire chapter. Not a shred of meaningful analysis. Not a hint of a cogent argument. It is clear that the author has little understanding of or training or experience in real estate. It is senseless to argue over the points of the book as other reviewers have because the book has no points; it simply has cursory and sometimes misleading references to points other people have made. There are much better books on this topic out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product and service","review":"1 star because there is no Zero Star rating.Buyer beware! what you see is not what you get.

Absolutely the best I have seen or ever expect to see -- Step by step suggestions to get you exactly where you need to go, maps and more maps, and a small language primer. The thing that puts this book above the rest is that it gives you a complete historical story behind each destination. I came away with beautiful pictures and the history to go with them. This book even features short day trips outside of Moscow. The Rough Guide pocket sized language primer (available from Amazon) is also an essential. Take these two books and prepare yourself for some of the greatest times you will ever have. P.S. -- Check out the new edition"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide book; necessary for all visitors to Moscow","review":"No one book has more information than this one, and it's simply the best all-in-one traveling companion available. But it isn't perfect. Personal anecdotes and incidents sometimes seem amateurish, and Moscow changes so quickly that some of them are now quaintly outdated. The maps are minimal to the point of being useless; the best maps are in \\"Great Moscow\\", \\"Three Days in Moscow\\" (if you can tolerate the outdated street names), or one of the building-by-building atlases now available (all of these are published and available only in Russia).

Haughty Spirit is certainly a fun book in the terms of Anne Rice's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" trilogy, but the story is simplistic. Sharon Green's fantasy novels usually have much more character development and intrigue - making them impossible to put down, and worthy of a dozen re-reads. This book was a one-time read and then I actually gave it away - something I NEVER do with her other fantasy books (in fact, I usually require a Deposit of valuable property just to BORROW them!).Haughty Spirit is good for a rainy Saturday night with no date, but it certainly qualifies as the least impressive of her works to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Willful goddess learns lessons in humility and beauty.","review":"I have read just about everything Sharon Green has written She does better when she sticks to fantasy fiction. I found Haughty Spirit contrived and predictable. I was surprised to learn that this book was considered erotica. It is just a mediocre attempt at selling sex with little story."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"The novel was Sharon's first attempt at writing for a certain \\"specific\\" audience. It was not, in my opinion, written for the sex as much as it was for the discipline and D/S aspect. I believe this for several reasons but mostly because the company that published it focuses on the D/S genre.I enjoyed the book and I found the discipline scenes very hot. There were a few scenes that jump to mind immedietely as excellent. It may not be her best Fantasy work, but I've reread it quite a few times and I still enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"it's hard to buy some albums of X in U.S. and most of albums I found via Amazon.Japan cannot be shipped to addresses outside of Japan.Among kind of few albums I can choose, it's just something below average.lots songs in the albums sounds odd and kind of different with ones I hear somewhere else.very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb decision making in order to stay clear of bad guys","review":"I didn't like this book very much. I tried. I like much of the old Patricia Potter books, but this era isn't makeing the grade. There were so many repetive thoughts of whether the phone being bugged, people diving in front of others to \\"save\\" them, oh my goodness a horse being shot ( I have four horses so it was just how the event was overwritten), making dumb mistakes when there are bad guys out trying, maybe, kinda trying to kill people. If the author took out the references to the above the book would have been much shorter.There was too much telling and convincing words instead of a real story. Save your hard earned money for a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use","review":"I have never used anything but the granuals.

The Hungry Moon is one of my favorite novels from that time (the other is Ancient Images, also highly recommended)... Fantastic, well worth tracking down. I recall that interview made mention that John Carpenter was interested in making the book into a movie... That would be pretty interesting, but I don't see it happening anytime soon. Still, we have this terror-ific novel, and that is already MORE than enough!!! In short: get this book, and give yourself a treat. To this day, I still buy Ramsey Campbell's books and treasure the memories of gooseflesh and shivers I got on those warm summer nights, when I first discovered his exceptional works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way of the Wolf, A Way to a great series","review":"A plot that was well thought out, great character development and the action in an easy flowing read, for a new avid reader such as myself, is a wonderful read.

I was interested by the story line when I saw this book in Barnes and Nobles, but now I wish I could get my money back. It had do real depth or interesting happenings that encaptured its reader. Given I have only made it a short way through the book, yet I am not going to torture myself anymore...I was in denial for a while, hoping that something big and exiting would happen, bit it didn't...I am used to character development like Paul Atreides in Frank Hurberts \\"Dune\\". When compared with a master sci-fi writer like Frank this seems like a childs book.I say: Why spend the same amount of money on Vampire earth as Dune when Dune will give the reader infinitely more pleasure? I do not reccomend this book to any reader who is in search of a deep, meaningfull, developing, and enlightening story...I hate being negative...but sadly that's the reality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Paper","review":"When I originally heard of this series I thought that it would be one that I'd liked, however after reading the first one, The Way Of The Wolf, I'm greatly disappointed.Knight creates an interesting and somewhat unique idea for a world, and borrows from Lovecraft somewhat, which is a good start. However he spends way too much time giving you background info over and over again. There's no character development at all. In fact the main character Valentine has no real personality and is very one dimensional. Overall there is no real plot to this story, it is a series of episodes spliced together and when you think he's going to start taking it beyond the training sessions or background info but it always ends too soon.A story that goes no where."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undecided","review":"This book left me with many mixed emotions. The episodic nature of the chapters made the narative seem fragmented and would completely take me out of the story. I love the concept but the execution was too off-kilter for me to say that I actually enjoyed the book. I am seriously debating whether to try another in the series to see if the clumsiness of \\"Way of the Wolf\\" is due to it being a debut novel or if the style is just that way. Definitely borrow this book before you buy it. (or get a cheap used copy)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start To A Series!","review":"This book grabbed me from the start and the ride never ended. Friends of mine recommended this book and being a picky reader, I was reluctant to buy it at first. I finally gave in to curiosity and peer pressure (my friends raved about it) and bought the book. For those expecting a traditional Vampire story, you won't find it here. It has an imaginative twist to the Vampire myths bundled with plenty of action and sci-fi elements.

I typically have bought the curry in the bottle at the grocery store and this is far superior. Living in Vermont we have few stores that sell such varieties and I am grateful to have Amazon offering such product. The curry is fresh and delicious; my only minor complaint is the packaging.

The book is set out in very logical fashion and has useful exercises and songs that progress in difficulty in a very intelligent way. The songs are more of the very old style county blues (not what I anticipated). However, it is an excellent fingerstyle guide that I highly recommend to any beginning fingerstylist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beginning book","review":"I bought this book because I love country blues (mostly stuff before 1940), but I thought it was beyond me. I'm a self taught player who picked up a guitar about 2 years ago. I got this book in December, opened it in late January. By the end of Feb. I was able to play all of these songs and figure out others by ear. Now it's August and I can play around 35 blues songs from piedmont to delta etc... I'm very happy with it. A buddy I hadn't played with from December until March was blown away. He couldn't believe how proficent I became at playing fingerstyle blues in such a short time.If you want to learn the blues this is a great book and it lays a great foundation. For me it's the one and only instructional blues book I'll ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...","review":"...but the writers missed the most fundamental step of all when they wrote it: they jump write into a discussion of fingerstyle exercises without giving any kind of instruction about HOW to go about picking the strings with one's fingers, i.e. the exact techniques and methods. To the writers and to most guitarists this is probably obvious, but true beginnners will be lost. Otherwise this is a useful book, but for blues enthusiasts who just want to play guitar and have never really picked one up before, I would suggest taking this book to a guitar teacher and letting him/her go through it with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is AWESOME","review":"Just to expand a little on what previous reviewes have said, this is an excellant book! I purchased it based upon some reviews at acousticguitar.com and am totally satisfied.I just received it and listed to parts of the CD. The book really holds your hand, so to speak, and builds on some excercises to get you up to speed in no time at all. You learn some fingerpicking arpeggios in the blues style, and in 10 pages they have you fingerpicking some cool blues rhythm.I have not gone too far with this book, but if you KNOW the BASICS (E chord, A chord, D chord, yada yada) you can really learn the basics. Just follow the well defined instructions. You can't go wrong with this book.I would definetly suggest listening to some CD's from some other Blues artists like Taj Mahal and Ry Cooder. Get the feel for the music and you can get in the groove."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good practice book","review":"Helpful book for widening your repetoire, for beginner-intermediate level.

She described it correctly but after returning from putting me on hold first asked if I could send pictures and then informed me that once put together it could not be unassembled and that there was nothing that could be done.

With Unleashed it was the inability to adopt a pet from Old Town after the first time and have the pet trainer train it. Fortunately this is fixable with a patch from Aspyr, but unfortunately when I reinstalled it I forgot to download the patch before I installed Makin' Magic. Luckily I remembered that one of the websites I used to frequent before it became a pay site (http://www.simslice.com) had something that could sort of fix my problem.My only words of advice are: After installing any of the Sims games search on the one of the main Sims websites, Aspyr, to see if there is an update or patch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unleashing the fury on my iBook!","review":"The game itself seems great. The pets are adorable, and I love the idea of an expanded neighborhood. My problem? Every time I attempt to go Downtown or to Old Town, the damn game crashes. Reinstalls and removal of all downloaded files does nothing. This is a bit frustrating for one who has played these games on PC without a hitch.You'd think a G3 700 MHz iBook with 640 MB of ram would be more than enough power for this game, but even when I boot up and don't do anything else, the game crashes.

There are more chips also, and if you liked the chip traders in the first game then you are going to be very happy with the chip traders in MMBN2.

The authors have tested each recipe extensively and found the best way to make not only soup but international favorites like Green Curry, Japanese Noodle Soup, and Cioppino. I couldn't bring myself to return the book to the library without ordering one to keep.

This is about the sins of the past haunting and taking revenge on the descendants of a family line. And it get where it really hurts ... the babies. This is a sick twisted look at how far pain and dispair will take you and how the love of family will cause someone to survive at all costs.

A nice mixture of styles and musically it feels solid however vocally the singing style seems uneven especially during the latter have of the CD. It feels like Erin Welton is having trouble singing or just simply out of breath on some songs. I'm not sure if this intentional or not but in other songs she flawlessly executes the track without erring. I also have issues with some of the more poppy accessible tracks tracks that sound like retreaded 90's alternative/electro-pop of Curve. They seem to use this as a jumping point for their fourth album Ablaze which seems to forge ahead into full on traditional pop/rock style and less synthesized dreampop or shoegazer songs.

Plus, the new defense items really add something. They help you get away from the zombies which, by the way, are not such pushovers this time. For example, if you have a grenade defense item set, and a zombie or dog gets you, you stick the grenade in its mouth and pull the pen. Poor zombies! lol This game is worth buying the Gamecube for, which this is exclusive to. So is the upcoming Resident Evil 0 and Resident Evil 4. This is by far and easily the best Resident Evil yet!

Well if you're sick of those third world graphics and bad sound get the resident evil remake. You'll be happy you got it but if you or one of your children get night mares easily do notget this game. Because if your not easily scared you'll be scared buy this game. The reson why it's fun is because the fear factor is so high and the graphics are the best. So when you play this game there will be creepy music and the zombies are so tuff and it won't just take two shots to kill a zombie. So this game will defenatly send a chill down your spine.

The graphics have to be the best that has ever been(with the exception of RE 0). The graphic changes from the original to the remake are simply breathtaking. While zombies look like colored-in walking blocks of annoying sound, the new zombies perform a too-smart-it's-almost-scary movement. The enviroments I could just stare in awe at for hours. This is a very challenging game with high replay value. There will be moments where you will piss your pants and go \\"Holy sh**! What the hell was that?\\" and sounds that will make you pause the game and go \\"Holy sh**! What the hell was that?\\" Never have I played a game with so much graphic detail and great gameplay at the sametime.

The look of the Gamecube version of this game is spectacular.

I mean I could make the choice not to buy, but then again I couldn't could I because I love Resident Evil.The game is a little hard for someone with my skill level, but for others who are highly skilled it probably won't be.This game shines above it's previous installments and makes you wonder if you actually ever played Resident Evil at all once you play this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Hard, BUT worth it!!!","review":"I just got this game and it is so awsome.

I think I decided to buy it because I was so amazed that they made a remake of 3D game. When i was 7 or 8 i bought the first resident evil used at a rental store. I thought you would battle zombies in a enclosed area. I was terrified the first time i played. I remember when jill's freind shoots off the zombie's head. Maby the zombies should die this way. This is one of the parts where the game is stupid. In the new game a zombie backs you into a corner. So what does you charachter deside to do? Fall down and trip. That was a great idea!! Lets do it again and again and again. Maybe house of the dead is more my type. In RE is you try to turn around and run away and when the zombie finally gets near you you have to turn around as slow as a blind cow with a broken leg on sleeping pills whose drunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Resident Evil Ever","review":"If you are a Resident Evil fan, and you don't love this game, then there is something seriously wrong with you.

Adds to the legacy and fully utilizes the Gamecube. Both a great game for new players and old. The graphics are outstanding, and even though I played it many times before on PSone it still was very scary. Some of the new additions worked. The new zombies were cool, and so was the new layout. The new boss was o.k. and seemed to be tacked on. Still the best game I have played for GC cannot wait for RE Zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good graphics and sound.....","review":"Shame about the rest. I picked this game up eagerly expecting something to blow me away. What I got was a slow moving, badly controlled character who cannot move and shoot (thus leaving her open to easy attack).

Tedious, yes, scary - hell no) there is absolutely nothing to offer in gameplay terms.

It has the best graphics ever, even better than Final Fantasy X. It's all been changed so even old players of this game will have a new experience and new gamers will have an even better time. And remember, all Resident Evil titles are exclusive to Gamecube, so if you don't have a Gamecube, you might want to get one. Resident Evil will come with two discs because there are too many movies for it all to fit on one disc. You can either play as Chris or Jill so you can experience the full game with both characters. If you have or haven't played the first Resident Evil for Playstation, you should get this because it's a whole new experience from the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone help","review":"Is it just me cause my computer says Resident Evil 0,1,2, and 3 have been discontinued.

I am a fan of horror games and I had never played the original RE. My copy only came with the case and discs, no manual. I'm unsure if this affected gameplay. I had to consult walkthrough's, but I often do with RE games because they are hard, but back to this game. The graphics are stunning, the story is creepy. The outdoor areas are messed up. A Hunter or 2 jumping out of a door in my path made me jump a few times. Although this game is epic, it can get boring, because the mansion is just so quiet and once you kill all the monsters, you'll just be doing mindless chores, running all over the place. There are a ton of puzzles to figure out. I'm a grown up and this game was challenging. Don't let kids play or see this! Replayability is a low, but for any survival horror fan this is a must to play through at least once, and have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"This game has incredible graphics and the zombies scare your pants off every time. This is more than just a remake, they added a new zombie called a crimson head that comes back to life unless you cut its head off!

The only thing i have to say is WOW this game fully realizes the gamecube graphics chip. This is the reason to get a GameCube."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let the terror begin.....again","review":"With all the hype that's been surrounding the videogame market within the past 5 months. Nintendo fans nation-wide will soon have their chance to taunt and tease owners of either the PS2 or XBOX. This game has to be seen to be believed. Everything has been revamped and remodeled to take advantage of the Gamecube hardware. All the voice acting has been redone and greatly improved to eliminate that once unpleasant sound of the characters talking. New areas and prerendered backgrounds (that look as if they're all done in real time) open this title up for a whole new age to enjoy. Human or genetically altered, anyone will be able to find a reason to be finally proud of saying they support Nintendo.If you're still reading this at this point, then I don't know what the heck is wrong with you.

And the sound can be very eerie. Typical RE fare. However, at this point, when I pick up a RE game I want to be able to shoot at virtually everything. I was frustrated many times by a lack of ammunition, coupled with even more frustration that sometimes a regular zombie would require 9 or 10 rounds to permanently knock down. [And that is even all that permanent]. I'm also growing very sick of the inventory management function of the games. All those dang keys and crests and obscure items (not to mention kerosent and a lighter now) to take up your inventory. Fortunately Capcom seems set to solve this for Resident Evil Zero, and IT'S ABOUT TIME. If you like challenges and having to assidiously conserve ammo, you will love the game.

Also you had the weakest gun it had like 10 bullets to shoot at the zombie then you would have no ammo, and it takes about 50 shots just to kill one.They also had the two characters if you pick the ladie she starts with a gun and the other guy starts with the sucky survival knife.All of the doors are locked over 75% of the time.[...] This is not a game you shoot zombies you just run away from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great remake of a great game","review":"Capcom has done a great job with this, they have expanded on the mansion, added on dozens of new rooms.

This is a must buy for any fan of the RE series, or for anybody with a gamecube who is curious as to what Resident evil is. This game is essentially a remake (With major editing) of an already great game (remake of RE1 on PS1).

This is a completely new, and much better game experience. There are very familiar scenes and monsters; however, the level of play, graphics, and cinemas are beyond what I had expected. This game has great mood settings for a wonderful horror game. From the rumble of thunder, flashes of lightning thru the window, to the cawing of crows, the sounds in the game make you feel nervous and terrified. Then throw in a great, scary soundtrack where the music is placed perfectly; and I will never want to hear the \\"Moonlight Sonata\\" ever again after this game.

The Bible only convers Weblogic Versions 6.0 and 6.1 but it has a lot more information on Server Adminstration from a Developers perspective then this book does.For example if I wanted to know how about Parameters or options for deploying JSP, this book will not get you there but the Bible will.Same thing with JMS in my opinion.The Bible has more information on both pure Administration and Administration from a Developers Perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little insight ......","review":"In my opinion this book contains too many step-by-stepprocedures (in tedious detail with diagrams), but containsvery little insight into the reasoning behind any step orchoice.

(Previously I was running Weblogic5.1)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing useful except for beginner level!!!","review":"A book on WebLogic 7 Server Admin should not be written like its for a complete novice. Instead of q book for real admins, the content is actually dumbed down from the BEA docs which are hardly useful in themselves. The style is do step 1, step 2, etc. It doesn't explain the technical issues involved in making various choices and how they affect the server and its applications. Explanations when they do appear are brief and pretty much the same dribble that's in the BEA docs. This is first and only book I ever returned to Amazon. I regret that some of those giving good reviews either don't know anything about server administration or have other motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"only book out there covering 7.0","review":"If you're looking for a book on version 7.0 this is the only book out there.

The 1934 movie called No Greater Glory was only 73 minutes and was a little more complete than this one. I think that this movie should have been over 100 minutes in length just to tie up some loose ends. For instance I would of liked to have seen a little more of the father in this movie. There could of been a good prologue of the boys youth to introduce the rest of the movie. In all I think a fifty cent movie has been inflated to an amount of over Twenty dollars. Don't even buy this movie until you have at least rented this movie and judged for yourself whether it is worth the purchase. To sum up it would of been better had the script been expanded and altered for showing on a dvd or a movie screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Amazing Book about Bees","review":"This is a special scientific book, for the author tells the reader not only WHAT we know about the inner workings of honey bee colonies, but also HOW we know it. Through simple but graceful writing, accompanied by many diagrams, Seeley takes you on a step-by-step journey through his experimental analysis of how the members of a bee colony work together to gather the nectar, pollen, and water that they need. I think anyone interested in seeing how a human has dissected the complex internal organization of a bee hive will find this a rewarding read. I especially liked chapter 6, where Seeley explains that the bees have several kinds of communication dances, not just the famous waggle dance, to activate more bees for making honey."},{"rating":"1","title":"The kindle version has no images.","review":"I was excited to find an eBook available for this important work and purchased immediately. I found out when reading that there are no images. When the text refers to a diagram, there is no diagram and the ebook tells you to refer to the printed version. That does not work for me since I do not have the printed version.The images and diagrams are a very important part of this book and the decision to leave them out seems to have been poorly considered. If I had the printed book at my disposal then I would not need or want the kindle version.

I needed more basic information about lipid land. I was looking for simplified description of biochemical processes not an overly simplified generalization. I had to refer to other biochemistry and nutritional text to understand what the author was refering to. I would not recommend this in place of a good biochemistry text. When complex processes are first introduced, detailed explantions of conversion processes are needed to get the depth of understanding. The map in the back was a strong plus. It took all the body processes and joined them together to show interactions among the chemical conversions. This was the strong point for the entire book and I might have purchased the book just for that. This was a recommended text for a nutrition class, but the instructor admitted she would not have recommended this had she looked through it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"A too simply and vague way to describe \\"biochemistryland\\".

I read it in about 1 1/2 hours. Although it has some good tips, at this point is is quite dated. It is also a very general book on the executive assistant's role and if you're looking for more in depth, there's a lot better out there particularly some of the books out there by Joan Burge on being a star assistant. After reading into it, it starts talking about personal assistants (for celebrities and such) which again was very generalized in nature. I'm sorry, but I don't see how you can justisfy $74 for this little handbook. It's MAYBE worth $20 - and that would be if it would be revised to current standards - just the section alone on computers is quite laughable because it's so old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great resource!","review":"I found the book very helpful.

They aren't in 3D and the idea of them having infinet axes, swords, arrows, knifes, magic, and bombs is stupid. It should be more up close fighting unless you are an archer and even then you shouldn't have unlimited arrows. The game should be more like Enclave or Zelda and you have to find or buy the stuff. You also shouldn't be able to buy stats, they should just increase as you get a higher level.

This is not spoken Portuguese, this is illiterate Portuguese.Some people can afford indulging in inverted snobbery. They join in with the uneducated and use illiterate forms of speech when they talk to tem. Then they revert to the educated language in their own jobs, their social circle.

I don't think it rated any higher. Be careful that you check the game system requirements;if your computer is not new the program won't run. The music is impressive, the graphics are good, but the game itself is horrible. The tutorial mode isn't really a tutorial, and you have to figure out the game for yourself. The senarios are very difficult, and you don't know how to improve. The game has no comments on how to make your airport better, like in other games. You just have to guess what the programers want you to do. There seem to be a few technical problems with the game, and events happen for no reason. Overall, I would buy more tried and true games like Roller Coaster Tycoon, and if you happen to have money and time to waste, then buy this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less gameplay than the original","review":"I am absolutely dumbfounded.

UNfortunately, that didnt happen. This was a complete letdown after the surprising hit of the first one. Airport Tycoon 2 was completely backwards; frustrating controls, annoying messages, bugs, bugs, and more bugs. They even took the control of designing your own airport away. You didnt see the airplanes taxi down the runway and tarmac which I liked in the first one. Again this game was a complete letdown. It didnt get any better when Airport Tycoon 3 came out. Hopefully there is #4 and will be much better but I havent heard of anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful!","review":"I think perhaps Airport Tycoon 2 is the worst game I've ever played. In fairness, I only played it for about an hour before I got so sick of it I gave up. I rather doubt I'll ever play it again.Airport Tycoon, the original, was a very limited game that still managed to be a little bit fun. Airport Tycoon 2 successfully removes everything that was fun in the original -- watching your planes and trucks drive around the airport, for example -- and gets rid of them. Even more astounding, the user interface and gameplay problems from the original have not been solved -- in fact, they've been made worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst tycoon","review":"Airport tycoon 2 looks like a really fun enjoyable game. Thats what it looks like on the back of the case, but beware it is one of the worst games I have ever bought. I could kick myself for buying it. Thought it was going to be good. The grapics are bad. When you build roads they aren't visible and break up in pieces in different areas as you move, then reappeare. Its a very good idea for a game but it really is a bad game.

You will never get the first turn, the enemies will always get 2-5 turns for your one. It gets to be very frustrating losing simply because the other team is getting 4x more attacks than you.

Come on, real historical names/places would have made it 100 times more enjoyable.Second, and most important, the fighting is TURN BASED! What a stupid idea; your character stands there and basically does the same move, then stands there and takes a shot from the other guy. Then it has this whole complicated movement system that is totally unbelieveable and even more un-fun.Don't waste your time with this one; I gave up after about 45 minutes and popped Madden back in the console.

My 14 year old son and me play Axis and Allies Guadalcanal (and D-Day) and were looking forward to a larger version of that highly playable game. This game is Guadalcanal on steroids and requires a huge chunk of time to understand and play. As an example, the resolving combat rules are nearly four pages long with no graphic examples (that made these rules very confusing). The complete rules are 35 text intensive pages long.

On the face of it - and ignoring the 2012 prophecy, which uses some pretty tortuous mathematical manipulations - there is a lot of interesting information here about the Maya, but I'm afraid I just don't know how much I can believe or trust.I'm sure many people will lap up this book, and simply assume that the \\"facts\\" on the Maya must be true because they are written in an authoritative manner, but please keep an open mind - which includes remembering that the authors may be wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book gives you an outstanding look into the mayan civ.","review":"Adrian Gilbert did an outstanding job of giving the reader a glimpse of mayan culture.

She obviously initiates only women in her \\"Sisterhood\\". While the book was interesting, especially if one likes Celtic paths, it had limited value to me as a male.

The ending felt rushed and I am not a fan of one thing happening and the next chapter picks up awhile later. I felt the same way about the last 'letters' book so I am guessing this is her style.

Despite a slightly negative portrayl of the modern dating scene, the author ends the book on a positive note that will hopefully aid people in their quest for a compatible mate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I didn't find this book to be very interesting. I don't think it would shed any light on culture, dating, sex or single life for anyone under the age of 45.She does a good job backing up her views with references in some cases. But in others she states her observations and gives opinion on what they really are/mean with out any scientific back up. I happened to disagree with most of her ideas in those cases. She also referenced Judith Wallerstein. In my opinion Wallerstein is someone who has an agenda before she does a study and then designs her study to prove it. Her most famous study, on the effects of divorce, didn't even have a control group. So in the most basic scientific terms it wasn't even an experiment.I didn't read the last chapter on how to really find love. I had lost all interest at that point. It seemed to be turning into a self help book at that point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could hardly put it down.","review":"Very good. I read two of his books in one weekend.

They are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any Karate Ka.","review":"In my search for the true way a person should focus their enegy in the Martial Arts, no other instructor has given me more insight into a person's personal growth in the Martial Arts than Master Jones. Only having met him twice at Martial Arts seminars, he has left an impression on me as to what a Master in the Martial Arts should be. In his book he nicely out lines what he has found through experiences as a police officer and a student of the Martial Arts, not only how to practice the Martial Arts, but a few insights as how to live the way a Karate ka should. Through his stories we see that Karate is more than kicking and punching in a Dojo, but is a way of living, through deeds and practices. Karate, The Isshinryu Way, is a must read for any Karate Ka. No matter what form or style you are in this book will give an honest insight into Master Jones' journey in the Martial Arts. Hopefully it will inspire you as it has me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hsing I Chuan instructor","review":"Super cool book I love to hear old martial artist talking about real martial arts. love old school karate good job mr jones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, terrible editing","review":"Another reviewer mentioned poor technical editing. My impression was that the code samples perhaps had a few syntax errors and wouldn't run without a bit of editing, and that the reviewer was probably being overpicky.My impression was wrong! This is the worst edited book I've ever read. There are mistakes throughout that seriously distract the reader from the content.This is unfortunate, because I thought the content was very good. If you are a statistically training data analyst, it might not go into enough depth, but if you are a database developer looking to bring data mining to your business/applications, this provides excellent coverage, from how to create the models to good descriptions and comparisons of the different algorithms SQL 2005 offers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!","review":"I have only recently started to get involved with Data Mining. I have been doing back end work with Analysis Services for a couple of years and we're ready to move on to the next level.This book was amazing! The background in Analysis Services and Databases helped a lot, but the book covered all the topics in an easy to understand order. Sure, the chapters on the different algorithms can be very in depth, but apart from explaining the actual mathematical formulas, there is a huge amount of information about each algorithm that each developer MUST use when designing a Data Mining solution.One of the reviewers commented that they can still not write a DMX statement. I'm confused by that statement! I am writing DMX statements using only the information I got out of this book. Sure, there are a few spelling mistakes here and there, but using the sections in the book where the syntax is fine, I've managed to run all the queries without issues.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial almost to the point of uselessness","review":"I bought this book specifically to gain insight into the output I've gotten from using a couple of the data mining algorithms; unfortunately, there's even less on output interpretation than there is in the SQL server help files. Flipping through the book leaves the impression that the authors are trying to be everything to everyone, and end up only scratching the surface except in describing the algorithms.I would have given it a 3 star rating anyway because it is useful to understand how the algorithms work, but went with 1 star to balance out one of the authors giving himself a 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Fails!","review":"This book was very poorly written.

The controls are non-linear and the sound effects are bargain basement. The novelty of being able to fly around freely wears off quickly as you realize that there really isn't very much more to this game.This game looks, feels, and sounds like it was made 5 years ago, stored in a forgotten basement, then foisted on an unsuspecting public.

I've read all of her first nine books many, many times, and highly recommend them. In this book and the ones that follow the author's voice shifts so completely, I wonder if she is actually the one continuing to write them. Mrs. Pollifax's character changes, she is \\"cross\\" several times in the first few chapters and the old Mrs. Pollifax was curious and philosophical and observant. This philosophical bent disappears entirely from these later books.The adventures no longer sizzle along. An early chase in this book is poorly crafted; as it happens it is described without enough detail to make it interesting or suspensful and we are told Mrs. Pollifax looks back on it as a \\"nightmare,\\" when there is no basis for this in the story. The earlier Mrs. Pollifax would roll with the punches and reserve \\"nightmare\\" for full fledged torture. These later books are so disappointing because the first nine are so wonderful...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recent books disappointing","review":"The first 4 or 5 books in the Pollifax series are wonderful. This is the worst of those that follow. I think the problem that I am having is that Mrs. Pollifax no longer seems to be the author of her own success. Lucky chance may be the reason she wins through in the end, or some individual she meets up with does it all for her. And I don't care for these partnerships, especially with Farrell. The wonderful thing in the past was how Mrs. Pollifax would come to a case with lovely excitement and by being herself assemble a group of unusual people around her and inspire them to great things. The recent Pollifaxes have seem tired and dependent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprising disappointment...","review":"I can wholeheartedly recommend all other Mrs. Pollifax books, but this one left me wishing it hadn't happened.

This set, with the alleged \\"Guest Stars\\", is/was a real disappointment to me. The backgrounds are cheaply made.

When being pursued by the bad guys, the same backgrounds appear repeatedly as Shaggy and Scooby flee.The voice characterizations of Laurel and Hardy, The Three Stooges, and The Harlem Globetrotters sound like amateur night at an elementary school play.Unless one is attempting to complete a Scooby-Doo collection, skip this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke","review":"I was really excited to find this, however it was broken.

Mom, do you know who Phyllis Diller is?) and the show, even in the 1970's was pretty weak.Extras have yet to be announced but apparently there is some sort of decoder competition type thing - obviously to get you to buy the thing.I had hoped that the releases would have continued with the basic Scooby Doo mystery shows instead of moving on to the gimicky ones but at leaset we are still being spared Scrappy Doo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This could have been better","review":"Ok - I was a sucker - I was looking forward to this set, but was somewhat dissapointed.

Hopefully, Warner Bros. will decide to release all the episodes for us Diehard Scoob fans so we can have our collections complete.At any rate, even though things are the way they are--I still love this collection.

While science has its definite merits it cannot solve the fundamental question of purpose. Science can and does provide answers to \\"how?\\" but cannot be used for \\"why!\\" By the very nature of the scientifc method the questions have to be reduced to numbers and thereby measurement but this is not applicable for the human spirit. Only when science and \\"religion,\\" in its widest sense rather than sectarian, co-operate in a given human being is personal growth likely to be achieved.Although one may quibble about certain aspects of this little book it is a useful and appropriate counterpoint to our materialistic society which seems to be bent on self-destruction.

He develops some beautiful and perceptive ideas in the book, which is worth reading just for the quotes alone.The basic thrust of the book is that throughout the history of humanity, there were considered to be \\"different levels of being\\", with increasing levels of awareness and consciousness, and that only relatively recently has the progress of science been so successful that consideration of our \\"inner\\" nature and being has been displaced.Schumachers book is highly pertinent and relevant and every bit as useful and brilliant as his \\"Small is Beautiful\\". It is however a book about man, his purpose and meaning in life, and the role (if any) of spirit.

Confusing and just as thin as the earlier segments -- which would be fine, except these concepts require WAY more meat to understand than the earlier chapters -- and way more RELIABLE meat.

It is just a badly made video with arbitrary cuts. An area is never finished before the artist starts something else but when you look that area later it is done. Constantly bad cuts all over. I like the artist. He can teach some very good methods but its just aggravating to watch. I don't know, I feel bad that the video is so poorly made but I do like the artists and if you want to take a chance, its only a few bucks.

Also included is a helpful list of suppliers for some of the more obscure ingredients. It's well written and funny, so you'll want to read it cover to cover even if you never make a single cocktail, but I guarantee you'll want to - try the 20th Century - in my opinion, one of the greatest lost cocktails of all time.

Details what has worked and what has not worked, in a moderately fair manner, in general.The book's main fault is that in several instances, conclusions are drawn as to the reasons why certain programs or certain policies succeeded (or failed), and politics often are brought into the discussion. There are some moments in which some of the authors' statements, presented without any cited studies or lacking footnotes, may appear somewhat speculative or even biased to the reader.On the whole, a decent overview of the many directions the criminal justice system has taken as well as a decent look at some of the policies foisted onto the CJS by the politics of the last fifty or so years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"The war against conservativism\\".","review":"Without doubt the book is well written and the authors do an amazing job of using \\"smoke and mirrors\\" to convince readers that their analysis of the criminal justice system is true and factual. However, I have never seen a more perfect example of an author intentionally manipulating data and statistics to support his or her opinion.Besides the clear political bias of the author, there are even a number of blatant factual errors. For example, look hard enough and you will find that the same exact bar graph is erroneously used twice in the book for two entirely different studies.This is NOT a history book.

You don't need another person to help, just hold it up and let the tail take the breeze which will right the plane instantly in the wind. It flies easily and stable, and the sight of it flying in the sky is impressive, to say the least. It REALLY draws attention!

Its a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good points, poor writing, suspicious theology","review":"Willard covers many of the essential points in spiritual formation. Unforunately it took a lot of effort to mine the useful ideas in this book. The authors writing style is overly complicated. There is an abundance of irrelevant information. It is a difficult read, and I don't believe it was worth the effort.Williard's theology is suspicious on some points. Williard defines 6 different aspects of the human being. His definitions for 'Spirit' and 'Soul' lack biblical basis. His understanding of Paul's concept of the 'flesh' is weak.The college I work at is using this book as a textbook for a spiritual formation class. This book has received nothing but negative feedback from the students. I don't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who disagrees with Dallas Willard?","review":"I have a really hard time swallowing any of this book. The first chapter seems to be an attempt to interject large and cumbersome words to have you submit to Willard's \\"far superior mind\\".Really! He spends the whole first chapter taking scripture out of context and rambling about what is sin and never actually saying it.I went to bible college. I took bible study. I took survey of old and new testament. I read and loved C.S. Lewis. But this book is horrible! And I'm shocked that I am the only one who thinks as much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a hard read","review":"This is an in depth analytical look at the human personality and what drives it. Ancient wisdom really, mind, body and spirit. Willard breaks the human persona into 6 elements (I prefer the trinity version), then breaks into an exhaustive proof of how true change must start with the heart. Some really profound points and observations are made. Worthwhile, but arduous. A simpler and easy to read encapsulation of the same idea can be found in a small book by E.G. White called \\"Steps to Christ\\" - that's a piece of work, and so easy to read and understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on spiritual formation I have ever read","review":"Most books on spiritual formation are superficial and/or offer cookie cutter formulas for how to grow. This book presents a well thought out formulation of the human personality that is consistent with scriptural teachings and then offers practical advice on how to surrender all aspects of that personality to Christ so that we might become like him. The practical advice is not formulaic but suggests the types of thinking, praying and actions one should consider in trying to develop into a more Christ-like person. I read it too quickly the first time and now I need to go back through and absorb it more carefully. Dallas has set forth a sound theory and a sound method to slowly grow in the image of Christ, which is refreshing in a culture of fast food spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"i've read many books and willard is flat out one of our best thinker's who mixes humility, insight, and practical know-how. he's heady as usual but much more readable than the divine conspiracy. the chapter on hell is probably the best explanation of lostness and hell that I've ever read. And his exposition on spiritual formation fills in the missing pieces from something like Foster's book on spiritual disciplines. it's less a how-to as it is a why and how."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 'Brass Tacks' of Living in Christ","review":"As usual, Willard has written another thought-provoking book. I found it difficult to 'speed' through his material, and the first half of this book was not as interesting to me as the second half, but the latter portion was a great blessing! His insights on transforming our 'bodies' and 'social dimensions' were particularly helpful. And I felt it was one of those books that would help to 'bump up' my walk in Christ several notches!

If that is truly the case, I am totally confused as to why this novel is so horrible. The story line is choppy and hard to follow in places. The characters are campy and don't wring true. The novel is poorly written. I kept wanting to throw the book into the trash bin, but I kept reading, hoping that it would get better. It didn't. Don't waste your money. Personally, I get the feeling that Ms. McKinney may be a closet racist.

What a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fences by Shannon McKinney","review":"This novel contains all the emotions and reactions involved with interracial relationships. It is a realistic depiction of how school integration developed and how some people accepted it and some resisted it as a way of life in the 1970's. \\"Fences\\" shows how change is not an easy adjustment for adults. It teaches us a valuable lesson in seeing people for what is on the inside rather than looking at the color of a person's skin and shows us that people cannot be protected from life by the fences they build around themselves.

The description on the site said 4-5. My Mother-in-Law has 5 kids. If the site had stated that this only holds 4 stones, I certainly would have gotten something else. I don't have the means to get her another gift before Christmas. Now I'm just going to have to take my chances and see if my Husband might be able to sand the stones down enough so that all 5 fit.

The necklace is alittle bit thin compared to hold the weigh of the locket. I think it would be better if the necklace was made a bit more thicker. And also, you probably might need to put alittle effort into putting the birthstones into the locket because the space of the locket's opening is not very wide. You need to find an angle to squeeze in the birthstones. And the small locket can only fit 4 stones. If u need to put more than 4 stones, I'd suggest you on purchasing the larger one. Other than that, it makes A great gift for a female."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the new mother again","review":"After much deliberation I finally chose this for my step daughter.

The delivery was quicker than stated, which I felt was a plus. Upon receiving it, my wife open it and sent me pictures. (I work offshore so unable to be there for the giving.) After some difficulty she was able to get 5 stones inside the locket, but after reading the description I knew that it wold be difficult to do but could be done. She gave it to our daughter and she was very pleased with it. I have yet to actually look at in person, but from the raves I have gotten from those who have I think it will have been a good buy.

But, I don't know if it's a one time defect or if it's the workmanship. On the front right side of the heart, it has an opening all the way through. It doesn't look like it's broken, just seems like it wasn't welded together as it should've been. It doesn't affect how it works (open or closing), just irritates me. Gives a perfect heart a flaw.

I bought this for my mother-in-law so she could have her 3 grandbabies with her at all times. She liked the look of it, but it tilts downward while wearing since the clasp is on the back (instead of the top) of the piece. Also, once you take it off of the chain, it has VERY limited opening to insert your stones. I had to do it for her. And it really should be stated somewhere that it will only hold 3 stones. Maybe you could get away with 4, but it would not close all the way. Anyway, one of the stones has fallen out already since the closure is not very secure. And to the prior reviewer that commented that they don't see how it could come out with the chain on...IT DID. Now I have to set out to either order new stones, or return the locket. No time for this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for my needs","review":"Perhaps I missed read the info on this locket but I will be returning it as it is too small for my needs, it only holds four gem stones. If you have a large family this is not the locket for you but if there are four or fewer children then it will work fine. Inside the package I found the maker of the locket's website to visit. There I found that they do make a larger version of the locket, which holds up to 15 gems, and even suggest that if this one is too small to order the larger one (for $20 more $$) from them. I wish Amazon had also offered the larger one but they don't, not sure why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Chain - DOA","review":"The chain was broken at the clasp upon removal from the package.

I'm going to try ordering another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Overall I have more complaints than compliments about this necklace. The main issues I have are that you can't see the stones in the locket as well as I expected and the chain goes through the back of the locket causing the heart to hang at a negative angle. As others have noted it is difficult to get the locket shut with the stones inside (I added three)...but with some patience I was able to move the stones around to a point where I was able to get it closed. I love that I could add another stone as our family grows, but am concerned that with how much trouble I had getting three stones in that I wouldn't have as much luck adding the fourth when that time comes. The idea of this necklace is great, but in my opinion the design doesn't do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice gift","review":"Nice gift but I thought it would be a little larger.

This baby worked perfectly. It's simple to operate and gets the job done. It does not \\"cut\\" the tile, rather it \\"scores\\" the tile and then snaps it in two pieces. All of the tiles came out clean except for some of the very smallest, about 1/2\\". I didn't test it on thicker tiles, but the standard bathroom tiles scored and snapped very easily.

It pulls through 2-3 pages at a time, can't handle bond paper, can't handle paper that's had staples removed, can't handle paper that's not perfectly smooth.So when you want to scan a multi-page document, you usually have to photocopy it first to get pristine pages, and even then your odds are only about 50/50 that it will feed properly.All in all, I wouldn't buy this one again, and would recommend against it for anyone who will use it more than once a week to scan multi-page documents.

If you buy more than two of these books, the third is bound to be composed of a third the recipes from each of the first two. Same test info, everything.

The noise the fan makes, even at the lowest setting is intolerable. It cools moderately well, but if you want to read in the same room with this beast, I would suggest wearing earplugs, if you want to watch TV, wear headphones. If you want to have a conversation, forget it. This Spring, I'm shopping around for a quieter model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but bothersome noise level for me","review":"I purchased this a few months ago and have been happy with it so far. This past Northeast summer has not been all that warm, but we did get a heat wave of 90+ humid weather for about a week. This A/C unit worked fine during that time.The noise level with a TV on is a little much. I tend to have ambient noise problems anyways, so a regular window fan could bother me. I wound that with the unit turned on, I was increasing the TV volume so much that I could hear the TV in the basement (a floor below). It seemed a regular level in my room, so this goes to show that the A/C's white noise really affected my \\"in room\\" hearing.

Our son makes carts for handicapped dogs and his workshop is in the garage. We tried a portable unit before buying the window unit. It was a waste of time and money. We did have to hire someone to make a \\"window\\" in the garage wall, but it's been worth the effort. The unit cools and dehumidifies the space where he works and it's not noisy.We picked it because it was rated well by Consumer Reports and had an Energy Star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy camper","review":"I am very happy with this product. Amazon shipping was just great.The unit is a little on the loud side , but works great for cooling. I am cooling around 900 sq ft room and it does a very good job.

Highly recomend if you need a window unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shiver - Sweat Cycles","review":"I bought this AC because of its power and energy efficiency, but those two qualities are exactly what make me hate it now. When it's on a cooling cycle, it noisily blasts arctic air until it hits the targeted temperature, then it completely shuts off! No fan, no blower, just off. Silence. Until the room warms up and the unit roars back to life. And it is LOUD!I'm not sure what the actual temperature spread is between cycles, but, as this unit is in my bedroom, I spend the night alternately sweating when it's off, and shivering when it's on. Add in the huge noise differential between when it's running and when it's not, and it adds up to a very unpleasant night. I despise this AC."},{"rating":"2","title":"You want cold air, fast..this is it!","review":"Buy it!This is a truly great AC unit.In a small room (600 feet or less) it has the power to drop the inside temp to 65 in no time.

I put it in a fairly large bedroom and it keeps the room as cold as we want it to be in the summer heat. Someone mentioned they wish there were only manual controls. At first I thought the remote control was a joke, until I wanted to stay under the covers and not have to get up in the freezing room to turn it off :-) It even has a built in digital thermometer. Nice touch. So far we love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too noisy!!!","review":"This unit was nice and compact and the controls and remote were good. It also cooled and dehumified well, but I am returning it now after less than a week because not only was it too noisy for me, my neighbors had begun to complain! I don't know how these other reviewers could think it was quiet, but I could hear its loud high pitched hum throughout all the rooms in my apartment! The unit was in a completely different part of my apartment than my bedroom, but it would wake me up every time it switched on. I even had Frigidaire repair people come out to look at it because I thought something must be wrong with it since it was so loud, but they said it was the normal level of noise for that unit - hey also agreed it was very loud and recommended a Gold Star unit. I would strongly recommend against this unit if noise is a concern for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"large flour sifter","review":"The problem with this sifter is the turning part of the sifter doesn't touch the screen on the bottom, so the flour doesn't move through the sifter very well. I was disappointed with it. Had I seen the action in a store, I would have purchased something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but poor design","review":"I loved the stainless steel construction and the large capacity of this sifter. However, when the hand crank was turned, only 1 of the 4 blades made contact with the sifting screen, rendering the other 3 blades totally useless. Obviously all 4 blades were meant to make contact with the sifting screen, thus ensuring a quick and easy sifting job. There was no way to adjust the blades so that they worked as they were obviously supposed to. I returned my defective sifter to Amazon, with the disappointing result that I had to pay a restocking fee, even though the item was clearly defective. Now it appears that some other unsuspecting customer will be sent this sifter and have to deal with it all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sifter does not work","review":"I ordered this sifter for my son who loves to cook. The sifter arrived with no nut holding the knob in place. We added the nut so the knob wouldn't fall off.

Do not buy this sifter!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected","review":"I don't know if I got a defective sifter or not, but it doesn't sift at all. I can't believe that I paid $20 for something that doesn't even work. Now I'm back to my old 2-cup sifter, which makes for a very hard time when you need to sift three or four cups with your soda/powder and salt!I don't recommend this product at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor poor quality","review":"Not sure what kind of \\"stainless steel\\" this manufacturer uses, but it does rust. And like other reviewers have experienced, the screen doesn't contact the rotating wires, so sifting is pretty poor and slow. This is a real disappointing product marred by lack of quality control. Don't blame the factory - it's the brand that accepted this quality and ships it to customers. They could have easily refused these defective units and sent them back to the factory instead of to customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"flour sifter","review":"I was very disappointed with this sifter. When you turn the crank,it is not calibrated correctly so the sifting mechanism does not contact the screen to sift the flour out of the sifter. You have to shake it against your hand. It also has a shelf around the inside bottom of the sifter which catches flour. I have used my old Bromwell 5-cup sifter for 25 years, and thought it was time for a new one. Evidently, I was wrong. I would not recommend this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for","review":"You can sift all night and nothing comes out of the bottom. The sifter arms do not rotate close enough to the screen to push the flour down. I end up just mixing dry ingredients with the rotation and dumping it out the top. Certainly not what I was hoping for. If I could just find my mothers old one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster","review":"I bought this Noctua case fan after reading numerous good reviews. I planned its installation to be the first step in my second computer build. After a half-hour trying unsuccessfully to fix the fan case to the computer case, I realized the holes in the fan case are TOO SMALL to accept either the rubber grommets or the supplied screws. One simply cannot make more than one turn of a screw before it jams in the hole. Substituting the case's own screws for this purpose produces the same result.A maddening waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly designed tool","review":"There's only a single support attaching the saw to the base on the right front corner.

Tool is well built and the size and weight just perfect for my body (5'5\\" 140lb). Can use the tool at 30 - 40 degree to the object and can not do this with the Brute breaker(too heavy for me). One thing I don't light is the power switch design. It is an on/off rocker switch instead of the momentary switch like one on the Brute. The location is far away from the handle so I have to take one hand off the handle to turn it on or off. It makes controlling the tool hard. One star is removed because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate-- until it broke!","review":"This is my second thermometer in a year. It worked well for two months and then suddenly broke.

I looked at my thermometer and it had shot to 293 degrees (really???) and then it stopped reading temps at all. It just says HI TEMP. Wonderful. There is no reset, pulling the battery doesn't work, etc. Jumped on Amazon to see if my fellow chefs have been duped as well - and I see that they have!I like that it's a great timer - but don't trust this thing as a thermo AT ALL.

After a few weeks of use the first and last rollers kept falling out and the end caps cracked. Then the roller assembly started coming loose from the stand. I would find a nut or a bolt on the floor. Finaly after about 6 weeks the height adjustment handle stopped working. The threads had stripped out making it useless except at a very low height. I tapped in new threads but now there's no handle, just a wrench and a bolt. I tried to make it work but it's just too flimsy.

The first thing I noticed is the rollers are no where near secure to the base. They wobble and twist with any weight to a corner. If you look at the enlarged picture you can kind of notice that there doesn't seem to be enough structual support to hold the rollers. After 2 days worth of use the clamping device stripped out. I took the device apart to see what the clamping nob screwed into - there was ony about 3/8 of an inch for it to secure itself. To make things more compliated the plastic cap on the bottom of the roller shaft fell off so I had to remove the plate on the base tube. Of course, when putting the base back on one of the screws stripped. To make a long story short, stay away from this product at all cost.

For those reviewers who felt like they needed maps and an answer, you can get maps at the visitor centers all bound up in glossy little books with equally glossy descriptions of people and places. This is not one of those books - it's so much deeper. This book is not a souvenier, it's a vehicle that takes you to places that a relative few will ever see and even less will understand.

PestPatrol, SpyBot, and AdAware are always going to each find spyware that the others won't, due to different definition lists, probably, and what each company thinks is a threat (i.e. PP wants you to have no filesharing software nor any wild tangent software). SpySweeper is a good choice if you were to purchase just one, in my opinion. The shields are really great, especially the ones added in version 3.0, HOWEVER!!! in my experience, having SpySweeper running on my computer is proving to be very harmful. In an idle state (no internet browsers open either) it uses 100MB OR MORE of my ram, which is strange, so it could be a problem just with my setup or installation or something.

I e-mailed the symptoms of the problem to Dell, and they diagnosed the problem as TCP/IP registry corruption. Maybe that wasn't Spy Sweeper, but it does a lot with the registry. I ran Spy Sweeper on my daughter's computer as well, and, again it found lots of stuff, which I removed. However, the main spyware/adware that caused me to buy Spy Sweeper was Adtomi, which I had been unable to eradicate (it manages to keep getting itself into startup areas).

At least some of this was done deliberately by Penguin and the translator, as he leaves footnotes saying \\"These debates have been omitted.\\" This is unacceptable in its own, but I think the lack of other information is also due either to the omission of these things by Polybius himself, or by the transcribers that have carried his works into our own times.

Just two examples; for my blood type, the FB list shows cucumbers as a food to \\"Avoid\\"; while in the cookbook, it is listed as \\"Neutral\\". Pinto beans in the FB list are listed as \\"Avoid\\" while in the cookbook they are actually listed as \\"Highly Beneficial\\". The discrepancy is from one extreme to the other.

Her worst. If I had read Stormy Challenge first, I would have avoided all her other novels and would have missed out on one of my favorite authors. There isn't a single likable character in this book and the dialogue is painfully repetitive. The female lead is a tease. The male lead is a stalker who repeatedly threatens violence and rape. The book should have ended early on with a restraining order, instead of dragging on to a wedding of two people clearly doomed to a life of domestic violence. If you are looking for a classic Krentz novel, try Wildest Hearts or Flash or Absolutely Positively instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one by","review":"Jayne Ann Krentz is one of my very favorite authors, but this book from her early years was terrible. I disliked the male protagonist and the female lead was annoying. I couldn't identify with either one. Early in the book, Court nearly rapes Leya because he \`wants her so much.' He's over bearing, arrogant and pushy the entire book.In her \`Dear Reader,' JAK tells us at the start of her career she wrote classic, battle-of-the-sexes style romances. This book originally was written under her pen name Stephanie James. I've read several of her books under that name and, although several are okay to good, this book didn't even make it to fair.The only reason I gave it a 2 was because I did finish it--I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. If you want to read an early JAK, try Between the Lines or one of her others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I normally enjoy books by Jayne Ann Krentz but \\"Stormy Challenge\\" was painful to read and it was boring.

To create a hero who is so agressively jealous & possessive in a world where so many real women are or have been at the mercy of such men is offensive to me. Women ( even in a fantasy type romance) should not have it reinforced that there is anything even slightly romantic about such behavior. I think Leya should have run, not walked to the nearest exit & then gotten a restraining order!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Loving it!","review":"I love just about everything JAK writes, but this book was so lame I had to flog myself to finish it! Zero suspence, no mystery whatsoever, barely even any racey parts. The charactors were not well developed and certainly not very interesting, but heck even bad JAK is better than most other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disaappointing","review":"I found this book, just doesn't make sense. There is no story, just unreasonable fighting between the two main characters. I couldn't figure out the attaction and there was no outside action such as them working together to save a company, or anything. Generally Jayne Ann Krantz books excell in having a feisty heroine that is trying to solve something or make a difference and then having the hero help. This book is just about constant seduction that never really happens. I couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick another Krentz book - it's bound to be better","review":"I love Jayne Ann Krentz, and I have read the majority of her books, and this was one of her few disappointments. The characters are annoying, irritating, one-dimensional and there is NO chemistry between the two to speak of. In addition, the male character's constant threats of violence are NOT sexy nor do they add much to the plot. In addition, every other sentence ends with an exclamation point, which I think is supposed to signal emotion, but that's about the only way one would sense emotion in this lackluster story. My advice, don't buy this novel - move on to one of her Amanda Quick or Arcane Society books. Her newer novels have much deeper characters in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointed","review":"My best advice is to not purchase this book.

Big mistake. The language was choppy. I believe she wrote originally for the Harlequin romances and I suspect that this was one of them that was re-released due to her current popularity. The copyright date on it was much earlier than the 2004 that the release date is showing.

While it's longer than the wood board we have now, it's just not rigid enough to provide a safe and comfortable transfer. Even when the actual transfer distance is only 8\\", the board sags down into the transfer space instead of giving a straight and strong bridge, thus making it more difficult for my husband to pull himself across the transfer space (he has to pull himself uphill to get out of the sag).

Instead, find yourself a strong, rigid wooden transfer board that doesn't sag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good intro to a country I knew nothing about.","review":"The book is short enough to be read in one sitting yet it is not simplistic.

She likes Poles with all their good and bad habits. This outside perspective and the ability of comparing Polish and British habits is definitively very helpful.

Negatives: Looks kind of old fashioned and has some construction quality issues. For instance, the outer plastic cover does not meet correctly in places (at least on mine; this may not be the case in all of them). Also, the water bucket is not easy to remove for dumping (you need to pull the drawer out with some force and then water ends up splashing around a bit). The bucket is also constructed of rather low quality plastic. I purchased and use a Little Giant condensate pump now, so I no longer have bucket issues. The instructions in the manual for hooking-up a condensate pump to the dehumidifier is not easy to understand and should be clearer. See previous reviewer's directions for this (very helpful). Positives: Fairly quiet for a dehumidifier. Has operated flawlessly in my basement for the last 3 months. Performance is excellent. I give it 5 stars for value and performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good purchase","review":"Due to dust mite and mold allergies, plus dampness in the basement, we tend to run a dehumidifer 365 days a year. The one we had ran constantly and was very noisy. This Frigidaire model was rated as being relatively quiet, plus a larger capacity, so we decided to try it. It also has a humidity display on the front panel so you can see the humidity level in the room. While you can still tell that it's running, it is a lot quieter than what we had and we have been able to keep the humdity at 40% or below without it running constantly. The only complaint from my husband is that it was a little challenging to set up the hose to the sump pump so that we wouldn't have to worry about emptying the bucket. But, other than that, we are very satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't run after a power outage","review":"The dehumidifier works OK but must be manually reset after a power interruption making unattended operation impossible.

Finally I was given a repair number to call by an automated voice. I called that number and was told that a service call was $150. No thanks. I returned the unit. I will never, ever buy a Frigidaire product again, they just don't seem to care about customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry, Dry, Dry","review":"We bought this and it's working hard, but that's because our basement leaks. Leaks like a sieve. Every rain of more than half an inch causes little streams of water to seep through the cracks in the walls to the drain or the sump pump.

This dehumidifier is not up to the task (as compared to two other competitor models I've owned over the course of the several years). I thought I would try a new brand name... only to learn that I should've stuck with what worked well. It dehumidifies to a very slight degree... but not nearly as much as claimed. It also has a digital humidity display which, based on the rate of dehumidiciation, in my personal experience and opinion, would take probably close to \\"a year\\" before getting to the desired level. I'm returning this product to purchase something that works effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Didn't Work","review":"I ordered the dehumidifier from Amazon based on the reviews. It arrived in only 3/4 of the packing box. The installation instructions were confusing, so I called the manufacturer for clarification. The manufacturer's customer service rep was also unable to install the machine based on the instructions. Once we figured out how to install it, the dehumidifier leaked.

Previous reviewers mentioned that the packaging was insufficient, and they were right. My unit arrived with one of the fan blades broken off - it shook like crazy and made a terrible racket. The manual said to take it to an authorized repair shop, which we did (30 minute drive). They kept it for 3 weeks without calling us; when my wife called Frigidaire, they told her they were denying the repair because Amazon is not an authorized dealer. We had to send it back to Amazon. But now the repair shop won't give the unit back to us - because Frigidaire told them that we are not the original owners! The shop is holding the dehumidifier hostage - they won't give it back to us until someone pays them for taking it apart and putting it back together.

Fans of Wallace Stegner and Norman Maclean will find these works every bit as rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good Doig","review":"I love Ivan Doig.

Ride with Me was nothing but an excuse for Doig to make a little money from all he knows about Montana, a state whose geography holds no interest for me. The characters were unpleasant, and the plot was thin. The old man is nasty and cantankerous without justification. The lovers end up exactly where they began, so all that happens between them during the novel cancels out. The hours the characters spent driving around in that truck brought back many painful memories of the boring vacations my sister and I were forced to take with our parents to see the country. Dull, dull, dull! I'd have given this a minus score if that were a possibility. Zero is too good for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It couldn''t help me determine where I was ... at.","review":"I'm sorry, but after reading the first several pages the author's grammar destroyed any credibility she may have.

This was not the first book I bought, but when I did, I greatly appreciated the author's explanations that were straight-forward but also came from her unique viewpoint. Things I'd read in other books began to make sense and I realized there is some flexibility in areas. While I'm no expert, I caught my wife showing off pieces I'm working on to guests. My favorite part of the book is the approach to creating designs. I can always find helpful tidbits even now when I am working on a design and need something to round out a design. If you're really interested in this type of chip carving, buy a pile of good quality basswood boards (lots of places online) and practice doing the basic cuts and designs shown in the book. And keep those knives sharp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"all jazz lover should check out brian","review":"just pick up my copy of brian's new cd,loved it all who dont known of brian should check him out i think you will like this young up and coming star he is something special. also would recommend secrets his last cd a must contemporary jazz lovers"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Music Fan from Washington, DC","review":"So much \\"Smooth Jazz\\" today is basically elevator music, not \\"smooth\\", definitely not jazz.

With the exception of Harry Manfredini's score for the original, the scores just got more and more generic sounding. It sounds as if Manfredini knew this was going to be the last composition he would write for this series and decided to throw in cues he had previously left off from other F13 scores instead of trying to come up with something new with the minor exception of a cue that sounds like one of those toy horns that, when held up or down, makes that descending sound.

I also have several other brands of mobile bases and the Shop Fox is by far the heaviest duty. I don't know about the extension bars that are listed here but the bars that come with the standard mobile bases are plenty thick and will handle the rated weight with ease. I assume the extension bars are the same type of tubing but that may not be the case. My purchase was with Grizzly for the bases and have to say that they are very professional and I doubt they would sell something that isn't what they advertise including these extension bars. My only negative with the Shop Fox bases is that they take a while to assemble and I did get a bent part. But the part was replaced immediately. Good folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Work with Base","review":"Caution - the extension rails I received from Amazon were NOT the correct match for the updated FOX base - had to call FOX, and eventually buy the rails, at a much higher price, through Grizzly.

Not only are they incredibly thin-walled (~0.090\\") but they do not even mate to the corner brackets properly. There is a lot of slop all around which for something sold to support up to 1200# is surprising, if not disconcerting. That is another thing - everything about the mobile base for which these bars were made screams \\"cheap, cheap, cheap\\" except the price.

Normally, I love low budget horror, especially horror with a comic component to it. But I'm not a fan of slapstick, and frankly, I hate it. This movie is slapstick, so draw your own conclusions on my view. The sad thing is if it werent for the slapstick, it could have been appealing to me. However, there were far too many characters trying to duplicate Rodney Dangerfield with ridiculous dialog and annoyingly affected voices. Some people enjoy very over the top type humor, and they might really enjoy this movie. So my suggestion is to understand that generally binary consideration - if you like slapstick and low budget, this is your movie. If not, there are far better options for spending your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes its total indie, super low budget. but delivered hella laughs.","review":"So i saw this on a dare to watch the most terrible movies of all time, with a name like this i was sure i had a winner. i will say i knew immediately this was a microbudget film, but when i started laughing and didnt stop, i can honestly say, i was incredibly surprised i was thoroughly entertained.

Not only is some of the artwork gruesome, but the story fails to deliver anything close to the original message of how gold (or make-substitution-here) is not the end-all of life.In Well's version, Ruby tells her little brother about an 'ancient' Max (Midas), who instead of turning everything into gold with a touch, turns everyone into dessert with his laser eyes. Mom is zapped. Dad is zapped, and there is no sign of regret until sister is changed into a slice of cake. Then, without explanation, there is a sudden change of heart. (I guess one can only conclude that it was okay to zap mom and dad but not sis.)The text is not the only problem though. The pictures of Max and his blood-red eyes are strange. Supposedly laser light, the emanations stream down in arches, not in straight lines. It looks more like Max is leaking blood from his eyes.

The series seems to be a series of detached segmented episodes with little overlap and my god the close-ups are horrible not to mention the terrible sappy music that starts playing leaving one thinking: Why are they trying to make this so damned dramatic?

I won't spoil anything but THE END SUCKED!! HARD honestly might be the worst ending in anime history, they lead up to a big battle scene that goes into outer space where it continues then the character shows up a day later after the battle , doesn't show but about 4 hits in the fight.

Wow! I wasn't disappointed! It's alot of history mixed in with vampire lore, which draws you in and make you want to take a closer look. At first, I thought Abel Nightroad(the main character) was just a bumbling priest until I saw him turn into a crusnik. Then, I was like; okay..... I can get into this.

That said I was saddened to find the original author of the story died in 2004 and it seems the popularity of the show kinda died off after that because I too think this series had something going for it, but its largely left unfinished. His friend did step in and finish the remaining books according to wiki.

It is written in a very simple language and gives you the proper approach to fluid and electrolyte problems. It is full of practical examples that you will see every day and shows you how to solve them. After reading this book, you will be confident enough to deal with electrolytes. Instead of replacing electrolytes blindly with K-Dur and Neutra-Phos and .... and not knowing what to do with Hyponatremia, you will have a nice framework in your brain to deal with them.

Ramsey makes the reader realize that we live in a \\"gotta have now\\" world and that by using credit to get it, we end up spending way too much money for even simple things like food (i.e. eating out compliments of a gold card at 21% interest) and everything we think we own is really owned by a bank or finance company.

As you pay the first one off, you transfer the money you were paying to creditor #1 to creditor #2 and it snowballs! I tried paying off my debts according to the largest interest rate, but I felt like I was getting no where! Dave Ramsey realizes this and helps you set realistic goals for yourself. I like the fact that he backs up his teachings with scripture (if that doesn't motivate, I don't know what will) and that his wife gives her condensed thoughts at the end of each chapter.

Dave Ramsey did an excellent job and probably made a fortune telling us what we already know: stay out of debt, don't get overextended, don't use credit cards, pay cash for items, buy-don't lease etc etc etc etc.....At least someone made money from this book, Dave Ramsey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the get-rich quick schemes.","review":"Dave tells it like it is... the only way to get rich quickly is to get rich slowly.

However, a lot of the information that has been compiled is out of date from the late 1970's and early 1980's. Do not use this book if you are designing your own Exercise Program. Do more research on the internet by simply using the search word \\"exercise\\"; you will have a wealth of current knowledge and numerous references to review. Do not start an exercise program without first consulting with your doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A saddlemaker's comments","review":"From the saddlemaker's perspective, this book omits more than it includes. Saddlemaking is a very visual art form, and this book barely includes enough B & W photos to give the reader more than a skimpy overview of how a traditional saddle is made. It is DEFINATELY not a how-to book on making a saddle despite its title. Considering there are literally hunderds of saddle tree styles, the small scale \\"patterns\\" in the book are of no use. The style saddle shown in the book is not a style saddle that one would find in today's American riding arena, thus dating the book's photos three or four decades previous to its publication date. If the casual observer wants to look at a few pictures of some of the insides of an older style English saddle, then this booklet may serve as a five minute browse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saddly lacking in details","review":"This book, though interesting, uses terms that it does not define and has no illustrations for the most complicated steps of the process. Unless you are an experienced leather-worker, and are very familiar with other saddle making and leather working methods you will probably not be able to make a saddle using this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative Ending","review":"This is truly a fun book.

It reeks of a writer more intent on impressing people than actually telling a good story. Because of that, the book collapses under its own weight. Comparisons to Selby are surprising to me, too. Is it the NYC thing? That's my only guess.If you read books to become impressed by the intellect and gifts of the author, you may like this one. It's like reading a grad school textbook in that regard. If you want to get lost in a good story, you aren't going to find it here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a book at all?","review":"Kirkus reviewed this book as perhaps the worst book published in 50 years. I don't think it's even that good. I could write a meaningful review, but it would be a waste of everyone's time. A mess of a story that tries to play on multi-cultural issues to gain readers. At the heart of this book, I find the author to be the one racially problematic. Let's hope readers look to other places for good fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst shows TNA has ever had","review":"Not one match on this show delivered to the point where you will be talking about it at the end of the year.

The idea is that she effaces her self as a means of escape from her time, society, and life and does not herself realize the consequences of that escape.

If you don't know why, then I pity your ignorance. Who else was there to compete with then? Early U2? Late Clash? Don't think so. Soft Cell? Springsteen? Prince? Mid-Career Bowie? Not Likely. Joy Division? Well, okay, maybe Joy Division are competition, but they still lose. This is the best there was, and it's still among the best there is.If you think of yourself as a music lover, get this album, get \\"Sulk\\", and get \\"The Affectionate Punch\\".

Why is there nothing more from them? Surely, they could have interested some record company, besides in this day and age, who needs record companies to be successful anyway! Heck, things like Owl City are probably more the norm now. That is, a group (or musician) is successful first, then the record companies hope to exploit it. Well, who knows, maybe personal issues.

While the music is ok, and only ok, many of the tracks are simply too similar and mundane to me, the lyrics really sank this album for me. Very high-schoolish lyrics loaded with cliches about the spirit and soul was an absolute fatal flaw for me. I tried real hard to like the album, but rock the cashbah is the only track that I really liked. I'd suggested getting everything but the girl's new album for better music.

The music is out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Ripping Great Straight Edge!","review":"You could buy a straight piece of aluminum angle at any metal supplier and get a straight cut. What really makes the difference with the U99 is the clamping mechanism. The jaws at each end have an agressive grip that doesn't budge, and there's no slack to mess up your careful layout. I have a couple of shorter clamps (not Emersons) and they have a little play in one end or the other. With the U99 I've found that a spring clamp is needed at one end for set up just because it's so long. I spring clamp the free end on the mark then line up the other end and lock the Ultra All-in-one in place.Can you make something that works as well? You probably can, but I prefer to spend my time making things rather than making jigs. Also the shop made circular saw fences I've seen only work with one saw, I have three. The U99 is ready to use right out of the 9 foot long box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for square cut only","review":"Title says it all.

But probably not worth $100.I don't know if anyone would actually use the T-slots, as they look a bit small and may be prone to binding. The clamping mechanism is ok. As others have pointed out, this will not square itself up with the work you're cutting, so you have to do that.I did not find the clamps to hold particularly tight to the wood. Even with the \\"wide\\" clamps (which only are the width of the track).Also, the unit could be a bit longer, particularly to help on the start and finish of the cut to give plenty of room for the shoe of the circular saw to track.Realistically, you're probably better off just making a cutting guide using a factory edge from a piece of wood, angle iron, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"if the locking is like the 50\\", beware...","review":"at first i was disappointed in the flimsy nature of the product. i figured it should be intuitive and easy to use. not so. it seemed the product was broken as it would not work. so i had to make a long distance call at my expense. there after three attempts, someone told me they had a problem with the product they had not anticipated. they were correcting it by including instructions. so the person told me the 'secret' of how to make this foolish thing work. i followed the cumbersome instructions and got it to -just sort of work. but it is a very awkard procedure and even then sometimes it does work and then again it will just not. this item sure is not worth the money, not worth the hassle, and not worth having to make a toll call. all it is good for i think is as a straight edge...foregoing any plans to have it clamp easily to wood and guide a saw. never would i have bought this ahd i seen it beforehand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edge Guide Not Straight, 1/8 Inch Out!","review":"Nice design concept with very bad manufacturing quality.

I think I'd benefit more and appreciate it more if I had some of the tool carriage accessories. I don't break it out as much as I should. It's a little delicate, the plastic parts were damaged in a fall but the customer service was excellent; they sent me replacements past warranty at n/c. The only real problematic applications are in cutting very bowed peices - you almost need two people - one to crawl on top of the piece while the other sets the clamp so the one on top can then cut it while it's pressed flat. You could also two or more other clamps and something suffieciently ridgid and flat to clamp the bowed one to. Angles are still a little more time and effort as the camp system only cuts square cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sterling OM ring!","review":"This ring has the Ranjana script for OM MANI PADME HUM on the spinning inner ring. I received a size 12 (which doesn't seem to be available on the website today!) and for $14 or so it's a nice piece of jewelry. However, be aware that the script is made from a one-sized casting; they just cut and solder it together to fit whatever size outer ring you order. So in my case the OM script repeats almost twice, but they cut and soldered it in the middle of a syllable. I'm not sure what that will do to my karma. :)Bottom line: nice, inexpensive .925 ring!

Fotoangelo is also included (a slideshow application), as well as Fotoslate (for photo printing), which I don't even use because I mainly do photo editing, but compared to others apps (and even the newer ACDSee apps), ACDSee Powerpack 5.0 is a dream. If you can find one, grab it. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"There is few medievals animes on the market, I've found this one interresting and funny. I must say that if you liked the part one of that anime, you will love the second part as much. Worth your time and money well spend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary but...","review":"Do not purchase this if you already own Man vs. Wild Season 2. This exact episode is already on that season/series. Other than that, this is a great documentary for anyone who loves to watch Bear Grylls and his amazing adventures. We also meet his wife, and see glimpses of his family, we hear her thoughts on his latest adventure, and watch as he goes through the grueling preparations needed for a task of this magnitude. Beautiful scenery, and a wonderful adventure!"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],N={key:0},B={key:1};function P(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(a(!0),i(y,null,p(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),f(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const M=d(D,[["render",P],["__scopeId","data-v-808069b6"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/61.md","filePath":"sponsor/61.md"}'),R={name:"sponsor/61.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(M)]))}});export{H as __pageData,G as default};
