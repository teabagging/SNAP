Greenfield is a restaurant consultant and columnist whose passion for Caesar Salad led him to penning this book.This book was an enjoyable read. I loved reading of the history of this flavorful salad. Also, I enjoyed the adaptations of this classic dish as well. One of them was hysterical! Well, actually, it wasn't funny so much as it was designed to feed a lot of people. The first ingredient: 90 eggs! Yeah, right! I will make that one tomorrow. Not! ;-)There are several black and white photos in here showing salads, menus, restaurants, chefs and the creator, of course, Caesar Cardini.This book is great for true Caesar Salad aficionados. Others may not appreciate it as much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What did they do to this movie (and why)","review":"I saw an asian import of this movie on DVD about the same time it was hitting the theatres in Denver. Other than the fact that all of the menus were in chinese and I had to follow pretty odd instructions to get english subtitles, I was impressed with the underlying message of the movie. I also thought the use of color shifting really added to the whole experience.I just got the american version of the DVD this week and the subtitles SUCK. They completely changed meanings every chance they had and the finished product looks NOTHING like the movie that originally caught my univided attention.I hope Miramax NEVER chops another chinese movie. If you don't mind a little extra work for a much better version, find the import."},{"rating":"2","title":"too bad it cant be nominated","review":"this is one of my favorite movies in theaters this year, too bad it was nominated for best foriegn film last year and cant be nominated again, all I have to say is: see this movie, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"review","review":"Its was great I lost my original copy and wanted to replace, but couldnt find it at all let alone at a good price. And here it was at a great price I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tarantino should be put in prison.","review":"An artistic tragedy. Tarantino and Weinstein should be put in prison for what they've done to this masterpiece. First they delayed the release so it wouldn't compete with the garbage Kill Bill franchise. Then they changed the original subtitles, dumbing down the story for the half-wits who control Miramax. Look for an Asian DVD release if you want to really see this work of genius. And please don't give your entertainment dollars to Quentin or Harvey, remember that they were almost done for, then a million morons paid to see \\"Basterds.\\" Now we have another decade of @*%&! to look forward to from these two hacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If your a Nartial Arts fan this movie is ok, the fighting is ok. But the directing is bad so is the script. I can be hard to follow at times. I think this movie was very boring and cant understand how it has 5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Communist propaganda","review":"This movie is basically communist propaganda. It is about how the center of the country dominates the provinces and the value of having a strong central leader. In other words, it is a paid ad for single-party dictatorship in China. Artistically, it is good, but from the point of politics, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Also, the director seems addicted to showing different colors (entire rooms of yellow, entire rooms of blue, etc). It got boring after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"support your local emperor","review":"That was the point of the movie in a nutshell ---- and that the individual's needs are not nearly as important as the group's.

That is the whole story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have been fooled by IMDb rating, just wasted my time to watching it","review":"I picked it to watch because of its high rating. The movie is awful.15% of the running time, the heroes were flying like birds. I got tiredto watch those flies. I am not talking about reality but they alsokilled any sense of poetry. Actors acting is nothing of acting. Nofacial expression, no body language, just dummy's martial art playaround the clock. You call that a perfect movie? You're kidding me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great visuals, awful story","review":"Ok let me just say that the special effects for this thing they call movie is great, probably one of the best ive ever seen, but the story is just not interesting enough and the fight scenes arent even that interesting, I think it tried to hard to be like crouching tiger,hidden dragon and it failed miserably. Chinese martial arts films are not supposed to be like this, and thats that."},{"rating":"1","title":"HERO- HUH","review":"Well it was a great copy. Picture wise BUt.and I do mean but.

I really wanted to see this movie, but after I watched it, I felt disappointment and irritation over the over written script, and the poorly delivered outcome. The movie had too much going on at times, and not enough going on at other times. At least in crouching tiger, hidden dragon, it never had too much going on. I also disliked the message of the movie, it seems forced upon the audience. While I wont give away the ending for anyone who wants to see this movie, I will say this: it seems like propaganda, like a movie that the chinese government wants you to see. But that is just what I thought. Oh, and by the way, my friend didnt like the movie eather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"First, while I can't explain it, this movie is like a piece of mainland China propaganda directed at Taiwan. If they hadn't lost me before the ending of the movie (And they definitely did), they would have lost me with how they concluded it. It tried too hard to be artistic over everything else and suffers for it. Perhaps 2 stars is 1 too many."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOO Over Hyped!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie sucked so bad!

My first reaction upon it ending was to think we had been in our seats for at least three hours, I was shocked to see it was well short of that time...that should indicate the quality of the story telling. What could have been accomplished in a much more streamlined fashion is painfully dragged out. While the camera work is impressive, its nothing more than eye candy, because there is little to no substance behind it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old thing","review":"Ok, I liked the idea.... when it was first introduced back with Crouching Tiger. Doesn't anyone see that these movies are the same. The same actress the same effects. The list goes on. I'm not going to spend money to see the same stuff over and over. It's the same with House of Flying Daggers. The same stuff shoved down our throughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool","review":"I saw this movie in the theatres and let me tell you, awesome!! The cinematagrophy for the movie as well as the choreography for the fight scenes are just mesmorizing(very Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon-esque). I like how it is at least somewhat based on Historical events, with the first Chinese Emperor Shih Huang-ti playing a prominent role. Along with this were small details like when Jet-li's character pays the blind musician he uses pieces of bronze(I think they were axe heads or something like that) that were really used for money in ancient China(or at least convincing replicas)!! In addition the overall message of the film I thought was good and profound. I won't tell you what I think that message is, you will have to watch the movie and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favotite Jet Li movie, English dub a horrible mistake","review":"If I were just rating the movie, it would easily be 5 stars. If you haven't already see it, you owe it to yourself to experience it. That is what blu ray is, an experience. The decision to release this movie on blu ray was a great decision. The decision to have the default audio track English was a questionable one, but it could have been easily overlooked as long as the original language was included as a LOSSLESS audio track. Lossless audio means no compression, the highest quality audio available today. The decision to release the movie with the original language only available as a LOSSY Dolby Digital track is absolutely unacceptable. That means that you are watching the movie in blu ray video quality and DVD audio quality. If you don't ever plan on having a digital surround sound system in your life, then go buy this movie right away, otherwise, wait for Miramax to release another version with the a Dolby True HD Chinese audio track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Magnificent","review":"Hero is a thrilling and deeply moving viewing experience. The Martial arts scenes are visually stunning, very unusual and beautiful. Surprisingly little explicit violence, this is about dance and spectacle. Backgrounds and settings are used to great effect, and the use of color is quite notable. The acting is nuanced and effective. The plot is quite intricate and involved, but still relatively east to follow. Several surprising plot twists. The ending is not completely satisfactory, but this is a movie to make you think---about ethical-political issues such as the justifications for war and revenge. Worth seeing more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hero Jet Li","review":"I loved this movie. It was mind blowing, full of inspirational scenes, takes me away to a fantasy world. I watched this movie multiple times and everytime was better than the last. I felt this movie offers moral point of view and helps me reflect in my own life. I would without a doubt refer this movie to anyone and anybody I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Feasty","review":"So I can't understand why every needs to run on and on about this being a propagandist film? It's a period piece. It's meant to describe the time it's set in. It's entertainment. It's a film for you to simply enjoy. If I want to watch something about propaganda I'll just put on any US war movie or the Fox news channel. You think that's not propaganda?Anyway... Hero is superb. If you like intense martial arts... wonderfully shot visuals... and great editing... this is a film you will like. Set aside these politcal judgements and enjoy the film for what it really is at the core. Martial way... art... love... paced at a deliberate slower pace because it's simply awesome to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling action drama you do not want to miss","review":"Jet Li has been in some aweful films (the Black Mask, The One), but this film makes up for it. The visuals were intense, and the action sequences were unmatched. This film, Hero, is very reminiscent to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It boasts the same feel of fantasy martial arts, while taking the viewer on an adventure you soon will never forget.See this movie, you will not only leave learning a thing or two about China's past and present, but you will also achieve that satisfied feeling you get when you had your fill of good cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Hero","review":"With \\"Hero\\" and \\"House of Flying Daggers\\" director Zhang Yimou has jettisoned to the forefront of filmmakers working today. There is no denying that Yimou has a distinctively strong visual style. That said, if it's all style and no substance, so what? \\"Hero\\" is blessed with a good narrative. Essentially, the theme of the film is what defines a hero. The answers that Yimou offers are both surprising and enlightening. Strong cast that includes Jet Li and Ziyi Zhang. Essential viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another poor movie from a rotten director","review":"This movie not only requires you to open your imagiation but to forget all sense of reality.

AND NOTHING OF WHAT MADE ME LOVE A YIMOU MOVIE! I SEE EVEN YIMOU CAN SELLOUT WITH A BIG BUDGET MOVIE! THE ACTION SEQUENCES WERE SILLY, AND THE MOVIE TRIED TO DAZZLE THE VIEWER WITH ALL THE COLORFUL BACKGROUNDS, BUT LACKED THE HEART AND THE PLOT OF A YIMOU MOVIE! THIS WAS AS [BAD] AS CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON! THIS MOVIE MADE ME PUKE! IF YOU WANT A GOOD KING OF QIN ASSASSIN FLICK WITH MORE REALISTIC ACTION SEQUENCES MINUS THE SILLY FLYING, GO SEE OR BUY THE EMPEROR AND THE ASSASSIN! POOR YIMOU!!!

Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Is A JOKE!!!","review":"The movie itself is fantastic, and I have been looking forward to this release for months. Today I got online and started reading some reviews on this release and come to discover that the English dubbed version of the film is the only soundtrack that is in a lossless audio format. That is ridiculous!!! It makes no sense since on every release of the film the mandarin audio option is the default format. I will not be buying this film and hope that enough people notice the audio formats before wasting there money on this crap. How can an independent movie company like miramax let someone butcher the blu-ray of a great movie by releasing a version like this...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great great film.","review":"This film was very well made. Not only was the storyline interesting, but the beautifully filmed scenes will take your breath away. All of the actors did a wonderful job. Though I liked Crouching Tiger, I consider this to be the superior film. Crouching Tiger got bogged down with too much emotional drama despite the wonderful fight scenes. This movie kept it simple with enough extra elements to keep it interesting. Ignore the posters arguing about politics, communism..blah blah blah. You connect with the characters and eagerly await what happens next. That is what a film is supposed to do. A fantastic movie that is worthing buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb! Martial Arts with a Soul!","review":"Wow! I went in expecting just an action-oriented martial arts movie with great cinematography and I got so much more. To be sure, the fight choreography and camera work are superb - the visuals of lone martial arts warriors facing off against veritable armies of soldiers and archers are breath-taking. The mixing of violence against a back-drop of lush natural environments is likewise stunning. However, what surprised me was the depth of the plot, and the message/moral at the end of the movie, which is NOT typical of most martial arts movies. Right up there with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon - and in some ways superior. Go see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hAD to write a review even though there are hundreds already","review":"I can't believe people are ripping this movie based on THEIR political beliefs. Why do you care about the message that this movie tries to send to you. Yeah, Jet could have blocked the arrows(maybe), or just flew over the wall, but he was making a point that this is the best decision he can make. I am also one that believes that countries should be seperate just like states, but this movie went the other direction. You are gonna rip one of the most beautiful movies ever because you didn't like the message that it sent, that is just wrong. The way the story was told, the music, the visuals, the martial arts, the ACTING, I could go on and on about what makes this movie right, but the 2 biggest things for me were the visual ecperience at the mirror lake and the dramatic ending. Overall one of the best movies ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"Full movie. High quality. The translation was really good, considering that my mother tongue is Chinese. Sound effect was really good as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time","review":"\\"Red Cliff\\" is a close second.I love the story and the use of color. There's nothing like it. i recommend it without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jet Li - Hero","review":"Jet Li pulls it off again. One of his better, epic films of 2000, this film has a very deep plot. While action and fight scenes are a little skiddish, the film is action packed overall and is filled with talented actors. Definite keeper for your Jet Li Collection and also one of his last 'epic' films to be created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Excellent movie, lots of action scenes to thrill the eyes. A must have for Jet Li and Zhang Ziyi fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Unsubstantial!","review":"I was really excited to watch this movie. I thought it was going to be some kind of masterpiece based on the reviews and word of mouth.Wow, was I disapointed.A) Slow motion was used way to much.B) The way the told the same story five (or however many) different ways just bored me to death. I almost fell asleep a few times while watching it.C) A few of the early fight scenes were good. Most of the others, again, relied too much on slow-mo!D) Some of the large army scenes were too CGI'd for me. You don't even have to look closely to see that the people are duplicated.E) Each time a character in the movie is stabbed, they show the victim's face and you hear the sword go in. EVERY SINGLE TIME- How trite!Comparing this to \\"Crouching Tiger\\" is a joke and I feel bad even mentioning them in the same breath.I'd give it one star but I did enjoy the first half hour of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"Besides the colorful of screen, there is nothing worth to watch.The story is ridiculous, the kung-fu is full of fake action.Do NOT waste your time and money. Find something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable chopsocky.","review":"This is one of the worst big budget movies ever made. It is very much on the same order as Ed Wood's films, \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", etc. The spectacular fight scenes that \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" maintained effortlessly, only destroy the suspension of disbelief in this movie. And going over the story of what actually happened three different times, with three different explanations, becomes less and less interesting each time through. The director's attempt to explore a philosophical point while making an action movie fails completely. If I had been in a movie theater instead of at home, I would have walked out before the film was finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"With a cast like that, I expected a decent film...I could never get into it, though. I felt like I was having \\"art\\" shoved down my throat...each flashback has a color scheme, like red, green, etc. It gives the movie a great visual appearance, but ultimately distracts and removes the viewer from the experience...it reminds the viewer he/she is watching a movie, rather than relating to the movie directly. I've never had that sensation in a Hong Kong or mainland movie, even those for which I had no subtitles and had only the images to tell me the story. Plus, I can see the same person die only a couple times before I get fed up and say, \\"just kill the guy, already, and get on with it!\\"Odd thing...almost all of the people I've talked to in mainland China hated \\"Crouching Tiger\\", but loved this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The truth","review":"This film does indeed look good, sound good, and has some nice aspects to it. But, come on. All of these glowing reviews ignore the fact that this movie is a rip off of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It is shown to us in slow motion (most of the film is in slo mo). It also is basically a propaganda film spouting communist themes (\\"one land\\"...\\"one party\\", sound familier?). Jet Li's character won't kill this terrible, brutal tyrant, because a united land under a evil dictator is better than 7 different kingdoms? Get real. This is one boring movie, and all the wire fighting and color schemes in the world won't change that. See this movie for what it really is, mellodramatic cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work of irony?","review":"Gorgeous cinematography, but pretty boringly told. Excessive use of slo-mo detracted from the action sequences. In repeatedly borrowing from Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, Zhang may have intended this as a work of irony. It certainly slipped past the Chinese censors. Most Chinese audiences are, of course, immune to irony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better then Crouching Tigger, Hidden Dragon","review":"This movie is the best movie that ever came from China or Hong Kong. There is way more fight scenes and the story line is very good.Everyone in this movie did an awesome job playong there roles and the scenery is beatiful.I hate it when people compare this movie to Crouching Tigger, Hidden Dragon, the chinese have been doing these kinds of movies way back in the 70's I think.PLus Hero is the better moives of the two if i must pick..."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Hero can be appreciated only for its artistic vision and execution. It is beautifully shot, with sweeping camera angles, vivid costumes, and well choreographed fight(s). However, the movie is flawed at the core. The script is confused and loses its original goal. It becomes a schmaltzy, over-the-top display of colors and costumes with no point to it. It does have a nice little action sequence in the beginning with Jet Li and Donnie Yen but that is about all. THe other fights are just dramatic scenes that end up being slow motion shots of the actors faces as they fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterwork movie, very poor quality DVD","review":"If you have an HDTV, this DVD looks awful. A stunning movie that simply looks terrible on screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most beautiful films that I have ever seen.","review":"I was lucky enough to study Chinese martial arts theater (in brief) some years before watching this film. Even the trailers intoxicated me, and I went out of my way to get to see it. As a film, it did not take long to reach legendary status in China. However, the reception here must have been minimal.The colors of the film coordinate with the attitude behind the story. Red is the color in order to portray everyone as heroic, while blue is the color used to portray everyone as deceptive. There is perhaps more nuance to it than I can even capture.The style flows like a well choreographed ballet, and the battle sequences are often hypnotizing. Although reminiscent of films like Crouching Tiger or House of Flying Daggers, there is so much of the film that is stylistically so original and striking that it is even hard to make comparisons. Yet, fans of those films will appreciate this treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"hero is a hero","review":"This movie has it all: epic battles, outstanding sword play, wu xia, romance, intrigue. Based loosely on an historical character--the cruel, but shrewd Xin, the first man to unite the provences of China into a single country. The hero's goal is to assinate Xin to avenge his father's death and to relieve is home provence from the threat of the cruel Xin. He executes a clever ploy to get close enough to Xin, again loosely based on an historical attempt on Xin's life, to acheive his goal. Both men, face to face, are prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for what they believe in in the spell-binding climax. I would put this movie on par with Chariots of Fire for the portrayal of man's struggle for truth and integrity--with great action as anyone familiar with Jet Li would expect and spectacular cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning movie","review":"This movie is such a pleasure for the eyes to watch. The cinematography, the pace, the colors, the beautiful language just captivated me. The story has some good twists in it, but it was particularly the grace that got me more than anything. But if you are wanting a fast paced action thriller then this is not for you. Make sure to watch it in the Mandarin version with English subtitles unless you understand Mandarin, as the movie just isn't the same when it is dubbed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maggie Cheung is amazing","review":"One of the primary pleasures of Hero is that Maggie Cheung is remarkably resplendent in every frame in which she is present. As a whole the cinematography, set designs, action direction and special effects coalesce to create a bevy of astonishingly memorable scenes.While Hero boasts a top-billing cast, the acting is a bit stilted, but it has an elegance to it that fits with the antiquated setting.A recommended gift for anyone who expressed the slightest interest after seeing the trailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hero","review":"Jet Li is fantastic! Fight scenes are increditable!!! Story line is historic and the sights are grandeur!!! In BluRay it's even more grandeur!!! Donnie Yen is Fab and so are the other martial artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great addition to Blueray","review":"I just got it today. Its one of my favorite films. No doubts about its visually stunning scenes. But i should say this Blueray version doesnt seems to be that great compared to a dvd version. If you have a dvd then dont buy this. If you want to save some money, then buy a dvd instead of Blueray disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cinematographers Dream","review":"If you appreciate the art of a beautiful independant movie production than you will love this. Hero shows a wonderful use of cinematography and color selection, beautiful cinematic slow paced storytelling and a soundtrack that touches you somewhere deep.Also consider that this is a chinese influenced film and not the traditional overdubbed Japanese sword fighting films you might be used to. Ashes Of Time (1994, Wong Kar-Wai) would be another example of this style of cinematic filmmaking.Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"gorgeous","review":"This is about the most beautiful movie I have ever seen in my life. Everything is flowing. The long drapery of each female actress, both gorgeous, are constantly blowing and billowing in winds, breezes and color. Much is in slow motion, to accentuate the flow back and forth of the duels, the ballet-like sword fights that fill the movie. I can watch it over and over for the color and astonishing sword feats of the actors.Jet Li is at his best. And it is based on real events. My highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"may the NAMELESS, BROKEN SWORD never fall from the","review":"SKY like FLYING SNOW on your sleepy head! an old chinese proverb. this movie is boring, ridiculous and sleep inducing. it may be a chinese cure for insomnia except you'll probably be tired again an hour after you wake up. and i thought hollywood movies were bad. chinese movies are worse. much worse. maybe indian movies are better. yeah sure. oh well, i also ordered rob zombie's \\"house of a 1000 corpses\\". maybe that's good. p.s. always remember the very honorable story of the (chinese) emperor's new clothes and look for what's really there, not what some pompous jackass tells you is there. and may the QIN be with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow for special effects & music","review":"This is not normally the type of film I enjoy, but after getting a new big screen plasma TV, with surround sound, we were told it would be a good first pick.

Transfer is pretty good for a film that's over 10 years old. Trust me, this film is worth Blu-ray.

At a time when China is dangling its war toys over Taiwan, it is unacceptable for Western viewers to endorse this piece of over-produced, government-sponsored, dogmatic trash.Particularly surprising is the promotion of this film by the liberal media. Roger Ebert of Chicago Tribune, David Edelstein of Slate, Charles Taylor of Salon, and many others have wholeheartedly endorsed Hero. In so doing, they have implicitly legitimated its reactionary political message. The only critic (that I know of) who saw through the film's glossy facade was J. Hoberman of The Village Voice, who wrote of the film's \\"sanctimonious traditionalism\\" and its \\"glorification of ruthless leadership and self-sacrifice on the altar of national greatness.\\" I, for one, sign my name under Hoberman's final pronouncement: Hero is nothing more than \\"fascinating fascism.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics, but what a dumb movie.","review":"I know it's a movie but it has some ridiculous assertions.SPOILERS!!!1) Two ASSASSINS did a FRONTAL assault on the Emperor and was able to hold off his entire army just by twirling their swords.2) When Jet Li's character kills the Emperor's targets, non of the Emperor's men bother to double check that his targets are actually dead.3) No Emperor is stupid enough to give the reward of letting people drink 10 paces from him.4) If the Emperor did give out such a reward, no assassin would be stupid enough to take it up, because if anyone really got that close to the Emperor, it would have turned out to be a decoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hero","review":"I waited excitedly for another Jet Li movie to come out.

This one has much more artistry than the average movie. I don't understand it yet. Apparently there are alternate realities where the characters take different paths in each reality and have different experiences. An example being how the character \\"Snow\\" kills people multiple times, apparently as if they were'nt killed the first time. But I don't think the movie is just one reality. The whole film is very abstract and beautiful. The only thing I would change is the fact that the original actors and actresses didn't dub their lines in English.

One must give credit to Ives for all of his research but I found the book impossible to read. Most annoying to me, he provided information, then disproved it, and finally argued that it might, in fact, be true. I reread several passages trying to understand what on earth he was trying to say. Other authors have done a better job of speaking about the people of the court - title changes, multiple names, it's all a big confusing mess here. Reading this, I felt like I was slogging through a textbook I HAD to read. So I quit. I will find another book about Anne B that is more to my liking and doesn't leave me so muddled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough biography to be worthy of the book title","review":"The book is tirelessly researched, which is its main problem.

This one is far better and has more color. I highly recommend this book to history readers. I am always mining any new biography for new nuggets of information about this most elusive of women.

The author jumps back and forth and there are so many names and ranks of nobility mentioned here and there and everywhere and back and forth, it's hard to keep up.

Only disappointment was there was no whiskey or women!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This book highlights the only drawback of ordering on-line: You can't pick it up and thumb through it. If I had, I would have put it back on the shelf. The book consists of 1 or 2-page anecdotes from Grant's life, and then (sometimes loosely) connected to a business principle. While I found some of the anecdotes mildly interesting, the business lessons were sometimes insultingly simple. A couple of examples: (1) Don't swear. (2) Interview people in person if at all possible. I was looking for a book with a narrative that provided insights into Grant's strategic thinking, his psychology of leadership, etc. Instead I received fortune-cookie truisms linked loosely to Grant's life. I think what I was looking for may be found in Tom Wheeler's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book on managing, leading and facing life's issues!","review":"Identical to the book on leadership using Robert E. Lee, Kaltman has taken issues faced by Ulysses S. Grant and placed them in similar context. Issues managers and people in general face are brought forth on how to deal with adversity, changes, demands, employees and other popular concepts are clearly written. Kaltman has put together a great book in regards to managing work related and also non-work related issues that can be very beneficial to anyone. The book is a rather quick read and covers many topics or situations Grant faced that could be represented towards leadership scenarios from his early beginnings to after the war. This book is full of great insight and lessons to be learned from either failures or successes that Grant went through. Many people can benefit from reading this facinating book on leadership and take what they learned and use it in everyday life. 5 STARS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is Very Motivational","review":"You must admit, since it has so many reviews, this book got people up off their buts to comment. I found it to be compelling and it kept me thinking about the subject matter all day long. I have a book that rates presidents and its writer gave Grant failing marks. Since I have read this and a couple of other treatise on him, I believe that writer was up in the night. Yes, and that's a firm conviction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting reading...interesting information","review":"This book is a quick read. I particularly enjoyed the author's focus on Grant's ability to react, adjust and adapt. Staying away from Grant's presidency was a good idea until the end. Even then, the author contrasts Grant's leadership style as a General to President and why he failed (at least historically) as a politician. What I didn't like about the book was the lack of reference to God. I understand that not everyone is firmly rooted in \\"the Word\\", but its absence leads to more questions...at least for me. Overall, thought provoking, mildly insightful and interesting. I heartily recommend Lee's Leadership Lessons.

But even if such a theology were to come into being what difference does it make to Sabom? Is his religious belief so fragile that he can't accomodate the feelings of those who diverge from HIS path? Sabom's book is quite refreshing when compared to Dr.Maurice Rawlings near-death research. Dr.Rawlings, a fundamentalist Christian, tries to frighten people into accepting Christianity by telling them that if they don't accept his version of jesus they can expect a Hellish near-death experience. What a small time Jesus this must be! Dr.Sabom is to be commended for presenting such a well thought out presentation of the near-death subject. His book is very thought provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"The word is Zondervan","review":"I don't want to rehash the thoughtful comments of the other reviewers... I saw a TV special about one of the people included in the book and that led me to buy the book... I neglected to note the publisher, Zondervan, an evangelical Christian publisher....that in itself lets the reader know where the author is going with his research. As a nurse I have been priviledged to hear such accounts first-hand; regardless of the ultimate nature of this human experience, one cannot avoid being deeply touched...what is saddening to me is that such experiences then become the 'battleground' for belief systems that are uncomfortable with mystery, and a rather small minded claim on knowing the 'truth' for the rest of us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good Disney, and it's good ragtime.","review":"The upbeat, gentle, main-street American genre of ragtime works perfectly with the upbeat, gentle, main-street American theme of the Disney parks.

This was my favorite Walt Disney World attraction as a kid, but it went belly up when its sponsor, Eastern Airlines, did. It was so wonderful to hear that melody again! Parts of it I had forgotten, but then I listened to this album, and though, \\"Oh,yeah!

In fact she explains many things under her breath, and the only way to get it, is through psychic powers. Therefore I am required to read this drivel on my own and try to understand the topics. Most of the problems have squat to do with the section topics. Additionally, the problems are vague, worded improperly, and essentially devoid of any learing value. I would recommend that you save your money and purchase a decent copy and get this crappy one from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meteocre level text","review":"I was required to use this book as textbook. It really doesn't help much but if you're the type who doesn't like to sit in during college lectures of a course such as Differential Equations, this is the book for you. It is hard to understand the text for this math book becasue it might ask you to refer to something in the previous chapter. I would definitely go with the first edition of this book. It was much better, and I myself have used the first edition. It is easier to understand. I have not completely read the book, but from what I have read (most of it) I can atleast say that this is not the \\"best of its kind\\". Chirag"},{"rating":"1","title":"Vague and Confusing...","review":"When taking an introduction class to differential equations, I found this book to be completely unhelpful in not only mastering the material but simply learning it as well! The explinations in this book are completely confusing and quite wordy. The examples and figures shown within these explinations often times don't even relate to the problems contained within the section. If a concept was not explained clearly, or not at all in lecture, it was very difficult to go back through the section and learn it with the book. I cannot express in words how frustrated and disappointed I am with this book. I am very upset that my professor selected this book because I know there are better texts out on the market. I also had to waste a lot of money for this wordy pile of drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very confusing book","review":"Used the newer edition of the book, which appears to be exactly the same. Found the book very confusing and hard to understand any of the concept without having someone else explain it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good differential equations textbook","review":"I think the strength of this textbook is the amount of material it encompasses: this book is used in two separate courses in my school--introduction to DE and engineering analysis. I didn't appreciate the textbook so much until I completed my differential equations course and then looked back at the sections on mechanical vibrations to review for my physics course. I then realized that the explanations and derivations were extremely satisfying, much more than your average introductory physics text. Also, the emphasis on the qualitative aspects of DEs, such as slope fields and phase portraits, aid in the coneptual understanding of the otherwise rigorous computation aspects of the topic. My only complaint is that the proofs could've been done in a more understandable manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Not a bad book at all. Physical applications well explained, theory OK but not as good in my opinion. Unfortunately, contains a fair number of typos, and the book is physically weak (the binding of mine is splitting after only 4 months of use) for a book of this price. Still, pretty good overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and unclear","review":"This book was used in an introduction to differential equations, and was of very little reference value. The theory is extremely distant from application, and the scientific and engineering motivations for solving differential equations are not apparent. If a concept was missed in lecture, it was often an ordeal to attempt to learn from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare yourself the pain","review":"This book starts off alright, but then it takes you on a ride through hell. Some of the chapters lack examples. The authors will ramble on about the theory and give you one example that is irrelevant to the exercises (usually an example that is extraordinarily easy). Then come the exercises, and if you get stuck, lo and behold, tough luck get another book or someone else to help you. While a few of the chapters are well written, there are other books in which ALL the chapters all written (like pollard and tenenbaum, which is also nearly 1/6 the price). All in all, I would not recommend this book to first-timers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different book!!","review":"We use this book here at Central Michigan University and I must say that it is one of the hardest math books to comprehend. It's wordy and has an overabundace of theorems, proofs, as well as example problems that are variable based. The authors make minimal usage of actual numbers. This book is probably chosen by professors for its computer applications rather than its instruction in learning differential equations. I am in the process of looking for another book to help me learn this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very realistic and fun","review":"My 4 year old daughter received this as a gift and absolutely loves it.

However the vocabulary is so high level that beginning and intermediate learners will have a hard time memorizing it and using it in conversations. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the book covers such a wide variety of specialized fields that the terms may be inadequate for an advanced learner. Advanced learners may be better served by reading books written for Japanese people about a particular subject. If you find books written for adults too difficult, books written for children and teens may be helpful.

Unfortunately, the seat angle latch broke on our first trip and the latch to fold the wheels broke on our second trip! Stokke told that this happens 'often', and charges $250 for the repair! The latches are made of flimsy plastic, so are easy to break (and the travel bag has no padding to protect them).

With the PDR you can look it up and decide for yourself if you should seek a second opinion. Some doctors make a living just selling useless (and sometimes dangerous) medications. Moreover, if you know what medication someone is taking (especially if you know the dosage), you can look it up in the PDR and figure out whats really wrong with them. Therefore, this is a good text for lawyers and those who work in law enforcement as well. The PDR also functions as a primer on medicine and the US health care delivery system.

I guess the producers wanted the Susannah York part to be Susannah York, which is too bad because she was a fine actress and her part seems to deserve a better script and direction.

This is simply giving you the other side of the story, the TRUE side!This music is for those who have drowned themselves in the lies that Black Metal has told.

The only ones who rave on this album are little sissy mallrats who only got into Blackmetal when Cradle of Filth started selling shirts in Hot Topic. These same kids who did not have this when it was actually released now try to say it is a benchmark of Blackmetal. What a laugh.This is not Blackmetal by any means. Do not be fooled.

Being a Christian, I love the lyrics and song titles on here but even if your not a Christian, don't let this stop you from listening to an excellent black metal release that should be in everyone's collection. The vocals, instruments, and haunting melodies sound like something you would hear in a pagan or satanic bands cd so don't think that just because it was done by a Christian, that it will sound terrible or cheesy. If you like the raw grim sound of early black metal, then be sure to pick this cd up as you will not be disappointed. Its a shame that Anonymous didn't release any other albums under Horde."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating subject, horrible writing","review":"David Yeadon's book on his experiences in the Outer Hebrides is unfortunately rather dull. The style is bland, riddled with clichés, and the only truly interesting descriptions we get are in the form of quotations.

There's nothing on here that's bound to be an international smash hit or anything... they're not the new Coldplay. I'd relate them more to Belle & Sebastian (the songs with Sarah Martin on vocals) in that the songs are more subtle than striking. Some very memorable melodies that'll get stuck in your head.

The plot is a little far fetched, but I'm not a bored guy trying to get through a mid-life crisis by poking my nose into a murder.

Steve is Maxwells brother. He guided 3 U.S. presidents down the Brule River. I believe he got this information through a book that was penned by Steve's wife Dorothy Weyandt.

I started EC'ing at 10 months so it was great that i didn't need to read everything starting at the newborn stage. Very easy reading - important when you are trying to catch reading time during nap time. Also not 'preachy' - it allows you to feel good about trying this without doing it 100% of the time.Not for the parent (caregiver) who wants a very detailed formula on elimination communication. Great for the parent who can trust their instincts and can generalize information.This is not about potty training. EC is about learning to read and understand the signs that your baby is giving you. This book does a great job of explaining the philosophical perspective behind elimination communication.I would definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many involvement levels and alternate situations listed.","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I also bought \\"Diaper Free\\" by Ingrid Bauer and while I liked her writing, it seemed that she was more of a completely diaper-free person.

It made it really easy for me to feel that it was adaptable to my situation and any way I did it was ok and their were some helpful guidlines. There were also helpful guidelines that I will prob try to impliment with my conventially diapered 2 year old. My daughter is now 3 weeks old and even with just our part-time/ occasional and a 2 year old we're catching 3 or 4 a day and most of the night time ones without stress or much effort. A beautiful concept that the Western world isn't in to, but soooo easy to do.

I bought this book just to sort of get re-inspired about the theory and read a new author. Wow! While the other books I'd read were very nice, this one was way better at actually giving solid instructions and advice. Instead of just expecting moms to intuit from day one (the intuition does eventually become the main indicator, but only once you've established EC with baby...)

The sound is big and bombastic with occasional quiet interludes thrown in for good measure. Dream Theater, Queensrcyche, and maybe even \\"Wall\\" era Pink Floyd are good comparisons.

Extremely listenable whether you're by yourself, or need some background for a friendly gathering. Track #5, with its reference to being behind the wheel of a \\"Capri\\", confirms the credibility of this band's continental origins.

Breezy music comes as easily as breathing for them, and from the first track, \\"Woodcabin,\\" it's clear that they're here to bring sunshine into your life. Even with the sibling rivalry gone to the disco, \\"Sylvie,\\" things stay upbeat. No one but Saint Etienne can make separation (like in \\"Mr. Donut\\") sound happy. \\"Been So Long\\" tosses in some light jazz riffs; \\"Postman\\" plays off the dynamic contrast of the verses and the chorus; and \\"Erica America\\" makes the most of its funk bass. If you're not smiling by the end of GOOD HUMOR, there's something wrong with you. The limited edition released in the U.S. includes a bonus disc, FAIRFAX HIGH, that collects the b-sides from the singles, plus a few exclusives like the melodic post-club comedown of \\"4:35 in the Morning\\" or the wordless simplicity of \\"Cat Nap.\\" Smiles all around!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this CD is the bomb","review":"Do you dig the Cardigans?

I will say, after reading reviews for this one, I thought it was going to be very challenging, just I was looking for. It was completely the opposite. The reps for each exercise are way to few to have any effect and I thought the moves would be more challenging and even doing the workout along with the person in the DVD who is doing the advanced moves, it was still a very beginner workout. Maybe not beginner in the sense of getting used to the bosu, which really doesn't take long at all. I would say if you are someone who is just starting to workout or getting back into working out after being out a long time, then this would be ok.

The term \\"huddle fever\\" is itself a grotesquely contorted expression of what most people would describe as a tradition of strong families. Strong families, common to immigrant communities, can at times be oppressive, however, they are more often supportive and nuturing. \\"Huddle Fever\\" did not depict the Lawrence I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corporate deployment of Sharepoint","review":"We used this book for a pilot of Sharepoint to a group of project managers.

Bass covers the territory with panache and depth, providing a thoughtful, nuanced look at the origins of the US-Israel relationship. His writing is crisp, inviting and colorful - it is hard to forget the manifold and varied picture he creates of the giants of history who forged the very policies whose repercussions we feel so stunningly today. It is also very hard to put the book down. Such a combination is rare and welcome, and makes this book a must for anyone even remotely interested in the Middle East and America (which should be all of us, these days...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very important connection","review":"This definitely fills the gap in scholarship that surrounds the nature of the American relationship with Israel. Although The Israelis were told to not be \`the first nation to employ nuclear weapons in the middle east' Mr. Eban replied to Mr. Rusk saying \`We wont be the second either'. Thus this book describes the complicated political game that was the 1960s relationship with Israel in which America looked the other way at the Dimona project while JFK declared he would support \`any friend'. Nasser helped cement the relationship by excepting Czech arms. Thus this books shows the truth behind Americas ties to Israel wasn't \`Jewish influence' but rather cold war politics. A fascinating and important account.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"rating":"2","title":"JFK faces the Middle East","review":"Parts of this exhaustively researched historical account read like a novel. Looking back forty years later on Middle East crises of the early 1960s, Bass shows a remarkable sense of depth and history. His accounts of West Wing meetings and diplomatic spats can be fascinating, and the image he presents of JFK's relationship with Israel and its leaders is totally believable and in keeping with what we already know about JFK in other arenas. The president is deeply engaged when he wants to be, acts out of principle, and has an all-too-honest view of humans' frailties. Interestingly, Bass found little evidence that domestic politics or the \\"Israel lobby\\" affected foreign policy in the Kennedy years.Parts of the book are a bit too detailed and will be of interest mainly to specialists, but I do recommend the book to anyone interested in Israel, the Middle East generally, or America in the 1960s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read!","review":"I am not finished with this book, but am looking for the others already.

I am using setting of 2 (low rate) and could fit only 7 small tabs.2. Bottom feeding. When you insert new tabs at the bottom, the existing wet and half consumed tabs are pushed to the top and the new ones are being used first.3. Tedious to open and refill. You need to turn the bottom 10-20 turns to open and close.

Block is very choppy in his transition between first and third persons, and Scudder's narratives in this novel do nothing to help move the story along. Heavy focus on the killer's thoughts might have worked better had the killer been a more believable character. Much of the plot felt contrived and forced to me. The novel did pick up a little momentum toward the end, but even at this point the final pages had to rely on unlikely coincidences. I highly recommend going back to any of Block's earlier Matt Scudder Novels (\\"When the Sacred Gin Mill Closes\\", \\"A Walk Among the Tombstones\\" etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matthew Scudder is dying a slow death","review":"I used to buy Block in hardcover but after the Turkey \\"Small Town\\" I just read library copies if I see one. \\"Flowers\\" here was on the \\"New Arrivals\\" shelf so I didn't have to spend a dime. Good thing too because Scudder is gone. Instead of the fascinating read of gumshoe evidence gathering via interview, we only get a psychopathic killer's mental ramblings.

He is killing him slowly by running off his loyal readers with the graphic murders, when what hooked us in the first place was Scudders logical process of uncovering the perpetrator.

The climax reads like a made-for-TV movie, where the intended victim hasn't been left alone for weeks, and, yet, just after Scudder and the intended victim agree that the killer is still in town and still after her, he leaves her alone to get the newspaper! And guess who is just down the hall at that moment? Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All The Flowers Are Dying","review":"Not bad, just not all that good or up to early and mid series Scudder. Block seems to rely more on graphic sex and gore (as in Small Town) than on the strong characterization that made Scudder an outstanding series character; deeply flawed but rigidly ethical (to his own deeply held code of ethics). In the last few books he has become too clean. Block has walked away from what made Scudder outstanding. I've been a major Scudder fan, but not this one. Plus, half the book is printed in italics, which is a nusance to read. This appears to be the last of the Scudder series and, though I'll miss Matt, his exit, at this late date, is appropriate.Good friends pass on. Rest In Peace, Matt!Richard A.

This one gives the killer whole chapters to present his worldview to the reader. You can tell it's him because the chapters are written in italics.

This novel is told from two perspectives, that of Scudder and a serial killer who was also in the previous Scudder novel \\"Hope to Die\\". Mr. Block's decision to age Scudder in real time allows for intresting storytelling. Scudder is in his sixties and he acts like a man of that age. I love a novel that keeps me guessing at it's outcome and this book had me going in the last ten pages. I think the last ten pages of this book is some of the best writing that Mr. Block has ever done. The ending is especially poigniant if you are a long time fan of the series.

This TV is amazing. Sports and my PS3 look amazing. Notice what I can only call..Shiny faces with some Primetime shows. I don't know if this is because of upscaling or what. I still need to fool around with color settings to get things just right but so far I've been super pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had it for 1.5 years now... it's great!","review":"Pros:- Fantastic picture. Very crisp, colorful, and the blacks are black.- Great value. 50\\" 1080p plasmas and LCD's are much more expensive (in 2008).- Horizontal viewing angles are surprisingly good. I can get at 45 degree angle before I start noticing a decrease in brightness. So, unless you have an extremely wide living room, no viewers will usually be sitting in the poor brightness zone.Cons:- Vertical viewing angle is not very good. If your head is above the top of the TV or below the bottom of the TV, you notice a significant decrease in brightness.-SLIGHT bow at top of screen. I can only notice it during letterbox movies. I thought this was a big deal at first, but then I realized I have more important things to worry about in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING DO NOT BUY!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS TV.... it is plagued with problems but the biggest problem is Samsung's customer service (which is non-existent). They are rude and refuse to back up their products. This is the second Samsung we have owned - both have been serviced numerous times. Granted, the picture when we purchased the tv was good and the selling point. If you purchase a tv every year, you'll be ok with the Samsung; however, if you intend to keep more than a year -- do yourself a favor and buy another brand. They only last 1-2 years MAX! The latest problem is thousands of white dots/pixels spread all over the screen. Apparently there are some class action suits for this problem but (go figure) our set is not in the list of class action suit serial numbers.I cannot stress enough to stay away from this company!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"Wow! What a picture. For reference, I also have the 1080P DLP 56\\" in my living room which i've owned for 2 yrs with zero problems. I was getting close to buying this 50\\" in the old DLP (same as my 56\\") for $1500. I did some more searching and found the new LED 50\\" on Amazon (thru Crutchfield) for only $1299 no tax and free shipping. Unreal. Crutchfield delivered quickly and in perfect working order, not only that, to my surprise was a free TV stand which sold for $250. ( I later sold it on craigslist for $150 ) SO, my tv was only $1050.I won't bore any further, the TV hooked up in HD to my Directv system is absolutely amazing. Volume controls are inconsistent and the satellite takes longer than cable when changing channels, but that is nothing considering the cost and the picture.I would recommend this TV to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung 50\\" DLP, LED","review":"I am thrilled with my Samsung 50\\" DLP (LED).

The good news is it came 2 days early. My experience, in contrast with some of the other reviewers, was that the shipper (Eagle) was courteous and efficient with their delivery.When I turned the TV on, there was a loud mecahnical noise from a fan making contact with the TV casing. A call to samsung was followed up by a call from their local agent who scheduled a trip to my house. It took 15 minutes to fix the problem and the everything is now working well.This was easily the lowest price that I found for this TV. I love the picture and the appearance of the TV. My message is that it may take some to deliver and patience to work through bugs, but both Eagle and Samsung were professional, efficient and easy to work with. I would buy this product again from Amazon if I were doing this over."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Time HD buyer","review":"Received this product (HTL5087sax) about a month and a half ago. After a lot of research and our 27\\" crt of 11 yrs. went out an hour before the super bowl, I pulled the trigger and ordered from amazon. I have been very pleased with the product epically with the HD content. Color is bright and sound is ok. The universal remote does not fully control my other devises, such as motorola HDMI cable box and dvd player but is acceptable. I almost was swayed to buy an LCD or Plasma due to all the complaints about the lifetime of the bulb but changed mind due to the LED technology. I would highly recommend this product to those looking to enter the High Def. world because of the picture, price and proven technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier","review":"As a former HD owner, this was an extreme step up. The picture is fantastic, and the LED's make it worth the price, even though it is highly affordable as it is. I give it 5 stars with the one complaint being there is no optical in cable, and the menu of the TV, while pretty, lacks some features. My faith in Samsung is restored. If you are considering purchasing this, I honestly suggest you do. The LED technology is worth the price alone but they packaged a stylish DLP gorgeous flat screen around it. If you have a good sound home theater system this TV only enhances the experience. I hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome TV","review":"I am very pleased with this purchase. The best part is how thin the border is around the screen. It fit in my Entertainment Center, by 1/8 of an inch. Boy that was close. Couldn't have done that with any other TV. The picture is great and the delivery was very timely(6 days) and flexible. They delivered on Saturday, which saved me from taking time off work. I sure am glad I found this TV online. The only thing the TV is missing, that I've seen on other HD TV's is the split screen feature. No split screen or PIP option that I can find. :( Oh well, still a great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a surprise!","review":"Considering the the pros and cons of the various formats, decided upon the DLP and LED light engine. A little concerned that the brightness may not be what I would expect. I am pleasantly suprised at the brightness and color clarity. The internal tuner quickly picked up the OTA signals with a RadioShack antenna and descrambled many HD signals from the basic cable connection.

Quite amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS TELEVISION, IT KEEPS BREAKING AND SAMSUNG CUSTOMER SERVICE WILL NOT REPLACE","review":"I have had nothing but problems with this television. The first of this model had dust in the projector (when it was delivered) so I was able to deal with the merchant and get a replacement.Now the television has a picture which shuts off for minutes or hours at a time, which was determined to be a motherboard problem. Samsung has been out to repair the television multiple times (I'm on the THIRD broken motherboard) and the television still does not work. Now they are refusing to replace or repair the television by giving me the corporate run-around.The picture (when it occasionally works) has spots on the screen which were determined to be an unfixable LED light engine problem. Samsung will not repair or replace this part (or the television itself).I have had this product for 3 months and it has worked for a grand total of five weeks.

It is less heavy than I expected. Very nice image with non-HD program. LED engine is expected to last much longer than regular light bulb. Highly recommended. Nothing to complain about. No PIP(Picture-In-Picture) feature. I didn't buy the extended warranty.If you want to buy HD TV, find out the watching distance in feet and multiply that with 5. That's the size of the screen you need. For example, my watch distance is 10 feet, 10 times 5 is 50. So I bought this 50 inch TV.

Setup was quite easy, and except for an incompatiblity with 480p resolution settings and DirecTV (which required 2 satellite technicians to figure out), getting it fully operational was not a problem.The sound (with the surround enhancement) is fine, but I would assume most people run this set through a nice sound system (towers, subs, etc).This TV performs well in a room (like ours) with lots of glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible customer service","review":"Fan went bad 2 days after got tv.

So I then took the front 20\\" off and it had the same cracking in the rubber..These tires are less then 2 years old and with less than 900 miles, and have been kept in a dark garage out of the sun.

These are great looking and durable bases. That being said, I coach a youth travel baseball and bought these bases and anchors to be put in ground at 65ft bases. When we went to 70ft distance, the anchors were already in ground. However, these bases DO NOT fit into any other anchors beside the ones that comes with them. For some reason MacGregor made these base poles at a slight larger thickness and anchors wider. So, these bases does not fit any other anchors in the market. Since the anchors are a little wider, any other bases will be a little loose. Keep that in mind when you purchase these."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Risk Worth Taking","review":"When I originally heard about this book, I was worried. I thought about how poorly they made Dungeon Master's Guide 2. However, this book turned out great! They added some great new classes and prestige classes. They really add to the game.One thing that's really nice is that it's not needed, but it just adds a couple new dimensions to the game.I will admit that I'm a sucker for more options and variant rules, so you should check this book out before you buy it. You might not think some of the additions are worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Fun","review":"Okay, so it may just be that someone, somewhere, wanted more money so they wrote a supplemental Handbook. But gosh darn it! This book is a lot of fun! There are great new classes and the possibility to expand the old player classes even more. I'm running a duskblade in one campaign, and my rogue is getting ready to go Super Rogue in another. It is SO much fun to have something a little different than was available in the regular Player's Handbook. Without the Handbook II, I wouldn't have any way to combine the fighter and magic user classes except to go through the painful dual class system. I hate that. So for me, this book is absolutely worth the money. I share it with my fellow players at D&D night, and we all use it for a reference at least once per game. I'd definitely recommend that at least one of these be present at your games, if not more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Players Handbook II : Must Have D&D 3.5 Book","review":"If you do not like the MMO feel of 4.0 D&D;, and play 3.5, this is a book you want in your collection. The Players handbook II presents three new classes that fill in a needed niche for 3.5 edition. The feats presented in this book add some amazing customization options that address the balance issues between melee types and casters. While some of the new character options for old classes are lackluster, they present some interesting opportunities for new character builds. There is also a section covering team skills that may find some use in your game; it is always good to have new uses for old powers, or a reason to take 1 rank in a skill. The least useful section of this book is the organization chapter. Depending on how much of your world(s) you create, you may find this section useful.Even with one bad chapter, no other book has pulled us back to playing D&D; 3.5 quite like the Players Handbook II."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate Class Abilities!!","review":"Highly recommend this book.

It does offer some new classes and some new spells and such, but over all the book to me was a dissapointment. The book goes into more variations of the original classes and spends some time on your character's background. Most of this information is available in the DMG and other books, this book simply puts them in one place. There is an NPC generator section that was somewhat useful, a good idea and section just not for me.Having been a gamer for over 20 years, I have read and owned my fair share of rules books, supplements and misc. books. This book in my opinion is not essential to any gamers collection nor does it truly provide much info that can not be gained from the core collection of books. The classes inside while nice, are not enough to warrant spending the money for the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring story","review":"I read the story of how you played Santa to the poor children.

If you want a cute hat, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swingin' Good Time","review":"Usually choral holiday recordings are standard, run-of-the-mill fare. This chorus really swings with great harmonies, excellent diction and rhythm, and a sense of humor.If you like swing music, buy this CD. Although there a few standard tunes, most of the selections are obscure and rarely heard. The band is top notch.Great holiday party music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awakening is easy","review":"Spiritual seekers are chronically crippled by the belief that there is a definite, though vaguely defined state that can be reached only by an elect few. Teachers needing followers are disinclined to tell them different. Douglass Harding speaks with a fresh voice and a unique method of questioning that assumption. He tells us that awakening is nothing special but our common human birthright.I'll leave it to the reader to judge for him or her self. I spent years laboring under the delusion that if I spent enough time and effort I would reach a state that could be called \\"enlightened.\\" Harding's simple experiments turn attention to the reality that who I think myself to be emerges from a state that is perfectly clear and perfectly imperturbable. That simple shift in perspective makes a difference. And he writes without a whiff of piety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like trudging through waist deep mud...","review":"For someone who supposedly arrived at the \\"understanding\\" Mr. Harding writes about it in seriously inarticulate and hard to follow way. Why it received such good reviews from others is a mystery. Whenever I come across something whether a movie or a book that's as bad as this one my first response is to throw it away or give it to someone I don't like. However; because I spent nearly $15 I instead (against my better judgement) donated it to a library. Don't waste your time or money on this author. For a clear, concise, razor sharp presentation on nonduality get the Jean Dunn edited trilogy on Nisargadatta Maharaj."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big sister","review":"I've always loved this picture!

It took clear pictures and was very easy to use. Although it was small in size it got the job done. Then, after less than a month of using it, it simply stopped working. It wouldn't turn on, the LCD screen wouldn't show anything, and when it rarely did turn on, weird sounds came from it. I took good care of it, didn't drop it or anything of the like. After repeatedly calling Mustek customer service and finally getting help from them, all they said was that it had a malfunction and to ship it in, but we never got a new camera. It was horrible service, and a cheap camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"my first digital camera","review":"I recently purchased the mustek dv4000 and I hate it, the pictures are awful! I used the highest quality setting and got very poor results, the only thing I do like about the camera which is why it even got one star was the fact that the digital recording I took came out OK, but digital still pics are awful and I'd advise folks to look elsewhere and not spend their money on this one. I'm sending mine back! I'm new to digital photography but I know on the highest quality setting, the photo quality shouldn't be grainy. High quality settings yielded low quality pics on mine....Anyone out there have a better experience? Could I be doing something wrong?"},{"rating":"1","title":"very cheaply made","review":"The set came packaged very nicely, but upon opening the package I saw that the refrigerator door was unhinged and cracked.

I was happy with the other Melissa & Doug products we had received for the dollhouse, so I figured this kitchen would do the trick. Boy was I wrong. To begin with, when I opened the box I expected to see cute black and white/ivory checkered style pieces. Instead they are GREEN and YELLOW. Not only is this just about the ugliest kitchen I have ever seen, but the refrigerator was broken into 4 pieces when I took the items out of the box. I thought it might require some sort of assembly, but after looking at it closely I realized it was simply a piece of junk that had cracked and come apart.Needless to say I am on hold with Amazon, waiting for them to process this return. My advice to you? Save your time and splurge for a more expensive kitchen set. I guess it's true what they say, you get what you pay for. Melissa and Doug definitely missed the boat on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Made","review":"I purchased this kitchen for my daughter's dollhouse. When it arrived, the kitchen table had come apart at almost every joint. I won't say it was \\"broken,\\" since the pieces weren't physically broken.

Cooking times are different with non-stick bakeware, so there's a learning curve, but cleanup is a breeze.

Kahimi Karie manages to set to progress back by 50 years with her I'm-just-a-cute-wimpy-Japanese-doll schtick. She may say it's just an ironic, pose, but it's a pose she's using to lure in people fascinated by the stereotype of the submissive Asian female.Despite the terrible message this anti-femenist music is sending, I might have enjoyed the music.

Islam is the fastest growing religion and there are certain fundamentalist movements in different countries as authors explain. However, after careful analysis I came to conclusion that the situation is blown out of proportion. There is not such things or idea as Islamic Threat. Islam believes in peace and tranquility of all. Unlike Pax Romana, Pax Islamica clearly dictates the tolerance for coexistence for different religion.

Seldom if ever have sounds been associated as precisely with visuals of which they are not 'effects', whether natural or musical.

I can honestly say this is the worst music I have ever listened to in my entire life. My 3 year old brother could make better music than this. The expression of stupidity and lack of maturity was amazingly shocking. As another customer said, my life was also changed in uncompromisable ways. Another reviewer said he added the day he heard Flossie to his \\"most important days\\" list. I, however, added Flossie and the freaking Unicorns to my hate list.Insane, purely insane.

You will soon hear that Flossie and the Unicorns was 1. written while intoxicated, 2. obviously meant to be a joke, or else someone needs to banned from playing instruments, and 3. causes suicidal thoughts in the sanest person's mind. If you are 2 years old or under, a person in the mental hospital, or someone who smokes excessive amounts of drugs, than this cd is perfect for you.

But not as much as \\"Amor Fou\\" (\\"Crazy Love\\" in English, and yes, they say both phrases in the chorus to remind you what it means.) Scuzzy beyond belief. That has the same merit as a childrens' music artist singing \\"Frere Jacques\\" and some obnoxious teacher interrupting to give the English translation.

The war receives mention in chapters entitled \\"The Nazis\\" or \\"Resistance or Collaboration,\\" but the contributions by the various authors lack overarching coherence because there is no overarching plot to be found of this event in this rendition of the age of conflict.

These tents have a QC problem and can't be set up as is. 1/2 the rings for the tie downs are missing and not sewn on.I have them with a seamstress now to repair them. Typical poor Chinese QC and thats why the Sportsman Guide bragged about the good deal they got and were passing on to the public. Do yourself a favor and buy a Gametracker Carbon Cabin. A true Pop Up blind and more expensive, so what. Try fighting with one of these blinds (teepee) after dark trying to fold spring steel and get it in it's pack in the dark, good luck.It's unavailable now because they were garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Woman who falls in love...","review":"I love to read about two things: strong yet vunerable heroines and Native Americans. This books had both. I not only read a tender love story, but also learned more about the Apache that I did not know before. The heroine is half Apache and Sioux, while the hero is half Commache. It was an exciting and quick read. I just hope that Lindsay McKenna writes more novels with Native American characters. She writes about them well. P.S. I especially liked the main character Akiva. She really made the book. She grew the most in the book and even inspired me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Celestron Microscope","review":"I read the reviews from the others before purchasing this, and they were all accurate. This microscope is exceptional for the price! It has good weight to it...won't topple over easily as so many previous \\"beginner\\" microscopes have. It's easy to use, and what I like best is the plug-in light source. My kids said nothing but 'WOW\\" for a good 30 minutes straight, as I kept feeding different objects under the lens. You'll be amazed at how much you can see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item, my six yr old loves it.","review":"Good quality and easy to use. Included slides fascinated us. Will last forever.

My kids really enjoy it and can use it themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unable to see anything clearly...obviously defective","review":"After spending a lot of time reading all the reviews, we selected the 500x Celestron. Shipment was quick by Amazon. We were so excited to view our \\"puppy seeds\\" (sperm from stud dog).. but, alas, the quality of the lens or something in the microscope prevented any clear picture. To cross check, we set up a borrowed microscope of similar power and could see the little guys very clearly. We packaged up the scope and are sending it back. Looks like you get what you pay for....Poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Previously owned? Bah!","review":"My sample came without a manual, and the packaging looked suspiciously like it was re-packaged after a return; not happy about this at all... :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Hazard","review":"Well I was hoping the review about Fire Hazard was wrong when I ordered this as I read all the reviews that were on at that time. However my experience was that the slides arrived damaged and the electric illuminator had the burning smell and was defintely overheating. This is the only item that I've ever actually returned to Amazon in the history of all items I've ever ordered from Amazon. Without the damaged slides and the overheating problem I think it would be a wonderful item however. Damaged Slides are easy to replace however the overheating issue is a very serious issue as it could catch on fire and cause your house to burn down or wherever you are using it. I hope to one day be able to afford one of the $500 - or above Microscopes as I'm still very interested in a microscope. But in the meantime I will choose to live without as this microscopes overheating problem is too dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!! READ THIS FIRST!!!","review":"This Model was illuminated with a Tungstun Bulb prior to 2009 - it gets HOT! It is DANGEROUS! Celestron replaced that with a cooler LED illuminator (way to go!) HOWEVER.... AMAZON IS SELLING THE OLD DANGEROUS MODEL! That's why the price is low. I called them and was told they could NOT guarantee the LED Model was what they had in the warehouse. For this item, shop elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A reasonable microscope for a reasonable price","review":"Was easy to set up and produced clear images. The adjustment controls felt very solid and worked reliably. The one we got must have used the LED light because my wife left it on for a few hours and it didn't get very hot.The scope met its description and works as expected. I'll probably be looking for another eyepiece to increase maximum magnification, but the unit as sold provides a good range of viewing.Make sure you buy some slides and covers as well; the unit comes with a couple of prepared slides, but nothing to allow you to make your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Microscope!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this microscope to replace my old plastic one and it's awesome!! It never breaks and when you buy the 100x objective lens, it's power is 1,250x!! That is really good for viewing bacteria and really small protazoan. The illuminator is great and the movable stage is good for looking at moving things. The prepared slides are really cool and are in great quality. BUY THIS MICROSCOPE!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice microscope","review":"I needed a microscope to view some very small bugs -- literally -- mite sized. This scope is a little overkill for doing this, but its features, ease of use, and price proved it to be an excellent choice. The highest power occular is not necessary for me, but nearly everything else about the scope is appreciated. The frame is heavy metal, the coarse and fine focus are very nice, the 2-axis adjustable table is indispensible, the independent light source is excellent, and so on. If I may nit-pick I would ask for an additional low power eyepiece or occular for the purpose of finding and centering very small subjects. But overall, I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value Choice","review":"For the price, this is a splendid microscope. My grandson loves it, and called it his favorite birthday present.

All this tape served to do was to put me to sleep. It is big on spiritualism, inner-self, self-realization and esteem - all noble goals. This is all fine and dandy if it was listed in the \\"New Age\\" section and advertised as such but it is supposedly a tape on PUBLIC SPEAKING!!! To be perfectly honest, I tried my best to make it through the whole tape but I found it a truly agonizing experience and could not stay awake for more than 10 minutes at a clip. Mr. Glicksten is well-intentioned but the combination of his monotonous voice, psycho-babble, aimless ramblings and frequent tangents makes this tape a true waste of time and money in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT for women with larger boobs!","review":"I just received my Marmot Montreaux coat and was super excited as I have never owned a Marmot before, but have heard fabulous things.

The coat is super soft, warm and wonderful, but unfortunately, despite ordering up a size is very snug in the chest. I don't think I could even fit a light weight sweater underneath.

I bought it because in addition to warping still images, it will create videos with varying degrees of multiple warps. This feature allows a series of key frames with the (multiple) warps set as desired, and also adjusting the duration between successive key frames (number of frames).I was happy to learn that it uses a standard video format, *.avi. This is better than the Kai Power Goo prgram which uses a proprietary format, so the KPG videos can only be played back within the program, rather than being available for mixing with other videos.I held back one star because of the non-standard interface - it works, just takes some getting used to and referencing the Help file."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Helpful Guide to Men's Health","review":"I got the book to restore peace to my health club workouts.

It is fun to listen to Sarah McLachlan sing \\"Rainbow Connection\\" even my husband thinks that song is good. \\"Sing\\" brings back so many memories from childhood. Those two songs alone are why I bought the album, but you also have Cake, Barenaked Ladies, John Ondrasik of Five For Fighting, singing fun songs too. My only complaint is that the music genres are very diverse, and while I like the more alternative sounds, I am not to into the blue grass feel of Wonderwheel, or the slower songs on the CD. We got it to dance to, so we just skip over the slow songs and listen to our favorites over and over again. There is a song for everyone on this CD. Your children will hear the music and jump up and dance, or boogie in their seats in the car. I don't know how you will be able to resist either. You will soon remember what it was like when you were a child and find you can act just as silly now, maybe more so."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD","review":"purchased as gift for three seperate grandchildren.

This one was really bad. It had two good songs on it; the rest she always asks me to skip over.

Ivy's version of \\"sing\\" is if anything worse than the saccharin original.Barenaked Ladies LA LA LA Lemon was alright; Five for Fighting's \\"Hoppity Song\\" was really good. That's it. I love Tom Waits; he doesn't belong on a kiddie disk.

If you want to purchase it to make your own compilation for your kids they will love a few of them. Others are WAY to slow and boring for kids to get excited about. There are a couple of them that make no sense at all on a chilren's CD. It seems like they couldn't decide whether to make a CD to put kids to sleep or to pep them up so they did both on one CD. That doesn't work for my kids. John Lithgow \\"Singin in the Bathtub\\" is a MUCH better choice. The songs are upbeat and lively.

Brett Anderson's voice sounds pretty good. I just wish they had better songs to show it off. They had mixed success on Coming Up and Head Music but this just falls flat IMO.If you are planning to sample Suede for the first time after reading or hearing about them I would recommend the Bernard Butler era albums \\"Suede\\" and \\"Dog Man Star\\".

I liked this initially because it was one unit with one (electrical) plug. Setting it up was a bit frustrating and I did have some issues with that. It wasn't compatible with my Nintendo DS wifi, which was also frustrating. It worked alright for about 4 months, and then it started to die. Near the end I was power cycling it 4 or 5 times a day to get it to work. I don't think it is a very quality product, especially since it burned out so quickly.

She makes you feel as if you were there and knew all the principal characters who were living their regular lives when the weather changed everything. Her personal connection to the story is evident throughout her honest, unflinching look at that day in 1966. After reading the book, I have a new respect for and understanding of tornadoes and their effect on their victims. I look forward to reading it a second time to soak it all in again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A World Turned Over","review":"Reading it brought back memories of that day and of the world as it was in the '60's. The writer's style of communicating the facts and stories made for an interesting account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robert","review":"I agree with the reviewer who thinks this book is overdone. If Hemingway wanted to show off her writing ability then why didn't she just write The Great American Novel instead? I found myself skimming through all her flowery prose to get just the facts of the story. I'm not saying I don't enjoy literature. I do. But I don't expect or want to find a book full of lyrical prose when I pick up what is essentially a historical account of a tornado that hit a strip mall. It's like sending coal miners to work wearing Gucci suits if you ask me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, this book is an injustice to the disaster.","review":"Part of the book is about the tornado mixed with a lot of prose and other garbage combined with her childhood memories. It reads like a flowery poem. The second part of the book documents her interviews with the people who survived the tornado, several of which who did not seem that happy or got upset when she was prying into their pasts. Even though she moved a few months before the tornado happened, many had no idea who the heck she even was. One of the men she interviewed, Larry Swales, happens to be in an episode of Storm Stories and is nothing like how she describes him in the book. She draws on old memories and reports things in the way she remembers them or wants to remember them and not the way they probably actually were. In books on weather events one should try as much as possible to keep their bias out of the actual event. This book is all show and no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"More childhood memoir than disaster book","review":"This book seems out of place in the \\"disaster book\\" genre. The author seems more concerned with reliving her childhood. Not a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Triathlon 101","review":"This book is particularly good on the hidden details of novice's triathlon (like equipment, costs and jargon) as well as on what one needs to do to \\"get up to speed\\" for performing each particular sport. I think it's a good book for folks that are new to the sport and have a \\"finish\\" mentality, as well as someone relatively new that wants to improve up to a decent Olympic distance tri (basically, one-fourth an ironman). It's also good at dispelling the psychological stumbling blocks, if you're somewhat daunted by what can be the intense competitive spirit of some athletes - a very healthy attitude! One drawback is that it was a little light on the art of open-water swimming, which can be pretty important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tri Prep","review":"I found this book to be very informative.

However it is a nice book that makes you enthusiastic about the sport, but there is no content that will make me a better thriatlete.

I'm training for my first triathlon so consider myself a newbie -- but this book did ~not~ gve me the info I need. Advice like \\"wear a helmet\\", \\"drink lots of fluids\\"... duh!!! - my 8 year old son knows that. The author recommends to get help elsewhere on swimming and cycling techniques because the details are beyond the scope of the book. I don't need a book for this kind of advice! I read another older book (can't remember the name at the moment) which gave good solid advice -- even for a newbie like myself. The mechanics of the freestyle stroke ~can~ be explained in simple terms by someone who understands and knows how to write. In short: too much filler, not enough meat.

I found that this book is extremely encouraging for the person who is considering giving it a 'tri'. The author gives information that is basic, but doesn't \\"talk down\\" to the reader, even though he is an experienced triathlete.

Their live performances were characteristic of the band, particularly in the eighties. This DVD attempts to capture early nineties performances but it is unsuccessful. Scorpions used to have a lot of interaction with the audience, had awesome encores and were energetic. Neither of these characteristics is shown in the DVD. They seemed bored. In addition, the edition breaks between song and song making the video a show of isolated boring songs. The bottom line: the concert section smells too bad.The videos section is OK, it would have been nice if they had included more classics. That's why I give them two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The manufacturer's could have corrected past mistakes","review":"When the live portion of this DVD was FIRST released on VHS I was disappointed with it, due to the horrible mix. Jabs' guitar is so low it's barely audible (and he's the main soloist, for those who don't know tha band) and Meine's vocals could also do to be higher.I was hoping this DVD would have corrected this shortcoming, since it spoils my enjoyment considerably. Indeed, it's made it difficult to play more than once or twice. However, this DVD seems a straight copy of the VHS. Maybe the original master no longer exists: if it did they could have made this into the full gig, maybe, or redressed the mix.In a word, frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCORPS STILL STING!!","review":"I have to say that this is an impressive DVD. You get the entire Crazy World Tour video, the First Sting video, plus bits and pieces of 'To Russia With Love'.I do wish they would have just combined both videos back to back like Def Leppard did with their DVDs, but it's still awesome. The only annoying thing is in between the live songs, the screen fades and the other songs start. I don't know if the original Crazy World video had this or not, but it's annoying.Of course this DVD has Wind Of Change on it. I finally saw it after seeing it once like 11 years ago on MTV when I was younger. I'm only 22. It did not disappoint me.Overall the only disappointment I have is that the scorps cut out a lot of footage that made 'To Russia with Love' great. If only they would combine all their vhs videos. First Sting, World Wide Live, To Russia With Love, & Crazy World. That would be a bonus!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well, maybe not that bad.","review":"If you like Scorpions, get it, if not that's up to you. The VIDEOS are great old and new (then).

The characters themselves are often riddled with faults but more believable because of them. Chadwick takes real events and ties them into the story seamlessly.

However, my five year old tipped her bike on the ground one time (she is no daredevil, believe me) and the bell stopped working. One of the plastic gears inside cracked right off and is now floating inside. She can still make a faint ring from time to time until the broken gear pieces jam the other two gears.

It's easy for him to use (you can grasp the large cover and turn it either way) and the bell is a pleasant sound. It's more of a fun bell than a safety bell (i.e. loud and grating). Definitely a hit for a young one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not very functional","review":"So maybe I should have known this bell is for kids' bikes, but it doesn't say that anywhere in the description. I love the orange and got it to go on my bright orange and red bicycle. Unfortunately it didn't fit so I had to tie it onto my handlebars. Also, it rattles and jingles so much I rarely get to use it because people can hear me coming a block away.

Moreover, they help to identify the various issues and concepts for further study.

Also, students will find the taxonmic charts helpful in organizing their studies, especially if they are visual learners as they paint \\"mental maps\\" of the subject catagories.The definition section was and nice bonus.

I am on daily dosages of steroids an benedryl but still having issues with my face and neck being very sensative, red, and patchy. I am so not happy with this product!

I do use this around my eyes (I cannot rationalize spending additional money on the eye cream) and have no problem with eye irritation.I do not find the smell offensive in anyway.A tiny, tiny amount goes a long way as this cream is very concentrated!I use it twice per day. Once rubbed into your skin until all traces of the cream have disappeared you will notice a slight warming effect, which is not unpleasant at all.I for one, am a true believer in this cream and will continue to purchase it.

Wrong. I have been using this product for several years and was sadly disappointed with what I received.

Strivectin contains an analgesic to give a slight tingle on the skin. This also gives it a distinct smell. The product I received runs out of the tube when inverted. Normally Strivectin must be squeezed from the tube.

Just put a little on your face before bed, especially around your eyes, cheeks, forehead, lips and you will be surprised how much it erases crows feet, wrinkes, dry patches by morning. Your lips will feel smooth and soft all the time too. You'll expect to break out more, but I have been breaking out much less with almost no acne. The vasoline is all absorbed by morning, after a couple weeks it almost looks like you had a mini face lift. The effect only seems to last about a day so you need to do it every night. I don't goop it on like a prize fighter, but it looks a little shiny when I am done. And a whole jar costs $1.00. You don't even need the name brand stuff. I wouldn't do it during the day, you'll look greasy. Just each night before you go to bed. It is amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"After 6 weeks on one side of my face ...","review":"I'm 46 and have pretty good skin. I was very excited about Strivectin and started using it religiously. I could have sworn that it was making my skin look better. It was one of the first cosmetic product I ever bought. After several months I became cynical about the entire industry after seeing marketing claims for various products that were obviously bogus. So I decided to really test Strivectin by only putting in on one side of my face. The skin regenerates every 28 days, but I kept doing it for 6 weeks.No results whatsoever! I asked several friends which side of my face looked better and most of my friends would say there was no difference. A few chose a side, but they were evenly divided between both sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with product!!","review":"I purchased StriVectin-SD Intensive Concentrate for Stretch Marks in January. I decided to give the product a chance, being that I have heard rave reviews about it. After the first week of using StriVectin, my strech marks were smoother and so was the surrounding skin. I continued to follow instructions carefully, I even exfoliated three times a week, thinking this would also help the process. By the end of the month I noticed no change at all! I just had smooth strech marks, wtf? I decided after the sixth week if nothing happed, I would return the product. Just as I thought, after six weeks of using this product, I was disappointed to see that nothing changed.

I got enough so that I could really give it a chance. I have used it religiously every day without fail for over six months and NO results. Even the teeniest tiniest lines have not altered in any way. I have read many reviews that were negative from people who only used it for a few weeks to a month.

It cost $135 less 20%. I think it is worth every penny. I have used it twice a day and there is a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin - smoother and fine lines are diminished. It is not a replacement for Botox, which works much better on diminishing frown lines and crow's feet. I do both.This is a good moisturizer but it really does much more than any moisturizer I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect","review":"Works great as a moisturizer, but does cause whiteheads unless your skin is dry. I believe the scent is added intentionally to act as an eye irritant, so they can sell you the scent \\"free\\" eye cream at a cost 10 times that of the face cream. I did purchase both having used them for 3 months on my face and hands. Disappointed that wrinkles have diminished only slightly. Probably not worth the exorbitant cost. Will not repurchase unless more pronounced improvement before the end of the tube.

Though its not 'easy' to read as the reader has to clear his way through the endless academic jargon. But this book has won at least the hearts of the east-bengalees, the translation into bengali is a testimony to this fact. Yes this book finally talks about some of truth behind the oft-referred 'Banga Bhanga'. This work de-mythified the mystery about that division and the clique that worked behind it - whether for or against it. The 'armchair communal Bhadralok' had a leading role in this historical movement and the fact that these people were definitely communal is an immense truth that comes out of this book. A testimony to this fact is actually added as the lone appendix to the book - the speech by Sharat Chandra Chaterjee. A modern Bengali must find amusement and for sure amazement at the sheer communal calls by this respected and hugely successful early-twentieth century writer. Thank you Ms Chaterji."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak book","review":"Joya Chatterji has woven a story that is neither convincing nor well written.

The first two books of this trilogy fitted into that description but this third book, Engine City, missed the mark. I found myself skipping through pages which is something I usually never do.

The most common pattern is a good start, a good to weak middle, and a weak ending.

By the second book he's slipped into the middle tier of writers, the third book sometimes reads like a satire of the first two. He seems desperate to find a way out of the story and finally just gives up.Macleod shows signs of promise. He needs an editor, more discipline, and more practice.

I was captivated by the author's first offering in hiragana and I have to say that this sequel is just as compelling and effective. The graphics are big and easy to remember and there are some useful facts in there to allow us to understand just a bit more about Japan. What I find even more useful is a summary of Japanese words towards the end of the book, which we could use to give us small tests to gauge our own improvements. Rest assured, answers are provided in the beginning of the book. Anyhow, the old saying about never judge a book by its cover is very true.

At best, this book would be usefull for last minute review, but not for a study guide. One more thing, although no study reads like a novel, some effort should be made to limit all the 6 to 8 word sentences!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary","review":"This book was very elementary... writing style and content.... I was so bored after just 3 chapters that I had to putthe book down and scream! Not that technical study material is supposed to be exciting, but when you read whole paragraphs made of sentences consisting of 4-8 words total per sentence, you start to remember the gray lined paper that you used to practice your cursive writing samples. I won't even rate this material's expertise level, because I couldn't get by the fact that it was written for the simple minded. Read the EXAM CRAM if you need to study for the exam. At least then you're expecting short and sweet, but full of great, big juicy content. Reading this book was like biting into a cheesy poof. It looks great, but there's nothing really there. ... Anybody want to buy mine?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This has to be one of the worst books that I have read that is supposed to prepare you for the test. Granted, if you are persuing any of the tests listed in this book, you should have in-depth hands on. However, one would think that any book that claims to give you a healthy view of the test would cover the test material. This book, in my opinion, greatly missed the mark on the important topics. Save your money and by a book that will prepare you for the real test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an overview","review":"This book basically gives you an overview of what IIS, Proxy and IEAK do. Do not expect to learn too much from this book since it's basically a study guide. It is just a series of quick explanations and exercises trying to explain/describe what several pieces of software do.If you need to pass the exam, experience, the online docs and technet is what will count here, as there are many issues addressed in the test that are not even touched by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good overview, lots of errors.","review":"The book is a easy read but that is also it's downfall. There are many errors that would cause missed questions on the exam. Some errors are simple mistakes such as giving info on IIS 3.0 not IIS 4.0. Other errors are very misleading and will cause problems for exam takers that do not own other information sources. It does not cover simulation testing and index server enough, but does contain some good reference material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture looks more apealing than the product.","review":"OK watch, but the picture makes the watch look great.

In a word; PATHETIC","review":"In all fairness to the producers, cast and crew of due South, this isn't their fault. This seems to have been a corporate scramble to cash in on dS, and I sympathize with everyone who worked so hard to make the show as marvelous, witty, cunning and intelligent as it is... as this book is not. There are a very pitifully few bright spots, like the recipe, and the photos. As noted by previous reviewers, the book has as little to do with due South as the movie Last of the Mohicans had to do with the book... without being even remotely as good. (I'm reminded of the \\"Slug\\" commercial on TV at the moment, where the suits are telling the ceo all about the products and tie ins, and tell him they can have a script for the movie by Friday.) Wait for it to come to your local library. If it never comes, you haven't missed anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"little more than an expensive fan magazine","review":"I was disappointed in the book because I thought it would be objective, historical information about the cast, crew and production. I've read teeny bopper \\"Teen Beat\\" fan magazines w/ more credibility than this book. The pictures are nice but many of the captions have wrong information (such as what's going on in the episode at the time of the scene). As a prior reviewer states, most of the \\"essays\\" allegedly written by characters are actually \\"out of character\\", either using language or referring to events not used by those characters in the show. There is almost no historical information--such as a listing of episode titles and dates shown or information about the actors,writers, directors and/or producers who were the driving force behind this great show. All in all, it's useful only for the pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bubble gum teenie bopper style","review":"The book didn't even mention the shows creator, Paul Haggis, his sister producer and writer Kathy Slevin or producer Jeff King. That's just incredible in my mind! It's got lots of great photos but aside from that, not much else. Also, most of the websites listed at the back have long since expired, of course that's expected with print material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Terrific!","review":"I loved this book. It gives a very descriptive view of due South and helps to understand some of the \\"inside jokes\\" that you wouldn't otherwise know about. It was very informative, and also is very entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"GUIDE TO WHAT??!! Useless Information!","review":"What a disappointment! A great show deserves an REAL guide, with synopsis of the episodes, interviews with the actors and cast, and some in-depth, fun history about Canada, the Inuit, the Mounties, etc. This slim booklet is badly written and little more than a tabloid-quality piece of junk.

Already threw this one away,"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wizard192","review":"I found that the decanter will hold a seal. You do have to seat the stopper well into the decanter to get a good seal and it takes some effort to \\"walk\\" it out. I can live with all of this. The problem is with the pump handle that you extract the air with. With light use the seal in the handle failed. I believe that the pump handle materials are inferior to stand up to the effort required to extract the air. Metrokane asks for $10.00 to cover shipping and handling for a replacement. With the current quality of construction you would probably need several pump handles or more to get value out of your investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Forget this product.

Pour could be better.","review":"I bought this decanter mainly because it was lead-free crystal. I am uncomfortable storing wine in lead crystal because the lead can leach into the wine. The vacuum was a bonus, though after a few hours the vacuum is lost. It drips a little on the pour, resulting in a wine ring gathering on any surface it sits on. I'm guessing there are better lead-free crystal decanters out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest thing since sliced bread","review":"This is a SUPER product...my only criticism would be a lack of instruction on how to use it...after you insert and push the 'cork' down, you must PULL UP on the little 'knob'...then you have to pump it 30-35 times to bring the needle into the red zone...the wine will keep at least 5 days (i haven't tried it longer)...then PUSH DOWN on the 'knob' to release the pressure when you want to use the wine...using a thumb on each side of the 'cork' push it up up remove it...NO RE-PUMPING IS NECESSARY...the price is reasonable...if you save a couple of bottles of wine, it pays for itself..i am going to get more for gifts...GREAT PRODUCT....LOVE IT"},{"rating":"1","title":"lack of instructions","review":"I found it very awkward trying to stabilize the pump with one hand, and pull the pump up and down to get the air out.Also I can not get the top out of the decanter.

There's not much more to say about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A neat conclusion","review":"My expectations for this book were rather low, based on the other reviews and my feeling that the writing quality slipped at the end of book two. However, I was pleasantly surprised by this book. This volume was somewhat less epic than the previous two and basically split between two plotlines, one on Irth and one on Earth. However, this neatly tied up all the hanging character threads from the previous books and brought the story to a solid and unambiguous conclusion. The author didn't really have any new conceptual themes to introduce in this book and it read a little lighter for that. I still feel the whole series just reiterates themes from his other book The Last Legends of Earth (not written under the Adam Lee psuedonym). If you have read the other books in this trilogy, the ending is worth it. However, this is clearly a \\"wrap-up\\" book and cannot stand on its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing 'Octoberland' lacks compelling story","review":"'Octoberland' never lives up to the brilliant fantasy of the first two volumes of the Irth trilogy.Author Lee uses a modified version of the awkward chapter structure he used in 'The Wolf and the Crown'. Lee almost completely abandons the world of Irth, focusing his story on The Dark Shore or Irthlings who immerse themselves in Dark Shore culture.Where are the Spiderlands? Or the aelves? Those stories both had the potential for great fantasy. What was most lacking though was the presence of Lord Drev, a central character in book 1 of the trilogy. One can argue that his story has already been told, but his was a fascinating character that I, for one, would have liked to read more about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy","review":"Very easy to assemble and perfect to store a weeks worth of newspapers.

This should be a reference for any programmer who needs to write high performance software, but doesn't want to spend months writing assembly. The book uses examples from Intel's latest compilers (kids: don't try this on your Microsoft compiler) and helps to explain some of those obscure (but extremely important) compiler features like the \\"restrict\\" keyword.I found this book to be useful in explaining why my software wouldn't vectorize. The book describes the use of several compiler options that help you debug vectorization problems in your software. And fortuantely, Intel allows you to download and use their C++ and Fortran compiler for free (for non-commercial use) - see Intel's software website.

It will not play most DVD's, and those that it will play freeze up on playback. The device gets confused as to whether it is on or off, and will not eject disks unless you first unplug and plug back in.

This disc focus is on the early years of Hawkins big band. His band rocked as hard as anyone's, with musicians like Julian Dash on Tenor and Avery Parrish on piano leading the way. Though the band never acheived the stardom of the Goodman or Miller bands, these songs will show why the Erskine Hawkins band deserves a place as one of the best swing bands.

Mine does have the solid wheels and yes, pins. If you don't run it into things the pins will last for a very long time and all carts will have the battery issue.

To begin with the atomic clock is not accurate.

The temperature display is finiky too sometimes loosing the signal of the remote and providing no signal even though its less than 10 feet and 2 walls from the temperature transmitter.

I was immediately drawn to the title because it provided exactly the message that I was trying to teach. As I read, the story starts off endearing and touching. Love is a Family unfortunately only includes heterosexual families. I only wish that this story went just a bit further to include all kids of families, where love is what binds you together. The absence of homosexual families was extremely disappointing to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary dharma","review":"I use Chop Wood, Carry Water as a meditation text in the dharma lectures that are a part of a weekly yoga class.

There's no jumping around, but I'm sweating nicely when I'm done. I wish I knew of more workouts like this one. I also purchased More Rejuvenetics, which is a toning workout that I enjoy also.I just purchased Beachbody's Yoga Booty Ballet Goddess Set, which I'm hoping is going to be similar to this video.There's a lot of great, older workouts out there which unfortunately are overlooked.

Some simple items, like combining vitamin C and E to improve antioxidant effects, can be followed by anyone. And if you do want to smoke and be 30 pounds overweight, you will certainly learn the many items of damage you are causing.At first, the little puns and cute asides were fun, but then they begin to become an epidemic, and interfere with the flow of information. Same goes for the too-cute drawings, which often cleverly mislabel body parts but don't help understanding. Finally, an editor should have actually looked at some of the pictures, which are wrong (don't match text). A second edition that provides the same information in the same clear and understandable manner without overdoing the distracting cuteness, could earn 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"You: The Owner's Manual","review":"Good practical information.

This easy to read and understand book really does increase your understanding of your own body. It's packed with excellent advice that really can help you live healthier (and most likely longer too). The RealAge idea of separating your biological age from your chronological age is very interesting, a useful paradigm. Chapters align with major functions such as heart/arteries, brain/nervous system, bones/joints/muscles, lungs, digestive system, immune system, hormones, reproductive system, and so on... There is also a small section on diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elementary at Best","review":"I first heard of this book from watching a segment of Oprah. I must say that she and the author(s) presented the material so well on the show that I was quite eager to learn more from buying the book. Sad to say that I was very disappointed when I finally received it. The Oprah show covered just about everything worth knowing, that you really don't need to buy the book. This book is even less informative than my grade school health books and what's even more insulting is that it's written in huge print/font with large line-spacing. I suppose they wanted to make the book appear more substantial than it really is by making it 432 pages long. Reminds me of high school days when we had to meet our minimum page requirements for papers and reports. My recommendation is skip this book and buy a high school anatomy textbook instead if you're interested in learning how the human body works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Would've Thought?","review":"I recently turned 41 and discovered that I wasn't 21 anymore! I needed help, QUICK, and this book gave it to me. It is divided into organ systems and delves into cancer at the end in a way that helped me understand what was going on inside me. I changed just a very few things and started feeling and looking better! That is the great thing about this book; these aren't your doctor visit scolding doctors, these are a couple of funny cool guys who happen to be doctors, who want you to help YOU. They don't want your money (well, except for the book), they don't want you to give up every delicious food you love, they don't want you to start running 5 miles everyday; they just want you to make some changes and see how you feel. They want you to be healthy and smart until the day you die; so much more fun than tied upright in a wheelchair in some old-folks warehouse, wearing a diaper and a confused look on your face.

Eg. On page 167/168, the authors suggest having plants in your room as they produce oxygen. But the reality is that plants use cellular respiration at night and therefore, act like animals in terms of gas exchange -- ie. produce carbon dioxided at night.This book is _okay_ at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of useful, easy to understand information","review":"I saw this book on the Oprah show and it is worth every penny!

I don't like to be told to lower my cholesterol - I want to be told why I need to lower my cholesterol.

Before I read this, my idea of exercising was based on YouTube videos and web site articles. But I never felt like I knew what I was doing with my body. Though I would lose weight, I'd always have some kind of side effect based on a supplement I took or the type of food I ate.But once I read this book, I started realizing that some of the things I did and/or ate, were contributing to my body being unhealthy regardless of my exercise (even looking healthy didn't mean I was).All in all, I bought this book for my parents because it was so informative on the body and there aren't very many books that cover the WHOLE body, but this one does.Would I recommend this book? I already have, even buying it for my parents.My Con: It's such a big book, I felt exhausted after reading it. So much information, my brain felt like a fried egg."},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU don't need this book","review":"Full of useless information that has been around for a long time. We've heard all of this before: drink lots of water, eat fish three times a week, brush and floss your teeth, don't put a q-tip in your ear, blah, blah blah. The book seems to be written for the elementry grade level with its cartoon-like illustrations of little elves living in your bones and the cancer cells with their angry faces. If there are a few pearls of wisdom in here anywhere, it would be hard to find them because the \\"humorous\\" writing style is simply obnoxious. The constant failed attempts at humor make the reading almost unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"The information in this book, as vital as it is, is obstructed by juvenile illustrations and language.

And if men think of it more, then why do so many of my female friends complain about their fat hubbies being more interested in TV than the bedroom? I'm really tired of this stereotype. Someone needs to do a new poll, and stop using the one they did decades ago. Someone needs to start addressing the very real sexual needs of healthy, active women, whether they are 22 or 40."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"This book is ok but far away to reveal the truth about the Diet and the bad impac on the body.

While this book may purport to reverse the effects of time (make us healthier) it can't actually reverse time, can it? I think no matter how often you read the book or follow its advice, I'm pretty sure you will still get one year older each year...does this guy think he's the Wizard of Oz?In any event this book confirms once again, the key to success is the blessing of Oprah Winfrey.

I found the book to be an interesting read for such technical information. Most books of this nature would be stuffy and used primarily as a reference, but I found myself reading entire chapters and skipping around while learning a whole lot! The pictures have incorrect labelling on them to make them more lighthearted, so I would not use this to learn anatomy.

The dollhouse as well as been busted up pretty easily too. The biggest problem with the furniture is that the little legs have broken off. If you can find them, that's the first feat! I would find the broken legs and then I tried gluing them back on the main pieces, but they never really held. (Maybe I didn't have the right type of wood glue, perhaps). Also, the bed foam/mattress has been pulled off and that too never quite went back on properly.

I don't know if the glue was old or what, but I bought her 5 sets, over $100 worth of beautiful garbage... In order for her to keep it, her mom would have had to glue every single piece back together. The intricate pieces made this virtually impossible. So in the trash it ended up.

It's very difficult to see the screen on your camera to aim for the pic because the pak it like a bubble w/ light reflecting off it. To take under water pic's you really need a waterproof camera.

The unit came with a strong green push using the component but seemed to rectify itself within the day(dvd). For user settings im using -4 red, -1 green, +1 blue.

Just like others have said here, they say parts will be shipped (in my case on the 3rd) then a week or two later you'll find out that parts haven't shipped, or on back order. BIG HINT: If the manufacture of a product has major components on back order, your's is not the only one broke.I've bought 4, but Olevia has got the last dollar from me and if you're smart they wouldn't get your first one. I think some retailers like Office Depot and HSN have dropped the line and just selling off stock.DO NOT BUY! You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big red flag - don't waste your money - Syntax tests at your cost","review":"It will work only until about one year for which there is a warranty after that it all depends on your luck. Mine stopped working at 14th month, took it to a local repair shop, low quality and unavailable parts, so repair was not possible except by Syntax.

I was not disappointed! Not only does the new box have new art featured on the DVD cases, but the box is nice and sturdy. Not cheap like the box before this one.The anime is fantastic. It has a great English cast for dub fans and awesome subtitles for sub fans! I've watched them both and they are fantastic.

But it is completely impossible with this one.This thing starts with an odd proposition - that some quite attractive girl is living in a tent in the middle of nowhere and is befriended by the most popular boy in school who just happens to turn into an animal when hugged or when emotions get too high.Ok, from a poor start it just gets worse. There's no story to begin with and the writing varies from poor to rotten.

Would most definitely recommend! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Fruits Basket is my favorite anime anyways so I was excited to be able to buy it on DVD. The dubbing on this anime is better then most and again, I recognized some of the voice actors from other animes. I adore the story of Tooru and her \\"rice ball\\" personality, she fit into the Sohmas real well. This anime is also kid friendly for preteens as well as being fun for adults.There are gaps in the story line and when I read the manga series those gaps were filled and it gave me a more rounded view of the story. I highly recommend buying the mangas as well as the anime.I am very satisfied with this purchase and the shipping time. I live in Germany so it takes a while for packages to get here, never the case with Amazon. My purchase always comes in good time, complete, and in excellent condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I would have liked to watch more of this series.

As a media studies scholar, I found the book refreshing in its clarity and in its interest in how teens think about and deal with the notion of the supernatural.The author's use of ethnographic techniques gives the book detail and depth, as it goes far beyond the limits of survey research to look at religion in American culture. This is a must-read for everyone interested in culture and media, as it deals seriously with profound changes in American society."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Questionable Study","review":"Ms. Clark has written a book about her interviews with young people and their families and has tried to draw conclusions about their religious beliefs from their television-watching habits. There are so many questions raised in the reader's mind that the book can hardly be called a valid study--perhaps an extensive opinion poll would be more apt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a compelling read.","review":"I did not enjoy the book as much as I had hoped. For all the hype around the book, I was underwhelmed by it. I thought her conclusions were flawed and were presented without any sort of context.That being said, it does offer an interesting look at the Mulroney years and those who were along for the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"I\\"LL TAKE BRIAN","review":"While Brian Mulroney was Prime Minister of Canada he endured far more unfair press than any Prime Minister in Canada's history. This book is nothing more than an extension of that press, full of unproven and false assumptions. Cameron's inferences to-wards Mr Mulroney's part in the \\"Air Bus\\" scandal alleging kickbacks and other malfeasance is pure journalistic \\"what if.\\" Indeed, Brian Mulroney took the current Canadian Federal Government to task for making similar allegations. He sued them for liable. The Federal Govt. backed down and paid Mr Mulroney several million dollars plus his legal costs. No evidence has ever been found that Brian Mulroney committed any wrong doings while he was Prime Minister of Canada.Finally, there was rumour a few years ago that the author was planning a sequel to \\"On the Take\\".That sequel has yet to appear. I wonder why. I have given this book one star. I wish I could give it a big fat zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corruption substantiated","review":"Excellent expose on the Mulroney administration. What we all suspected has been extremely well researched and summarised. It's a national embarrassment that this man due to his legal and political connections is untouchable. This book should be compulsory reading for any Canadian history student so that Canada does not, through inept choice of leaders, repeat the mistakes of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsubstantiated, petty character assassination","review":"Cameron produces a string of unsubstantiated accusations, innuendoes and flimsy coincidences in an attempt to paint the Conservative ministry of the Rt. Hon. Brian Mulroney, PC, CC as a group of corrupt swindlers. While any government has its share of time-servers, careerists and greed, this book does not prove any of its allegations. As we all now know, Mulroney won his legal actions against the Liberal government of Jean Chretien, and Cameron was all along an informant for the RCMP in the politically driven Airbus investigation. Her credibility and objectivity as a journalist is questionable, at best, after these revelations. Save your money and buy a more enjoyable (not to mention factual) book about Prime Ministers, such as George Bowering's Egotists and Autocrats."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking speculation about humanity's future.","review":"Science fiction may be the last genre where genuinely heroic characters and a Romantic view of humanity's future are still welcome; this book epitomizes these qualities. Although the backbone of this novel is an action-adventure story, that isn't its strength. The writing and plot development are leisurely and quietly provocative, inviting the reader to THINK about where we're going and who we are. This is the best thing Anderson has written, and I was sorry to come to the end of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harvest of Yawns","review":"I wasn't a Poul Anderson fan before I read this book, and I still am not. The last Anderson book I read was in the Ensign Flandry series in the late 80's which told a nice story but was nothing special. This book has an interesting idea: the downloads of the head of Fireball trying to outwit each other. The corrupted download is a pawn of the oppressive government while the other fights to maintain Fireball's independence and freedom. Too bad Anderson forgot to tell a story or build the characters along the way. Another author could have made this into a great book with this premise. The book is indeed a ponderous read as Kirkus Reviews indicates. Instead, of concentrating on developing a good storyline and dialogue, Anderson describes EVERYTHING is excruciating detail. If you want to be entertained, I would recommend that you read some of Anderson's earlier Flandry novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishingly engaging hard sci-fi","review":"This is the book that made Poul Anderson my favorite hard science fiction author of all time. The plot is novel and engaging, the characters are well-developed, and the underlying themes cause a reader to pause and think. Anderson has developed an entire universe that, while grounded in scientific reality, is as imaginative and engrossing as any I have read. This book, along with the others in the series, is a must-buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"If you are looking for business management...okIf you are looking for ideas on baskets..forget it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bioinformatic for the beginner...","review":"I guess that everybody interrested by this kind of book knows already a little about bioinformatic and wants to improve his bioinformatician skill. So forget about this book:This is really a well-documented introduction to all the methods currently used by every biologist or biology student, such as Blast, Clustal, multiple alignement or use of web-interface for submiting sequence.So get it if you need a clear introduction to the field, but if you already know a little bit about bioinfo, immediately choose a more detailed book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly organized overpriced book","review":"Although the book is presented as an introduction to the topic, its organization assumes that the reader has already been working in the area. Two of the chapters (1 and 17) are a waste of space. The first chapter presents a (useless) introduction to internet, while chapter 17 attempts (and fails to do so) to explain Perl in the context of bioinformatics.

The good thing is that I only borrowed the book :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of decent...","review":"This book is probably decent (though frustrating due to being so brief) for an introductory undergrad course, but it's not detailed enough for a graduate level course.

The idea of it seems to be very good. In other words the engineering is fine. However the material is just okay (thinner and more brittle than other plastic vents on my home) and the manufacturing quality is poor. There are gaps between the seams where the various molded pieces are assembled that will let in water and air.

The concept is great, and it performs the back flow preventer operation well, keeping the bugs out but the air has to make such an immediate 180 in such a small space.

It also touches on all the other great players of the day...Trevino, Miller, Floyd, Palmer, Ballesteros, Crenshaw, Norman and others not as well known.The book gives an accurate portrait of Watson as a player, who rather than cower at the presense of Nicklaus on the leaderboard (as did most other players of the day other than Lee Trevino and as all golfers of today shrink at the sight of Tiger Woods) shows that Watson had supreme confidence in his own game to not only play with Nicklaus, but to emerge as the Open champuion with an all time record low score. The book also shows what a truly classy gentleman Jack Nicklaus is, along with being the greatest golfer ever.I would reccomend this book to any golf or sports fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rambling piece ...","review":"This book is very poorly written and organized.

Particularly, he pays very much attention to retired players he met and coming to terms with the differences in public personas and actual personalities.I expected a far heavier treatment given the first half of the title. However, the opinions and issues are very skant throughout the book. There moments he gives opinions are often not substantiated and the depth of material is actually suited best for younger readers.I expected the opportunity to be taken to rationalize the role of the commissioner and outline a concrete argument about Vincent's experiences and how things could improve. Instead, the minor essays give a taste of the subject that most hardcore baseball fans would already know before reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like the WORST commissioner","review":"Mr. Vincent calls his book (and himself) The Last Commissioner. So, MLB hasn't had a commissioner since 1992? Hmmm. This book should be titled The WORST Commissioner. Fay Vincent spent just 3 years as commissioner of baseball.

Don't waste your money or your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent Pap","review":"This is probably the worst baseball book I have ever read. In addition to rationalizing all of his own many critical mistakes as Commissioner, Vincent provides trite and banal commentary about historic baseball figures, and adds nothing to baseball lore.

My husband's a fireman.Well, I was quickly drawn into the story. It was well written and a great read, keeping you turning the pages, wanting to see what happens next.I finished the book, and thought it was really good; I couldn't get the brother, Clay, out of my mind. I really like his character and felt so bad for him. Little did I know, there was another book. Beyond Tuesday Morning. And guess what...Clay's back!This is one of those books that stay with you forever. Someday I'll probably read it again. For now, I've convinced my twelve-year-old to read it.

I bought this to adapt my Thule setup (fork trays and a tandem mount) and found it to be a complete waste once things got heavier. Here is why: the cheap plastic risers do nothing more than create a second, narrower set of cross rails with a further reduced weight limit. I suppose if all you were racking were 2 \\"good\\" bikes (max 25-30 lbs. each) it would be acceptable (not box store 50lb. high tensile steel bikes). However, for serious racking on the newer Outbacks, leave the factory rails in their \\"stored\\" position and get yourself the Thule 450/50 or 450/58 system. Using the factory bars as side rails allows you to use more roof space and increased weight limit (for a cost of course). I can now easily rack my tandem as well as 2 kayaks or 4 Thule fork mount trays. The 532 would never have held up to a single kayak let alone my tandem."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is flimsy and only works with lighter items like bikes","review":"I have a 1999 Jeep Cherokee for which it is no longer possible to buy the Thule adapters to use with standard Thule products such as a bike rack or ski rack.

That wasn't something that was made clear in the description of the product on Amazon.com. So if you want to use it to carry bicycles or skies, it may work for you, even if it is flimsy.

The book contains some interesting ideas and should be read by any recent creationist. While his arguments against recent creationism are quite solid he fails somewhat in his arguments against evolution. Many of his purported \\"problems\\" with evolution have quite simple explanations that have been tested and hold up to the scrutiny of scientific testing. Overall, this may be a good introductory book but it is somewhat dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Illogical Argument on Top of Another","review":"Hayward makes numerous silly claims throughout the book. For instance, he claims that a fortuitous Rb-Sr isochron would be akin to spilling peas on the floor and finding that they all line up. Fact is: No creationist supposes that isochrons form by such random processes. Instead, mixing lines can give rise to isochrons instead of millions of years of in-situ 87Rb decay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut and Paste Job","review":"The author wishes to argue for an old age creation view. The way he accomplishes this is by selectively extracting from evolutionist material, those arguments that refute a young earth; and by selectively extracting from creationist material, those arguments that refute evolution; and slaps this material together to make this book. If the source text were on a word processor, this book could have been put together in one afternoon by cutting and pasting text. I did not see any original material here and it adds nothing to the C/E debate. If you want to study this issue, then get your hands on original material from both sides and arrive at your own conclusion instead of getting this book where all the material that doesn't support the author's conclusion has been edited out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creation and Evolution","review":"Hayward's book is certainly far from unique in the genre of old-earth, apologetic literature. Of the many I have read, this one has a more balanced, thoughtful tone than most. Hayward believes in a Christian view of spirituality and salvation, while also believing that the majority opinion of the science establishment is correct in its assertions about the age of the earth, geologic processes, etc. In this, Hayward has shown a significant ignorance of both the processes themselves and the limitations of the scientific method. Some of this may be forgiveable, since significant research by diluvial geologists has been published since Hayward's book, but many of the deficiencies appear to be poor scholarship. His best argument for an ancient universe is the starlight issue, though he clearly misunderstands and cursorily dismisses topological questions that remain. If one needs a book from this genre to provide balance in a research project, this is as good as any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compromise is a compromise","review":"As a YEC I bought this book to learn more about the viewpoints of others. However, as I am not a scientist, I would not want to comment on his scientific arguments but I sure want to comment on his Biblical interpretation which I feel is very wrong. He chides YEC for being dogmatic about the literal reading of Genesis and yet he is being dogmatic that his Fiat Creation is the answer. One cannot think that by casting doubt on YEC Bible interpretation that he has forever dealt with it. Alan is not being consistent with his use of the rules of Biblical interpretation. Just by looking at his Bible interpretation, one can easily see that Alan is more on eisogesis and little on exegesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Hayward provides an unbiased evaluation of evidence for and against an ancient creation of the universe, directed primarily at a Christian readership. This is a much-needed book in a time when many Christians confuse tradition with actual biblical truth. Arguments for a recent creation are gently dispelled and many examples (primarily from earth sciences) are given to demonstrate that the earth must be much older than \\"young earth\\" creation theory teaches. It is clearly emphasized that one can accept the scientific evidence for an ancient earth and still be a sincere believer in special creation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Caramel Cocoa","review":"This cocoa is hard to find in grocery stores and is well worth buying in bulk.

The information in the book is not well-organized, and much of the writing seems stilted and awkward in attempting to explain things. While I realize the book was probably not intended as a handbook for book collectors, an organized glossary of terms could have at least claimed it a spot in the book case. There is none.

This small strap is very weak and if you take the case off and let it hang on the camera, it snaps off easily. My other Nikon cases would easily slide off and on with a secure mechanism (screw bottom), with no fear of losing or falling off by a simple snap. I was on vacation and it fell off when I did not immediately put the camera back in the case and did not know this until a stranger had picked it up for me. For this reason I am only giving it 2 stars. If there were a more secure strap to hold the case onto the camera strap, I would give it a higher rating. Please be aware of this feature when you are considering this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I love my Nikon D-80 but I really don't like this case. It provides minimum protection, but the clasp to keep it on the camera strap is easily undone and so it falls off all the time.Also, there are no extra pockets for an extra SD card or battery. If I did it again, I would buy another case that was tougher, more secure and had an extra pocket or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Snug fit for D80 + 18-200 VR; it's a nice leather soft case.","review":"After looking around for information about this soft case, I can only find approximate dimensions and description saying that it fits D80 body + 18-135 kit lens. However, I figured that the length of 18-200 lens is just slightly longer and decided to order one anyway. To my surprise, it is a snug fit for my D80 + 18-200 VR + skylight filter + lens cover.The leather soft case is strangely listed as CD-D80 here on Amazon. However, the one I ordered is CF-D80, like what was listed everywhere else. Anyway, it feels like it will provide basic protection to minor bumps, drizzle, and dust. A good companion for my carry around shooting setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the D90","review":"As another reviewer said previously, this case fits the Nikon D90 with the 18-105VR lens perfectly. So if you have that camera and are looking for a soft plushy case, go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited functionality","review":"Warning: This camera case does not fit with the Nikon D80 and 18-200 mm lens attached. It also does not have a separate shoulder harness or a zipper seal for protection from the elements. I ended up returning mine after 2 days of use. I replaced it with a Lowpro topload zoom II bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD-D80 Case is exactly what I wanted","review":"My photography is exclusively outdoors, often far from the road. I wanted a light case that would give the camera some protection and enable me to get at it quickly. The case fits the camera well and, while it wouldn't save it if I dropped it on a rock, it would likely protect in most circumstances.The only thing I don't like is the small strap with a snap that attaches the case to the camera strap. The snap is not robust enough and the opening the camera strap goes through is a bit small. This often causes the soft case to fall off the camera (strap) during use.Overall, works for me, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"Accurate shipping. Product is very good.

It's nice soft \\"pleather\\" instead of rough nylon and according to these reviews it can accomodate the D80/D90 with a Nikkor 18-200mm lens. I figure this should also accomodate my D60 with the same lens (which I plan on getting soon). Right now it's a bit loose with just a 18-55mm lens on the camera but I'm still happy with the protection and convenience this case provides for daily use. So if you're a D60 owner, I would recommend going with this case. Minus 1 star for the flaps on the left and right sides not being very snug when closed; the case would be more snug if the flaps were more rigid, perhaps with wire support. This is disappointing especially considering the price and the brand, and regardless of what camera it was designed for, it should be more snug than this; this might be an advantage the CF-DC1 has over this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally good, but not heavy duty","review":"This case is good if you just want to walk around with your camera and keep dust off of it and general light-duty usage. However, it's about twice as thick as a backpack and has velcro closure and thus should not be used for anything heavy duty. If you want something really padded that would protect your instruments if you dropped them (from a low height, of course) or bumped into something with a little bit of force, this isn't the case for you. I bought a 17-55mm f/2.8G ED-IF AF-S DX lens as well and that attached to my Nikon D80 fit in here just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"D80 case","review":"It's not a must-have, but it will protect your camera from scratching, or falling, or even in light rain.

Auletta sees Dobbs as prominent instance and forerunner in the societal transition from emphasis on wide- public straight news to one focusing on 'opinion- news' aimed at niche- publics. Dobbs is spoken about as a bit of a bigot in his calls for halt to immigration, on his anti- globalist, and anti- business message.I find Auletta a truly outstanding reporter and generally enjoy his presentations.

It is hard to apply it unless she's going to bed for the night because the smell is so strong, if I put it on her at the beginning of the day, or before we go anywhere, we all smell like it and it is a potent smell.However, I do think it has helped to bring the bumps to a head, but they are no where near gone. It has only been about 2 weeks, so after another 2 I hope to see more improvement. No miraculous healing, tho, like some reviews at all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked for my son","review":"My son had molluscum spreading for over a year. I found this product and ordered it. After a few weeks my son's molluscum started drying out and going away. Although my husband had to order a second bottle, the moluscum was gone in a little over a month after having it for over a year. I would recommend this product to anyone. He only had a few bumps of the molluscum and his case wasn't bad. However, he did spread it to his little brother. I do plan to order more of this product with the confidence that the molluscum will be gone very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very impressed","review":"tried for 4 weeks now and apart from the molluscs flaring right up they dont seem to have dissapeared at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I was using tea tree oil and my molluscum were slowly going away.

This box set comes with DVDs 5-7 of the series as well as booklets/inserts for each DVD. Each booklet contains beautiful artwork from the show, character profiles, and comments from production staff. The main box and the boxes that hold the discs and inserts are really well done; they keep everything safe and have great artwork.I noticed the product description didn't have a rating. I, personally, wouldn't recommend this for those under 13-14 years of age.

In spite of its occasionally serious-sounding tone, it is not a \\"how-to\\" book about intimacy; it is less a map than a tour-guide. In spite of its perhaps unintentional allusion to the spiritual life (such as Merton's \\"Seven Story Mountain,\\" the number \\"seven\\" having spiritual significance), and its occasional references to things spiritual, there is no spiritual \\"food\\" here--nothing one has to chew on because every insight or obstacle or challenge is pureed enough to be sipped through a straw. Still, perhaps its popularity-- and its very aim is to be \\"popular\\"-- says more about us as readers/consumers than it does about the writer. If that is the case then one cannot help but wonder whether the author's regard of us is more cynical than sincere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story","review":"This film is not your ordinary Dracula flick.

One would expect to see the usual horror / Dracula film, but aside from Bram Stoker's: Dracula and The Lost Boys, this is it for me.

The video consisted of a music video production featuring cute poses around LA and some attempts to cut in what looked like the band playing the song for several seconds at a time.

He was unable to get any of the pieces to stay together by himself. The pieces do not click together and once they are finally together, they fall apart easily. I do not understand how it can be so difficult to get pieces to go together only to have them easily fall apart. One half of the jaw did not even match up with the other half. The internal organs will not stay attached to the spinal cord and the rib cage falls apart if not being held together. After 30 minutes of working on it myself and not getting it to stay together we put it back in the box.The instructions are poorly written and obviously not edited by an English speaking person.The concept is great, but very poorly constructed especially for being advertised for 6 year olds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good choice....","review":"If it is possible, I think that the soundtracks for this show just keep getting better!

It reads in a lovely 1940's style vernacular by another writer who calls himself a friend, but spends the entire book very skeptical about Hemmingway's writing style. Since the author Kiley did not actually read any of Hemmingway's work until The Old Man and The Sea, the book is actually dedicated to the loyal fighter, friend and drunk side of Hemmingway. It is really engaging and allows readers to appreciate Hemmingway and Kiley (although known as the \\"best known American in Paris,\\" ends up dying fairly unknown)."},{"rating":"1","title":"lipton noodle with real chicken","review":"it sucks, i have been eating lipton chicken noodle soup for 40 years, now they change the receipe or what ever they did, i can't find any of the old boxes, if i could find it, i would buy a case or two, i have looked everywhere in every store. i have also talked to other people very disappointed.

The dedication is to those who have chosen to teach love rather than fear. McBride's heartwarming story is about a teacher who resisted change, clung to the grammar drill and kill and had trouble dealing with students. The janitor shows him a better way to relate to kids, people in general. \\"The future will depend on what we do in the present.\\" Gandhi As we struggle with new strategies, reform movements, and the demand to change the way we are as teachers, this book can soften our hearts, relieve our stress, lessen our fears, and give us hope for the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless drivel","review":"I am a teacher. I love teaching. I teach in a tough public school, and my favorite students are the \\"difficult\\" ones. I train teachers how to be better teachers because that is how much I love teaching. And I have to say, I hated this book. It was one incredibly long cliche--a story that has been told countless times before, and always better than this. It is poorly written (which is probably why it was not published by any major publishing company and why the reviews on the back are written by people no one has ever heard of.) It is full of mixed metaphors and simplistic maxims on life. I am not sure Bill (or William) McBride has a real understanding of students, teachers, or janitors--as none of his characters seemed even slightly believable. This book has a lot of syrupy sweetness, but nothing substantial enough to really offer teachers hope or inspiration for long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive and stereotypical","review":"I had high hopes for this book after hearing its praises sung by my grad school prof and reading the reveiws on the back of the book. I was truly disappointed. By page 20, I could predict what was going to happen because it is the same tired book about teaching that has been written hundreds of times before.

With there new pop/rock sound they appeal much more to my liking. They beat out the \\"Britneys\\" of the world, because they actual write, perform and play there own music, which is far from the pathetic \\"dancing britney\\". Talent is what they have and a lot of it. They have come a long ways. This cd is great, it is just very enjoyable listening, and great to sing to in the shower! I think a lot of teens can relate to the topics in these songs especially, but most anyone can really. This was worth the money and a great addision to my collection.

And on The Big Room, they definitely have! For one, the vocals are definitely not as tinny as before. Secondly, the arrangements are more rock-oriented. \\"Sometimes\\" has a riff that could be out of a Pearl Jam song. Don't worry, though - the fun is still here. Thirdly, the lyrics continue to offer a very realistic view of girls' lives at their age. Shades Of Purple had well written lyrics, but The Big Room has improved on them. And finally, the album is more cohesive - it helped getting rid of the R&B bent Shades Of Purple had. Shades Of Purple hinted that they were capable of more than just bubblegum pop, and on The Big Room, they prove it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, these girls rock!","review":"If their debut album, \\"Shades Of Purple\\" is their \\"pop\\" album, then this is their \\"rock\\" album.

That I can handle. What I wasn't too thrilled about was when the handsets just plain stopped connecting to Skype after just over a year of use, out of nowhere. Router registered the bases' IP address, so that wasn't the problem. For what I paid for this originally, over 200 dollars, I am very dissappointed. I switched to Nettalk DUO after that, using an old landline phone complete with an answering machine, and all the features including long distance, and HALF the cost of skype (only 30 a year, which is basically what you pay for a landline number with skype, plus the $3 a month) and I've been much happier.

And while I agree with this, I do think the book had more than enough other good qualities to keep it interesting. The characters were all interesting, even the minor ones.The biggest problem I had with the book is that there seemed to be so much story left out. At times it was confusing, and whether this was from the writing style, or intentional since there are more books, I do not know; however I intend to find out since I will read the next book.

It is important to get the chronology right from the beginning, as trying to do so later is difficult. I'm a math/science person but I did well. So I guess this book helps.

It's about owning your own life, and never being a victim. This is a book about the wisdom of learning that what happens TO you doesn't matter so much as how you respond. It is an utterly Romantic book, in the best, old sense of the word, and I would recommend it to anyone of any persuasion. (It was recommended to me by a straight woman.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"you need to modifie the plates","review":"The plates will have to be drilled if you are using sony explode speakers, the holes do not match up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for individual web users, students and teachers!","review":"The authors have done a great job of providing criteria, explanations and examples for web users who wish to evaluate information on the web.

In turn, Tommy takes them to school with him and scares all the girls as well as a teacher. He spends the day in the principal's office, and a note is sent home.

There is only one (albeit excellent) track by the breathtaking Handsome Family, and, thank goodness the Johnny Dowd/Maggie Brown duet is included -- these folks have voices that just plain work together!

You expect strong bass from Bose speakers, but usually you get over-boosted boomy bass. Not with the 301's.

Sister Wendy is here to lead you into looking at art yourself with that some of her child-like enthusiasm and an open mind. She likes to show you how to dump your preconceived notions of what is and is not great art and relax into just looking. I know it sounds weird but Sister Wendy is a bit of a hedonist that way. I find her analysis very strange at times.

First, the book is poorly written, some concepts being covered ad nauseum, some not at all. Second, the book is so-selfserving, flattering the reader every chapter that they are so wonderful as to be reading this book.

I liked it less each time. At first, I found the book fascinating, but then I tried to make sense out of it all. When I finally did, what I found was \\"Decieving people is o.k. as long as they benefit according to your rules.\\" I found that being focused on your goal of money or power is the way to get it. What I did not find were ethical considerations or the need for value clarification. Some of the people Ms. Chu quotes are not people that I admire, such as the oil monopolist and cutthroat capitalist T. Boone Pickens. I also couldn't help but think that Ms. Chu is trying to become a cult figure. I would rather read a book which tells me how to succeed AND be ethical.

But it's not. The target plate mechanism is held in place by metal rods that extend across the trap through holes in the side. These rods should be threaded on both ends and held in place by nuts. Instead, they are \\"secured\\" by cheap little plastic washers. These washers come off easily and cannot be re-used. And when one comes off, that end of the rod falls down into the trap rendering it useless. I have had two of these traps - the first arrived with three washers off the rod ends, and the rods and target plates lying in a pile in the bottom of the trap. The replacement trap arrived oksy, but after a few shots from a low-powered airgun two of the washers came off, causing those rods to fall down inside the trap. Very frustrating. Simply threading both ends of those metal rods and securing them with nuts would make this a really great and durable target trap. As it is, the thing is a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"outdoor enthusiast","review":"My son got one of these targets and the first time he used it, we were disappointed.

Its advantage is that it gives you instant feedback - you don't have to run out and check a target, you can hear whether you're hitting or not. Very useful for prone shooting.I have had some difficulty with the settings on it however. The two rightmost targets sometimes don't want to lock back. My more powerful airgun (a Benjamin discovery) will put them right back, but my other gun (Daisy Powerline Targetpro 953) doesn't have always have the strength, especially at further distances. The converse is also true; often the reset target won't return the two targets on the right and will only reset the left two. Ah well, it's still a wonderful trap. If I fiddled with it I could probably fix it.Sorry everybody if you read my review before and it didn't make sense.

Unlike the sanitized and banal stimuli (visuals, thoughts, mass media, current academic inquiry, etc.) that surrounds daily life today, this book reminded me of the mysteries that remain within the world. It was repetitive at times but it is such a large book that it's excusable. There appears to be solid reasoning for the proposals in the book.

Are there specific instances of shamans curing disease? Why is the supposed wisdom gained by those who tune into the other realms bereft of the practical, such as being of use to the residents of the Amazon in keeping their homeland from destruction or, earlier, the San people from extermination? What part do the trances alledgedly gone into by spiritualist mediums play in these doings?

With good reason, it turns out. The plot develops at a glacial pace and is full of actions and motivations that don't make sense. For example, the actions of the hero's wife at the end of the movie are totally out of charcater, given what she's said and done earlier in the film. Rather improbably, the movie portrays early California as a sword culture coexisting with a gun culture, which allows the producer to deliver a combo Samurai flick and Gunfighter flick, with lots of the dramatic pauses for which both are noted. In fact, the plot plods along because it's so full of dramatic pauses you could almost say the whole thing was one big dramatic pause. The only redeeming feature of this movie was the beautiful scenery.

The rest of the cd is really nice music, but not the fantastic music of his past where he would have strings of hits. It's a lot of Adult Contemporary music but still should have his fans enjoying it. Jermaine Dupri produced What You Are and that happens to be my favourite song here. I also really like Reason To Believe and All Around The World (a more upbeat Brazillian style song).This didn't grab me on my first listen through, but after a couple of goes, I'm really enjoying the cd and glad that Lionel is back again.

And they are the commonly available makers.While the Bose 201s aren't as horrible a value as the 901s, you're still foolish to get these when much better higher quality speakers are out there.An indicator of Bose priority is the fact that their advertising budget is higher than their research budget.

In fact, This is the first Anime I've seen with this much CG effect. Great music, the opening track sounds like a slow paced Yoko Kanno original (although it is not)I am looking forward to the full release of Arjuna, I can only hope that Bandai rushes these out instead of torturing us with one volume every few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books about ginseng.","review":"An excellent book that tells you how to use Ginseng.

Problem is that it is never ever -- i repeat, NEVER EVER AS GOOD AS THE ORIGINAL -- everyone else on this little blue marble knows it but they are oblivious!One artist covering another's hits or a live album by an artist is a different matter, but please, please, for your sake and mine, do not encourage this bad behavior. Do NOT purchase this album. It is much wiser to buy Millenium Collections, Singers & Songwriters series, Have a Nice Day 70's series, anything by Rhino, anything by Razor & Tie, TimeLife Gold, Pure Funk/70's/80's, VH1-80's.I'd give this a zero or a negative 10 if it were possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGRACEFUL","review":"Sometimes she wants to paste her faves into a coherent assembalage.

There is a typically hard to find, and read (printed sideways) disclaimer, in a corner on the rear label. But, why even bother desecrating these works of musical art by messing with them? Do the manufacturers of these kinds of CD's have no shame? Hmm...Evidently not... Bottom line, don't waste your money or time on these kinds of pathetic, ear torturing monstrosities.

We just up-sized him to his larger crate and attached this Pen to his crate so that he still has enough room to play in. Also good to have something to put him in while we are doing things that need to be done around the house.

She later finds out that over seventy boats were downed in 60 days while she was there. A very dangerous attack on the East coast of the US before Pearl Harbor and she was lucky to survive for us to hear her tell this tale.She was lucky to have a reluctant Hemingway with her in China when she becomes frustrated with her travels there; if not for him she would not have survived!Great read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best ever!!

All through the book she states how she doesn't remember this or that, so often that the whole book comes onto question. The trip to China with her then husband Ernest Hemingway was a total blow out. She wasn't sure about anything.The second story, her first trip to Africa, was the best in the bunch.The last trip to Africa was totally unbelievable. Fiction.She can not remember enough to make a coherent record of her journeys.Also for someone who loves to travel and has spent her life doing so all around the world-- she has no camera!

The hero/head casino robber/muscle bound star looks like he just finished toking up before each scene and his eyes were the bloodiest part of this lame flick. The storyline is assinine, a doctor supposedly trying to create giant food, mistakenly creates these giant Komodo dragons instead, chalk that one up in the ooops column.

We thought this game would help him to catch up on where he is behind - and it did. After 4 months of playing this game only he is able to talk a lot better and his teachers at school told us they see a remarkable difference in his starter spelling and his speech. This game helped my child be less frustrated - because we used to not be able to understand him - his beginning speech sounds were so bad.

The other problem remains to be the fact that the majority of the readings are 3 pages or less and there is an absence of higher level thinking. The only reading material that is above the 9th and 10th grade level are textbook chapters which simply provide for more busywork for the students who should be to applying reading strategies to their own textbooks.I am still seeking a college level reading text that actually is holistic and contains college level readings that challenge students.

As a matter of fact, I lent it to a friend who hadn't read the DaVinci Code, but after I told her about the book she wanted to read it anyway. You don't have to read the DaVinci Code to get a great wealth of info from this book. As a matter of fact, I wish I had read this book first. Now that I have I am going to go back and re-read the DaVinci Code. There are a great number of books out there about \\"the facts\\" and I have read many of them. This is the first book I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!!!","review":"This is a very interesting book. I fully recommend it to anyone looking for answers about Christianity. You may not agree with everything -- and that's OK. But take whatever you get from this book and simply make it yours. Try it. You may like it.Also recommended: \\"What Did Jesus Really Say, How Christianity Went Astray: [What To Say To A Born Again Christian Fundamentalist, But Never Had The Information]\\" by Peter Cayce"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs balance","review":"This is a good book with a lot of historical information and quotes, but it is the usual kind of scholarly approach that one finds to Christianity (like few other subjects): An investigation for which the author already knows the answer. I would rather see something a bit more open-minded than the sort of \\"writing the facts to fit the opinion\\" that usually comes to religion. For instance the entire concept of Jesus's \\"Kingdom of God\\" has only one possible meaning to the author; suffice it to say this is not so for a great many scholars, theologists and spiritualists. Rather disappointing for something that came through the Oxford University Press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"The book is excellent if you want to know what is true about the religious parts of DaVinci code - it appears to be the best book out there now. It does not deal with the art aspect, tho."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bart Erhman's book good, but has its own problems","review":"Bart Errman carefully and in precise academic thoroughness exposes as false the historical claims made in Dan Brown's excellent mystery thriller. The one drawback in Bart Erhman's argument are his own biases about the reliability and dating of many of the New Testament documents, for example the Pastoral epistles, 2 Peter and the Gospel of John. He also resorts to a dan brown type of statements such as \\"Scholars now agree that . . .\\" But many reputable New Testament scholars don't agree with the doubts Bart Ehrman has about the NT sources. Anyone wanting a more reliable guide to the authenticity of the NT documents could do no better than read the late F F Bruce's little book \\"The New Testament Documents Are They Reliable?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A duo Blues piano","review":"I love very much piano Blues players, specially Otis Spann and Memphis Slim.

The plot combines elements of Mexican history loosely interspersed with typical horror movie plot devices like reincarnation, virgin sacrifices, evil scientists, an ancient mummy, and one of the stupidest robots ever. The sets are awful, the plot holes are enormous, everything is so dark that it's virtually unwatchable, and the climactic fight between the robot and mummy is among the worst choreographed (and slowest paced) I have seen.Some people may be able to view this as a \\"so bad it's good\\" movie, but I mostly found it tedious and boring, with insufficient camp value to redeem it. If you think it might be worth a look as a bad-cinephile, go ahead and have a go, but I recommend trying the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version to make it (a bit) more palatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mexican hat dance","review":"This movie truly epitomizes the genre of the Mexican B-picture.

If you wind up liking this movie you might also check out another Mex B-pic called \\"Night of the Bloody Apes\\"; it's a rung above this pic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"You might think that with a title like \\"Robot Vs the Aztec Mummy\\" this would be a terrible film.You would be correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely terrible","review":"Dr. Krupp (Luis Aceves Castanda) is your typical mad scientist who is hellbent on taking over the world as he steals forbidden treasure from an Aztec temple unleashing an ancient mummy of a king named Popaca (Angel Di Stafani) who goes on the rampage trying tom get his treasure back. In the mean time, the authorities are searching for him and Krupp invents a robot to destroy the mummy.A totally ridiculous and out of place 1957 Mexican Sci-fi horror clunker with terrible acting, a stupid as hell plot, bad special effects including a laughable robot and of course a character who looks like an early Freddy Krueger.

The first part of the book is a series of rare interviews published for the first time where he discusses society, culture, his life and art. In the second part the author offers his analysis of the sculptors work. The book is filled with many tresures, such as unfinished pieces, prints of projects that were destroyed and over 100 black and white photographs.

It's eclectic nature initially struck me as odd, but I quickly found it to be irrestible and had (and still have) a difficult time listening to anything else. Compared to the brilliant fusion of rock, pop, and British harmony of \\"Dive,\\" the rich texture and soaring vocals of \\"Consume Me,\\" and the aggresive, driving rock of \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"It's Killing Me,\\" most other albums seem a bit dull to me. Every tune on this disc is catchy. Some say that this album lacks focus, but for me, it's variety has given it incredible staying power in my discman. dc Talk is extremely talented, and I can't wait for another album. If you buy this album and give it at least four or five listens, you will be hooked and very pleased with your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one from dc Talk","review":"This is an excellent album. While it doesn't quite live up to the classic Jesus Freak, I believe it may become a classic in its own right. It is more of a pop/rock album than Jesus Freak; gone is the great rap. However, Toby McKeehan, Michael Tait and Kevin Max's songwriting skills are still evident. The best songs are 'Into Jesus', 'Supernatural', 'Fearless', and 'My Friend (So Long)'. Hopefully dc Talk will continue with their excellent songwriting and not spiral downwards musically like their contemporaries (e.g. Michael W. Smith, Whiteheart, Newsboys etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural, naturally.","review":"Supernatural takes DC Talk up yet another level. With great sounds and even greater lyrics that get at the mystery and reality of our walk with God, DC Talk challenges us to embrace the supernatural nature of God while holding His hand.

Several of the songs deal with relationships, eg. between those whose views have come in conflict. And as much as I like the ones with really funky sound, my favorite is \\"Consume Me\\" because it is really the words of a person in tune with God. The lyrics are powerful, and after all, that's what Christian music is about, isn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music that bridges the gap b/w unbelievers and Christ","review":"The songs are great. It is special for a group to follow up on a smash-hit with another one.

And as if that wasn't bad enough, don't forget that this is their first release after a 2-year hiatus. Before that hiatus, they released NINE singles from the Jesus Freak album. Does that seem like a copout to anyone else? Isn't work done for the Lord supposed to be of top quality? There is no excuse for Supernatural to be anything less than spectacular considering their recent history. But sadly, it's the same stuff that every other Christian band is monotonously cranking out. Much like the majority of other mainstream Christian pop bands are, this attempt by DC Talk is just another imitation of already-existing secular pop/alternative sounds. Try something original--or better yet--interesting next time, boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!","review":"I picked up Supernatural,instantly assuming it was going to be AWESOME!

I would give this CD a rating of two thousand stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"The style changes again, but the quality doesn't.","review":"It seems like with every new CD they release, the style has dramatically changed. It started out 80's style rap, then to early 90's hip-hop, then to an R&B sound on Free at Last, Jesus Freak changed totally to Grunge, and finally we have a techno-ish/hard rock. All of these changes, and they adapt beautifully to each one. I'm sorry to say that recently I was wondering where their main focus was during their mainstream fame (being either for God or for fame), this album made my decision. All three guys write on every or most songs, and the lyrics are deeper than past songs. The song \\"So Long(My Friend)\\" helped a ton with that decision. But the lyrics really seem annointed by the God of the universe here. It's apparent that God was spearheading this act. Jesus Freak was awesome and I liked it's style better, but the lyrics on this one hold much more meaning...at least to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DC Talk are the BEST","review":"I LOVE the SuperNatural CD!!

Supernatural flows together so nicely, but all the songs are unique, so it doesn't get boring. I really think the Supernatural IS better than Jesus Freak, even though I love Jesus Freak. Supernatural is just more mature sounding, with more viariety and passion. I love every song, but I think my fave is Since I Met You, Into Jesus, Dive, and My Freind (So Long). I guarantee this GREAT CD to anyone, because they are sure to find a song that fits there likes. Supernatural is put together so nicely, and it rocks totally. Buy it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no title","review":"I used to own this cd.wow.I even went through few phases in the course of a year in which i actually enjoyed it.Then i realized somthing.This \\"band\\" spent three years making a very mediocre record.Now,somehow,I acually miss the cd.Thinking about it,i do find \\"My Friend(So Long)\\"and some other tracks \\"interesting\\".In summary,this album contains some ok rock/pop;but don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DCTalk Needs to Stick to One Style","review":"This cd would have been worthy of five stars if all the songs were up to the caliber of \\"Fearless\\" \\"Supernatural\\" and \\"Red Letters.\\" However, they jump from style to style and does nothing but confuse the listener as to what kind of group they are listening to. Their Jesus Freak cd was a much better example of just how superb this group CAN be. Still, it is worth buying simply because the above mentioned three songs exhibit quality musicianship"},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm.......Not Quite","review":"This is certainly an interesting CD. dC Talk is definitely umm...searching. They couldn't seem to decide what they were doing on this album. I also thought Kevin Smith's voice got kind of annoying. This album didn't have much to hold it together. Some good, some bad. \\"Jesus Freak\\" was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A challenge","review":"Ok, if they are not Satanic as some of you claim.

I question whether this music points people to Christ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freakin' annoying! dc talk- go away!!!","review":"That's just about all I have to say.

It's simply overproduced. Not a thing on this CD feels fresh or energetic, or even honest...now I'm not doubting the guys honesty or energy or (God forbid) freshness, but sometimes you can add too much junk to a song and just weigh the sucker down. Supernatural feels that way. That's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant - dc Talk outdoes themselves","review":"I can't say enough about this album. dc Talk has moved leaps and bounds. Two albums ago - they were a cheesy christian rap group, they have since evolved into musically mature and lyrically profound artists.

I bought this CD this summer, and I love every song on it, I just can't get enough. It's wonderful to hear such terrific music, and to relate to all of it. To listen to these far out lyrics... sometimes the songs are so overpowering that you find yourself shaking, or smiling, or laughing, or crying. If you are looking for a CD to by - Christian, Pop, Rock, Alternative, this is the one to by, on so many levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"DC Talk new Cd, new adventure!","review":"This Cd just goes to show you what a good rock group does while it's not on tour.

Overall this Cd is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can We Make It to Mars asks some interesting questions.","review":"Neil Degrasse Tyson is a great host and the show is very interesting.

The Bergs are well known wreck divers. The book has many really exellent photos and hits most of the highlights of Island wreck diving. It is broken down by Islands and gives a little blurb about history and conditions for each wreck. What the book lacks are, the exact locations of the wrecks and the accessability, e.g. shore dive, dive charter, 1 hr. trip or 2 hr. trip? A good photo book to get psyched up for your vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Coffee Table Book","review":"This book had some nice photos and did include a bit of information on the wrecks and dive sites, but is definitely not a book for a serious wreck diver. For example, no information is given on the locations of the wrecks so anyone interested in seeing the wrecks is forced to find a local dive operation. Since most local dive trips cater to casual, recreational divers who normally follow the recommendations of the operator and have little input on the destination anyway one wonders about the usefulness or potential audience for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daren should be a surgeon-he keeps you in stiches!","review":"Daren Streblow does a fantastic job in keeping you in constant laughter.

The point of view keeps this from being a \\"private eye\\" story, and the character development makes you become really interested in the outcomes of the characters.Some of the scenes portrayed in the book are very violent, and it is not for younger readers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great love-mystery-adventure-political commentary story!","review":"Corbett's writing is exceptional and his story lines not only entertain but get you thinking. I discover him through his second book, \\"Done for a Dime.\\" I picked it up in a little bookstore in Pacific Grove CA.

Then they just started sticking onto to the bathtub so strongly that we couldn't pull them off the porcelain. They'd just pop out of the \`sockets' that we had cups with no pillow stuck to the tub for a few days. This pillow had great possibilities and was more expensive then other similar products. If I could choose again I'd stick with this company's \`Bean Pillow'. It is hard to be negative, but with a little work this might be a great spa pillow. But it isn't there yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read for a class","review":"I did not like this book. Russ is angry and the book is angry. I read for enjoyment not for politics or onesided emotions. There is no balance here. As I understand it,Russ, a recognized and celebrated heroine of the feminist movement, wrote this book as her last fiction novel platform for feminism then went on to write non-fiction books on the subject. (per research on her for class) This book is highly political, anti-muslim, and very angry. The story has potential but not presented this way for me.

It's been a great activity for us to do together and the whole family enjoys finding good rocks to polish and gathering around to examine the changes in rocks with each changing of grit/polish.Rocks are free and grit can be found cheap and only needs to be bought about once a month, so after the initial expense of the tumbler, this is an inexpensive, educational and fun hobby.I had the exact same model when I was her age (25 years ago) and used it for a good 10 years before it got lost in a move. Keep it clean, dry, and put a drop of oil (3-in-1 works well) on the motor bearings before starting a new batch of rocks and this machine will last for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"For patient kids","review":"By design, there's not a lot 'to do' with this activity while it simply spins and spins for weeks. But that's part of the learning experience; how to wait for the result. Got this for our 11year old after he'd been asking for one for about 3 years. He's very happy with it. As for the product, spend the extra to get this type of good one rather than the 'toy' versions. Even this one needs some adjustments over time. The rubber barrel really deadens the sound and is nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginner Tumbler","review":"My first batch of rocks turned out great. I ran the unit in my basement, because it does make a lot of noise (hard to avoid). I ran it in front of a small fan to ensure that the motor stayed cool. I did have problems with the rubber getting rubbed off. I would find piles of rubber pieces when I went to change the cycle contents. I can't figure out where the rubber is rubbing off from, but it does NOT seem to affect how the machine works. I am satisfied over all. I am getting ready to run a second batch of rocks I collected at the beach."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to See and Hear Rare Footage","review":"Usually there is a choice of watching the DVD with commentary or without.

For a new writer she has produced a heroine that you want to know more about in a universe that appears more interesting the more you read. She has managed to evade the trap of many new authors of feeling that everything has to be completely explained all in one hit and one is left wanting more. Jane Kilian our heroine has finally been returned to face trial but things are not going to happen the way everyone expects. Get the books. Read them both.

The author did such an amazing job of collecting writings from so many different kinds of grrls and she's done such a service because if I see some of these girls in a different light (like gang girls and sorority girls) I'm sure everyone who reads this book will too.

Who are the 8 Masters? They are a bunch of tough guys, I guess. This is a Joseph Kuo movie, so it doesn't have the greatest depth to it. Carter Wong trains his whole life to become a kung fu master, but he doesn't want to fight the 8 Masters once he is grown up. But the 8 Masters really want to fight him, and they end up forcing Carter to fight. This is where the movie gets good. The last 30 or 40 minutes is pretty much nonstop fights. I like Joseph Kuo's method of making Carter Wong look better by speeding the film up. I'm not a big fan of undercranking, but it helps Carter Wong. So if you can make it through the first half of the movie, you are in for a treat in the second half watching Carter Wong fight Judy Lee, Phillip Ko, and many others.3.5/5I have this DVD in theWu Tang 8 Diagram Collectionand the picture quality is decent and it's full screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Happily-Ever-After romance","review":"I don't like to post spoilers in my reviews, so it's hard to say much, but I really didn't like the way this book ended.

So, instead of purchasing a new TV, I bought this smart strip. Now All I have to do is remotely turn off the stereo, then the TV power is cut as well. This setup works GREAT. For thirty bucks (about), I have a solution with a simple work-around.If you have a misbehaving device that needs to be unplugged to 'reboot', think about this device.

The next morning the peripherals were on again. More tweaking, and now the peripherals only sometimes came on with the computer. Back and forth... I gave up on this after a couple of weeks. I'm having trouble imagining what they put in here that makes the turn off point drift around so much, but it makes it unusable for the advertised purpose - at least with my hardware. On the other hand, it's an okay vanilla power strip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea / Didn't Really Work","review":"I wound up buying three of these to help manage phantom load. In the end, I was only able to use one on my home theater system. The other two attempts to use with computer equipment did not work out since the computer did not draw enough power when it came out sleep mode to trigger the autoswitch on the control outlet. Same problem when using with laptop or cell phone chargers. In the end even the home theater setup was mostly bust since the DirecTV box acted badly and needed a 5 minute reset if you cut the power to it.

We have a small fan that has to be plugged in and turned on to activate the switched outlets.

This information is relevant to consumers and when not displayed clearly and transparently leads to mistaken decisions by consumers. As far as I checked with many customers about several kinds of master-slave power strips, they need from 9W to 15W to work. You need to calculate this 9W to 15W additional consumption 365 days per year from the master-slave power strip, deduct the energy you will spare from other equipments you have plugged in it (calculate their consumption in stand-by mode) and check if at the end of the day you will spare or not energy by purchasing the master-slave power strip.

I thought I would give it a try, and it worked. I had a peak power bill of $260, and the next month it was down to $160! Problem was, with PCs on desks and TVs in entertainment centers, it wasn't very easy to unplug them.I started searching for smart power strips and came across these on Amazon. I bought seven for the house, and the power bill has stayed the same as when I was unplugging everything, but now all we have to do is turn off the \\"main\\" appliance on each power strip and it does the rest!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective","review":"Product was defective. My TV was unable to control the autoswitched outlets or other devices. My lamp was able to control only the indicator light for the autoswitched outlets, but apparently not the outlets themselves as my TV and XBox were not being turned back on. It took their customer service about 4 days to return my call even though the receptionist initially advised me that they would be in touch \\"shortly\\".

I hooked my computer up to the control outlet and attached my lcd monitor and speakers to the \\"auto-off\\" outlets. I shut off my computer and the peripheral devices automatically shut off. I then powered up my computer. My speakers came back on but my lcd monitor did not. I tried everything to get the lcd monitor to turn back on. I unplugged it for a day, plugged it into a different power strip, everything else I could think of. My monitor is dead and there is nothing I can do about it. I'm sure this power strip would be great for powering down speaker, DVD players, surround sound systems, etc. However, I strongly recommend you avoid plugging your lcd monitor or tv into this device.

It was also cheaper too."},{"rating":"2","title":"to control sound system for my TV","review":"I bought this to control my older Yamaha home theatre sound system for my TV entertainment center...that I needed to control with my TiVo remote...so that one button on one remote did it all (the Yamaha has a button for on and a different button for off). This worked almost perfectly, and after I adjusted the sensitivity a quarter turn...if works seamlessly. My TV is rear projection, so when the bulb-cooling fan finally shuts down...so does the sound system. However with the TV off, you cannot turn the sound system on (if I want to listen to CD, radio etc.). Hmmm...maybe I can use a 3-way tap and turn on a small load to trick the strip to turn on the Yamaha.

After that, it turned into a regular power strip, regardless of unplugging it, using the adjustment switch, etc. I threw it away and bought a replacement, which also lasted about a year before having the SAME problem.When I spend this much money for a surge protector, I expect it to work longer than 1 year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work!","review":"This model was supposed to be adjustable - it has an adjustable resistor that was supposed to compensate for the amount of power being consumed by the various components.Well, it didn't work worth a lick.

I move the strip to a set-up with our flat screen TV and it worked fine. For the Energy Star TV, when I adjusted it so it would turn everything off, I couldn't turn my TV back on again. Only worth the money if you love hours trouble shooting.

Perhaps the DVD is better (wait a minute--- it has to be better, since it could not possibly be worse!) But as yet I have not seen the DVD. Hey Paramount-- howzabout honoring Mr. Brooks with a redo on this VHS edition?The cinematography of Albert Brook's film is of a piece with the overall elegance of its construction, both on technical and thematic levels; don't let the fact that he's a comedian fool you: he works on a highly refined aesthetic level. Not for nothing did Stanley Kubrick go out of his way to look Brooks up to tell him how much he loved \\"Modern Romance\\". Do yourself a favor: do seek out the DVD edition of this film- the improvement in picture quality is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brook's first film is one of a kind.","review":"Albert Brooks may be the most creative comedian of this and the last century (his real name is ALBERT EINSTEIN after all; and you can look it up)This first film is hilarious; obnoxious; and all together FUNNY! Brooks rarely if ever plays sympathetic characters in his movies; all the while skewering people who are the same in \\"real life\\". This is the ultimate put-on movie; may have influenced in some way the later films of Christopher Guest. Some of my favorite bits are Albert's \\"back burner\\" confrontation with the black consultant, His appearance at the front door in clown makeup (listen for his in-character \\"hello?\\" before Grodin opens the door-for some reason it always makes me LOL), most of the preparation experiments for what amounted to a month or so of filming (instead of the hoped for year)before it collapsed are hilarious as well.

I expected a kind of lesbian retake of the Jewish classic folktale \\"The Dybuk\\". Though the story is funny, it fails as modern folklore because the author has confused her folklore archtypes. A dybuk is the tormented spirit of person who died usually under strange circumstances. The souls of these dead posses a living person. Kokos, the \\"dybuk\\" in this story is really a demon, like her lover Lilith. Demons occupy a separate place in Jewish folklore. Too bad, the story would have been that much better if the author had gotten her folklore characters right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of unique, challenging quilting designs.","review":"As an avid hand quilter, I am always on the lookout for something different in the way of designs. Dorothy Osler's book really hit the spot. It is a review of traditional British and Welsh motifs from antique quilts, something new and refreshing to the American eye. A plus is that Ms. Osler comments on each one's origin and meaning. She also includes options in the way of size, and slight variations to choose from for the designs. I found myself frustrated by the short length of the book. Maybe she can do a Part II?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best, But FAR From the Worst.","review":"Well, this does not quite match the first. In this chapter, we lose the element of plausibility that the first one had. Also, I think the death of King in the first scene kills the suspense of the movie. I think it would have been much more effective to see strange things happening, have Geena discuss the situation, and then have her exposed to the truthful reality of what she feared. On the positive side, some images are well done. The characters are pretty well developed, and there are some nice comical moments. Jeff and Sandra make a real likable couple, and it is touching when Vikki falls in love with the handicapped Mark. Also, the story is well constructed in that Part 2 opens up 5 years after Part 1, at a nearby camp, and where fears of the past have not exactly vanished."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sequel","review":"This is a great sequel for many reasons. First of all, Jason is the killer, and Friday just isn't Friday without our masked friend.

Anyways the movie moves to slow and the death scenes are the lamest in the series(a guy in a wheelchair gets a hatchet in his head and flies 50ft down a flight of stairs)I mean come on.

The Killer is Jason! He back for revenge for his mothers death. This time he stalks Ginny(Amy Steel) five years later, and more counselers at Camp Crystal Lake who plan to reopen it.

But unfortunately the horror seems to be kept to a minimum, endless boring teenagers faffing about and a lifelss plot. Jason, when revealed, lacks the intimidating presence he has in later films of this series, seems just to be a 'bloke with a bag over his head' who keeps falling over.

That's why I loathe \\"Part 2\\" so sincerly. It replaces suspence and scares with too much blood and cheap surprises. The only thing more rediculous than the acting is Jason's 'disguise'at the end, which is a pillow case over his head. To see a slow, pudgy man running around with a pillow case covering his face with two eyeholes poked thru pretty much defeats any chance of suspence that could have been saved during the final fifteen minutes.

The movie itself is really of it's time. You couldn't get away with it now, but I prefer this by far to modern horror fodder. The picture is probably the best it has been. It is not spectacular so don't expect it to be up to today's standards, but it doesn't have to be, it is grainy in places and clean in others.

Penned by a different author (Amy Steele) it was a slight improvement on the original. I stress 'slight'. The opening sequence was indeed full of suspense and terror as the woman who killed Mrs. voorhees is murdered by the new killer. So is Jason back from the dead or is it just a myth?

Without even any hint of the mystery element that the original at least tried for, what's left? Just a worthless slash-o-rama---even more worthless since a lot of the original gore effects had to be cut in order to avoid an X rating. A FRIDAY THE 13TH without a whole lotta gore?

Part 2 begins by killing off probably the nicest \\"last girl\\" of the series, Alice. On my first viewing, I was dissapointed already. However, Alice is replaced by yet another satisfying \\"last gir\\", the sassy and smart Ginny; but she still didn't save the rest of the film from being a dissapointment. The whole movie just seems to be missing something; I have no idea WHAT tho. The rather murky atmosphere also made it a tad depressing.

Where as the first film had a few genuine scares and thrills, this installment isn't scary one bit, not to mention the killings aren't exactly creative (look to the later films for some creative deaths) and the direction of the film is overly sloppy, and Jason isn't scary here one bit, but thats acceptable considering this is the first film where Jason himself is the killer. While there are a few half decent moments, the rest of Friday the 13th Part 2 falls flat on its face.

I think part 2 is better than the first, simply because I am a Jason fan, and nobody can compare to him in the Slasher genre. You may notice that later on in the series the whole summer camp atmosphere is lost due to the fact that Camp Blood is closed down (I wonder why?). Well, the first 2 movies take place entirely in this camp environment, which is what makes them great. Jason is ruthless, and this movie is ruthless. Stupid kids get slaughtered one by one in glorious early 80's slasher style. Be prepared for: throat slashings, hangings, hammer in the back of the head, machette in the face, double your pleasure, double your impalement, severed head, axe ripping flesh open, and more.

This sequel has a good premise and a fine scary ending, but overall it just didn't scare me at all. The murders were weakly executed with very little sound effects. The killer became too anonymous. There was too much undressing of girls. And the hair-dos were so funny, I kept laughing and wishing for hairdressers to jump out of the woods, ready to cut off about 2 tons of hair :)But the ending was worth sitting through this weakling of a horror movie. It's suspenseful, believable, twisty and most importantly: it shows how Jason copes without his mother.

Jason made an appearance at the end of the first film, and you knew they had to make a sequel with him. It's not all that different from the first one(actually, none of them are), but it's good for junkfood entertainment. This is pre-juggernaut Jason, so it's interesting to see him as a scrawny guy in overalls. He makes a special trip to the city to kill Alice from the first film. He wouldn't do this again till part 8. He stumbles, gets chainsawed, gets kicked in the crotch, wrestles with the boyfriend, makes mistakes in judgment. Pretty neat. Some of these reviewers tend to complain about the sack Jason wears. What's the big deal? If you were some deformed orphan surviving in the woods, it's very logical that a sack is the best mask you'll find. This is the one that introduces us to the guy who would become the Frankenstein of the 80s along with the Dracula(Freddy Krueger) of the 80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"A horror icon is born....","review":"The cool thing about this movie is it introduces the world to Jason and, boy, does it do a fine job of it.

The kickboxing \`break a leg' still makes my eyes water, so do the rodeo moments and the arm wrestle straight from the Cronenberg's The Fly.However, beyond that, there is little else to amaze. Unless you think naked sky diving is \`outrageous' then I would suggest you either look elsewhere for clips that are \`too hot for TV'.I do not feel you get real value for money. Most of the time, the clips are replayed again and again in slow motion.

In the mean time, my local tire dealer aired up the flat for no charge. Removal of the tire required assistance from my step-son and a firm twist by me, but once I loosened the bolt it was very simple to remove the flat tire.With the exception of the tire issue I've had great luck with this machine, which is my first.

Not bad considering that the rim was secured in place with an impact wrench, making it virtually impossible to replace without stuffing the entire blower back into the car.But that's what it's been like. After spending $100 last year on a carb, it actually worked first try during the snowstorm a few weeks ago. But tonight, it screwed up again. The snow collector stopped turning, and after some desperate experimentation, it turned out to be the wire that activates it.I've never seen a device which so thoroughly demonstrated complete disregard for the customer and basically slovenly design.

The machine did tend to drift to one or another side if snow was unevenly packed. A minor inconvenience. I finally got some clogging with the last VERY wet snow of the year but other than that it handled everything fine.Startup is easy even in temps as low at 0 Fahrenheit.For a city sidewalk and modest driveway it is fine.

Couple of points that I learned after making numerous calls to the Amazon and the manufacturer:1) Manufacturer MTD - worst customer service center to deal with, they only believe in repair and has service dealers (BTW on their web site they have service dealer list that is outdated) who don't want to fix their products2) Amazon - Not a place to buy a product like this. They don't understand that snow blower kind of things cannot be put under 30 days return policy.

You have to squeeze both together to get the unit to function. You have to be careful and pay attention as to which to disengage. It can be a bit tricky with heavy gloves on.

One of the tires is completely flat and due to Amazon's return policy I am now stuck following up with the local distributor to seek resolution.

I couldn't have been more wrong. Once I took it out of the box, it became a staple in my baby care necessities. I was warned how uncomfortable pumping could be, but can honestly say that I have had no problems with this pump whatsoever since I am able to control the amount of suction. Until I started using it, I had no idea exactly how much my son was consuming! It's also quite convenient to get bottles and accessories for as I have seen them in my drug store and super market. Well worth it, especially since the price is affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for a working mother","review":"I tried others...and was so unhappy. They hurt and made so much noise. Having to pump became a bathroom embarrasment. I would sit and would be lucky to get 2 ozs in 15 min with the electric ones. I just didn't want to spend a lot of money! Everyone recommend Avent and I wouldn't listen. Now I know better. The Avent pump was quiet and comfortable. The \\"petals\\" allowed for fast letdown. I was able to pump 4-6 ozs on my 15 min breaks. The bottles were great for storage and I could hide in a lunchcooler to the office refridgerator. Just one note: give some time for rinsing the pump. There are several parts but the work is well worth the reward. I would have given up breastfeeding at 4 weeks if it wasn't for this pump. Because of my success, my son and I enjoyed 10 great months of breastfeeding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not perfect","review":"I was really happy with my Isis pump, although I only used it occassionally (2-3 times a week). I never any problems with actually using it, but I would agree with some of the other reviews regarding it being a pain to take apart and wash. For that reason, I wouldn't recommend it for someone who is planning on pumping multiple times a day. For those who couldn't get any suction -- you need to flip the star-shaped valve so you are putting it in from the bottom (bottle side of the pump), star facing up towards you. I don't have my instructions any more, so I can't say if that is the way you are *supposed* to put it together, but it gives you the best suction. My sister was having difficulties with getting enough suction, and flipping the valve remedied the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Well I somehow ended up getting the Isis manual Breast Pump in the mail for free & the only thing I can say is that I'm glad I didn't shell out money for this pump! It's terrible.I sat for about 15 minutes trying to pump either breast & I think I succeeded in getting a drop to appear on one nipple! lol I could see the suction was working, but not particularly strong & it didn't do a thing.I read the other reviews & I guess it depends on the person as some people obviously have no problems & others can't get the darn thing to work at all. So if at all possible I would advise borrowing one from a friend to try out first to see if you can have any success before purchasing this pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pump!","review":"This pump works better for me then the one from the hospital! It's very easy to use and clean and I love that it attatches to the bottles so I can give it right to my baby or throw it in fridge for later. It pumps pretty quickly and is easy to travel with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This pump is terrible. It causes severe nipple pain. To the point that the next time I nurse my baby after using it my nipples still hurt, and that never happens otherwise. It also is not very effective. If I am not engorged it takes about 40 minutes of pumping to get 2 ounces. If I am engorged it takes about 20 minutes to get 2 to 3 ounces, but still does not empty my breasts. There have been times I have been engorged and still couldn't get anything. One time I pumped for about 45 minutes because I needed milk to take to the babysitter I only got 2 ounces, and it made one of my nipples bleed. Also the only bottles that will attach to it are the Avent bottles, and they do not support breatfeeding. I am switching to the Platex pump and nurser system, which do an exellent job of supporting breastfeeding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"I thought this pump would be the best pump for me, a part-time working mom, as I didn't need to get a huge amount of milk. It was good at first, but after about 3 months of using it, it's completely ineffective. The parts come undone during use sometimes, making a huge mess. I can't get my milk to let done now unless my baby is actually nursing while I'm using it. Was great at first, but not for the long haul, even for a casual pumper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first, but...","review":"I bought this, and tried it out straight out of the box, and it worked perfectly. Then I sterilized all of the parts and tried again, and there was no suction. I took it apart and put it back together, but still nothing. After sterilizing all the parts, the pump simply would NOT work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money for something more accurate","review":"I wanted this breastpump because I am a huge Avent customer. Unfortunatley, breast milk always got between the suction and the funnel (which enables the breastpump to pump). If you're going to spend money, then spend it on a more accurate pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"S-L-O-W.......","review":"If you're a mom on the go, this is not the pump for you. It took me about an hour or so just to get a few measly ounces out of this thing. Sometimes, it made it very painful to pump as well. Yes, it's portable and not as expensive of the electric pumps but if you want to get your pumping done fast, invest the money and get an electric pump instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Breast Pump for you.","review":"This is the first and only pump to use. Very simple and convenient to use... I use this pump at work and it's great. To bad Avent doesn't make an electric breast pump. You won't be sorry with this pump. This is my first baby she's 6 months and I'm still nursing her. I don't understand why others talk about the pump being fragile and breaking easily. It is very sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for sleeping baby","review":"I have been breastfeeding for 4 months and have the Medela electric and hand pump. I just bought the Avent Isis pump because I needed something easy and noise free. I am amazed at how much milk i am able to get in 10 minutes compared to the medela pumps but I do have to recommend to take the cushion off the pump. I found it to have no suction with it. Unfortunatly standard bottles do not fit the pump so if your child does not like the bottles you have to go threw double bottle cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great manual pump!","review":"This pump was recommened to me by a friend when I was still pregnant, so I decided to buy it and give it a try. I had a Gerber battery/electic pump before and was not too happy with it, and I was nervous about switching to a manual pump, but I'm glad I did! I can usually get at least 4 oz. out of each breast in about 20-30 mins. I agree with a previous reviewer about the neck of the pump cracking, but I emailed Avent and they sent me a new part in less than a week! Plus, the pump has the new one piece design which makes it much easier to clean! I love the wide necked bottles and the nipples are not confusing for my exclusively breastfed daughter. She's been using the Avent bottles and nipples since she was less than a week old and we've never had any nipple confusion. I would recommend this pump and this brand of products to anyone! Definately worth the $$!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good, if not better, then an electric pump","review":"I got the Isis Breast Pump based on a recommendation from a friend. I will admit, the first couple times trying to assemble it was difficult, but once you get the hang of it, there's no problem. Using it was pretty easy. I currently use it to pump the occasional bottle (several times per week) and I am extremely happy with it.I will be returning to work soon and purchased the medela pump in style electric pump. I got the electric pump because I will have to pump three times a day. I figured I would need the additional speed the electric pump is suppose to offer. I've used the medela pump in style electric pump several times now and I don't find it to be significantly more efficient. In fact, I feel like I have better control and better suction with the Isis Breast Pump.I would recommend the Isis Breast Pump over an electric pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly not for everyone...","review":"I bought this pump based on its reviews. Sadly, it takes about an hour to get 2 ounces out this way for me. The one thing I've learned with reviews of breast pumps is this - Because every woman is built differently, some pumps will work great for some and not so well for others. What I CAN tell you is this - If you are a fairly small breasted woman who must go back to work and pump while you are there, this may not be the pump for you.Other important notes:1. Fairly easy to use and put together. Reading the manual helps.2. Extended use will make your nipples sore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, not happy","review":"I bought this to have an alternative to the Pump In Style. I have found that it only works when my breasts are very full. Now that I have been breastfeeding for so long - my breasts are usually not full - and this just does not work. (...)it has cost me probably a dollar for each ounce I've managed to squeeze out of this thing. The few times I have been overly full - it works pretty well (but it does pinch a bit) - but otherwise it is a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this pump before deciding to make the commitment to an electric one. Well I am VERY disappointed. It has NO suction!I took it apart and re assembled 3-4 times each time and have tried using it over a course of 2 weeks now... and still no matter what I try NO SUCTION.I went and bought another one and returned the first thinking it was defective, but same thing, it pulls nothing from my breast and I can not even feel any pulling. I have ample milk supply and can easily express by hand.Save your time and money , do not buy this pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"The good:This pump is very good in function and practicality. you can take it to work and pump quietly. it does not need batteries or AC power.The cushion is VERY COMFORTABLE and it does stimulate the let-down reflex very quickly.You can pump directly into an Avent storage bottle or Avent baby bottle.The OK:The handle is average though - if you think of ergonomics.You have to lean forward quite a bit if you don't want the milk to accumulate in the neck and come back up in contact with your skin and contaminate your sterile milk.The Bad:I discovered that after a few uses, once you pump and the milk is flowing, the pump makes a goose/duck-like noise!! If you try pumping in the middle of the night while the little one sleeps, go to another room entirely!The little star valve is annoying when washing/boiling, because of its small size, you can easily lose it. This system provides an extra valve though.Otherwise, I have yet to find the perfect pump, but this one comes close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Be Frustrating","review":"After my Medela Harmony suddonly quit working, I was in a rush for a new pump and ended up getting the Avent Isis. At first I thought I had purchased a dud, but after a few minutes the pump grabbed on big time, and I was expressing milk faster than I ever had with the Harmony. I do find that this pump works better for me when I remove the rubber \\"petal\\" lining. And this pump can be squeeky. The most frustrating thing for me though is that after using it for a little over a month the little white disk would pop out of place, just when I would get a really strong suction going. Then I would have to stop and take the pump apart to get the disk back in position. Also, the wide bottles don't fit very well in the bottle compartment of my diaper bag, and my daughter is not use to the wide nipples. I use the Avent bottles to store milk, but I use the Medela bottles for feeding, which is kind of hassle compared to being able to pump directly into the feeding bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back Pain!","review":"I was very dissapointed with this product, in order to keep the milk from accumulating in the plastic petal I have to lean forward while pumping resulting in back pain. This is appartently due to the fact that I have \\"perky\\" breasts. It didn't say anywhere on the box that this product was a poor design unless your boobs sagged!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy anything from Isis from Babies R US !!!!","review":"I purchased this unit and discovered after opening the small seal, NO REFUND or RETURN. This unit was not suggest to be used for our situation and we needed a motorized unit. So I tried to return the unit at Babies R US, they read me the fine print on the stickers and told me to call ISIS. I have offered to accept exchange for other ISIS product without any sucess.After calling ISIS, they told me to talk to Babies R US. I call and emailed Toy R Us customer service many times and they told me to to call ISIS. What a bunch of no support and pass the buck service.In short, ISIS sales are final and if your not 100% sure you want to try this unit or it will work for your needs, DONT BUY IT!Don't be mislead think a smart consumer that you can return it if you not satisfied!I suggest not buying anyting from both companies now unless 100% necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medela is much better...","review":"When I was in the hospital, all the nurses there recommended getting the Medela breast pump...I'm glad I did because of all the complaints I've heard from others about the Avent pump and complaints I've read about the Avent pump.

It is gentle and effective! It is easy to assemble and clean after use. Each bottle comes with a top that can be used after pumping to secure and keep the milk fresh for use. Now that I have had my son I purchased this again and still feel that it is the best pump! I have tried some others, but I have found that the extra layer in the pump helps minimize nipple tenderness when starting the pumping process for new mothers. Those that offer only the cone shape with no insert hurt and stretched farther than it should be (for me anyway :D ).I love the Avent Manual Breast Pump, and won't use anything else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"painfull","review":"I love the Avent bottles but the pump did not work good for me.

The first one is the little round white piece falls off during pumping. The second one is my right wrist definitely gets quite tiring and sore after pumping 3-4 times a day and 30 minutes each time. My suggestion is if you are serious about pumping, it's worth the money to invest in an electrical one. I just ordered one from Avent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for a manual!","review":"I pump only on occasion and this has worked very well for me. It does the job in about 10-15 minutes.

After reading all these great reviews I wonder if I just got a bad one or something. No matter how slowly and conscientiously I put it together it leaks air. You can hear it leaking but it's also evident by the fact that no milk comes out. Extremely frustrating when I KNOW there's milk in there, I can see it wanting to come out but the suction just isn't there. I consider this pump money wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Hard to Find Replacements","review":"My husband brought me this pump and it took forever to use it the first time. I gave up after a week and brought an electric one. But I went back and it has worked really well. Now I love this pump.However, it is really difficult to find replacement parts. I wash the pump pretty often and some parts have cracked (it's all plastic parts anyway) from use and wash. I had to get the replacement parts from Avent directly, but they charge you an arm and leg for shipping. I finally went out and brought another one. I guess 2 pumps in 8 months is not so bad.Otherwise, it really works and is a great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars for Design, but None for Quality","review":"This really is a great pump! It works very fast and easily, with no pain. However, the pieces that connect the bottle to the pump handle break easily after just a month or so of use. The plastic is brittle and that area takes a lot of stress. I have now broken two pumps. You can't imagine the frustration I felt when I struggled to pump a bottle for my screaming son, and the bottle spilled all over the rug as it snapped off (twice).I would highly recommend this to someone who doesn't plan on breastfeeding long, but would like something for emergencies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be in other reviews","review":"I bought the Isis pump based on the positive feedback that others gave on this website.

It is more comfortable than the electric pumps, but definitely not as efficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly Disappointing and Frustrating","review":"I am deeply disappointed with this pump. It squeaks, the pieces come apart when I'm trying to use it, I barely get any suction...pumping two ounces is an ordeal with this pump.

This hand pump is not worth the money. The rubber filter keeps popping out when there is a lot of suction. Maybe the women who liked this pump had smaller nipples than I do. Every time I have used this the rubber pops out. To put it back in you have to completely unscrew the cap and put your fingers in. A bad design and not at all sterile. Do not waste your money. I complained to avent and although they had good customer service and sent me out a new pump, it did exactly the same thing. It is the product itself that is defective"},{"rating":"1","title":"$45.00 worth of non-returnable nothing","review":"The day my son was born I needed to help stimulate my breast so I tried to use my pump. Let me say that I was excited to try this product thinking that it was going to be useful. I read the reviews and thought this would be very good to start off with. It does nothing. Sorry to say but I don't know how people can give this product any rating because I paid $45.00 for a product that is non-returnable. See what happens when you try to saw money........So please if you want to pump buy a good electric one. It will run about $100.00 but at least you know it will be worth it.

Thee were times when I got so frustrated from having to stop, disassemble and reassemble that I'd just give up. Maybe I did something wrong but when I called the company for help they weren't much help at all. Finally went out and bought the especially for baby electronic pump which is also about the same price and Im now a happy pumper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"I got this pump when I was still pregnant, I didn't think that I would be doing a lot of pumping since I am a stay at home mom.

Then the last time I tried using it, it was competely broken, no suction what-so-ever. I was really mad, because I spent a lot of money for something that I never really used, and couldn't take back. It was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!","review":"I was very thorough in my research before purchasing this item, and was convinced it was the perfect one.

I called Avent and they sent me a replacement part at no charge. I have been pumping since my son was about 5 weeks so he could have my milk as I have returned back to work, so I was a little upset when the part broke because I didnt want to spend money to buy a new one, but Avent was great about it. This pump is so great, I can pump up to 2 full 4oz. bottles in about 15 minutes. I also like the fact that \\"let down\\" occurs so fast. I can even nurse and pump at the same time.

After spending 45 minutes trying to get this to work, and then another 20 minutes on the phone with Avent, they tried to tell me that it wasn't working because it hadn't been sterilized withy vinegar so wasn't fitting properly.

I'll keep the avent as an emergency backup, but really, I wish I could just toss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a double electric","review":"I have a Medela pump in style advanced, and the avent isis. I bought additional flanges for the medela, hoping a larger flange would work better. The Avent Isis works better for me, and is a lot easier to carry around if you have to go somewhere to pump. Breast pumps never get all my milk out, but with this pump I was able to get a double let down several times. That never happened with the medela. This pump lets you be more in control because you can express with one hand while pumping with the other. I highly recommend this pump. I only paid $28 for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pump on earth!","review":"This pump is so amazingly efficient and it's great that you just pump right into the bottles! It is also sooo quiet! I have very fast MER and it is recommended that I pump before I actually feed my son. With this pump, I can feel the engorgement at night before he wakes up, pump right there in the room even though we cosleep and stop as soon he stirs to be fed. I used to use my double electric for that and would have to go in another room. Then I would miss my son's cues to be fed, and my poor husband would be awoke and need to find me, then I need to get myself untangled from the handsfree pumping bra and all the tubes and etc, all the while my son is screaming bloody murder!

I was hoping that it would allow my husband enjoy feeding our baby as well as make my transition back to work easier while being economical.This was not the case. I would have to pump for at least an hour to actually accumulate five - six ounces. Milk would gather under the pads which was very frustrating considering that i wanted everything to count at that point. Pumping at work with it was next to impossible because it would leak on my clothes while pumping.We ended up buying the Medela anyway and had a very different experience. It was fast, easy and clean. Even though the Medela pump is MUCH more expensive, it is DEFINITELY worth the money for the frustration you will save."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"I am currently nursing my third child & my beloved medela pump broke last week, so I bought this one. I have several friends who like this pump & I had read positive reviews, so felt quite confident buying it. I chose not to buy another medela as I don't plan to have any more children & this one is almost half the price. It has taken me a week to really get used to it & I have found it to be really very effective. I think I actually get more milk from this pump. I work part-time & as I don't need to plug it in, it's easier for me to find a place to pump. I also love the bottles that come with it-all my children have taken the medela bottles better than any other type. On the downside, it does wear a bit on your wrists, so I guess it's best if you only need to pump occasionally. So, all in all, a great pump for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to use","review":"It is very difficult to keep suction with this pump, leading to lots of wasted time and frustration. It can be useful for when you can't use an electric for emergency expression. For regular use, I recommend an electric pump. I'm using a hospital one now and I've never lost the suction."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY!","review":"While I had many problems breastfeeding at first, after my milk came in this pump has been wonderful. I find it very easy to use, and after I am done pumping I can easily store the milk. It is easy to wash as long as you make sure you have read the instruction booklet. The only thing I did not like was the plastic cover, so I just do not use it and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I registered for this pump because I planned to only pump on rare occasions, so I thought it would be silly to spend the money for an electric pump... Big Mistake. This manual pump takes much longer to assemble, has more parts to clean and reassemble, and pumps significantly less milk than the Medela DoubleEase I replaced it with. Granted, there is a big difference in price, but when you're only getting 2 hours sleep at a time, the laundry is piling up, you haven't had time to go to the store or prepare dinner, and you haven't even had the energy to bathe yourself (welcome to motherhood), it seems worth the extra money to me to have a pump I can assemble in less than 10 seconds, get 4 oz. of milk in 5 minutes, and still have one arm free to hold baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enough for me","review":"I bought this pump because I read all of the great reviews but I have to admit that it didn't work as well for me. I originally rented a hospital pump, which worked great but I decided to save the money and invest in my own pump. I could not get as much milk out with this pump. Also, it took much longer having to do one side at a time. I would suggest renting a pump or if you plan to nurse for more than 6 months it would be worth your money to buy the more expensive electric ones. Unfortunalty, I had too much trouble breastfeeding to continue. My baby is doing excellent on formula but for those of you nursing...keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 uses","review":"I love how comfortable and effective this pump is, but the quality of the plastic is really bad. I'd read the reviews here and knew that they sometimes break, so I was especially ginger with mine. But despite my care, to my horror I saw cracks developing in the threaded part of the horn after only the 3rd use. It's really broken now and I have to sort of hold it together while pumping- not easy! I've only used it about a dozen times. I emailed the company and was promised a replacement part a month ago, but it hasn't arrived-I 'm awaiting a response to my second email. A big disappointment, especially since it works so well- but I don't want to shell out the bucks for another pump that will break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pump!","review":"I breastfed my first daughter for 9 months and used this pump religiously. I was crazy enough in the beginning to rent one of the electric ones thinking it would be even faster and more effiecient, but I was mistaken. My letdown with the Avent was so quick and the fact it was a manual pump allowed me to control the speed and pressure at which I pumped my milk. I could easily pump an 8oz bottle in no time flat. I am now pregnant with my second and will do it all over again with a new Avent pump. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best on the market","review":"I have used the Isis with both of my children and it has been a godsend. It has helped me with my milk production and being able to freeze and store. I have no complaints about it. It's easy to operate and doesn't make my nipples sore. I'd reccomend it to any breastfeeding woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working Mother","review":"I recently purchased this pump after using the Evenflo Electric Pump for about 2 months. What a difference a pump makes. I was ready to give up nursing my daughter until I started using this pump. This pump is easy to assemble and easy to clean. I can pump 2--4 ounce bottles in approximately 15 minutes. The pump does not hurt at all and seems gentle on my breasts. The Evenflo pump was hurting my nipples constantly. I use the pump 3 to 4 times a day and I have not had any problems with it. I recommend this pump over any electric pump--it is easier to use and the results are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me!","review":"I had an Isis pump with my first child and could not get it to work well. With my second child, I though I'd try the newly designed Isis and had the same problems. I could not get it to fit properly and could never get the right suction. Since you cannot return breast pumps, I was wary of trying another manual pump. I only need to pump occasionally and do not need an electric. I just got the Medela Harmony pump and from just one pumping session, I got more milk than I ever got with the Isis. I was very upset that I didn't get the results that so many reviewers raved about with the Isis. As a first time mom, I thought the problem was with me. Since my children were gaining sufficient weight, the problem was with the pumping process, not with my supply. If the Avent doesn't work for you, either try another pump or consult a lactation specialist. It may save you a few anxious moments!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Duck Bill Valves! Not bad, for once or twice pumping per day","review":"It is a very cost-effective manual pump if you only need to pump no more than three times per day.The only problem I had with this one is that you need to replace the star valve every two months(given you're occational pumper). When the valves ran out(there're 4 coming with the order), I called the customer service to purchase more. The rep told me that there were another valves available that are called \\"Duck bill valves\\". So I ordered 6 for $6.00 at Amazon.I have used the Duck Bill valve for three months, and it is still working pretty well. So I strongly suggest that you should have Duck Bill Valves stored if you purchase this mantual pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I bought this pump because it was recommended by a lactation consultant. I thought it would be the only pump I would need, but it didn't work! I found this out at the worst possible time - the third day after giving birth when my milk came in. I was completely engorged and my daughter was not able to latch on. I tried this pump and it would not maintain suction! I didn't have another pump handy and had to express milk by hand (very painful at the time) just so my daughter could latch on. I have retried it several times using all the tips in the instruction manual and it never expressed any milk for me! I was very disappointed with this pump and not able to return it. A waste of money at a time when there was not much to spare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hassle","review":"Although I'm a big fan of the Avent products, I didn't really care for this one much. First off, while pumping (since you're the one controling it) you can actually feel the pressure. I'd much rather prefer an electric pump where you're not the one controling your own pain). Second of all, the milk kept interfering with the suction. It would go under the rubber that keeps the pressure on your breast therefore losing the suction. So much of a hassle. GET THE ELECTRIC PUMPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Invest in a electric pump","review":"Borrow, rent or buy an electric pump! I found the Isis pump very time consuming and ineffective. It has a rubber seal that fits into the bell of the pump and is supposed to create a secure fit to your breast. Milk would get inbetween the rubber part and the pump creating poor suction. It used to take me 30 minutes or more just to pump a few oz. w/ this pump. Then I purchased a electric pump and I can extract the same amount in under 10 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pain!","review":"I had to get an electric pump after attempting to use a manual one. I got the Isis Avent because I trust the brand so much. It was awkward to use and just too much work for so little breastmilk. Electric pumps are expensive but you can get them used on e-bay, garage sales, consignment, or Craigslist for cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pump Will Break","review":"This pump works wonderfully, but it is very fragile & will break after use. It is not reinforced where you screw the pump onto the bottle & I had 2 break on me before I taught myself how to self-pump. I couldn't continue to go drop $40 bucks on these. So, just beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I originally wanted this pump over an electric because I loved all the reviews I read and it was economical for me to purchase. As soon as I got this pump I realized that it wouldn't express any milk for me. After reading the instructions I read that not everyone can have the petal on the pump. I had to remove the soft part of the pump and the cup without it hurts. The pump itself is very squeaky and embarassing to use in public. I still have the pump because I can't return it now but have received the Medela Pump in Style Advance as a gift. Since my baby will not nurse this pump is more for me. I encourage anyone to try the Avent pump because if the petals work with you then it's very comfortable but this pump is definitely NOT for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neck of Funnel Piece Cracked, Twice!!","review":"I purchased my first pump right before my daughter was born. It worked great for the first six weeks. I would pump 4 to 6 ounces in about 5 minutes. I noticed my pump was losing suction. I took my pump apart and realized the neck to the funnel piece was cracked. I then purchased a second pump. I had it for two weeks, and the same problem, an identical crack in the same place as my first pump. My second pump still works, however it's not as effective as it was when I first purachased it. I have tried to call Avent, after being on hold for several minutes I hung up in frustration. I just purchased a medela pump in style today. I have heard great things about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked twice","review":"This pump worked really well the first two times I used it. I washed it, and then couldn't express any milk. It was very frustrating. Also--others have mentioned that their pumps came with extra parts. My pump didn't come with anything--even directions on how to put it together. The lactation consultant had to help me put it together. I'm disappointed with this pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pump isn't all it's cracked up to be.","review":"This pump advertises that it's design stimulates let-down, and that is not the case. This pump will pull and tug at your nipple just as much as the next one, and because it's clear, you can see how much of your PRECIOUS breastmilk has been lost and stuck in the mechanical aspects of the pump. You'd have more volume and less pain if you hand-express."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Pump is an Ergonomic Hazard","review":"I bought this pump based on the good reviews I read here - however once I got it and used it I realized how hard it was. I would spend 45 minutes pumping just to get a total of 2 ounces at best! My hand hurt from all the pumping action and my back hurt from bending over to get the milk to flow into the bottle. I have since bought a Medela Pump in Style and I can get 4-5 ounces in 10 minutes with no pain. In retrospect I would have bought an electric pump to begin with - this one was too much work for not much milk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucks but it won't let go!","review":"I've heard so many rave reviews that when I lost my Purely Yours, I got this one (my son was not nursing so often by then). I was disappointed. My hand hurt from having to squeeze the pump. I guess I should expect that, given that it's a handheld manual pump. Well, I didn't think it would be that tiring. Both my hands were tied up when pumping both sides. The suction was too much. It would release, so I had to let air in every so often so my nipples wouldn't get sucked into the bottle! Well, it wasn't that bad, but it really wouldn't release. The output wasn't what I'd like, either. Maybe I'm just used to the electric variety. This pump would be okay for light pumping but not for working moms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great at first.....","review":"I loved this pump when I first bought it about 6 months ago. I do use an electric pump almost everyday at work, but needed something at home and didn't want to shell out $200 on another electric or tote the electric back and forth. This was perfect and easy to use, at first.Now, when I use it, I get about 10 pumps and the little white part that is necessary for creating pressure pops and I have to completely re-install the pieces, while my breasts are leaking. I used to get the equivalent amount of milk my electric pump produced, now I get less than half. I've tried alternating the way I pump (3 pumps, release off the breast, repeat AND 2 pumps, release, repeat AND 1/2 pump for 3 pumps, release, repeat AND others), but the white piece still pops.I haven't contacted Avent yet, but will the next time I get 10 minutes to spare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I purchase this? :)","review":"First off, its not cheap, its manual, it just happens to have a good price attached to it. having control on how fast the milk pumps out is great, generally every woman is different, but this one is having a high success rate, you can be pretty fairly sure it will work for you. Some people neither work, electric or manual, some people only this work, or a certain brand, its just how your body works, buying one for 50.00 bucks to find out its not working must feel better then buying for 300.00. I purchased it for my wife after my son was ripping her nipple off with his super grip, she did not want to spend money since her friends had a low success rate which prompt me to do some research, I found this, took a chance, if it failed well I looked at it this way, it's 50.00 bucks and its not a complete lose, we tried other alternatives to save her nipple without spending too much money and we got a bottle out of it. Luckily it worked for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good","review":"I'm using the Isis pump again for baby #2. I'm a stay-at-home mom so I don't use it too much. I purchased it with my first baby to help relieve the engorgement I had as my milk came in. It's definitely not as fast as an electric pump but it's small and convenient for those on-the-go. It takes some practice to get out more milk, which can be done by changing the position of the pump every so often. (This is not easy to do if you use an electric pump.) When I was engorged with my second baby I spent almost an hour trying to unplug blocked milk ducts, which can be really painful. Using a combination of massaging and angling the pump I was able to pump alot of milk. Another tip when pumping on one breast is to wear an Avent shell on the other breast so that when that breast automatically starts to let down, the milk is not wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for use AFTER milk supply has been established","review":"The first few weeks of breastfeeding were pretty rough for me. I was convinced that I was starving my baby and unable to get much milk when using this pump. Fortunately I visited a lactation consultant and rented an electric pump for a week. It was amazing how quickly my milk production stabilized after using the electric for awhile. I immediately bought a Medela Pump in Style. The manual pump is good for occasional use now that I've been nursing for the past four months but if you are having problems in the beginning with breastfeeding either rent a hospital pump or get a Medela before thinking about giving up nursing. Don't base your decision on this manual pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I have found this pump to be very frustrating. It will loose the suction if you move the least bit and let down, for me, was practically impossible. Stick with the Medela rental or purchase your own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FB","review":"I thought this would be great when I traveled instead of bringing my electric pump. Boy, was I wrong. Even if you don't intend on pumping that often, I think this was a waste of energy and time. Although electric pumps are expensive, they are more convenient and less stressful on the mother. If you value your time, pass up on the manual pump and get an electrical one. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"My baby was not latching and I had to use a pump. So, after renting the one from the hospital initially, I decided to get one for myself. Lactation consultants suggested this pump. I got it and even after pumping the whole day, I could get only 10cc! It pains a lot too. The only good thing is that you get 2 Avent bottles. Never go for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very painful","review":"I didn't want to spend a lot of money since I had heard stories about women who have had trouble nursing.

Until it just broke on me!I was just in the middle of pumping - which by the way - I had been pumping for nearly an hour and had almost 4 oz...when the neck of the pump SNAPPED RIGHT IN HALF!!! And i dont been lengthwise. I mean snapped in half as in snapped right off!!! Now I have to dump all of that milk because there is plastice bits in it! :(I rely in pumping to feed my child cuz of many problems- and now Im at a loss...Money is WAY TOO TIGHT to buy another one which is what I have to do now- but you better believe I'm not buying this one again! :("},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works","review":"I have nursed three children and have tried several breast pumps. This is the best pump around for several reasons. It is easy to assemble even with a baby in one arm and a toddler tugging at your leg (good for all of the multitaskers out there). It is small and not too difficult to travel with. It is contoured in a way that makes manual pumping easy on your hand. It helps produce the fastest \\"let-down\\" response of ANY other pump I have tried including electric ones. It also produces a great quantity of milk in a short period of time. The main thing is it really works and you don't have to break the bank. The only negative thing I can say is it has one very small part that is easily lost (the pump comes with extras). Every mother is different, but since you are likely to try a few pumps before finding the right one for you, I truly think this pump is worth trying first (it may very likely be the only one you need)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please invest in a better pump, this one is a waste of money","review":"I purchased this pump after reading all of the positive reviews. I also figured I would barely ever use it and just had it for a back up. I had such a hard time a first breast feeding, that I figured I would just pump and give my daughter a bottle. This was a better option for me than giving her formula. I almost gave up all together because of this pump. the massaging mechanism causes the pump to loose suction, so I removed that and now the white valve pops out in the middle of pumping. It has just been the biggest headache for me. I fianlly gave up and went out a bought a $300 electric pump and love it. I wish I would of just saved the $50 and bought the electric one from the begining. PLEASE DO ALOT OF RESEARCH BEFORE BUYING A BREAST PUMP. IT WILL MAKE BREAST FEEDING MORE ENJOYABLE THAN A HEADACHE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the Working Mom!!","review":"This breast pump is terrific!! It's one of two that I am now using since I have been back to work. I have been using the Medela Pump In Style for the past 3 months with my son..and now since I don't want to carry the large case I have decided to use this one on a daily basis while at work. It's totally the best thing. I can get out 8-10 oz. in about 10 mins with no problem. This pump is made well and easy to sterilize. For a manual pump it really does a good job at expressing breast milk quickly. I have really enjoyed breastfeeding and don't want to give it up and this product enables you to pump anywhere at anytime. I find that this pump works much better than the low grade electric or battery operated low grade pumps. I have owned three breast pumps so far and this one is my most preferred product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A LIFESAVER!","review":"I had registered for this pump thinking I would only use it on occasion, primarily breastfeeding, since I am a stay at home mom. My daughter had so much trouble latching on, that once we were home from the hospital, breastfeeding was a nightmare. I started pumping milk to feed her and found it to be so easy that I stopped trying to get her on the breast, and now pump exclusively. I thought that I'd need to buy one of those expensive electric pumps to keep up with her, but I can pump both breasts in 15 minutes with this pump. A must have."},{"rating":"1","title":"It actually HURTS","review":"I tried to use this pump when my daughter was ~4 weeks old and it HURT so much that I wanted to cry. Also, it took me 30 minutes to pump ALMOST 2 ounces. At that point, I thought that pumping was just not for me. A few weeks later we bought the Medela Pump in Style and it worked GREAT (I got 6 ounces in 5 minutes) and did not hurt at all! Yes - it is much more expensive, but totally worth it. After using the Medela for a few weeks, I tried this pump again and it still hurt and barely pumped anything. I agree that the suction is just not right. While I do love all of the other products I have from Avent - I really feel that this pump was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"I used it for my 1st and 2nd babies and I thought it worked pretty well, until I had my third baby and I was given a Medela breast pump in the hospital.

But I have had the same problem that others have reported; the little membrane/valve thing keeps popping off, thus causing the pump to lose all suction. I have to stop pumping and fish the thing out every 2-3 minutes. I can get just as much milk with this pump as I can with my Medela Pump in Style Advanced, but I don't like having to stop and unscrew it every few minutes. And according to the reviews, I am not the only one with this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible pump!","review":"I bought this pump thinking it looked easy to use and convenient. It was annoying to hold and pump, it hurt, I got cramps in my hands before I could get a drop of milk out and when I finally did - it leaked incessantly.

I bought a Medela instead and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst product ever","review":"This thing doesn't work. I've breastfed for 8 months, and used the fabulous Medela at work, but I leave it there because it's too heavy to lug back and forth.

A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very frustrating","review":"I have found this pump very frustrating! When I try to use it, I end up having to take it apart about 20 times trying to pump 4 ounces.

This is driving me insane."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the expensive electric pumps!!!!","review":"I bought this pump and then the Medela Pump in Style because everyone convinced me that I needed an electric pump to go back to work. Well, they were wrong! This handy manual pump is much better at expressing milk at your own pace. I can hold and release pressure while pumping depending on milk flow instead of constant same pressure from the electric pump. THis Isis pump produces so much more milk from me and I can even walk around or sit in a hidden nook at work with it. I have even held my son while pumping and walked around the house. Easy to use and clean and helps keep the milk coming for us working moms!! I don't even use the Pump in Style anymore, what a waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MY MONEY","review":"After reading so many fabulous reviews, I was suprised I couldn't pump one drop with my isis pump.

The reviews actually help me buy this product and also my husband. My husband convince me to spend the extra cash and get the Isis Pump. I have to say it is a great product, very comfortable and dependable. I do not have to pump much, just a squeeze from my fingertips and the milk express quickly. I love the comfort of the pump; With my first child, I had a very hard time pumping when I went back to work. My arms will get tired and will express very little. Within minutes, the Isis Pump expresses at least 4 oz easily. The product is easy to assemble and clean. Storage bottle are great and can be used immediately with nipples provided. I will definitley suggest to buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pump, better than machine IMO","review":"I bought this pump when I decided to stay home full-time with my son. I was going to go back to work part-time and buy an expensive Madela, but then we decided I'd stay home, so I bought this pump on recommendation by friends and my doula. Since my son was in NICU for his first week, I rented a hospital grade Madela and it was TORTURE. The cups were uncomfortable and the suction was never right...either too light or too strong. I was intimidated by a hand pump because I was worried about my hand getting sore, but this pump is quite comfortable.As far as the neck cracking goes -- I've experienced this too. This happened to me by twisting the neck on too tight. But if you go to the Avent site, you can order individual parts. Another part I have trouble with are the little tiny white valves...when rinsing parts that thing jumps right out of my hand. I've learned to cover the drain. And those two parts is why I do not give this great pump 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this pump","review":"1st of all very portable, easy to use, and great low price. I currently expecting my 2nd child and was thinking of getting an electric pump, but after reading the reviews and the time it takes to express milk; I thought to myself why waste money if it's going to take the same amount of time.I was in the hosptital last year for a few days, in order to keep my milk supply, they gave me a Medela pump and let me used their (rental unit) Lactina. It works fine but cleaning the tubes and getting it set up is a hassle. I will consider renting it if I have low milk supply problem but I would not spend the money on the Medela pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large Breast, Large Nipples","review":"I bought the ISIS as a supplement to my MEDELA PUMP IN STYLE. I also bought it based on the reviews I read. It sounded great to have a pump that I did not have to hook up to and I could use anywhere in the house and I could move about as I pumped - if need be. Indeed it has an incredible latch down flow of milk. I was surprised how much milk came out and it was FAST! However, my nipples were so red and painful throughout the process and afterwards that I suspect my breast and my nipples were too large for the diaphragm.So I give it 5 stars for CONVENIENCE; 5 Stars for the 5 petal shaped massagers that produce milk faster and more naturally than any other pump: but 2 stars for comfort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for occasional use","review":"I love Avent products!! This pump is awesome. Easy to use and to put together. Even my 13 year old has no problem with assembly. I use it on one breast while nursing on the other.

Highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im very frustrated with this pump","review":"I got this pump as a gift and have pumped with it for 6months. One of the attachment pieces broke in three months and was easily replaced, but just a couple of days ago the neck broke on the pump. I was devastated. Since I couldnt afford a new pump right away, I have had to resort to pumping by hand. This method was very inefficient and I could not make enough milk to sustain my baby while Im at work. I actually had to take off of work until I could get a new pump. Now I worry that my breast may not make enough milk for pumping since I havent pumped in a couple of days. Another problem I have with this pump is it takes forever to pump out a sufficient bottle. I think I am going to try an electric pump because in the end it will probably be worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's slow and noisy","review":"I have been breast feeding/pumping for 5 1/2 months and was using a double, electric pump. I bought the Isis because of the small size for traveling and because of the good reviews it got.My advice for someone looking to buy it for travel - don't do it. It takes 45+ minutes to express from both sides because it's so slow. The silicone insert is extremely 'squeaky' and extremely annoying. I also felt like I was going to get carpal tunnel in my hands from the pumping action.I also had a very difficult time getting the suction quite right. I wanted to cry when I used it the first couple of times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for pumping on the go","review":"I used both this pump and the Medela PIS while I was breastfeeding. What I liked better about this pump than my electric was its portability, how easy it was to clean, and its quick letdown. I would put this in my purse and liked having it available in case I couldn't nurse my daughter, or for when I had a business meeting and would need to pump. It really came in handy on our first airplane trip-- my daughter refused to nurse, and we didn't carry formula with us. I was able to pump her a bottle and feed her while we were in the air, making everyone happy. :) The PIS needs to be handwashed and sterilized, but you can put the Avent pump in the dishwasher, which made things much easier. The only downside to this pump is having to manually pump it, and the creaking sound mine made as I pumped. But, I would definitely recommend it, especially if you don't have alot of money to spend on an electric."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was the worst pump I ever bought","review":"I got home from the hospital and repeatedly tried to get my pump to work but no matter what I did, it would not work correctly. The pump action was so low, it would have taken me forever and a day to fill a bottle. Instead, I preferred to purchase the Medela Electric Doubleease pump. That has been the best pump for me and is well worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dO NOT recommend AT ALL, spend money but electrical","review":"I don't know who wrote the other nice review, probably someone who works selling this product but believe me, it is not good at all.yes it is small and compact and the pressure is just as good as an electrical one BUT, there is a white small piece that keeps pupping out of its place. While i am pumping, i have to stop, disesemble the whole thing and put that white piece back into its place. During one pumping, i had to stop at least 4 times. one pumping took over 20 minutes. It was frusterating. I called the 1-800 number and they said they will send me another new design of that white piece but it was 2 weeks before i got it and i gave up pumping. Caused me a lot of head ache. Trust me, it is worth it spend $150 and get something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"Bought this with the plan to occassionaly pump so husband could feed. I'd heard great things about Advent. Can't get anything out with it! Went and bought an electronic which was worth paying more for. Would not recommend this pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD pumping and it BROKE!","review":"I recently bought this and had problems from the start. I was told it was a great pump but I beg to differ. It wouldn't pump well first off and I had to constantly readjust it on my breast. It is hard to do anything else because you have to concentrate on pumping. Many people will tell you it's a good pump but if you plan on getting a decent amount of milk out, it isn't in my opinion. It takes entirely too long as well. One session can easily last an hour, on one breast! And to top it all off, it broke last night on me! Go with an electric pump. You'll have to pay more, but since you can't return pumps, you'll be safe with the best instead of wasting money with manual pumps first, like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worse breast pump ever","review":"I tried this breast pump for a month and all i could get out of it was sore nipples and 1/2 oz after an hour of pumping.

DO NOT BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks too easily","review":"I recieved this pump as a shower gift. After ONE use the bottle attachment part cracked. Since I had to pump a bottle, my husband went & bought another one. After having it only a few weeks, and only a couple of uses, that one too cracked. Now I am stuck with 2 pumps that dont work and am out a lot of money. I at least like the bottles but [$$] for 2 bottles and a paperweight is a little pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get it to \\"latch\\"","review":"I got this pump because of the reviews, and i hated it. I had plenty of milk, so that was not the issue. I couldn't get it to latch on to relieve me of engorgement, let alone pump milk to store. I really don't need to pump, so i was told i should get the manual pump. I find it's best to get the electric pumps, like \\"pump in style\\" by medela. Because I don't pump much at all, i don't want to waste time. If you need to pump often, don't even consider a manual! The medela is so fast and effiecient. i can do both breasts at once to go even faster. 10 minutes is all i need! it's worth the money, especially if you will have other kids. Don't bother with the avent pump!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome pump","review":"This pump is truly amazing. It is so quiet and you can express a lot of milk in a short time. It is hard to believe just by looking at it, but it really does work. I did have a problem with the neck breaking as well, BUT Avent sent me a new one right away. It actually arrived the day after I called. I would hightly recommend this pump if you want to occasionally give your baby expressed milk. It is not for heavy duty use. I"},{"rating":"2","title":"WORTH EVERY PENNY!","review":"I recently purchased a dual electrc pump. It took 45+ minutes to get 4 oz (total). This was very frustrating!! I went out this morning and purchased the Isis and had 6 oz in less than 15 minutes. I was happy & so was my daughter. I find that I'm able to pump more milk than previously which is also a plus as I can freeze half and feed the other half.I've tried other manual pumps (and they worked better than the electric pump I purchased) but really pulled at the nipple and left it extremely sore. I have no pain with the Isis!Cleaning is a breeze! Take it apart, wash it and re-use. I wash it after each use with soap & warm water and put it in the dishwasher to sterilize each night (the small pieces I put into a plastic bin that you use for nipples, pacifiers, etc).It's very easy to use, very comfortable, and comes with extra parts (which is a plus being as the other manual pump I had the o-ring wore out and couldn't be replaced).Buy it! Use it! You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and quick for cheap $$$","review":"I love this pump. My sister recomended a more expensive one, but I read so many good reviews of this one, and since I only need to pump a few times a week at most, I bought this one. The only difficulty I've had is putting it back togeather after washing it. It goes together well enough, but it doesn't seem to work strait off. I always have to re-tighten or loosen a part to make it work again. Otherwise, for the price its wonderful. Very quiet and efficient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Milk","review":"I am a breastfeeding mother. I will soon be going back to work part time and I needed to express my milk. I rented a hospital grade pump and never got alot. With the Avent pump I am able to pump 5-6 oz in under 10 mins.It's easy to clean and easy to transport. I like that the parts are dishwasher safe and I like the let-down cushion.This is a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got extra money?","review":"Although very impressed in the beginning with this product, I was very unhappy when the pump broke less than three weeks after I started using it. However, I bought another one since it was still cheaper than the Medela and I had been able to pump eight ounces in about 20 minutes. I tried to be very careful the next time around, but the second time was not the charm and the same part broke yet again. I e-mailed the company, as I read from others who had the same problem that they received great help in getting replacement parts sent to them so quickly. It has been four business days and no response, so second e-mail was sent. If you have the money to keep buying pumps when one breaks, this is the one for you- otherwise you might want to save yourself time and headache and go for the electric"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump","review":"After attempting to use a different pump and not having any luck, I decided to try again with this one. What a pleasant surprise! It is easy to assemble and even easier to use. The massaging action gets the milk flowing quickly which is great. In no time at all I was pumping 2-4 oz. while my baby slept. I have not needed to, but I'm sure it would be easy to use at work as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I had someone buy this for me as a baby shower gift. In the first few days of trying to pump...i was unsuccessful. The pump was annoying...it squeaked and after about an hour of pumping, my hand was tired and had only about an ounce in the container. I then bought a first years electric pump and had 8 ounces in the container after 15 minutes of pumping. Not the best product and now i can't return it because it's been used. Worthless in my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work well for me","review":"I bought this pump after reading glowing reviews. I had been using a pump-in-style (my son was premature so I needed the big guns) once he was older I thought I could go to a manual pump it seemed like it would be easier to use for a quick pump before I left him home with dad for a few hours. I really gave it a long trial- two months but really did not find that I could get more than a few ounces out at a time. It was uncomfortable on my breats even pinched and rubbed a blister once. Finally I just gave up on pumping all together. If you are lucky enough to have an electric double pump don't think the grass is greener elsewhere. It wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Before You Buy This Pump Please Read","review":"I purchased this pump because of the great result I had with the bottles. The pump was very disappointing. The suction is not strong enough and you can barely get anything out. I bought The first years pump and it is excellent! I would skip this product all together, it's a big waste of money!! The best years pump cost a few more dollars but it is well worth it. Avents other products are great but this pump is no good, it's a new low for the company that's very heart breaking to me I consider myself to be a loyal avent customer. I couldn't even find any phone numbers or anyway to contact them on their website regarding this product. I am truly displeased I ever spent a penny on this pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like It","review":"I tried to use this pump for a few weeks and had an extremely hard time expressing milk with it. I had plenty of milk but this just didn't pump it out for me. I had to lean over so far to get the proper suction fit that my back was constantly hurting. ... the Isis was a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare Pump","review":"I bought the Isis pump because it was recommended to me by the breast feeding specialist at the hospital. My daughter is now 4 months old and my 3rd Isis pump has just cracked and broken. That is 3 pumps in 4 months. The first time it happened, the cracking at the base where the pump and bottle meet, I thought it was our fault. I thought I had maybe dropped it without really realizing it, in all the baby chaos. No, it was not my fault. I treat the pumps very gently, do not even put them in the dishwasher. They all crack and break in the same places. It is a nightmare, because we cannot afford the more expensive pumps, and before the pumps break, they do work very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"I tried this pump when we had a power failure. I have a premie and getting breastmilk is crutial for her growth. This pump was of no help at all. It took 20 minutes per side to get a fraction of the milk. I was still full and used my medela pump to alliviate the engorgement that resulted. I decided to invest in the car adaptor as a backup to the Isis. Save youe money and invest in a better brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I purchased this pump to pump in the middle of the night while I use the electric (Medela Pump in Style) at work. The electric pump was too bulky to have to take home every night, so I bought this pump as a portable pump. First of all, it takes FOREVER to pump, and is 10x more uncomfortable than the electric pump. It took me over 40 minutes to pump 2-3 oz, whereas I can pump 6 oz. in 10 minutes with the electric pump. I called Avent, and they were absolutely no help whatsoever. They jut said that it was my fault and I must be using it wrong because everyone else has no problem. Be careful before you waste $50, because if it doesn't work for you, there is nothing they will do for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"I guess I should not have tried to save on something as important as a breast pump. This model is really not worth your money. It does a poor job and will be completely useless if you are engorged (which defeats the purpose of the pump to begin with). Besides, the pump is really slow and proved to be useless and unreliable. I understand that this pump was not meant for daily use, however I had to pitch it before I went back to work since it would simply not work for the most basic needs.In addition, as pointed out by my lactation consultation, manual pumps usually lack comfort and durability (this one is no exeption). Trust me, if you are serious about breast feeding, you will need to invest in a REAL pump such as the ones offered by Medela or Lansinoh instead of wasting your time and money on a manual pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate It Hate It Hate It","review":"I have a terrific milk supply and can pump out 5oz in 10 minutes with an electric pump. With this pump I can pump out 1 oz in maybe 15 minutes. I have to concentrate to \\"let down\\" which I don't have to do with other breast pumps or when baby nurses. I find it difficult to maintain suction with this pump, also a problem I've never had before. I couldn't dislike this pump any more if you paid me to. Congratulations to everyone who uses this pump successfully and loves it. It didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but quiet!!!!","review":"I decided to go with this pump since all of my feeding products where Avent as well. I found it to be easier for me to pump than to nurse, because my little one got tired of suckling. She drank more with more ease from the bottle. After a long battle with this noisy little pump, I've slowly but surely begun to produce less and less milk. I've contacted the company on several occasions regarding the pump and they've been more than helpful. They even sent me a new pump, which was great except it squeaked just as loud as the old one did!!! So I've decided to give up on breastfeeding because of the sour experience with this little pump. I wish I had never spent the money on this!!! I give the company and their customer service 5 stars, but 1 for this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful, Until It Fell Apart","review":"I have been using this pump since I came back to work 6 weeks ago. I use it 2-3 times a day Monday through Friday and I clean it every night. It isn't painful and it pumps quickly. I couldn't have been happier until it fell apart.The actual pump part will no longer stay attached to the bottle. It takes twice as long to pump now because I'm trying to hold it together. I constantly have to stop and try to tighten the top back onto the bottle. Not that it matters, because I usually spill it when the top falls off anyway.I am now in the market for a new pump and I guarantee it won't be an Avent. I'm sorry I wasted my money on this. Please don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Choice","review":"I have been using this pump for almost 5 months now and it still works great. I was scared at first of the thought of attatching this machine to me because all I could think about was the pain it would cause. I have to admit, it did take some time to get used to, but now I love it. It helps the let down reflex go much faster and makes pumping all that much quicker. It is wonderful because you can control how fast or how slow you want to go and how hard the suction is to be. This is a great choice for a pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for occasional pumping","review":"If you plan to pump regularly, do not bother with this one. Spend the money for the Medella Pump in style. I hardly used my Avent pump and it cracked. It worked okay in the beginning. If you are planning to pump at work, do not rely on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"PART-TIME PUMPER","review":"I love this pump but have nothing to compare it to other than my sister's experiences with expensive hospital pumps.I found the price to be right and since I'm a sahm I usually only use it for baby's cereal or special occasions when I need to go out and leave the baby with a sitter.I find the speed of pumping (how much milk in how much time) to depend on how full my breasts are at the time. The fuller the breasts, the faster the milk comes with the pump. I've pumped four ounces in 10 minutes, another time I pumped 2 ounces in 20 minutes. I'd reccommend trying to pump when you are fullest. I have just started using it at least once a day, sometimes twice, for the cereal. I haven't had any parts break yet and it's been six months. I sterilize it by boiling the parts in water on the stove. I wonder about the wear and tear on the plastic with the water boiling but so far so good. Good Luck and Keep Nursing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Medela","review":"I bought the expensive electric Medela Pump in style and used it for 5 months. This is BETTER. Its much cheaper! Its quieter; it doesn't hurt. It works faster! This is portable... I could go on and on.The instructions say that you can hold the suction and milk will continue to be expressed - instead of pumping continuously (which is what the electric pumps do.) That process works - which means less motion and less strain on your breast tissue. This is a really great product.This also comes with 2 of most plastic pieces - 3 of the little 'white valves'. So, if a piece wears out, you have a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Quick","review":"I wanted to use the pump for a while before writing a review. My daughter is two months old now, and I have been using it nearly everyday, so that I can finish my last semester at college and leave her with a babysitter. It is quick, breaks down into smaller parts for putting in my backpack, and it doesn't hurt. The only that I don't like is that the clear tube sometimes gets foggy from the heat of the breastmilk, and you can't see if any milk is getting into the pump. When that happens I just wipe inside the neck of the pump, and it's perfect again! I recommend this for students and moms who need to pump at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Five","review":"This pump is really awesome except for one thing...the neck. I have had it for a month and use it regularly until one day the neck broke. That would be the main part that holds the bottle/disposable bottle to the unit.

She had very little trouble with it.I did try this pump before I had my son to get the feel for it, for practice, & to try to self-induce labor. It seemed like it would be a great pump, until my milk came in.I keep getting milk sucked up under the petal thing which causes it to lose suction. I even tried everything in the booklet & website to correct this & nothing helps. PLUS, I found out that I could hand-express nearly twice the amount of milk in less than 1/2 the time when I was engorged & the pump was apart to be cleaned.I thought pumps were supposed to save time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this pump before all others!","review":"I have now nursed two children successfully and highly recommend buying this pump before you buy an electric pump. I experienced a much better letdown and got plenty of milk, even when I was \\"drying up\\" and he was eating solids. I own an electric pump and rented the hospital one as well, so I really did try the others. I also recommend this pump if you already have an electric one, because you can walk around the house, sit in the car, pump at work and you do not need to plug it in!I was able to pump a big supply before I went to work.Advice: try to pump 4 oz a day to freeze and label while you are still home-at 3 months, then you will have plenty while you get the hang of pumping and working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy !!!!!

I wish I would have just shelled out the money for the Madela Electric because that is what I will be doing today!! Do not buy this product! It can become a huge problem if this broke at the work place! The plastic is cheap and faulty! Also, a plastic valve part kept getting sucked through the neck which I would have to take apart and fix and put back together AGAIN & AGAIN!!! It was a nightmare at 4 in the morning!!!!

Like one of the previous reviewers I have also been having problems with the star valve popping out, disrupting the suction of the pump. Whenever this happens I'm invariably in the middle of letdown and have to stop what I'm doing and spill milk all over myself to get the dumb thing popped back into place so that it can eventually slip out again. If being relaxed is supposed to help women with their pumping then I'm surprised I've been able to pump more than an ounce, since I'm usually frustrated and angry when using this thing.Get the medela if you can. It's less expensive and it actually works as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pump has a design flaw","review":"The small valve pops up so frequently that it is really not able to finish one session."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy and efficient","review":"I was hesitant to buy a hand pump because I'd heard they took forever, but this one has been quite efficient. I've pumped 8 ounces in 15 minutes, which is plenty fast for my purposes (backup storage and a daddy bottle every evening).Since how far you squeeze the handle determines how strong the suction is, you can intuitively adjust the suction throughout your pumping session.The clear pump head is nice because you can see the milk flow. This has probably saved me some discomfort, since I don't squeeze any harder than necessary to get a milk stream.There are a couple of small parts that might tend to get lost, but the pump manufacturer considerately includes a backup of those parts.The bottles that come with this pump are rather small, but the other Avent bottles fit it as well. (I bought two 9-ounce bottles (Philips Avent 9 oz BPA Free Bottle, Dual Pack) for that purpose.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great option for affordable pumping","review":"I have used this product every day for almost nine months, and I have been very pleased. I knew I wanted to breastfeed, but I also wanted her daddy to be able to feed her occasionally, and I didn't want to feel like I could never be apart from her. This pump is very affordable, and works very well. It easily attaches to any size bottle Avent makes, which is very convenient. It also comes apart for easy cleaning. It may not be quite as efficient as an electric model, but always works well. It's also small, which makes it easy to even throw in the diaper bag, if needed. I have been very happy with this pump."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pump better than Pump in style and cheap","review":"I bought this because I read good reviews and I liked how the Avent bottles mimic the breast. I got the kit that had the insulated bag and it came with a few 4 oz and 9oz bottles. I love this for the following:-It's small and easy to carry. With the black insulated bag noone but friends know I have a breast pump in it. The bag easily holds the pump and 2 full bottles, maybe even 3.-Easy to clean, there are hardly any parts!-I can control the suction!-I get a ton of milk.I was getting about 4 oz in 15 minutes on this doing one breastI thought I could get more so bought a pump in style and I was getting 1 oz per breast in 20 minutes. They say electric is best , not always true. However Medela has the custom shields, I had to also buy a size bigger. With the Avent I just take out the flowered soft cup and use it as is and I am fine. I was using the large Medela ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"electric is soooo much better","review":"I bought one of these on the recommendation from a friend who claimed this worked just as well as her hospital-grade electric pump (I have since decided she is from another planet). When my milk first came in, I was able to get 4-5 ounces in 15 minutes. But after a few weeks, I was having to pump for 30 minutes to get 2 ounces, leaving my breasts bruised and sore. I finally rented a hospital grade pump and learned these are the greatest inventions ever. I actually tried my hand pump again a few weeks ago to see how it would work if I ever needed to pump away from home and I uncomfortably got half an ounce. I then went to the electric pump and got 5 ounces. Buy this only if you are extremely engorged and need to pump occasionally for relief, but not if you plan on pumping daily. You will waste precious time pumping when you could be sleeping."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really love this pump","review":"I bought this pump nearly six years ago while pregnant with my son (4th child) and have used it since then through 3 babies. Before that I had tried MANY pumps, none of which I was satisfied with. For me, comfort is the name of the game. This pump fits the bill. As with any pump, the secret is in the let down. One will not get any significant amount of milk from any pump unless you are able to let down. To facilitate this, I highly recommend breast massage before pumping no matter what pump you use. The squeaking can be annoying and does not lend itself to discreet pumping, but that is the only problem I have with this pump. As far as having to lean forward, I have never used a pump where this was NOT necessary. This is by far the best pump I have ever used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best hand pump on the market!","review":"I purchased this hand pump when my 5 year old was born and used it to pump at home while I nursed him exclusively for a year (I used an electric pump when I was working).

I saved it and I'm now using it with my two month old. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this and buy the medela","review":"After reading all the positive reviews, I bought this pump and was very disappointed. It took me an hour and I only had one once in the bottle. Thinking maybe I was just incapable of pumping I was hesitant to shell out the big money for the gold standard electric pump (the medela pump in style), but finally realized I cant live as a nursing mother without a successful way to pump so I bought it. What a difference! Now I have a hand free for the remote or a magazine and I get 4 oz in less than 15 min. So easy to build a reserve of milk in the freezer and have freedom to leave the baby. Even for just occasional use, skip the manual pump!Additionally, for some reason Avent had to make their bottles a unique size so you cant use other brands for collection or storage and are stuck with the Avent bottles which I personally did not care for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not withstand repeated use","review":"I ran out to buy this at the suggestion of the hospital's lactation consultant right after delivering our daughter in November. She said it was a \\"good little lightweight pump, and affordable\\" --- well, I don't think [$$] for a manual plastic unit that hurts your wrist and breaks after 5 weeks of regular use should be considered \\"good.\\" I was dismayed to find how tired I became while expressing my milk twice a day -- the pump is not comfortable at all; the rubber guard has become loose and doesn't adhere properly to the breast, and the worst is that the neck has cracked on the pump causing milk to leak out. I just called AVENT customer service and they tried to tell me I was using the incorrect kind of WATER to wash the unit out! I suggested to them that they make a product that is durable so that moms don't have to waste precious time, money and effort replacing parts that should have been made properly in the first place. SAVE YOUR MONEY -- DON'T BUY THIS ITEM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Frequent Use","review":"I purchased this pump when our first baby was born. I didnt think i needed an electric pump and frankly didnt want to spend a fortune on one. It does work well, however i found that after each use you have to take it completely apart and wash all the pieces with care. Also, the more you use it the less effective it is. I ended up pretty frustrated after the first few times. If your planning to use this for weekend outings once or twice a week it will be fine. However if you plan on using it more than that I recomment buying a well known electric pump. I'm buying one for sure this time around. I know that most hospitals will rent out the expensive pumps for a fair price if you dont want to go out and buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money..

Unfortunately he had latching problems in the beginning and I was forced to rent a Medela dual pump to keep my milk supply good. Obviously the Avent isn't as efficient as the Medela, but when we give my son a bottle and I have to pump when I'm at someone else's house, the Avent is great and has quite a suprisingly strong suction. I was pretty impressed the first time I used it after my milk supply was established. I got quite a bit out in only a couple of minutes. I was scared to use it after I had been using the electric, figuring I'd be pumping for a half hour on each breast to get the same amount as the electric got, but it only took 10 minutes per breast, just like the Medela. My only gripe is sometimes it's difficult to manage at the breast, but I'm thinking maybe that's just me not knowing how to use it. But when I do figure it out, it's a good pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed for the third time","review":"There is nowhere to put your thumb and I think it adds pressure to the neck. I'm breastfeeding only, but to pump a bottle gives me freedom from one feeding a day & my husband or son usually gives my daughter that pumped bottle. If I were working and had to pump several bottles a day the pump would probably last about two weeks before the neck, the only part there are no extras, breaks. Today the third pump I have purchased has broken. I could've bought an electric by now, but since I do not work I didn't think it would be worth the investment for one bottle a day! My daughter is not even four months old yet. So far it has broken every month with pumping one bottle a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Pumping Experience","review":"Is started out with a Medela Pump in Style that worked pretty well at first when my son was about 2 months old. I'm not sure what happened, but about a month after I'd been using it, I got milk blisters. They were PAINFUL when my son would nurse and even MORE painful with the Medela even on the lowest suction setting. That's when I tried to find a manual pump that worked quickly and caused me less pain than the nursing or Medela. I tried a couple of different pumps, but the Avent made it possible for my son to continue to receive expressed breast milk AND for me to heal quickly. Because I could control the suction, it didn't hurt nearly as much as the Medela. I still use it more often than the Medela even now just because it doesn't hurt, works quickly (approx 4 oz in about 10 minutes), and is easy to transport. I fully recommend this product. Happy Pumping!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The manual avent pump is useless. I took the thing apart a dozen times and reassembled exactly as the directions told me to and was unable to get any more than a tiny amount of suction. I threw the thing out and bought a Medela.

Complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor suction","review":"Maybe someone got good suction from this but for me it didn't do squat.

NOt bad for a double pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, slow, incredibly frustrating to use","review":"I bought this pump after all of the fabulous reviews I read. I'm a stay at home mom and figured a good manual pump was all I needed. This obviously works for a lot of people, but it wasn't worth the time or the pain for me. It was painful to use and I could never get more than 2oz (both breasts combined) per session, and even so it took me at least a half hour to get this much. My baby drinks 4-5oz which means I needed two sessions of painful pumping to give him a bottle. I did have the pump assembled correctly and it did have suction- it just didn't do much for me. I splurged and got an Ameda Purely Yours and the difference is incredible. With the Ameda pump I can get at least 6oz in 10 minutes. Too bad I can't return the Isis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have while out and about","review":"I purchased the Isis as a secondary pump for when myPump In Style Advanced Breastpumpwasn't quite necessary. I bring it to work daily for expressing, and have been quite pleased with the output I get. It seems to get the same if not more milk than my medela, with little effort. This pump is much more gentle than an electric pump. It connects to our Avent bottles, which make for easy transfer of milk storage to feeding. It cleans up really easily, and assembles in a snap. I also bring it along with me when I know we will be out of the house for several hours in case I may have the need.

The mount was rock-solid and never had any problem. With this suppossed to be brand name GPS, the mount along with the GPS unit fell off six time during a ride of half an hour.

Contacted Amazon who said contact tomtom, who said return it or provide with upc on box, proof of purchase, and some other things I don't remember and they would replace cord if I paid for shipping. That tweeked me off enough that I won't buy again from tomtom.

When turned off, the battery will drain within 2 days. Support says that this is normal as the battery must maintain settings. A really poor excuse. A PC internal battery will maintain settings for up to 10 years. On top of the battery draining, the unit will not operate on external power until the battery has a minimal charge and is reset. This means that you cannot use the unit for about an hour after putting on external power. Really great technology here.On top of that, new maps came out about 6 months after I purchased the unit. Had I purchased the new maps, I would have paid full price. I was not offered a discount. I also submitted map corrections over a year ago and these have not appeared.

I then connected the GPS device via the included USB port and ran the updates. After the first update, I kept prompting Tom Tom Home to check for more updates after each reboot until there were no more. I tested the unit in the car and it worked flawlessly. When I went off the suggested path, it created a re-route immediately. It has a bunch of cool customizable features and a pretty straightforward user interface. I highly recommend this GPS unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Tom","review":"I must say I am disappointed with the mount for the GPS. I had difficulty keeping it on my windshield. It fell off 3 times during a 1.5 hour trip. If I missed a turn it would tell me to turn around. My daughter has a Garmin and the mount is much nicer. The Garmin also recalculates the route if you miss a turn. The Garmin seems more user friendly than the Tom Tom.

The suction cup makes mounting a breeze and it quickly removes from the base to take on the go. Touchscreen works with minimal effort. The night colors make it very safe to use at night. Only part I'm not thrilled with is the 12-volt power cord, which is currently drug across the dash as we have it mounted to the left of the steering wheel.

In general I think I received my money's worth. The items where it lacks: whereas I purchaed the extra wide screen thinking I would get a larger field of view for maps the fact that the information section on the bottom of the screen takes up 20% of the screen is a big drawback, the sofware should make this section transparant.

Just ask any honest physician and he/she will tell you.I too have experienced increased vibration and energy in my hands.

This book is at once about how the shop operated, and the change that the industrial revolution brought.Sturt basically ran a small, rustic, rural, pre-industrial General Motors. If it moved on wheels, they built it or fixed it. But he was also a writer, conscious of the change that he was seeing, and determined to leave some artifact for the future of the details of the life in his shop.

The recording quality is not the greatest (somewhat muffed); the sound engineers did a credible job making this CD quite listenable. The ravaged state of Billie's voice suggests this was probably recorded during one of her club dates in the mid-to-late '50s. But, as always, Billie triumphs. She takes these 14 songs that are closely attached to her and turns them inside out. You can feel the pain and ache in her heart as she churns out each song in that ravaged, bluesy voice. Again, listener suspends all judgement of her technical shortcomings and succumbs to the emotional delivery of each performance as only Billie can.

The plot was pretty neat, and the fact that Chris was crippled added a lot to the story. The characters were really well developed, and it was easy to get a picture of them in my head. The mystery about the murderer was really good, because the person who actually killed didn't really have any motives to kill the two girls, so it was more of a surprise.

We get a lot of detail about the other political efforts of the people who tried to found these museums, but we have no way of knowing to what extent those other political beliefs manifested themselves in what visitors saw, because we never really learn *what* they saw. That many of the organizations that sprouted up to restore and maintain these homes had deep ideological divisions makes this omission even more glaring, because the reader has no way of knowing which agenda, if any, eventually won out. There is interesting and informative material here, but what argument there is, is poorly presented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Photoshop CS Accelerated","review":"An excellent book for a beginner.

Trouble is, there's not enough cutting satire, and what there is gets overshadowed by some rather ugly scenes of ruthless violence. It doesn't matter how cute Matt Damon is, it's just not funny when he takes out a large handgun and blows innocent people's heads off. Ditto Ben Affleck, who's the lesser actor, and whose own adventure into bloodletting at the end ruined the film.Salma Hayek and Alan Rickman totally outclassed everyone else in the production. The Jay character was not as funny as we wanted him to be (note to Kevin Smith: you can be lewd, and you can be crude, but it ain't funny if it ain't delivered right).In short, not enough potshots at the church, and too many gunshots at the walk-ons."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book!","review":"Kevin is right on target.

The second story was a little better than the first. The ending was very good. It takes place in the city and then on a ranch.

I did not find out the origin of this film score some years later. Now exists a recording of this score in excellent digital sound closely resembling the 1935 film score with the nuances and artistry that one could only hear on a cd. \\"BRIDE\\" features what I consider to be the single best segment of music ever written. On track 7, it is \\"chase\\"; on band 8, it is repeated in \\"monster breaks out\\". My only criticism is track 7,\\"chase\\" whose segment from 2:51 through 2:58 is not repeated and thus is incorrect. Fortuately it is correct on track 8;\\"monster breaks out. A superb disc of a original classical film score that virtually has no equal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not an average monster movie soundtrack, but much more","review":"A wonderful score to a terrific movie.

The result would be something very similar to \\"The Bloody Countess\\" - an often incomprehensible account of historical events related in prose so flowery it stands to cause migraines. Penrose's work is a garbled mess of self-consciously mysterious language; hopelessly bogged down with high-flown speech, the story of Countess Bathory becomes lost in all the Kafkaesque prattle. She moves randomly from one topic to the next, following no logical thought patterns, often obscuring her points in meaningless, poetic drivel. I read this book seeking factual information on the history of Elizabeth Bathory and came out sorely disappointed; to call it unreadable would be a kindness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Her Victims, A Terrible Mess","review":"This has got to be the most poorly written book I've ever read. Unnecessarily flowerly prose makes much of the work incomprehensible, and what is understandable is loaded with minute detail about things that add absolutely nothing to the story or our understanding of it's subject. A totally unrelated chapter devoted to the crimes of Giles de Raiis only adds to the confusion. Try instead, the fictional \\"Blood Countess.\\" It's far more readable and there's probably enough fact in the mix to give readers the overview they won't find here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it was pretty bad.","review":"I haven't read something this poorly written since Christian Jacq's 'Ramses - Son of Light'. I attributed the thin, 2-dimensional prose to an inept translation from French to English. Could this be the same reason? It is quite bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless Tripe","review":"Not to be taken as a serious, scholarly work on its own. It reads more like a bad novel occasionally hemorrhaging facts--perversely analogous to one of Bathory's poor victims. Sadly, there is no clear dividing line between facts and breezy, flatulant fiction-writing. Unless you are experienced in reading poorly written continental-European prose, are some sort of PoMo cretin, or are some teenaged Goth/dork, the value to be culled from reading this book is little worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dark Princess","review":"I loved this book.

First the set list. There are too many songs from \\"Brave New World\\". Now it was a good album and good comeback but I think they should have added more classics like \\"Aces High\\", \\"The Clairvoyant\\" or \\"Flight of Icarus\\". Another problem are the special features. To be honest they are quite boring and they could have been done much better. Overall though if you are an Iron Maiden fan this is definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixing Issues","review":"This would be a great DVD, but the mixing left the vocals clouded.

The editting of the video is terrible. Iron Maiden or the producers should have hired a pro to do the editing. I agree with Chris Glenn 100 percent. This kind of switching angles back and forth is very distracting. I watched a little over half the show with the hopes that I could find a rhythm to the editing but no such luck. I finally had to turn it off because it was to hard to follow. As for sound, the fact that they did not give uyou the choice of 2 channel sound is reason alone not to buy this disc set. The fluctuation in sound levels are very apparent. I have yet to hear a live concert recording(heavy hitter rock/roll) which sounds better in 5.1 digital than in 2 channel stereo.I also purchased the Judas Priest-Live in London. If you only could buy one of these DVDs-Iron Maiden or Judas Priest-select the Priest, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound-Bad editing","review":"First off, this concert is fantastic. The sound is clear and blistering, the energy with all six members recalls 1985's LAD. Overall, I say \\"Get It,\\" it's an excellent concert with newer Maiden songs sounding like old Maiden classics!Alas, there is a caveat:The editing is schizophrenic. Something like 38 cameras are used which isn't the problem, it's the fact they're all used within a minute of each other over and over again preventing the viewer from focusing on anything for more than a couple of seconds.In this day of MTV editing, Iron Maiden should be above this. The haphazard editing, I believe, is supposed to enhance the energy and excitement of the show but it detracts from it because it's somewhat annoying hoping to watch a camera shot for more than 2 seconds.Final note to band: You don't need wild editing to show excitement, everybody at that concert only had one view, and they left exhausted from what I'm sure was the most intense concert they've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concert; terrible editing","review":"I bought Rock in Rio because I like Iron Maiden and I really enjoy good concert DVDs. The concert is strong, the audio excellent, the video quality is outstanding. So why only 2 stars? The editing is horrific!!! The footage is cutting to another shot every second. At some times, it's cutting 3-4 times PER SECOND. I found the DVD to be unwatchable, which really made me angry since it was a good concert with good audio and video quality that was ruined. It turns out that Steve Harris edited this DVD - Steve, stick to what you do well. If you are a hard, hard core Iron Maiden fan, go ahead and buy the DVD - you will probably enjoy it. However, if you hate videos where they are always doing the fast cut to another shot, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch at your own risk!","review":"I love this band to death, BUT this is just unwatchable. Seems like the Editing wand broke on Steve. And it's really a shame because it could have been up there with LAD. On this concert we hear Bruce singing songs from the Blaze era from FOD and some old material too. It would have been great to sit back and enjoy, but I'm afraid you have to watch this at your own risk of a possible seizure or a blinding headache. Sad really :(Oh....and the same applies to DOTR dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds great, but too much flipping around with the camera","review":"Well I waited for this for so long now, finally got it. Disapointed. It gave me a headache to watch, its much better if you don't watch it and just listen to it.For whatever reason they keep flipping the camera around never showing the same angle for more than 1 second. Or every 2 beats or so they show a different angle. It would have been great if they did multiple angles instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst edition I have ever seen!!","review":"The worst thing that could happen for Iron Maiden was when its founder, its boss, the marvellous bass player and songwriter called Steve Harris decided to edit this DVD. I don't understand it.Theoretically trying to \\"capture\\" the famous Maiden energy and vibe on stage, he opted for using a ultra-fast edition that will make your head spin, without paying any attention for who is soloing at the moment, if Nicko is at the middle of a great drums flourish, etc. All of the takes last, in their majority, less than one second and a half. The result was that you simply have no pleasure watching this MTV-styled DVD, thanks to its terrible edition.Well, that's my opinion. Of course, the \\"UP THE IRONS\\" guys will love anything this deservedly great band release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best video concert I have ever seeeen!","review":"I didn't buy this dvd right away.

They way the sang along and jumped with the songs. They even moshed. I saw it. Even thought it was in the back. But, they caught it on film. I couldn't even imagine playing infront of that many people. I don't know how they did it. But they did and they did it the only way madien could do it. It was sick, sick, sick.

Fortunately, I got to see them a year before that. Semi-promising tracks off their new (at the time) disc 'Brave New World' included the title track, \\"Ghost Of The Navigator\\" and \\"Dream Of Mirrors\\". Sound and picture quality here are top notch. Of course, we also get to thoroughly soak in plenty of that good 'ol classic Maiden like \\"The Trooper\\", \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", one of my personal Maiden favorites - the awesome \\"Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Hallowed Be Thy Name\\" and the '80's metal foot-stomper \\"Run To The Hills\\". For me, one of the most memorable scenes on this DVD is during the song \\"Iron Maiden\\", when vocalist Bruce Dickinson bonds with several women (who are dressed to be sacrificed) groups in and willingly enters an actual iron maiden - the ancient torture device. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLinding fast edition makes this DVD unwatchable!","review":"The sound is great and the image also is.

The main problem is the soundlevel that fluctuates all the time and the fact that theydon't have a 2-channel stereo soundtrack. The image quality isgood but it is poorly edited. We don't have a chance to seea single second of any of the band members. The imagekeeps changing from one to another every second.I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Put Harris on Ritalin NOW!","review":"Harris takes a great concert and manages to destroy it with the most hyperactive editing I've ever seen.Normally when watching things I never even think about the editing. Editing is something you shouldn't think about when it's done right. You shouldn't notice it. You only notice it when it bad, and it's really bad here. I think that had 24 cameras and Harris seems to be of the philosophy that you must show a shot from each of them within every minute. He can't do something wild & crazy thing like focus on Bruce while Bruce is singing. He has to randomly jump around from one shot to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to drive a viewer to the brink of total insanity.All I wanted to do was strangle Harris as I watched it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maiden in top form!","review":"This is a great DVD and well worth the price. Being a Maiden fan for twenty years and seeing them a couple of times in concert in the mid 1980's, I can say that I have never heard them sound better or have a better stage show! I agree with the reviewers that \\"Live After Death\\" should be released on DVD. However, I believe that the band gives a much better performance on this DVD: Bruce's singing is much better than and the band's energy level is much higher - you would think that the \\"boys\\" are 20 years younger! Some people mention the editing as a reason for not buying this. I don't see it at all; Steve Harris did a great job in spreading the footage equally between the band members. You can actually see Nicko in this one! This is a definite must for any Iron Maiden or heavy metal fan, buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere in the Cover or Eyewitness : I was there too","review":"This DVD is already available here and it's for me a very special opportunity to see again the show I saw on Jan, 19th,2001.To you I'd just say that this DVD successfully shows the climate of being in an Iron Maiden show.To the Iron Maiden team I'd like to say THANKS for this chance to remember that night, just like Bruce said, that was a very special night."},{"rating":"2","title":"100th Review (unless someone beat me)","review":"BUY IT!!!! This is a great DVD. It is heavy on the stuff from Brave New World, but that's because they were on the BNW tour when they recorded this. Overall great show, the crowd was really into it, although this is more evident on the cd's IMO. I only have two minor objections: 1- MORE BASS!!! kinda quiet. 2- Editing, looks like a toddler on caffine edited it.Overall Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best live Iron Maiden recording ever","review":"If you like Iron Maiden, this about as good as it gets! The performances are great, the instruments are huge and energetic without losing clarity, and Bruce's singing is dead on the whole night. You can just see and feel how excited they are to be playing this show. This surely redeems the last 3 live albums they've done, which were recorded near the end of Bruce's first run with the band, and to ME sounded a little garbled and hasty. There's just some magic to the way some recordings come together, and this is one has it! This leaves all 4 of their live albums I've heard in the dust, (yes...even Live After Death!) I say this is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST SHOW","review":"This is a great DVD!!! great songs in special of New Brave World album. The sound and video quality is really good. Maybe the edition of scenes is too fast and Adrain's solos needed more camera attention. But the real important thing is that Iron Maiden is more live than ever. They just love the music, what a 3 guitars, steve\\"simply great\\", Nicko is the heart's band and Bruce is the best heavy metal singer ever. Without Bruce IM is not the real IM. Great songs and also the second disc(interwies,etc) is very cool. Buy this DVD. Up the Irons."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Must","review":"Rock In Rio is an excellent representation of how Iron Maiden still know how to pull it off. The sound quality and video is the best live production they've put out to date. The only complaints I have is unless you have 5.1 surround you lose out on some of the sonic production... My other small complaint is that I wish there were more classic tracks. I know Maiden have put out plently of live videos with all of the classics, but never with this quality. All-in-all, Maiden live up to their dedication to their fans and have put out yet another must-buy. Die-hard fans should also get their hands on \\"Eddie's Archives\\"...this should have been put out years ago...it is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron Maiden RIR rocks","review":"I loved it.....RIR is an awesome display of Maiden, still kicking ..., while I will admit that Live after death is the best live album ever, rock in rio is still a worty disc to have in your collection..........the boys are back........if you love Maiden....get this........IRON MAIDEN RULES"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Nice to see a great Maiden show so many years after they started making music. Bruce acquits himself very well as one of the great metal singers of all time. The 3 guitar lineup is really fun to watch, and the crowd is very much in to the show. The song list is very good (Have to leave out some classics with a band like this or the show would be 12 hours long!) and the musicianship is choice. Just a great show for any Maiden or metal fan! Make sure you have a great stereo system so you don't miss anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eddie invades Rio","review":"This is among the very best of my music dvd/vhs collection. This well-filmed, entertaining concert footage captures Maiden at their energetic best. In spite of it being the final show of another long worldwide trek, you can tell they really enjoy what they do. Most amazing to me was the inclusion of a couple of the Blaze Bayley-era tracks, which if anything, Bruce takes to another level! Maiden realizes every era of their history is important to their fans. Up the Irons! Long live Maiden!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Effective Guide","review":"Beginning with a personalized story of how he learned many languages, Barry Farber reviews the essentials of language learning.There are three sections to the book: Part One is 'My Story'. Part 2 is 'The System' and 'Part 3 is Appendixes.I highly recommend you supplement this book with Mark Frobose'sThink and Grow Fluent (Secrets of Language Success)andAutomatic Fluency - Nine Steps to Speaking Languages and Finishing Fluent (Secrets of Language Success Series).Farber has left out the all important subject of programming the mind for language success and I think Frobose nails that area very nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This is a book about some guys exploits at learning languages. But don't blame the author, this book is written in that unmistakable \\"ghost writer\\" style. It includes such awe-inspiring topics as flash cards, talk with the natives, and word associations, rudimentary steps every language learner already knows. Maybe, before the internet, this was a useful book but in this day and age my own poor Japanese Language learning skills are leaps beyond his."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will give you false information","review":"This book starts from the author's boast of how many languages he can \\"speak\\" and how talented he is. Then it starts giving you a tiny bit of information about each language that is almost useless. For example, he says, in Japanese section, \\"Like Chinese, Japanese conversation is fairly easy.\\" which makes me laugh. It is absolutely not true, and I know that because I am a native Japanese speaker who has been teaching Japanese to Americans. Apparently he knows no Japanese and he mixed things up with his little knowledge about Chinese. Even though we share similar characters, speaking Chinese and Japanese are totally different.These information about each languages can be easily found if you just go to a bookstore and browse some dictionaries of foreign languages.If you really want to learn languages, don't buy this book unless you want to read about his useless boasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Language the Easy Way","review":"This is one of the best books for learning a how to learn a language. The author, with 25 languages under his belt, really knows what he is talking about. His review of languages is extremely helpful for deciding what language to learn. The only problem I had with this book was that his \\"multi-track\\" approach requires a lot of money to effectively do. I am sure though that if you do learn a language like how he describes, then you will learn it. This book is also good for simple motivation. To sum it up, this book is a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit sexist and outdated but still worth reading","review":"The author focuses mainly on European languages but his tipscan be used to study any language. His advice includes:1) making flashcards2) studying while waiting in line or on the phone3) buying all available audio lessons and rotating through them4) reading real newspapers and magazines is more valuable thanusing the most advanced textbooksIt's not 5 star because he didnt mention the Leitner methodfor flashcards and it's too long-winded in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book of education common-sense","review":"It's a maxim in education that perfect practice makes perfect understanding, and that people learn best by doing. Somehow, Farber manages to take these two ideas and stretch them so that they occupy nearly 200 pages.Although more shouldn't be expected form a \\"self-help\\" book on a subject as general as \\"Learn[ing] Any Language\\" it is disappointing to see so many 4 and 5 star reviews for a book that, in essence, rehashes common sense. This book does not mention any revolutionary techniques that justify it's existence, nor does it take into account valuable online resources that exist in the world today--such as language-learning communities or sties where one may find a foreign penpal (and can converse pseudo-anonymously).Overall, this book was a huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks!!","review":"I've been learning Spanish on my own for a couple of years. Whenever I start to feel in any way unhappy with my progress, I turn to this book. It's full of advice, insight, and inspiration.Mr. Farber really knows how to learn a language. And he knows how to write. And most of all, he knows how to write about learning a language.If you're thinking of learning a language, or you're already trying to learn a language, you need this book. It's worth a lot more than the few dollars that Amazon is asking for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Motivating","review":"This book is a good read, and even gives you tips on learning languages. I thought the section on memorization was a little lengthy, but better too much info than not enough. There is also a list in the back of all the major languages with a million or more speakers. While not vital, its nice to know how many potential speakers you may be able to speak with when learning a language. The only problem with the list was that languages like Yiddish were excluded claiming that it is just an offshoot of German, but Afrikaans was included and it is an offshoot of Dutch. I also thought it might be helpful to go into language families a little more, but all in all, it is interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful and encouraging","review":"Righly claiming that most high school language teachers have scarred us for life by dragging us through the rudimentaries of grammar before we ever speak a foreign language, Farber encourages a different slant on language learning: Learn as a child does. Pick up grammar and vocabulary simultaneously and from multiple sources. Dive in and keep going and don't strive for immediate perfection (if you need it, in time it will come). He points to several wonderful tools to help us and how to use them. Great book to get you started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine for a couple of years then started to leak","review":"The heater worked very well for between two and three years, but when I turned it on this winter, it started to leak oil.

Her voice is so great and she carries herself with such maturity. JoJo's voice sounds like that of a much more mature woman. She has such range and knows how to use her voice to her advantage and showcases it so well. She blends the perfect mix of R&B;/Hip Hop and pop and turns out amzing songs that make you want to dance, snap your fingers, tap your feet and slow grooves that you can get lost in.Every single song on here is a standout track and 5 out of 5 stars.The songs I cannot get enough of are:\\"This Time\\"\\"The Way You Do Me\\"\\"Too Little Too Late\\"\\"Anything\\" - with a great sample from the 80's smash hit \\"Africa\\" by Toto\\"Coming For You\\"\\"Let It Rain\\"\\"Exceptional\\" - a GREAT slow jam^^ Those are just the songs that I could listen to over and over to again. The whole CD is worth the purchase. It is a standout CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little to lame","review":"I love the songs, a little too late. I think Jojo has a great voice, and will become a great artist over time.I was a little disappointed in this cd, however.I expected there to be a lot of tracks that I would love, but nope. A little too late- while I love the song reminds me of songs on her 1st cd.There is another great song called \\" I am coming for you\\" track 8.Otherwise, the cd is filled with rap, and r&b; songs that just don't fit her. They're weakly produced and don't show the true range or beauty of her voice. I wish she could find a better temper of music to fit her better as I think she could be great. Again, it's half-baked r&b; that just won't hold up....that's why you don't hear any of the other songs played on the radio. She has more potential that to be just a one hit per cd kind of girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!!!","review":"I just bought the CD this week and I have enjoyed it.

JoJo wants to be mentioned as a Artist with R&B roots,but thus far her music comes across like generic attempts at trying to hybrid R&B. if JoJo ever aspires to be the Teena Marie of her Generation than she will need the right Producer&also get some real songwriting as to the fast food vibe that is felt on alot of these tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad Road of Singing","review":"Everybody's about to forget about JoJo (Joanna Levesque), and we know why. Too Little Too Late was actually the only number one hit for Billboard Charts from this album. Throughout her own life, \\"Breezy\\", \\"Leave (Get Out)\\" and \\"Baby It's You\\" are probably the only greatly known songs she's successful for. Now that's doing a singing business really poor.

This album does a good job of showing it. She really is given the opportunity to show what she can do. You hear her sing high, sing low, and everything she can do in between.

Suffice it to say that the main characters become mass murderers during the course of this thing, murderers of a whole lot of innocent people.

Oh, your average audience member who's smart enough to tie their own shoes might notice, but the makers of the film didn't. That's just a bit too deep and intellectual for them.However, if you like looking at a pretty girl in a black bra and a skin-tight T-shirt getting squirted with water, diving into water, and generally running around while very wet, well, this movie does deliver that.

Just imagine most of the regular printer sizes only prints 8-1/2 or legal size bond paper and NOT 12 x 12\\". My biggest frustration is using the Picture TV Slide Show, it is easy to MAKE but NOT to BURN/TRANSFER IT to a CD/DVD. It requires another program, known as NERO, which is about 120 MB for a TRIAL VERSION ONLY (30 days).

I found out that the older version (2.0) bonus CD works fine with the newer version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many bugs and glitches to mention","review":"I used this software to do a scrapbook for my mother for her birthday.First of all the software takes up a HUGE amount of space! Like 1600MB. The program is so slow and I have a relatively new computer. After about 4 pages in one file it becomes impossible to work with and then crashes. I had two files - 6 pages - crash and the work was gone. All the work gone. The text editor will add typos and put in and take out spaces. Sometimes it works great other times you have to restart your computer. Once it added bright green lines where I had added all of the embellishments to the page - everything other than the background. I had to redo it. Piece of JUNK! but what does print on a color laser - don't try it with inkjet - looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best, Creative Scrapbook Software There Is","review":"I bought this software for my wife for Christmas. The quality of this software is outstanding. It is simple to use, but has many, many features. I would recommend this software for anyone who likes to scrapbook, but also for those who enjoy doing anything with pictures. You can make calendars, greeting cards, birthday cards etc., as well as flyers. The price for this software is very cheap for the quality and the amount you get from it.

After reading some (non-Amazon) online reviews I decided to spring for this software. It is the slowest software I have ever seen and in the two pages I've worked on, I have crashed it 3 times.All of the templates are 81/2 x 11 which makes no sense and there are no custom sizes available. The UI is very hokey and looks very old. It doesn't do a bad job, but it doesn't really do more than fair.

In utter frustration, I returned the item soon after. The only good point was that it offered decent graphics that mimicked scrapbooking pieces well. Too bad the software and service didn't match in quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best product on the market for scrapbooking!","review":"This product is so easy to use!

It has a lot of glitches and absolutely can not be used effectively on Windows 7.I consider myself pretty computer savy and this is just not what I was hoping for.

FYI...if you are using this as a way to create a profile with Lifetime Adoption, keep looking for another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute and fun","review":"This is the only software I have ever seen in person or used. Overall I like it much better than traditional scrapbooking, which was getting way too messy, and my kids were always getting into it. This software is easy to use after playing around with it. Also, it allows you to import free or low-cost digital scrapbooking supplies from the internet. Most of the designs are CUTE, not pretty or beautiful, and many are downright cheesy. I found it very easy, CHEAP, and quick to print pages online at ScrapbooksToShare.com. Overall this is much easier and cheaper than traditional scrapping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes scrapbooking fun!","review":"The price was right for this great computer scrapbooking program. After getting bored with the other computer scrapbook program that I received with my printer I went looking for a new program with more choices. I have had hours of fun making pages for the family vacations we've taken this year. My only complaint would be that there are maybe TOO many choices...not really a complaint at all, but you DO start to get lost clicking through all the possibilities. My only suggestion would be if they could somehow incorporate an index search that would enable you to find everything pertaining to...say soccer. Instead of having to look through all the different backgrounds and accents separately.

This movie is so bad it is funny which is the only reason I give it two stars. If you want a good gory film look elsewhere.

You will ride around the circuit racing from city to city for the opportunity to get up on that next bull. The pay stinks, and there is a lot of pain, but for Pee Wee it is the life to which he was born. Pee Wee's last ride is the hook that pulls you into his story. Can you imagine the world in which he found himself after breaking is spinal cord that fateful evening in 1995 when he rode his last bull?

I couldn't put them down. This series is the tie that binds the Circle Trilogy (Black, Red, White) to Dekker's other works. Ted is a master at cliffhangers and totally unexpected twists and now he's taken it to a whole new level by interweaving storylines over multiple books. It's absolutely awesome.

It deals with an alternate world where four teens are chosen to become part of the Forest Guard who is at war with the Horde(the desert dwellers). Johnis the main character is unsure of himself and why he was chosen but decides to follow his heart instead of his head.

It is cool to see the root system developing, and the pamphlet inside gave a nice description of a seed. We split open one of the seeds so they could see it looked just like the pamphlet described it. I learned a little bit, too. My only complaint is that the viewing window is made of extremely flimsy plastic, which could easily be destroyed by eager little gardeners.

Cool! But aside from that, the informative content was rather low - more akin to something one would see on the Discovery Channel than the once-great Nova series (no offense to the DSC). The rest of the doc was repetitious and the narrative a bit dumbed-down and hyperbolic. All those flaws were magnified by the over-the-top melodramatic music. Really awful.

This one involves a fallen angel, who rebelled against God even before Lucifer did. Throughout history, he has intervened in human events.

For each mineral, locations are shown by county, so it's pretty easy to start with a mineral and get an idea of where to find it. However, if you're in a specific place, and wondering what you can find there, it's a lot of work because there's no cross reference by location.

It would just return vague errors. When I swapped back to the Time Capsule, the errors went away and everything functioned normally. I spent over two hours with a Level 3 technician from D-Link trying to resolve the problem, and eventually, after trying everything in his arsenal, we give up.Additionally, I would experience random connectivity problems with my MacBook Air, though the ipad and iphones seem to never experience issues.At any rate, I returned the unit to Amazon and will be trying something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I actually buy TWO of them?","review":"I bought two of them. The first failed last fall, and I liked something about this router so much that I simply bought a 2nd one, even though the first was still under warranty. The wireless communication slowed to a crawl and would speed up after a power cord removal and replacement kind of re-boot. Then the wireless communication failed entirely. So, I went to Fry's and bought the 2nd one. Now, it is about 6 months later, and the wireless communication is failing again in much the same way. I ought to have it repaired, just to punish the manufacturer, but what a hassle! I don't really wish to spend hours on the phone with their customer service, just to have them tell me what I already know.So, I'm now researching for another router, but it certainly won't be a Dlink of any kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with the DIR-655","review":"I purchased the DIR-655 with expectations of screaming WI-FI....what I got was a unit that had to be restarted twice a day as it would just lose contact with all my devices.

Strange thing with this unit is we had issues trying to stream audio from any of our notebooks to our Yamaha Network A/V Receiver, heck I always thought it was an issue with our notebooks as I could still \\"control\\" the functions of the reciever through the Yamaha Web Interface through my DIR-655, I just couldn't stream my music.

After many attempts to make this router work and visiting the manufacturers website to manually install or automatically install it I gave up. It should take no longer than 10 to 12 minutes to make a router work and reset the password and name your network.

Then it kept getting worse and finally I couldn't even hard wire into it and get into the admin of it. I'm still looking for a n router that is actually fast and works.

It won't work with Linux, and is difficult to configure with other systems (Mac Intel, XP, and Linux). The set up can be confusing: you log in with a browser, but there are multiple screens and lots of resets to get anywhere. The range and speed are average. After a couple of months and poor technical support, I've decided to give it up and buy something less frustrating.

HOWEVER, IT IS NOT THE CASE! After setting up this router, I lost the signal in my bedroom completely!!! You can imagine the disappointment. A 40 dollar Netgear G router from 4 years ago, out-range this supposedly the best single band N router in the current market. In the end I hooked my Old Netgear back, and used this router as a WIFI extender, took a while to figure out the setup.

When the computer is plugged directly into the cable modem I own, the speed is WAYYYYY too fast. 15 ms pings with 20 Mbs download. Once I go through the D-Link DIR 655, either through wireless or a wired connection, the speeds drop to reasonable levels! Pings are over 200ms like they were meant to be. Download speeds sometimes drop to about 100kbs! That's still faster than dial up modem speeds, but what can you do. Even better, the software is bulletproof.

The signal strength is surprisingmuch weaker than my old super G, with frequent dropping of the connections on all 3 HP notebook running on G, as well as my Palm TX. Unless you have the N setup for most of your wifi needs, I don't believe this router is any better than the regular $[...] router.

I was able to isolate the cause to this router since if I connect the modem to my computer, there is no connection problem at all.I called DLink customer service, after an hour of changing settings without being able to make the unit work, they told me to return the unit to Amazon.

All are running flawlessly on this router with WPA2 security enabled. I have one wireless N device, and the speed I get with that laptop is excellent. Overall I am very pleased with this router; it missed getting a fifth star because the setup wasn't as user-friendly as I would have liked, but that was more of a problem with the PS3 than with any other device. The speed and thoroughput I get with all the rest of my wireless devices, which are all wireless G, is also great.

The first problem is that the connection (both wired and wireless) drops out for a few minutes on a regular basis. This is particularly painful while watching a movie or playing a game on line. The second problem is that our wireless printer doesn't work well with this router having an intermittent connection. The DLink tech service is a huge pain being well trained in the run-a-round. After countless hours, I finally discovered that this version (B) has a known hardware problem that has not been fixed. I'm told the older version (A) is ok, but I'm not willing to chance it.

However, the product had a 4 star review overall and I've decided to give it a shot anyways. I'm a pretty technical person (software engineer), and it took me over an hour to figure out how to get this working with my Verizon FIOS. The problem is that it doesn't recognize the WAN connection coming out of my FIOS modem. After tweaking, I found that the default mode on the WAN port (10/100/1000 auto) for some reasons does not work correctly. I had to force it down to 10Mbps.

I tried using different versions of the software but still I could not get it working.

The guy (name available on request) finally said he would phone me back in 10 minutes. He never did. After trying again to set up the router by myself, I phoned back tech support, and talked to somebody (name available on request) who seemed somewhat more knowledgeable -- but this was probably only an illusion. After another 15 minutes on the phone and me climbing back in the ladder again to reach the router, the thing did work briefly. But it stopped shortly after the phone call.

I could not stream HDTV due to too weak of a signal no matter what I tried, so I decided to buy this router.I replaced it and set up the new router with no issues. I went and connected the x-box to the new router and was very disappointed to see that signal was actually worse. I was getting 8-9 bars (out of 15, 11+ needed for HD) with the old router, and now I'm getting 3-4 bars with this one. The antennas on this unit are small and cheap.

This results in stuttering web video streams, poor file transfers which hang part way through, and a need to restart the unit every few days to restore performance. It's worth reading the dlink support forums to see what others say about this router -- it sounds like many users have the same issues with the dir-655 that I do.I'm switching back to my 6 year old 802.11g router, which had no issues at the same usage level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple setup - great performance","review":"The wireless signal in my house was really disappointing me, so I decided to upgrade my router and step up our game a little.The signal from this router has been outstanding.

However, I am one of the people who have had issues with it, namely the wireless signal dropping out several times a day.If you search issues with the router, you'll find that it has an issue with dropping wireless. It seems to be related to the firmware version, but the older version which didn't appear to have any issues can no longer be loaded into the router.About 4 times a day, the router will drop the wireless signal. So everyone on will get disconnected for 1 minute to 15 minutes. Very annoying. You can unplug it and power it back up and it will come on, but none the less, annoying.I plan on replacing it as soon as I can find the time to reconfigure whatever new one I purchase, which will take me hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe wireless, no RFI","review":"Being a ham radio operator I had to be sure that the wireless router would not interfere with my serious radios... and it doesn't.

And so far the HF radio has had no effect on the router.Router was easy to install, and once I entered the right DSL password (from my ISP) it was easy to program and get started up.

However, be warned that a Gigabit switch in D-Link's definition DOES NOT imply 10Mb support. It will only do 100Mb and 1000Mb. I just verified this with tech support, who were quite friendly, by the way, and I got through to them immediately. So even if everyone else in the industry sells a router with a 4-port Gigabit switch that is backwards compatible with slower devices, apparently D-Link does not, at least for this model. I'll have to knock them 1 star because even their tech support site incorrectly makes the claim of lower 10Mb support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great in front of FIOS router","review":"I only wish I had realized earlier just how poor the ActionTec FIOS router is.

Fast speed and pretty far range. Router is set up on the second floor of a fairly large home and I've had no issues getting a signal anywhere in the house or outside. Network / wireless setup was very easy. Just pop the CD in and follow the instructions.My only complain was that there was literally no information about how to enable the shareport (USB) on the back of the router. It's not just plug & play; you have to download the Shareport Utility and install it on your computer. Took a while to find this out online, but all was well once I got that squared away.

I thought I would be able to get N mode working but found out that no game consoles use it and you need the N adapter which costs just as much as the router so I couldn't use that mode for any of my computers. After connecting it, and optimizing it to the best performance I could get working which was just the next one under Extreme N mode, I got the same results as the Linksys router. No difference what so ever. So I resorted to just going wired.To make your computer N compatible, it will cost you close to $200 for the adapter and this router. So unless you want to spend the money for it, go for it, it will be better but its only limited to whats N mode ready. If you're not gonna use N mode, then skip this and just go with the Linksys wirless basic router. You'll get the same performance.

I felt at that time it was the only way I can get them to help me out. I had to go to that drastic measure to get the help that I needed and that is not good.

Therefore, you must call tech support for them to reset the router and install it in a different way online. I already had another router so getting online wasn't a problem but kind of a hassle. It took about 45 minutes to complete. I got this because I wanted to get wifi 2 floors down and on the other side of the house, it was worth a try. It didn't do the job in my situation. My wifi is only slightly better, but like I said I am in the basement and the router is on the 2nd floor and on opposing sides.

I have installed netgear and belkins in the past, for friends and family, and this D-link router is just as easy as any other. Following the quickstart instructions is just enough. I personally purchased this router because it had the shareport USB utility which allowed me to connect a USB external hard drive, that I can access anywhere from home, and it works fine. The only downside is that the hard drive is only accessible from one laptop at a time, which is fine for me at this moment. I hope D-link will improve this in the future. I live in a 1600 ft2 apartment and the signal is strong all the way to the last corner, at least 3 bars (out of 5). Make sure you follow the recommendations for the antennas and how to arrange them.

The customer service was nice, and I'm not complaining, but there's no reason I should have to call them to get the thing working. I get off the phone and don't even bother checking the Wifi which was a mistake. I was getting about 26Mbps! I couldn't even download updates for my anti-virus software. Even my labtops which have great built in wireless cards were getting low Mbps. I was getting 54Mpbs+ with my Belkin, and I have to be right next to the D-Link to get that.

It's not overheating - it doesn't even feel warm. The network just vanishes, interrupting the movie, game, file transfer, or whatever I'm doing at the time.

It is in the basement of an 1800 SqFt house. The router is 7 yrs old and figured while upgrading a completed home theater system maybe it was time to upgrade the wireless router. D-Link DIR-655 Extreme N Gigabit Wireless Router signal strength was no more than half the linksys signal. Also, connections were lost in rooms upstairs directly above the router. I re-installed the Linksys and not one connection has been dropped for over a month now. This DLink router was a waste of $80. Maybe Ebay will help me recover half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoped working after 3 months","review":"Long story short....The unit failed to work after only 3 months.

I kept asking if this was D-Link's customer service and was assured that it was. I kept saying I didn't want the \\"free\\" stuff, just answers to a set up problem and he kept telling me he would get to it as soon as his computer booted the info and then continued to try to get me to take the \\"free\\" stuff. After hanging up I called back and got the same...\\"congratulations, you're the 100th caller, etc.\\" Finally just returned the router to D-Link."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I got the router delivered to me yesterday and set up last night. The first test I did was to transfer a 3GB file and I have to say it was pretty fast. I have to admit that setting up the wireless security wasn't too intuitive. The latency was pretty good while playing PS3/PC games without making any adjustments in the router. I'm looking forward to tweaking the router. There are too many features to handle in one sitting and without thinking it through. This is definitely not recommended for noobs but more towards intermediate to expert people familiar with networking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better range than my old Linksys","review":"I bought this hoping that I could get a little better range than my Linksys WRT546GS. I've had that router for a couple years now, and it was great for that time, but I figure that's long enough for a router, so I thought I'd try the DLink. Works great. Easy setup (as I experienced with Netgear, but not necessarily with Linksys, as I recall). I don't know about the N standard, have no devices that use it, but I do know that my B and G devices are showing faster and stronger connection speeds with this router than the Linksys. It's located, btw, upstairs in a two-story house, behind a closed door. All the computers are downstairs. I'll need to check online if anything can be effectively hooked up to the USB port, because a big harddrive would be nice...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this router!!!","review":"Don't buy this router. It's very unstable and offer poor performances. After a week I can't figure what the problem is. My Blu-Ray player can see the network and the day after it can't. Files transfer can take hours.

Unfortunately, it doesn't hold a candle to the Linksys I replaced. It was easy to install but that's where the praise stops. The signal strength is much lower on all devices being used in the same places throughout the house. Worse yet, the signal is dropped entirely at intermittant times meaning streaming video is a nightmare to watch. I wish I hadn't installed my old router at my mothers! Now I will toss this one and buy something other than D-Link new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"Easy to setup. However, the router would only work for a few hours at a time before requiring a power cycle to get it working again. Tried reconfiguration, nothing helped.I was hoping for better range performance than the Linksys router that I currently have. No!! During the short working durations, the range was no better at all.Fortunately Amazon processed my refund quickly. That was about the only positive thing I can say about this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not connect at N speeds, maxes out at 65 mbps.","review":"I bought this set it up and would not connect at wireless N speeds. It would max out at 65 mbps. When I reset it, like unplugging it and plugging it back in, I would get the N speeds 150 mbps the first time it connected and would transfer files at that speed, then usually next time I connected it would drop back to 65 or 52 mbps and stay at these speeds. I Googled \\"d-link dir-655 65 mbps max\\" and found that a lot of people are having this problem. Called their support, they didn't have a clue so I returned it and I am looking for something else that will give me 150 mbps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very please with this new router.","review":"We use the internet a lot at our house. We have 3 laptops and one desktop. Plus our HD TV is on WIFI, we use Direct TV Whole home for watching DVR programs in the office, as well as two Direct TV receivers have wired internet connections. We can download content to the DVR from the internet.Thus we use a lot of bandwith.This router is able to handle the loads no problem. Since we increased the WIFI security level, the encryption keys are longer, but that is to be expected.I also like the fact this router shows you what devices are connected. A very nice feature.I would recommend this router."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shareport doesn't work... for anybody.","review":"I purchased this router mainly for its usb shareport ability. It doesn't work though. I went online to see what the problem was. Turns out shareport doesn't work for anybody. It worked when it first came out, but an update to the software rendered it extremely un-reliable. It will connect for about a day, and then you have to reboot the router to get it working again.Total crap product. I wouldn't buy this router if you plan to use its shareport functions. Otherwise, the router works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I bought this router expecting an increase in range and speed compared to my G linksys router.

The router is fast, with only occasional drop connections.About 2 weeks ago, everything changed.

There goes my 100 bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very strong signal and fast!","review":"I bought this router for my 3000 sq ft 2 story house to replace a netgear N router.

Customer support was very helpful once he understood what was going on.

Great speeds when it worked.If you live in an apartment - get a router that has a Dual Band feature and only run your wireless off of the 5 ghz band.A lot of things such as garages, baby monitors etc... run on the 2.4 ghz band and could cause interference, as well as other routers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Features and Price, If It Worked","review":"Wow, are there any really good wireless N routers out there? Maybe one but this isn't it. I researched thoroughly prior to settling on the DIR-655. I was replacing an existing G router because I wanted the higher wireless speed as well as gigabit ethernet. After spending nearly two hours trying to set this up, I gave up. It kept assigning conflicting IP addresses or none at all. I assumed it was defective and ordered a replacement from Amazon. Amazon of course has great service and overnighted one to me. Unfortunately, I had the same exact issue with the replacement.I spent over an hour on the phone both with my ISP (Time Warner) and D-Link. D-Link's tech support is horrible and basically worthless unless it's something obvious. So I ended up returning both units and going with a Netgear N-300. It set up immediately and has worked great so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent for a while","review":"I have this unit 13 months today and the wi-fi quit working. Up until now it was great.

I can see all my neighbors less powerful routers, but not mine. After troubleshooting myself for several hours then on the phone with tech support for 2-3 hours, decided it was defective.

I dont really know much about routers and from what i saw online this was a very well rated router. We use this router for a PC and a Mac and it works with both very well. The set up was very easy except I couldnt get the CD to work on the Mac. I dont notice normal web surfing being any faster but I have noticed that it improved video streaming. Downloading videos from you tube works great.

I'd unplug and plug it back in, which would get me about 5 minutes of connection time before the router would cr4pped out again.

This got annoying - time to upgrade.Waste of money. Yes this was easy to set up, even the least technically inclined person wouldn't have an issue setting this thing up.

It is not. Toshiba support directed me to D-Link support because my new laptop worked fine on all other modes except the new 'n' mode. D-Link's best solution was for me to run my new $125 D-Link router in degraded mode, i.e., any one except 'n'. My old wireless router does that, so I sent it back for a refund. No more D-Link for me! Mode 'n' is not yet finalized anyway so it's best to wait until the standard has its final parameters to meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider another","review":"The Dlink DIR-655 had no noticeable improvement in range and speed over the old DI-624.

It is easier to set up, seems to be slightly faster and have a greater range, and cost a few dollars less. We have been using the TRENDnet for three months and haven't had to reboot it yet.

I reset it rolled back firmware it would not work and stay up when I needed it. I thought at first it was my dsl modem. So I changed that, I changed settings did not fix it, I even searched the blogs to see if I could find a solution no dice same dealio.
