Educational and interesting","review":"One of the best reads of the year, The Washing Machine details how various banks, politicians, terrorists groups, black market dealers, and others launder illegal money to give the appearance of coming from legitimate enterprises. The author is not shy about naming specific banks, groups, and techniques that have been used and follows the money trail from beginning to end. Some of the companies and groups mentioned include the Bank of New York, the Russian Mafia, Al Qaida, and offshore financial entities in Ireland, Turkey, Sri Lanka and other places. The final chapters deal with what the various countries and law enforcement are doing today to help curb the problem. This is a real education in what goes on in the underworld of illegal activities and how the income gets reintegrated back into business enterprises that appear legitimate. The Washing Machine is a highly recommended read for anyone interested in the financial underworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into the criminal underworld!","review":"Mr. Kochan explores the movement of money around the world and around communities plagued by drugs.

The book is straighforward, authoritative, and to the point. Covers a lot of material. Very good value. Some of the descriptions about the difficulty in dealing with heavy weather are so direct in a German sort of a way, that they are funny (I was reading the book initially while sailing upwind in 40-50 knots in our J44. The pounding was intense. The author writes something to the effect that 'in heavy weather, when sailing upwind in a modern, well built boat, it will seem that the boat will break apart from the pounding, but it will not'.

The turntable of the phonograph was warped badly enough to scrape against a particular point in the rear.

Obtaining clear static free sound from both speakers simultaneously took several minutes. It did sound good once this was achieved!Note that TEAC no longer lists this model on their webite and I am assuming it is discontinued.

These are the cheapest made and overpriced headphones on the planet. I am done with Koss and the cheap junk. I waited over 3 months for Koss to ship these and they did not last a week.

Since it was out of stock here, I bought mine from Wal-mart. There are a few problems with it, however. The leg joints are kind of flimsy and the cloak doesn't hang right. Minor design flaws that can be overlooked. On my particular figure, the sword doesn't fit in the scabbard. It appears to be blocked by a bit of plastic shaving. Easily fixed, and I don't think all of the figures are like this.On the up-side, the glow-in-the-dark feature is really nice and well done. He doesn't just glow a little, he's like a mini disaster flood becon. Also, with his left hand being open, the King of the Dead can preform a very nice two-handed sword pose. Definitely a plus. His cloak and under robe come off, so you can strip him down to his bare armor if you like. Not to mention that most of the moving part are made of a rubber material so that less breakage is possible.Overall a great toy.

Two of the most horrible characters I have ever read about. Heroine was inmature, selfish and at times boring. Hero was a complete manipulator, controlling. I never bought the love they felt for one another, she loved him after a one night stand without no particular reason besides him being her first. He refered to her youth so much that at points at though of him as a pedophile, sure she was old enough but she did not act like such. Never did, not even at the end. Horrible story, even worse characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible H & H","review":"I'm a little over half way done with this book and I have to say the H & H are horrid characters. The hero is forever running of their heroine. He's not likable. I know it's typical harlequin, but I absolutely hate how all he has to do is touch her and she forgets why she's so mad at him (usually with good reason). The heroine is as bad, but I really couldn't care what happens to her at this point. There is no chemistry between the characters. I'm only finishing this because I've forced myself to get this far.

I just found myself so appalled by the off-the-wall plot twists and gratuitous violence that I couldn't justify more than 2 stars.Serge is a compelling character, and Dorsey does an elegant job of weaving a dozen or so characters' stories together in this novel. In the process of putting the story together, you get a pretty unappealing look at people in Florida -- homicidal self-serving maniacs dominate the story. At the end of the day I found myself wanting a little more explanation for one homicidal rage in particular (I won't spoil the ending by giving details here).Side note -- I picked this book up because I liked the cover of Torpedo Juice (his latest) and I wanted to start from the beginning. I'm pretty sure I can't stomach another one like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Dorsey","review":"This is an early Tim Dorsey book. Not anywhere close to his later standard. The two main characters (Serge and Coleman) are there, but almost unrecognizable from the later books: Coleman is still in an alcohol/chemical fog, but Serge is more murderous and far less likeable and enjoyable. Dorsey, in this book, does explain that \\"Coleman\\" is not his real name, but a nickname from an incident from childhood involving his drunken father. It explains a lot, in that respect. I'm almost finished with this book, and I'm glad for it. Ready to get on with Dorsey's later, greater stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAUGH OUT LOUD FUNNY!","review":"Tim Dorsey has joined that small cadre of writers (Carl Hiassen, Elmore Leonard, Dave Barry) who make me laugh at the state I grew up in. FLORIDA ROADKILL is outrageous, sometimes ludicrous, but downright funny. I had to move into another room to read the book at night because my laughing kept waking my wife up. Dorsey's characters are hysterical, magnifying the best and worst of human behavior to the utter extreme. His descriptions of Florida, especially Tampa (my hometown), are so dead on I thought I was reading a travel guide. My only real issue is that the plot does take a backseat on occasion as Dorsey pulls out all the stops introducing characters, throwing them together in a neverending series of bizarre encounters, dropping them off and then picking them up again later in the narrative. It's easily forgivable, though, when you're laughing so hard at Dorsey's over-the-top descriptions that your sides hurt. I can't wait for the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Guilty Pleasure","review":"Mr. Dorsey covers much the same terrain as Carl Hiaasen's stories but with an even more sadistic nature. He creates numerous oddball scenarios in which morally-challenged slimeballs meet their doom. I found myself repeatedly laughing despite the profusion of repugnant situations and mounting body count. A fast-paced adventure that left me continually wondering how it was going to end and who would be left standing. Mr. Dorsey's macabre lunacy is somewhat similar to Mr. Hiaasen and Elmore Leonard's works and just as enjoyable. This was the first book I have read of his, but it certainly won't be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!","review":"Ordered based upon first reviewer's comments.

I did enjoy the book but did have a little difficulty keeping up with the introduction of so many characters and then trying to recall them when reintroduced. It all comes together but I did have to look back on occasion to recall the character and their initial role. In my case it was just too much jumping around at times.I did find the book hilarious and was laughing out loud at times. Dorsey certainly has a quirky way of telling a story. Plenty of murder, violence and chaos throughout and intertwined with a good amount of humor. I love the character names--not a bit boring. I will read the next book in the series. I'm not sure I am ready to add Dorsey to my favorite author list but I am drawn to the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"War And Peace In Paradise","review":"If Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, Hunter S.

It's a trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth finishing","review":"I had high hopes when I started this book, but it quickly became tedious. Too many characters, too many disjointed scenes, not enough plot. After getting half way through the book, it just doesn't seem worth the time to finish it. Given the grammatical errors in the book, I was surprised to find out that the author was a reporter, and even more so to find that he had been an editor.Stick with Hiaassen.

Its ending is unbelievable and by mid-book I was bored enough to read the last chapter and put the book out for recycling to the nearest convalescent hospital.

Both write about the great state of Florida where nothing seems to be too outlandish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected...","review":"I bought this believing the hype written on the jacket that said Dorsey's writing was akin to Carl Hiaasen's. While he tries hard to deliver the off-the-wall type of mystery, characters, and suspense that Hiassen does, he falls too short, and only succeeds in delivering a type of madcap plot so complicated with so many different characters you find yourself going back chapters to try and figure out how these people fit together. The loose ends are not tied up at the end, and you are left feeling a \\"HUH?\\" that makes it not worth reading. His delivery is heavy on the crass and light on wit and wryness that is characteristic of Hiaasen. This will be the last Dorsey I read.

These guys really know how to delve into the Florida psyche. Dorsey has used all of the crazy Florida eco-terrorist/politico/bimbo/fisherman/hunter/tourist stereotype plot lines, most borrowed from the above authors, in one single book. What you get is a confusing story with a lot of gratuitous violence and bloodshed thrown in. You don't even care what happens to the main characters. Yes, there are some funny parts, which is why this didn't get the dreaded one-star rating. My advice? Throw this one out and start with \\"Double Whammy\\" or \\"Welcome to Paradise\\". Lots better story telling with a lot less blood and guts.

I ordered this product thinking on all the good reviews and thinking this was the \\"new version\\" of the product but instead it looks like I received the \\"very old\\" version. The package it came on was old. It didn't include foams in different sizes, just one replacement in the same size than the ones it had on. The only pro is that you can use this product as foam ear plugs to block outside noise... but you can also get a pair for less than $1 in your closest pharmacy.

I found them very uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, they do block out sound, at least.","review":"I thought these would be a good travel idea, to block out external noise. That they do, in a small, cheap package. For that, they get a 2 instead of a 1.The bass that is trumpeted by the marketing is certainly there as well. But it simply sounded \\"thuddy and muddy\\" - we're talking quantity over quality in the bass department. In fact, these are probably the worst sounding headphones I've ever used. In the end, I preferred putting up with outside noise in my other phones (a nothing-fancy Sony pair) than listening to these.I also found them quite uncomfortable to wear for extended periods, but that can be a highly personal thing.All in all, the best part of these was taking them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have's","review":"This is my first review of a product.

Trust me, these are well worth the money to try them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your own earplugs","review":"I recently purchased these to have a pair the would make listening on the bus bearable. They failed at one critical point...I was unable to get them in my ears! Despite the range of cushions that came with it, I couldn't get any of them to fit. But after a quick trip to Walgreens (to get nicer earplugs) and a little work with a soldering iron, they live up to their initial purpose. While the sound quality doesn't blow me away, for the price they offer excellent isolation. They block out sound as well as the earplugs would have. One problem is they are extremely bass heavy. While at times that doesn't matter, when I'm listening to classical the balance isn't too good. In summary, you might have to shell out a few more bucks for better earplugs, but after they offer the most isolation of any earbud under 50$."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Bass-heads ONLY","review":"\\"The Plug\\" offers VERY poor balance across the sound spectrum, they are very bass heavy/boomy, resulting in a very muddy sound.

Overall, a poor choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to get more volume with the Rio 500","review":"I found that the Rio 500 did not produce enough volume, especially while I was in the gym.

They can be shipped for 3 dollars or less (no matter how many) very easily so Koss is definitely cheating us here. Used to be 6 dollars and even then they charged individually for these tiny items but you could gain a little over this 12 dollar for new price.Ear buds themselves are fairly good (usually last me about 2 months) when compared to how long most others last at this price and sound is also pretty good. They fit well and stay in good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work under a helmet. Returning it :(","review":"I bought these earbuds specifically to wear while riding a motorcycle. This application requires good sound isolation to protect against dangerous levels of wind noise and a close fit without protrusions poking into the helmet liner. The Plug received good reviews on a few MC forums so I had to try it.The noise isolation is OK, about as good as theKlipsch Image S2 Comfort-Fit Noise-Isolating Earphoneswith silicone mushroom-type seals. The photo of these Kosses is deceptive though, and the plastic part that stays outside your ear is much too big. Not only does it snag on my snug-fitting Shoei each time I remove it, the sharp edges of the silver-colored ring also dig into my earlobes. (The Klipsch are similarly too long, but at least they have no sharp edges.) For any other application these are probably a good value for money.tl;dr if your helmet fits correctly, these won't. I'm returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Sound Quality","review":"I bought these Koss earbuds because they looked like some other Koss earbuds that I had purchased several years ago that I liked a lot.

When I recieved it, i saw that the actual ear piece was like memoory foam which you press and insert into your ear so it can assume the shape and blokck out any un wanted sounds. Well it was nice at first until you wanted to PT. When you sweat, it does not stay in your ear to save the world and after prolonged use, the foam around the air piece gets old and doesn't cooperate any more and then it doesn't fit into your ear any more. On a scale of 1-10, i give it a 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man these Bite!","review":"These are the worst headphones ever. Do not buy! They pop out on a consistent basis (on my 30 minute commute to work on average they pop out, usually out of one ear, 3-4 times). So I'm constantly trying to reinsert them, very troublesome on a subway. I think it's due to the foamy nature of the replaceable plugs. They do not conform to you ear's structure and thus gradually expand over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't plug the plug","review":"I just received the plug and gave it a try on my Nano. I bought the Plug in order to replace the Ipod set which bugs me while running on the treadmill at my local gym. Needless to say I have given up my efforts to get some decent sound out of them. I shoved them as far as I could up my ear canal, up to the point of pain. Sound was mediocre at best compared to the \\"Stock\\" earphones that came with the Ipod. It is of great mystery to me why some of the reviewers gave them such high ratings. Standard Ipod sets are way better.On the other hand I did not expect anything great due to the price.

I found these not only a terribly uncomfortable fit in my ear (when they stayed in), but to have the worst sound I have ever experienced in earphones of any brand.

Dicey at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subwoofer in your head","review":"Greatly enhance deep bass perception. Very comfortable fit. Balanced sound. Come with an extra set of silicon ear plugs. Potential problems: Not too good with treble highs. I recommend that you get it only if your portable device has a minimum 5-band equalizer or if you're not a treble fanatic. Also, the silicon plugs look like they might not last very long, but that's just speculation on my part since I've only had them for a few days. Finally, it insulates from all ambient sounds, so if hearing sounds around you while listening to your portable player is important, then you should consider another design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss \\"The Plug\\" Portable Headphones","review":"Very pleased!I love the spongy ear-cushions, they fit perfectly.

Now try the reference of \\"shallow ears\\".I have tried now several brands of an ear plug headphone and I just can't get one to stay in my ears.The foamy material is great and does mold easily. But eventually the foam tries to expand back to its original shape and thus pops out of my ears.So no fault of the product, my ears must be too shallow for the ear plug's foam to really fill in the holes on the side of my head.So it's back to an over-the-ear clip headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice but id rather something better","review":"They worked great for about a week. Now they anger me. I want my old earbuds that hurt my ears after a few hours that need to be wrapped over my ear to stay on. It takes so much effort to sit there and attempt to scrunch the foam then you need to stick it directly in your ear in under a second (can't miss) otherwise the foam will already be expanded and push back out of your ears. I'm sorry I don't have pin point accuracy sticking objects into my ears. Let me go get a mirror.Then once you finally succed in actually getting them in, you end up fumbling over the small cord and pulling them straight out leaving you with having to scrunch them all over again and take another 15 minutes getting pissed on trying to get them in. I would take them back if I was allowd to!!Yea they have great sound but the foam just stinks. It's to much troubly trying to get them in my ears. However if you have huge ears, these could be for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but with some flaws, worked nice with a mod.","review":"The rubber cilinder that comes with this product is just not flexible enough to keep compressed until you put them on your ears, and most of the people complain about the ear pieces \\"gets out\\" of their ears. you can apply some \\"mods\\" to this product, just google for \\"the plug\\" and \\"koss\\" and you will find some pages on information about making this product better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Sound.

It seems like Koss tried to actively develop lousy sounding earbuds because I can't imagine a beta tester using them and not saying they're garbage.They are uncomfortable.The connection sucks. They are temperamental. Jiggling them causes the sound to sometimes drop out in one ear.The perfect trifecta: I bought them from Radio Shack, used them for a day, and promptly tossed them in the garbage.Do yourself a favor - look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sound, but serious fallout","review":"These headphones are have great sound for the price, but are only good for casual wear. If you plan on doing any kind of exercise, don't waste your money. The foam plugs didn't come close expanding in my ears and continually loosened and fell out at the least amount of jarring. Go for Sennhauser or Sony headphones if you run. It's worth the extra $20 and will save you a ton of time and frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great...","review":"I've owned 2 pairs of these, and they do provide o.k. sound quality for the price. However, I've since switched to another brand of in-ear headphones (JVC Marshmallow--love 'em) due to several shortcomings of this product:- difficulty in acheiving optimum sound: you gotta have these positioned in your ear perfectly to get well-balanced sound- cheap cord: it's too thin and flimsy, tangles too easily- cranial reverb: every bite you take or word you say ressonates through your skull in an unsettling way when you have these on- sound quality isn't really that great compared to the JVCsThere are better value choices out there; I'd recommend skipping these."},{"rating":"1","title":"awfull","review":"these are some of the worse headphones i have tested the sound is horrible and tiny using an ipod touch no bass what so ever. i guess i have not learnt my lesson sony seems to have the best sounding headsets for this price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tinny, underwhelmed, get Philips HE592 instead","review":"As a long time Philips HE592 user I was looking for something better or at least as good. In a head-to-head comparision the results are clear. The Koss require more power on the signal to create the sound (1.5-2x more). The bass is jittery and the overall sound quality poor. There is not nearly as much bass as the HE592. Compared to the HE592 it sounds like you are listening to the playback through a metal can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koss \\"The Plug\\" is a gimic!","review":"When I saw these in the store, I thought cool, but after I got home I came to realise that not only the sound quality is bad, but the damn things don't stay in your ear! Overall I must say this was a waste of my 25 bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for plugging up bronchioles, perhaps","review":"Having stared balefully in the general direction of these earphones for a little over two years now, I am better able to determine their true functionality.Whilst the manufacturer has it that they could be used as an ear phone, I believe they are much more suited as a chocking hazard for three year olds, or perhaps, as knotted recursive afunctional loops.To be fair, during the brief periods in which the earpiece actually stayed in the ear, I could grant that the sound was acceptable for the $43 (AU) price tag. Sadly, however, these moments were few. Far more often, said earpieces would blithely fall upon the user's shoulder, usually at a particularly climatic moment during a song.Oh, sure, you get spare pieces of foam. Spare pieces which also fail to fit into one's ear.Hopefully, as an earlier reviewer noted, Koss has since improved the product, because the only other viable use is probably in plugging bronchioles."},{"rating":"1","title":"No treble","review":"The sound quality is total crap.

I got a pair of these at Circuit City for 7.99 and I love them. They take a little while to get used to. I took about 5 minutes experimenting with the different shapes and sizes of earbuds included in the package until i found the ones perfect for me. They take a little effort to get in your ears the right way but once they're in all other noise disappears and music fills your ears. My only complaint is that they are extremely bassy. I listen to a lot of live and accoustic stuff so all the bass is a little unneccessary, but they still sound great! Perfect for airplanes.Give 'em a try![EDIT] - They do wear out pretty quickly. The cord is too thin and wears out within a few months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good - could do with a tad more treble","review":"I kept seeing these on the rack in my local supermarket for $15 and finally gave in and bought them. I hate wearing full-size headphones, as I wear glasses and the ear pads always jam the arms of my glasses into the sides of my skull and hurt me after a short while. These Koss buds are very comfortable.I also travel on airplanes quite a bit and don't want to fork out the big bucks for hissy noise-cancellation so this seemed like a good compromise. These plugs seal out external noise quite well.They are also reasonably efficient, and have STACKS of bass - sometimes I have to use the EQ on my MP3 player to knock the bass down a bit. The top end is a little bit messy (cymbals don't sound that clear), but the overall performance is very good; considering the price.Very lightweight. Cable is very thin.They came with a set of about 5 replacement sponge ear plugs.No built-in volume control."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I use these mainly for riding the train in NYC and they work very well. All sounds in my favorite songs are clearly heard, you know how you know every instrument in your favorite song. Just make sure you squeeze them down and hold them in your ears until they expand. This is very important for getting the sound exactly right. For $10 they are a great bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A plug for the plug","review":"For an earbud these are amazing. The sound quality rivals much larger, heavier and more expensive traditional circumaural earphones.They key is being sure you position them properly. You'll know when you do because bass notes easily roll off when the seal and orientation of the plug is wrong. To get the most out of these, compress the foam by rolling it in your fingers and immediately put them in your ears. Twist gently to seat them and you will be rewarded with good clear sound.The lifetime warranty is a plus.For the price these represent a truly great value"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought a pair of Koss plugs two years ago that I like a lot and wanted to get a second pair for work. I thought this pair was the same. Unfortunately I was wrong. The quality on these headphones are poor compared to my original pair. The sound quality is bad and the ear buds are samller and are not as comfortable in mye ears. I really enjoy the pair I had bought two years ago and am disapointed Koss has decided to redcue their quality in these head phones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good headphones","review":"These headphones have excellent sound quality, especially in the Bass ranges. The foam pad is very comfortable and does not hurt my ear, even after hours. It requires a little more effort than most headphones to roll the cushion, put it in your ear canal, hold it and wait for it to expand, then carefully remove hand, but it pays off with noise reduction and great sound and a snug fit. The dark purple plastic is a little strange, and they do look funny, but that is a very minor detail. Great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"These are the WORST sounding phones I've ever purchased. I've owned many Koss phones over the years, from full-size headphones to ear buds, and expected Koss quality in these, but was sorely disappointed. They are tinny, fuzzy, with no bass and very little midrange. Nice idea, with the soft cushions, but if the sound isn't there, what's the point? I have a $7 pair of Radio Shack phones that sound 100 times better than these.Giving them to the kid to use on his hand-held video game, because they are useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is my second pair and the left ear plug goes out.

I would definately recomend the headphones to anyone who likes to be active while listening to music, such as exercising, or doing chores around the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are an a budget and don't plan to be mobile...","review":"These are probably the best units in the $12 range. The sound is pretty decent for the price IF IF you get them inserted and postioned correctly. If they are slightly out of perfect insertion (easy to do), either bass or highs will suffer. With that said, I really encourage you to wait until you can save up for something better. As I said, it is a hassle to get a good insertion/fit with these (the pinch/roll/wait for expansion thing is not quick). Once you do, you don't want to move around because they will shift and/or fall out very easily in my experience. This last point is a deal killer for me. Save up $20 more and go with the Sony EX81L if you are on a budget or look at the Shure line if you have money to burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Cheap Earphones","review":"Since I'm used to using studio quality headphones I'm constantly disappointed with that quality of today's portable headphones. I had a set of sony earphones from like 8 years ago that sounded amazing, unfortunately they broke and I haven't found anything comperable.These Koss headphones are the best I've used so far. I used a set of 31 decibel ear plugs with it and the quality is pretty good. It's definitely better than the backphone creative and sony make and is much better than the aiwa back-earphones. I'm still looking for a better set, but these will do for now. I personally like the mute button, too.

The sound quality is excellent, but they are tricky to put in your ear.

For the price range though, I guess it is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother!","review":"First of all, the logistics. It takes some intense acrobatics to get these things in your ear. They're definitely not something you want to slip on and off too frequently, and they do collect earwax. Soundwise, while the \\"plug\\" technique does create impressive bass (although not a very crisp sound, just brute), there is a serious lack of balance in the sound. The upper frequencies are tinny and bland. Save your money and get something better. This is just a gimmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for tiny ears!","review":"I purchased these headphones thinking they might be a good fit for me since they seemed to be good for small ears.However, I have very small ear holes I guess, because these don't even go in. The only way I can use them is to take off the foam and use just the plasic rods in my ears. Wicked uncomfortable..So if you have average sized ear holes I'm sure these would be great, but if you have little ears, look for something else! (I'd love to recommend something, but I can't find any either.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahhhhhhhhh.......","review":"The horrible ear buds that came with my pricey MP3 player not only gave me an earache but were a pain in the neck to keep in place. I could wear these little Koss plugs all day long and never know they're there. And sound quality is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good...","review":"At first, I thought this was the worst sounding set of phones I'd ever bought. That was until I figured out how to wear them properly (after reading some other reviews here, actually).If they're not isolating other sounds, you're not wearing them right. Once you get them set up properly the bass is strong and the isolation is very nice -- it becomes apparent why they included a mute button. The high end is a little weaker than I'd like, which is why I'm not giving it 5 stars, but the bass is about as good as the best stereo monitor phones I've ever bought. And these are much easier to carry around with a MD or MP3 player than normal phones :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for my needs that I have found!","review":"I use mine to listen to the radio while riding my motorcycle.

I have used these earphones in C-130's, 5-Ton Trucks moving through the desert, and Hummers as well. They offer excellent sound insulating properties so that when the ambient noise around you is high the volume does not have to be loud to still enjoy your music... so my ears are not ringing when I take them off after having flown in aircraft and enjoyed my music on my Iriver mp3 player. They are pretty durrable as they have not failed me in this year either. The sound is great also, and the bass is right on top since it is sealed into your ear much like our foam hearing protection is. The replacement foam that comes with the headphones are an excellent touch, and KOSS has my business when it comes to finaly having to replace these headphones. They don't fall out of your ear when you are running PT either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"I bought these to replace the stock iPod earbuds because A) they sound very tinny B) the white wires just make you a walking Apple advertisement.The good: They blow the iPod earbuds out of the water 100 times over. The bass on these little guys is rich and the highs and mids are nice. These are obviously not for audiophiles, but for the price (I paid $10.99) they are absolutely worth it. The in-your-ear design had me hearing my music in a way I had not heard before.The bad: Like everyone is saying, they don't quite fit in you ear as advertised. Keep trying until you hit the sweet spot and keep them there. They may not be suitable for people jogging or working out because I would imagine they would lose their position often if you shuffle around a lot.So one point off for bad ergonomics, four points for great sound and value."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the active user, DON'T BUY","review":"If you are an active user who doesn't dedicate their entire lives to making sure you take good care of your headphones, don't buy these headphones.* The major problem with these headphones is that underneath the removable squishy inserts is a delicate tube that is easily breakable even if the squishy inserts are on the tube. I broke this tube within the first few days of use and had no more use for them.* If you plan on keeping a close watch on these headphones and don't share them with others (therefore not spreading your earwax residue that builds up on the squishy inserts), than by all means buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw away 'expensive' headphones","review":"Bought these earbuds in early June, broken by late September.

Pretty sad when the headphones cost about $12 shipped.The reason for the 2-Stars is that they sound quite good when they work. But, since they only last about three months, paying $48/year is expensive, and a bit too rich for me.Got some Skullcandy phones to try.

The foam did not provide a secure fit, and I always felt like they were on the verge of falling out (which they often did). If they did manage to stay, in they made my ears sore and the sound volume was very poor (probably due to the bad fit).There are definitely better products out there in the under $20 range (like the Panasonic HJE300's I ultimately bought to replace the PLUGs).

I don't use any other ear buds. I like them because they block our noise better than any headset I have used. They are better at blocking out airplane noise than my noise canceling headset that is big and bulky. I listen to audio books on my iPod while mowing the yard and these are the only ear buds I can do that with. Any other buds let in so much noise that I can't understand the book.My wife, on the other hand does not like the way these feel. If you can stand the roll up type of ear plugs then you should be OK with these. If the foam type ear plugs bother you, then these probably will too.

For the most part, they fit nice, but you have to know how to insert them properly.

For me, they fit well, and seem like they'd stay in better than the rubber-tipped earbuds.It's a shame they sound like a Hallmark musical greeting card playing inside a tin coffee can. These are bargain basement earbuds, so I certainly wasn't expecting them to sound like Sennheiser headphones, but I did expect them to at least match the sound quality of my off-brand earbuds that I got for like a dollar and a half on some Chinese *ahem* \\"extreme deal\\" website.

These 'phones literally suck the life out of my music, by destroying its dynamics, detail, rhythm, tonal accuracy, and high frequencies, and then layering a harsh fuzziness on top of that.

You would need to have a very large ear canal to keep them secure & not popping out. Koss gives you different size covers, but all of them do the same thing; within a minute or two, these always pop out. The cord is also unnecessarily long. It is a shame, because they do sound quite good, and when they are in securely, they isolate noise around you, making it possible to hear a great deal of detail in music.

The problem, as others have noted, is getting just the right fit in your ear canals, which seems to have a _large_ effect on the bass as heard. As best I can get them to fit, the bass is a little weak. Very, very light fingertip pressure improved the bass noticeably. But, this is not exactly convenient (besides the fact that you must be VERY careful with hard objects - the tubes - in your ear canals!).

I read the review from 2003 about the description errors BUT, I figured by 2007 amazon would have rectified this issue. Alas, I got bit. My first disappointment with amazon in many years of transactions. Yo AMAZON, if you read this please fix this 4 year old problem! As far as the sound quality these are acceptable ear buds and I will put them to use as travelers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and fit","review":"These in-the-ear headphones, also called \\"earbuds\\", are made of a soft and pliable material that seats snugly in the outer ear canal. This seals out external noise, making it the perfect product for listening to a walkman or IPOD on busy city streets. It saves your hearing because you don't have to turn the volume up loud to drown out ambient sounds. I discarded my IPOD earbuds because these are much better. They deliver a full-range sound -- clear, undistorted, with excellent bass and treble. I find that, to get the best fit and seal, it helps to moisten the earbuds and to pull gently on the pinna (the flap of the ear) while inserting them. After about a year of daily use, the material gets stiff and it's time for a new pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Awesome","review":"These ear buds have a tight, comfortable fit. They act almost like ear plugs to outside noises. They're way better than iPod ear buds; I have my iPod volume to less than an 1/8th. They're more comfortable and won't fall out randomly, as iPod earbuds seemed to do. The one complaint I may have is the bass is a little intense for my liking."},{"rating":"2","title":"God Value","review":"My wife is very hard on earbud type headphones, usually not lasting more than a few weeks per pair. So, I do not want to pay a lot for earbuds. She aso only listens to books on tape, but constantly - so I don't need a lot of high fidelity. These appear to be a good value. We'll se after she opens them (Christmas Stocking stuffer) and has them for a few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Idea, good Product, excelent for travel","review":"I can not tell that theese are the best headphones I ever had.But for this price, the sound is very good.

The squishy tips can get lost easily...ive already lost one...but i love that they mold into your ear. I have the worst luck with anything i have to stick in my ear and im happy to say i have not had any inner ear pain from wearing them for hours at a time...In conclusion...nothing's perfect...4 stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, but not the same plug as in the picture","review":"I wanted the exact product as depicted, the in-ear head phone and since my phones tend to break at the plug, I wanted the bent one. Well, that wasn't deliverd. I wanted to send them back but realized that the last other pair of Koss in-ear head phones I bought here also promised the bent plug, and I got a straight one, therefore, no alternatives.I expect this to break within months, just like the other pair did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I wanted to give earphones a chance because I look totally old school with my behind-the-neck headphones. These worked fine for about a week, then the volume adjuster on the wire gave up and distorted the sound. They isolate you from everything going on around you, which can be dangerous. They're hard to put in and not very comfortable. What a piece of crap, given how much it costs. Don't buy these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Not worth even the twelve bucks...the buds I got for $2 on my last plane ride have as good a sound and are more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No comparison to the slightly more expensive Sony Fontopia line","review":"I bought these as a potential replacement for my Sony MDR-EX51 ear buds (they've lasted around a year and a half). I can best describe these as foam ear plugs with small holes hollowed out, attached to mediocre ear buds. They fit in my ear fine, but they were uncomfortable, and the hole is so small that every time I moved my jaw the hole changed shape and the sound level decreased. Moreover, there is a small plastic tube through the hole that is supposed to assist the cushions in attaching to the sound mechanism itself, but they are fickle and I found that mine quickly (within around 5 minutes) were misaligned so that the cushion part did not fit snugly. I'm not a brand snob at all, but do yourself a favor and get the Sony ear buds because it's definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphone $ for $","review":"I have purchased 10 pairs. Most as gifts for friends. They have amazing range and are very functional. Very small, comfortable, and they put the sound deep into your ear canal. The bass freq. is shockingly low. They are great for anyone who wants a all-around all-star. They are great for working out too. Just squeeze the tip, place into the ear, and they stay put. I would and have recommended these to anybody. Take the pluge , you will never regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be great, now seriously lacking","review":"I've bought these in the past, but they've changed them recently. They used to have a fuller sound, more bass, but now they are tinny sounding. They also used to have a more durable cord and plug, but now they are really much more poorer quality. I'm disappointed. For the price, they're ok, but don't expect much from these barely passable earbuds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor model, not durable, stopped working after 6 mos","review":"I bought this model because it was cheaper than the Sparkplug model in white with an L-shaped plug. Well, the straightness of the plug couldn't withstand normal use, and the audio stopped working because the junction between the wire and the hard part of the plug probably got bent back and forth too much. Good sound and sound-blocking, but not durable if you plan to move your MP3 player in and out of your pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"good price and sound","review":"I use these with my ipod nano while at the gym or doing yardwork. The closed-in ear piece helps keep out the sound of the lawn mower or chatty gym-rats on their cell phones. These also have the deepest bass of any other earbuds I've tried -- too much for some, but those that like rock or metal should dig 'em.A couple things to note: A brand new set might have a few issues with falling out, but once the cushions are \\"broken in\\" they stay in the ear with no problems. Also, the cushions occasionally soak up sweat and become soft and pinched in the ear. Lastly, they are almost alway gross after use!It takes a while to get used to the pressure in the ear, but I can't switch after getting used to these."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap","review":"they were great for about a week then the foam got all mushy and wouden't go in. my advice, save you money and get some real noise cancling ones"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"these headphones are the greatest for the price.pros--GREAT BASS! makes up for the not so good treblenoise-canceling saves you eardrumcheapcons--if you don't know how to put them in, then they wont stay in. they are like foam ear plugs. twist them in your fingers and quickly stick them in your ear and hold them there for about 5 sec.takes time to get used to. they can make your ears a bit sore.can fall out easily, if touched too muchbecause of the cons, I gave it 4 instead of 5. but don't get me wrong, they are great.definately worth your $$$$$"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"wonder if they even tried these out before they began productionthey take half a minute to put on and they dont even stay in.and they break easily.

The Sonys are OK, but Phillips have some really good & inexpensive ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the most comfortable, nor the best sound quality.","review":"I usually have avoided Koss before because of their cheap construction, but after seeing these among other quality headphones, I figured I would give them a try. These promised better sound qualtiy than your average $10 headphones, but after using them for 5 minutes, I realized that I was probably better off buying cheaper headphones. The cords are a really thin guage wire, the \\"ear cushions\\" do not really fit comfortably, and the \\"big bass sound\\" is almost non-existant unless you push and hold them in your ear. All in all they sound really \\"tinny\\" and the midrange is pretty bad.Coming from a pair of sony earbud style headphones(which I used for years before they broke), I think I am going to get rid of these and go back to my trusty old sony headphones...atleast then I know I am getting what I pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb primer","review":"I don't understand the criticism's to this book. This book covers every major teaching of the 4th way on the basic levels of understanding. It's not meant to be a deep comprehensive commentary on the Work. The author accomplishes the task very well. This has been a great help, having had read many of the books on the Work and having joined a group six months ago. The teachings of a true Work group unfold very slowly. A true group isn't about lectures, it's experiential. I highly recommend trying out a work group.

I had gotten 15 and 20 years of flawless service from my previous two sets of earphones before I purchased the A250 phones. Within two months of gentle usage listening to chamber music at modest levels, an intermittent contact developed in the stereo jack. After two email inquiries to Koss did not elicit a response, I installed a new connector myself. A spring clip mount for one earphone self-destructed two months later, and a small metal part within the clip disappeared into my carpeting.

Several of the examples are ultimately the same basic procedure but repeated over and over again. The book lacks the key building blocks essential to learning VBA. I find it hard to believe anyone could learn the language by simply copying these examples without a use case or additional information how to alter the code to make it more useful and flexible.I recommend the Mr. Excel series of VBA books if you really want to learn how to program Office apps, they have been the most productive VBA learning tools I've come across. They build slowly though very useful/real-world problems by adding to the complexity and at a pace that allows you to understand each successive step.Save your money, look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing, bad teaching","review":"After the first 30 pages I got frustrated enough to write this review. Obviously the author does not know that the best strategy to teach a beginner is to use examples and present ideas gradually in the context of complete examples. By page 10 you have procedures, modules, functions, projects and details of how to use a project module with the same name in a different project! Terrible teaching indeed. The side notes and other boxed pedogogical styles are as badly abstract and procedural as the main text. I have gone back and forth for clarification several times and to me that is not a good presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed with this book","review":"I really was disappointed with this book. It lacks for complete examples and details that show how to implement and use VBA functions, commands, and procedures presented in this book. It was hard for me to implement and use most of the Objects, Methods, Properties, etc presented in this book. The readers need to see complete examples in order to understand how it works.This book is suppose to be for beginners, however, it is a more descriptive book of VBA objects, methods, etc rather than a teaching book that takes the reader step by step through the learning process.A lot of typos especially in Excel functions or commands which confused me and wasted a lot of my time trying to find the correct function. I think it is not worth buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for a real beginner","review":"This author has a clear way of explaining the full realm of VBA using all Microsoft Office applications. The hard part is that its not really for the ABSOLUTE beginner. Another problem is that through each step of his writing he makes the assumption that you have a specific need for that specific portion of VBA's abilities and then goes on explaining it like your just going to be able to apply it to your personal programming needs. The sad part is that the author took no time to create a hands on approach so that you could understand and self apply. I would go with a different beginners guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my throat & stomach burn","review":"I think this tea has an unpleasant taste and smell, but I wanted to give it a fair try, so I drank half a mug.

In the late 80s and early 90s, Roxette's star shone brightly with such hits like The Look, Listen To Your Heart, Dress For Success and their last major hit It Must Have Been Love. And then they inspired such bands like Savage Garden whose I Want You sounds like a good rip-off of Joyride. On this collection of hits, you'll find the international release Wish I Could Fly plus three other new songs 5 years later than the rest of the world. But better late than never. Relish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have For Any Pop/Rock Listener","review":"Quite simply, this is one of the best Greatest Hits albums out there. All 16 tracks are wonderful. I have recommended it to several friends, all of whom love it.

While the 1995 release is indeed good and includes many of the same songs, the 2000 release is definitely better, adding a few great tracks in place of a few good/decent ones from the original. If anyone is interested in \\"Greatest Hits 2\\", another great compilation, please contact me.This album has done wonders in my world of music. Typically I only listen to various genres of rock. I had always liked a few of Roxette's songs, but to my recent discovery, had only touched the tip of the iceberg before buying the Greatest Hits.

Also, \\"She Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" is a brilliant piece of simple pop that's perfect for windows-down summertime driving.Buy the US version if you must... but don't say you weren't warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks the set!","review":"Alright, I bought this piece about 4-5 years ago in Israel, and loved it, cause it just rocks. Finding out that it was released in the US only about a year ago just shocked me. That only proves that Americans do not appreciate some good European music...

Well, not new, they're like 6 years old, but thats just the whole deals with european music again.That is a good album, it has the lyrics in the booklet and all, so if you have nothing better to do, you can scare your neighbours by singing along. \\"Hold on tight, you know she's a little bit dangerous... pawawawa!!!\\" Hmm, sorry...Anyways, buy it...

He introduces the book by saying that he'll give techniques to \\"unleash the warrior within\\" but all he does is present a simple idea like 'focus' and then talks about experiences in the SEALS. The book isn't good as a motivational/training guide and it's not good as an informative piece on the SEALS. It's a little of both and that makes it very weak (unless you're training for the SEALS and need to unleash your warrior within at the same time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen it before in better form","review":"This has all been proposed in far better books.

The pre-shave oil works great with either razor.You just place a nickel sized amount in your palm, rub hands together and apply to your face before you lather up with shaving cream. Wait a minute and be amazed at how your blade glides through that 3 day stubble. I am still blown away by how good this is.It would get a 5 star rating, but $18 for 2 oz of oil is a bit of a rip.

Yeah, it costs alot more than EDGE, but I've cut myself maybe 5 times the last 15 years. Before that, it was 5 times a week! Anthony pre-shave works great and you only need a little to cover the area, which for me is the bottom of my neck,where 80% of the cuts seem to occur.

I preface this review as such because the REN oil is a stark contrast to this Anthony product. Your preferences and prior experiences will likely dictate whether this is the product you are after. I found that the Anthony oil applies thick and leaves your skin feeling 'sticky' in a way I was not prepared for from a pre-shave oil. I use it sparingly after wetting my hand with warm water and rubbing the oil for a few seconds before massaging it into my beard. I don't often shave, so, when I do, my whiskers are lengthy--and most often pre-buzzed by a beard trimmer prior to the shave itself.

Her beautiful vocals are destined to be heard nation-wide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Traditional County Offering","review":"Jolie Holliday's album definitely leans toward the traditional side of country music, but is not excessively so. It is still very appealing to people, including me, who are more into modern country music. Jolie's voice is very good, capturing and conveying the emotion and attitude of each song. The songs themsleves are very good too, both music and lyrics. Especially pleasing are \\"All the Good Ones are Gone\\" and \\"A Real Good Day\\". The album came out in 2001, and there has not been another one from Jolie since. That's a pity, and is even more reason to be sure you get this one, especially if you like more traditional country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Good Day.....is a \\"must have\\" CD","review":"This is an outstanding CD.

I thought it was good, the creeper ruled. It is one of my favorie classic monster movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal Opportunity","review":"Just because a movie is bad doesn't mean people won't like it. House of Horrors is a B-schlock classic. Contrived, marginal acting, sub-intelligent plot, low-brow entertainment, fantastic! And I find the contention that poor Rondo Hattan was \\"exploited\\" to be very tiresome. The guy has gone down into cinematic history! He has a solid fan base nearly 60 years after his death. Tom Cruise, Richard Gere and others adored purely on their looks can only hope to be so fondly remembered. I give House of Horrors a B for Bad. And that's damn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Person of Interest","review":"I remember seeing this film on Saturday afternoons.

It is based on the Holmes story \\"The Six Napoleons\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horror, but not a thriller","review":"This is another Universal horror film from the 1940's, when both budgets and quality levels shrank dramatically. \\"House of Horrors\\" is one of the worst of the genre, with an inept cast and an idiotic plot. The only cast member capable of generating either interest or sympathy is Rondo Hatton; the others are forgettable. Interesting only as a curiosity. The real horror here is the astonishing level of ineptitude it took to make a movie this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst type of explotation","review":"The films premise is simple and inept, look how ugly the Creeper is ! Rondo Hatton who was disfigured due to being gassed in the trenches in WW1, which caused his limbs to grow abnormally is throughly exploited in this disgusting attempt at entertainment. Apart from the fact that the Creeper cycle of films were diabolically poor in the first place and that as far as I can remember when it was first released the ads said \\"See the ugliest man in Hollywood, The ugliest man alive\\" as at draw for the audience is a sign of a very very poor production. The only good thing that came out of this cinematic offal is that Hatton ended up marrying one of the most beautiful starlets of the time I cant remember her name but I do remember a reporter asking how she could marry such an ugly man. From a time America should be ashamed of this repugnent trash should be shown to people in an object lesson on how insensitive and ignorant we humans can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw,Cold Electro","review":"This compilation consists of the Swedes Luke Eargoggle, Rutherford, and others from the Stilleben records camp.Their electro has to be heard to be truly described. But its not anything youre used to hearing on the radio or in contemporary pop culture. They use haunting sounds, strange voices, and analogue synthesizers over hard grimy electro rhythms that are clearly headed into the future with a little hint of yesteryear. Most of the time these artists only drop releases on vynl so to have these rare and early works on cd with high quality mastering is very pleasing.Warning: This is real electro not a part of that wrongly titled \\"electroclash\\" fad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful toy!!","review":"I know its expensive but trust me its worth it!!

It is one of the few books that I have started and finished in one sitting. Its prose captures the rhythms and thought patterns that are so prevalent in Chinese culture (the intricate interpersonal politics of love in modern China). I have known characters that could have acted as stand ins for ALL of the characters in the book. Although it is a sad story, it is one that is painfully close to reality and anyone who has lived for many years in China could easily mistake the book for non-fiction.This book is a fascinating look into the heart and soul of a/some/many Chinese women."},{"rating":"2","title":"K Nimmo's evaluation","review":"The book Katherine was a very interesting read, it was very reminiscent of Helen Keller. The story of a very fascinating women living in post-mao China was very interesting. The main character Zebra was the symbol of everything that made up China at that time. Women were not allowed to speak their minds or act out their true feelings. But when Katherine enters her world Zebra's life changes. Katherines westernized views began to change Zebra, for the worst or better whatever way you see it.Zebra begins to realize things about herself with Katherine as well as with a character named Lion Head, a man Zebra feel in love with in the book and then in turn had her heart broken by him. The experience you get from reading Katherine is very good, but I see it as more of a story about a woman realizing her place in life, more then I see it as a story about post-mao China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking emotions, a brilliant piece of work","review":"Never have I been so captured by a book as Katherine.

Ms. Levine is such a clever writer. She writes a great mystery with lots and lots of humor entwined.A blonde socialite hires Jaine to be her ghostwriter. Jaine soon learns that she is working for a wicked stepmother. After a few days on the job, Jaine shows up for work to find her employer murdered. Jaine has made friends with the stepdaughter and doesn't believe she was the killer even though the police think that very thing.After many days of sleuthing, Jaine is sure the mystery is solved and that all loose ends are tied up. However, a surprise ending makes this book riveting until the last page.The writer has many red herrings throughout and just when you think you know you find yourself surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levine is Likeable","review":"\\"Killer Blonde\\" is delightful, and full of the wit and comedy of Laura Levine. Levine fans will not be disappointed. Main character, Jaine, takes a job as a ghostwriter for a rich woman who works out of her bathtub. When the would-be authoress dies, Jaine's heart goes out to the step-daughter, and she tries to clear her as a suspect and find the real murderer. I guessed who the murderer was before the book ended, which tells me that part of the plot was somewhat weak, since I usually don't know whodunit until the end of most books. Entertaining nevertheless, an excellent feature in the Jaine Austen series is that you don't have to read them in order. Buy if you are a Levine fan.

Now I know why this one was left over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough...","review":"I bought these headphones to replace a pair Labtec LT-835s which I'd been using for five years. I am not an audiophile by any means, but the audio quality of these headphones does not meet my expectations. They sound kind of -- echo-y, I guess. Plus, the earcups are too small and the whole unit grips the head much too hard. These factors combine to make it a pain to use the TD-80 for more than 15 minutes at a time.The per-ear volume control sounds interesting (and even useful) but is not well implemented. The position and looseness of the dials makes it easy to jog one while you are putting them on or taking them off, throwing the L-R balance out-of-whack.I'm sending them back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best earphones I have bought","review":"I bought the Koss TD/80 stereophones a long time ago and was impressed with the sound and deep deep bass. I was a little concerned about the tight fit on my head however, the inner headband is made of durable aluminum. This allows it to be bent to adjust to different head sizes. Just be warned not to make the earcups too loose on your head, or else you will not hear as much bass.I recently wanted to upgrade to even better stereophones and picked the Sennheiser eh2200 which are even more expensive than the Koss TD/80. I was surprised to find that the Koss TD/80 produced even better sound and deep bass than the Sennheiser eh2200. This is surprising because the Sennheiser eh2200 are the most popular stereophones I could find on Amazon. So I am returning the Sennheiser eh2200 and sticking with the Koss TD/80."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value - but a little too tight cuz I wear glasses.","review":"For the value, these are good quality headphones. I bought these for work, looking for a cheaper alternative for my old Sony MDR-V600 (which are AWESOME if you want to drop [$$]).I am happy with the sound quality (awesome bass), but the only drawback was the comfort. These don't cover your entire ear, so the pads press on your ear (not too comfortable when you wear them with glasses). But if you can deal with that then these are an excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cans for the money.","review":"I have a set of Grado SR-80's in addition to these Koss TD-80's... the Grados retail for $100 (I paid $80) and have a DYNAMITE sound, just beautiful sounding, open air headphones. However, those do not stand up to backpack carrying too well! Eventually, one of the times I opened them up to solder them I got the left side too hot... these Koss TD-80 headphones were free, but even had I bought them they seem to be cheap, like $35? These TD-80's do not have as good separation and midrange as the Grados. The Grados sound much more airy and spacious and are a lot more comfortable (and they aren't known for their comfort!). If I had to choose one word to describe what I dislike about these cans it would be: muffled. However, for the price I think these are pretty good. These about match the AKG's at my station for sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get them! Spend the Extra money!","review":"I was debating between these and some facier pairs on ebay and boy did I regret it. These are heavy, bulky, and not comfortable on my ears. They sound pretty good, the base is great, but not worth giving up comfort. My neck even hurts wearing these because the headphone are so heavy. Its like putting a textbook on top of your heard for a couple of hours. Its also such a relief when i take them off for my ears. My ears were red.

On the other, it was a touch less satisfying than \\"Line of Vision\\": it almost felt like a first novel by a guy who wanted to take Scott Turow to a new level, rather than a confident second novel that breaks bold new ground.And yet by the time you've finished, you're loving Ellis all over again for making you re-examine facts that seem to point in one direction but turn out to mean something else entirely.So: buy Life Sentence and Line of Vision and decide for yourself which you prefer.

His boss, senator Tully, is running for governor, and in the political world, this causes bad publicity. The plot seems straight forward.

Martin and Debra Carter have their own shocking secret--a secret that was unexpected, and one that is revealed fairly early in the story. But there's more than that one issue for Martin and Debra.There is action and drama throughout the story, making it hard to put down.

I was looking forward to Johnson's second book. I thought we would be reading about Founder Found getting families back together, the struggles of families trying to cope with their problems, why they separated and either stays together or the father left again. We never went into those households. Instead we had to deal with the demons of Zales live and of Franks past and his violence. The main characters were full of problems that took center stage..how depressing. Martin and Debra kept my attention. The other characters had to many issues for one book. In my opinion, putting and keeping families together was not the focus of the book. If men can identify with this story line then their are a lot of our men not sleeping at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 Melodies Pour Rever, Vol. 1 Alain Morisod","review":"Outstanding CD. It took me almost six months to find someplace that had it available and almost two months to receive it once I ordered it.

I highly recommend this to anyone who likes easy listening music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is a wonderful product. The board and pieces are made of excellent quality. The board looks stunning sitting out and the pieces feel great to hold and finger with while playing.The game is also very interesting. I have not yet played on the larger side, but I am looking forward to it. This game has a lot of potential and is a fun way to exercise your mind. I would definitely recommend buying a board with two sides (one small/one bigger) and getting some nice stones. This is an excellent set, albeit expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"boringness","review":"this show was so relaxed and slow paced that if i'm ever having trouble falling asleep all i have to do is just pop in a shingu dvd and i'm off in lala land in no time.

If the viewer can ignore the sometimes self indulgent retelling of Hockney's love life, he/she will be impressed with the true magnificence of his work. Also worth a view for a glimpse of Patrick Procktor's painting. This movie is a must-see if you're an admirer of Hockney's art: his life seems a manifestation of his art."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it.","review":"It is not true that the film made a horrible transfer to DVD. The quality is wonderful, especially for a film that was made in the 70's. In fact, I'd say it was a labor of love for whomever processed the original prints. This is a film about David Hockney so there's no chase scene. I can only speculate that since he is an artist, and artists are a little different from the rest of us, this film is a little different from what you might expect. I think Peter Schlesinger is very pretty and I would like to have gotten to know him better but the film never peers into his personality, and I think that is intentional. I find David Hockney much more attractive in that he is warm, funny, artfully clever, and human. Whether you buy it or rent it, I think you'll get something out of it if you want to know something about David Hockney."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a counterpoint to the reviews already here . . .","review":"I came upon this film by accident; though I was a child of the '60s, David Hockney's work was not known to me. Being introduced to his art in this film was moving and revelatory. Hockney's work is highly accessible and having the subjects pose beside their painted selves was eerie. What struck me most was how perfectly the film captured that more innocent time, the early '70s. Repeated words, happenstance Eros, throwaway conversations, knockings on the same door . . . none of these elements of the film were to me extraneous. Rather, they evoked a time when time was taken to create a mood, a place -- much as did the works of the artist himself, then, and then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!!!","review":"I ordered this DVD and anxiously awaited its arrival only to find a terribly boring and pseudo-intellectual collection of rubbish not worthy of my time. And as another reviewer pointed out, the DVD transfer is abyssmal! For those of you who want to determine for yourselves if this is a decent film, I suggest you try renting it before buying. Believe me, you will be glad you did. And those of you who are willing to learn from my mistake, try satisfying your thirst for knowledge of the life, aesthetic and circle of Hockney with a book or other source (I believe there are other films out there as well). This particular work will leave you feeling robbed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ten very interesting minutes; mostly ultra-boring....","review":"The ten or so minutes showing Hockney painting, are very interesting.

If you feel you just have to see this because you'll do anything \\"Hockney\\", do yourself a favor and rent the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Was This Movie Made For?","review":"David Hockney didn't like this movie. It was way too personal for Hockney (and too explicitly homosexual for the average heterosexual preference). He thought it was going to have a lot about his paintings and him talking about art. Instead it follows his failing relationship with his lover, Peter, who was a major inspiration of his paintings at that time.15% of this film is about art. There's about 8 minutes collectively of Hockney in his studio and painting. One minute of him talking about what's on his mind with art. Six or so, 20 second scenes where they re-create some of his great paintings at that time; and a few scenes where he's being hounded about his production and selling his art. And what's most interesting to me is he was in the middle of painting \\"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\\"- so you see a little of the process of how that painting came about.Take away that 15%, what's left is a homosexual film that's poorly edited."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good fundamentals but lacks practical approaches","review":"The book does a good job introducing the fundamental details of Internet based appplication security concepts for B2C and B2B via applications and web services.

It's not even a documentary, as it claims to be. It's nothing more than an endless collection of movie trailers purporting to be somehow gay-related. The sound and picture quality of all these trailers is uniformly atrocious, to the point where it is frequently difficult to know what you are watching. There is no narration, no analysis and no explanation as to why some of these trailers are included. If you have absolutely nothing to do, your time would be better spent staring at a blank TV screen. Save yourself the pain of watching this abomination.

This one loaded to XP with no problems (deleted other camera manager)and software works well. By using sd/mmc card, I think I can avoid battery problems since the card retains the photos and won't drain the battery. Indoors it needs lots of light but that was no surprise. Outdoors, on a heavily overcast day, the photos were very nice in high and low resolution. Using sd/mmc card, it works as a crude video camera (640x480)...jerky at low frame rate, but pretty amazing for a tiny camera. In fact, Santa would like to keep this one and give his kid the cheapie 640x480. A pro won't like it, but a pro shouldn't be looking at it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this poorly made product.","review":"Received it as a present. Had no problems with the software or drivers (other than it could be slightly better to use). Without an SD card it's pretty worthless, almost no memory. So figure that you'll need to spend as much on a memory card as you do on the camera. The picture quality is decent, low light is horrible, but that much is expected for the price. HOWEVER, after 1-2 weeks of minimal use the camera is now in a continual reboot mode where even the slightest movement causes it to power off and on over and over. This is without dropping it or damaging it in any way. Customer support is fairly useless and non-responsive.

Not sure if I needed it or not at the time of purchase, but it proved to be useful for easily controlling volume.

I purchased the Koss VC20 to insert in the playback circuit when I needed an in-line volume control. The device works perfectly, just as it is supposed to. The only minor drawback is that the notched wheel with which you change the volume setting is rather small and quite sensitive - only a potential disadvantage for folks with large fingers. Overall, I'm totally satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHeap price and it works well.","review":"THe price was right and the thing works as I expected it to.

I don't really want to replace my headset cord and finding a shorter replacement that will fit my JVC headset is turning out to be a challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Volume Control","review":"I bought this because of its volume control. I wasn't looking for sound quality because I use my headset to listen to the news and NPR not music which is why I wasn't concerned about sound quality.

The MS Zune ipod is a great little thing but just doesnt have the volume needed to watch some low volume videos. Ten years ago I loved my Koss volume control with my sony cassette walkman, it made everything Super loud. The new one on the package it says \\"makes volume louder\\" but I cannot make it boost any sound on my Zune or Sony CD walkman, tried with both earbud and over ear phones and the result is always just a slight volume loss (between max with and without device). after purchase I broke down and bought the E5 headphone amp that cost only a little more.If you need any extra volume this is not the device for you. This is perfect if you want an inline volume or extra length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't boost volume","review":"Whereas this device will allow you to adjust the volume, the range is limited from no sound to the volume you'd have without it. I had gotten the [apparently mistaken] impression that it would boost the volume for headphones which had low volume for some sources (like Zune, IPod), but that does not appear to be the case. Since you can always lower the volume on the source (mp3 player, etc.), I'm having a hard time seeing the value of this device - except that in some cases it might be handier to have an inline control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This product is simple in design, however somehow it still sucks. I have owned items like this in the past and never had such a time with them. I plugged everything in, and it worked great, untill I moved, and it began to crackle non-stop. Once I adjusted the volume the slightest bit the music went out all together, if it is not on full volume it is muted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not turn sound up; only turns sound down","review":"I have discovered, as have others, that most modern TVs do not have a simple output jack for headphones. Instead they have a limited volume output set of jacks. The sound coming out of them is set pretty low and you cannot increase it using your remote's volume controls (I guess the manufacturers figure you are going to hook it up to an amp and a theatre sound system, which is not what I wanted to do.) So I heard about this product and it seemed like just the thing I needed to boost volume. Wrong. It has no power source, so if you set the dial on the unit at maximum volume, it comes to your headphones at exactly the same weak strength as emanates from the TV output jacks. All it can do in reality is turn the sound down. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lost mine and was lost without it","review":"This is something you probably won't fully appreciate until you've had one for a while and then lose it. You may not need a headphone extension cord with an inline volume control. But once you get used to having one, you'll find the convenience and functionality are habit forming. The one I lost was in daily use for 3 or 4 years and continued to work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away","review":"I had purchased a volume control at Radio Shack that worked reasonably well -- for about two months, when it broke. So I was looking for something of a bit higher quality. Good reviews here convinced me that this Koss product was just what I needed. Sadly, this is not for anyone who is even remotely an audiophile. When you turn the volume down it dramatically attenuates the high end, so music sounds not just quieter but also has a much narrower dynamic range. This item would probably last much longer than the cheap Radio Shack control, but the sound quality is completely unacceptable. So why do many people on Amazon give it high marks? I have no idea, unless they are listening to books on tape or something else that requires only low audio quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Gadget, 3 Easy questions to make your decision.","review":"I purchased this item with a new pair of headphones for my wife and I to use with our laptop. The Koss volume control does exactly what it's supposed to and is a handy convenience to adjust volume quickly and easily. I didn't notice any signal degradation as a result of having the volume control plugged in-line with the headphones. If you need a little extra cord length then that would be an added benefit. My wife absolutely loves the convenience but I've concluded I could just as easily live without it.Should you buy it? Just answer three questions and you'll have your final answer. 1) Would you prefer a little extra cord length? 2) In everyday headphone use, do you find yourself frequently adjusting the volume? 3) Do you have the extra cash to burn?My wife answered yes to all three while I answered no. Did we keep it? You know what they say, happy wife, happy life. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reduces Bass","review":"This volume control dramatically reduced to amount of bass that goes through it.

However, the late Elizabeth Montgomery infused the character of Samantha Stevens with an unique charm all her own. While Nicole Kidman is an all around better actress, she doesn't possess that quirkiness that made Bewitched a TV hit in the 60's.I liked the movie's novel premise but maybe it should have been a bit more serious in tone. It could have been a scathing commentary on the fickleness of Hollywood.Most of the casting was excellent. There was something lacking in the pacing of the movie. It seemed to drag in spots at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Remake","review":"Okay, I LOVE NICOLE KIDMAN and I believe had the plot been better, she would've made the perfect Samantha. In fact, I'd like to see them cast her in a television role of Samantha!But the plot and Darrin...well, let's just say I was not pleased! Even my kids hated the show. Sure, there were a few cute moments, but the plot was weak and the attempts to make it funny were overdone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Wish I could give it zero stars. A disgrace to the TV show and hard to believe that Oscar winners such as Nicole Kidman and Shirley MacLaine were part of this mess. Calling it a waste of talent is an understatement.

If you loved Bewitched as a classic show, as I did, then I suggest that you don't taint your memories with this awful movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXCELLENT CASTING....and that's all","review":"Nicole Kidman is an ideal choice for playing Samantha.

This movie fails on several levels, as romantic comedy, fantasy, or even as tribute to the original series. Worst of all is the Norah Ephron script. Nicole Kidman as the witch Isabel is a ditz who speaks in a Marilyn Monroe, 'happy birthday Mr. president' cadence. Why she desires to live a normal human life isn't explained. Her fascination and awe with simple every day mortal things like turning on a lawn sprinkler or opening a can of soda seems bizarre, as she has no problems using a credit card or driving a car. She has no chemistry with her costar Will Ferrell who's poor performance is also partly the fault of the poorly written script. Did Nora Ephron even like the original series?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewitched has been bestunk","review":"will ferell is pretty funny in this movie, but the whole idea was stupid, they shoul've made a movie based on the show not the way they did it.

I usually put off movies if reviews are bad but this one looked like maybe since it wasn't hyped so much it would be the surprise hit of the summer. I was wrong. This movie was not funny. I love Will Ferrell but he is just annoying in this part. Whiny and self absorbed. Also the plot is full of wholes and characters pop up into the plot for no real reason except to have another character. The part that actually got good was towards the end. If they would have cut out half the movie at the beginning and started from the end this movie may have worked but since they didn't the movie also didn't work. I did like the innocent jokes that Nicole Kidman had but even after a while the boredom had taken over and it was hard to even muster a laugh. My advise if you want to see this movie wait until it is on video and then wait until it goes to cheap rentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Movie","review":"It seems that any TV show can be a movie, especially the hugely popular Bewitched. The story of a married witch, and her husband who doesn't like her to use her special powers. Every so often - the mother-in-law would stop in (Samantha's mother Endora) who, of course, was a witch too - and thought that her son-in-law was a damn fool, he didn't like her either.In the movie: Samantha will be played by Nicole Kidman. Darrin will be played by Will Ferrell. Endora will be played by Shirley MacLaine.With the release of the movie, you can bet that episodes of the TV show will be released on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good!","review":"I'm not a big fan of either Will Farrell or Nicole Kidman, but I love this movie! It's a really clever twist on the series Bewitched, paying a nice homage without trying to recreate it. Farrell and Kidman have a fairly good on-screen chemistry (no sizzle, but not bad) but they play off each other really well. Michael Caine and Shirley McClain are great (what else could they be) and the other minor characters are original and hysterical.My only slight downside - Kidman's Isabel looks amazing similar to Meg Ryan's Kathleen Kelley in You've Got Mail (I think the score is actually the same at times!). Not surprising, since Nora Ephron directed both, and they are both charming in both roles.Nice, light, clever, feel good movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fluff","review":"This is mild fluff comedy.

But this is the one. The script is nearly non-existent, the direction is inept, and Kidman and Ferrell overact so badly one hopes both of them stay away from comedy for a very, very long time. While trying to be a sweet romantic comedy, the amount of unfunny improvisation from Ferrell and the over-the top acting make this movie into an amateur night at the community theatre. Ephron was trying to skewer the industry, but misguided attempts at humor and the horrible script makes this movie more of an industry joke than commentary on the industry itself. I'm surprised this movie actually got a theatrical release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flop!","review":"Bewitched was my all time favorite TV show when i was growing up and in high school. Again, outside of Shirley as Endora, the story, cast and everything else was very disappointing. Why does Hollywood think that they can improve on the classics? Out of all the years this show ran couldn't they have been somewhat or at least a little creative? This is an extremely poor film and whoever told Nicole she could act? I've seen this poor girl in all kinds of films and she is still a lozy actress. Don't you think by now that someone would have told her? Don't waste you money on this one folks especially if you in my generation of the 50's/60's. Of course kids of today who don't know what good acting is because of special effects might like this film somewhat. This is the first time i wish i could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star simply for the stars and director showing up for work.","review":"This movie is so bad in plot, concept and casting it defies rationale or explanation. Why couldn't they have just played it straight, instead of creating the inane plot within a plot about the TV show remake, etc. They could have had an all star cast with Dr. Bombay, Serena, and others. At least they had they had Aunt Clara, who could have been far more bumbling than she was played by the reliable Carole Shelley. Nicole Kidman needs a vacation; she is way too overexposed and between this bomb and the other trash, \\"Stepford Wives\\", maybe she DID need Tommy Cruise to micromanage her career after all. Ferrell's antics are old and tired in a poor man's Jim Carrey sort of way- just miss this \\"Bewitched\\" - stick with the original TV show!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Acting, Thin story","review":"As a true fan of the original TV show Bewitched I hoped for something entertaining and enjoyable. Will Ferrell is, as usual, a crappy actor. Nicole Kidman's character is extremely naive and childish for someone who is supposed to be centuries old. It was a silly boy meets girl movie, that I'm glad I did not pay to see at the theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Way to Spend Some Time","review":"I don't like remakes of TV shows or movies. I don't think you can ever top the original. So far, I have been right. (My opinion, of course.) I grew up watching the original Bewitched and loved it. I loved this movie too because it was NOT a copy of the show, done with different actors. Of course, if you are younger, none of that matters. Will Farrell was wonderful in his role as the self absorbed actor gone zany by a spell that is cast over him. Zany is what he does best. Nicole Kidman was also perfect in her role as the innocent, not of this world witch. The supporting cast and Characters, good also. This is fluff, but full of laughs and fun. Not for everyone... If you like drama, suspense, violence, etc. you will not be pleased. There is a good amount of swearing, though, so decide if you want your young ones to view. Too bad, because it would have been fine for them if not for that. Sweet and Fun--that sums it all up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered am I","review":"It starts off strong and then dwindles into boredom. Nicole Kidman and Michael Caine rise above the poorly written script. I am not a Will Farrell fan. I find him annoyingly stupid . . . and this movie is no exception. I think Will Farrell is an acquired taste like Benny Hill . . . and obviously I haven't acquired it. I am not sure why they picked him as Darren . . . He is a weird choice . . . I think Jim Carey would have made more sense. I say check this movie out even though it is terrible. It is so strange you have to see it to believe it. The whole real witch being cast in a remake of Bewitched was an interesting idea . . . just poorly done.

I bought it for Nora Ephron, whose comedy \\"Mixed Nuts\\" is a favorite of mine. But the film is awful: unfunny, uninteresting, and even irritating. Kidman is sooooo cute. Will Ferrell is sooooo forgettable. The casting is extraordinarily poor. (Shirley Maclaine looks as though she is embalmed.) The weak script descended to a car chase to keep the teens interested.

Will Farrell was more annoying, unfunny and awkward than ever throughout the whole thing. I don't know who keeps casting this guy. (-2 Stars) Nicole Kidman really did what she could to try saving this thing.(2 Stars for Nicole for really looking and playing the part well.)The only highpoints of this debacle where Shirley Maclaine and Michael Caine. Two dreadfully underutilized veteran actors in this film who completely steal the show in every scene they are in.

Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, Shirley MacLaine, Michael Caine, Nora Ephron, a beloved story: they sound like the perfect ingredients for a great movie, right?Wrong.Not even all those talents on and off screen are able to save this lame movie, which manages not to hit a single funny or entertaining note.

The breezy feeling that I always got while watching the TV series did not happen, even though it was nice to hear the theme music. I have always been a fan of Nora Ephron, and I can't imagine what happened here. I think there was a lot a careful calculation going into the TV show. Everything was fine tuned into something that seemed weightless and ethereal. When Samantha served Darrin a cocktail after his long days at work you could almost feel the weight shift off of your shoulders. There was a summery feeling to the series, and even though I think Ephron was searching for a way to connect into that somehow, she got lost in a maze of possibilities that didn't pan out. I got the feeling that she never actually looked forward to the show every week, that she never sat in a dimly lit living room somewhere waiting to be transported for 30 minutes. I just wish she had left it for someone who had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has moments to shine but not enough to make this a good movie","review":"I have watched a few bewitched tv episodes and it was ok butr the movie should not be called bewitched.

Not only did it not pay homage to the TV series, it seemed like an insult to it. Characters were not funny or likable. This film was boring and predictable. I gave it 2 stars because I made it through the whole thing although I'm not sure how."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfortunate Embarrassment for Everyone Involved","review":"Hands down, one of the WORST movies of 2005. Perhaps of all time. And to add insult to injury, it's supposedly an \\"homage\\" to the witty, sexy, timeless sitcom of the same name. Definitely one of those \\"What the heck were they thinking!?\\" projects that was not worth the wait. But the first seasons of the Elizabeth Montgomery series instead and don't waste your money here---or encourage the industry to do more of these unfunny, insipid \\"update/remakes\\" of classic TV series.

This movie fit this catagory.I have no idea why Nicole Kidman was in this movie. I will now be leary of her movies after this diaster. As for Will Ferrell, he is bad. Whoever ever thought it was a good to cast him. This guy is a terrible actor who starts off annoying and gets more and more annoying as the movie moves on. In the future I will avoid anything he is in.Save your time and money on this dog with fleas!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, horrible, HORRIBLE! Shame on you, Ms. Kidman...","review":"After the debacle of \\"Stepford Wives\\", one would think that Nicole Kidman's next offering would at least be a step up. Not so with this film. Granted, Nicole Kidman is a great actress, adept at doing exactly what director's want her to do. In this case, Ms. Ephron (hardly a director of note) instructed Kidman to adhere to the script- a rambling, boring, high-concept/ hardly inspired mess that negates any magic the original TV show had (you know you're in trouble when they rely SHOWING THE SHOW to instruct the entertainment).There are a handful of funny moments- Steve Carell's Paul Lynde impression, Amy Sedaris' too-brief stint as Mrs. Kravitz, but these aren't enough to raise this to even tolerable status."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewitched","review":"Bewitched was a great movie. It wasn't the bebst ever but it was good. Towards the end it got a little boring but........ a lot of movies are like that. It was not really like the real show Bewitched but thats ok!Bewitched is focused about a witch (Nicole Kidman) who wants to quit being a witch and wants to have a normal life. Of course she is clueless about having a normal life. When a has-been director wants to make a remake of the famous TV show 'Bewitched' he needs to find the girl who will stay quiet and let him rule the show. He finds the witch and casts her as Samantha in the TV show. The witch then finds herself falling for the director (Will Ferrel) until she figures out the real him, she decides to get back at him whichever way she wants.In conclusion, Bewitched was good but also got boring. I think they could delete all the parts of them dating because it is boring watching them do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of talent","review":"This is a good example of wasted talent. Either Hollywood is running out of ideas or this was someone's sick and twisted tax deduction loss. The writers could have come up with a better story by looking at actual past episodes. Will's acting is getting a little old now. His characters are too similar to his previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewitched sucked!","review":"That movie is the biggest waste of film I have been to in a very long time. IT was boring, hardly kept me awake. I will never go to a will farrel movie. He really stunk it up. I would love to have the seven bucks I wasted on that piece of trash. Will would do better driving a ice cream truck than trying wayyyy to hard to be funny. I would buy a cone as long as he didnt try to be clever or cute or funny since he cant pull off any of the above!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming, light comedy","review":"It was a light, charming little comedy and found Nicole Kidman as delightful as always. I'm not certain why others found it so dreadful; the movie was as portrayed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its like a 1940's love story with more magic and twists","review":"I won't go into plot points since other reviews have covered that. But if you were expecting the original bewitched you might be disappointed because the old one was all about(Samantha) where this one is more split evenly between the couple as well as the supporting cast. The love story between Kidman and Ferrell reminded me of Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn, \\"Bringing Up Baby, Holiday. Sure its a bit silly, unbelievable, and there are some jokes for jokes sake but its the innocence of it all that makes it so bewitching :)I felt good after watching this movie in a way that reminds me of the old love stories. On top of loving the story, Kidman's performance was amazing. How she so subtly changes her voice to fit the role and expressions I have never seen from her before. It was a real pleasure. Ferrell was also enjoyable for me because the strength of Kidman's character really complimented his goofiness. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Awful!","review":"This movie was so horrible I fell asleep for a bit while watching. I used to love watching reruns of this in the eighties as a little girl. I was so delighted there was going to be a movie. This movie was something trying to masquerade as \\"bewitched\\" It sucked. Did Nicole Kidman read the script before she signed on the dotted line? Will Ferrel was terrible, he was so bad. They should be ashamed of this movie. It was not funny! I didn't laugh once. The romance they tried to create didn't work! Kidman and Ferrell=no chemistry. It's been a while since I've seen a movie this bad, honestly. I was embarassed for these actors who are some of the best Michael Caine for one. This is one of the worse movie scripts and remakes I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bewitched","review":"I found parts of the movie mildly entertaining. I actually found the free original episodes that came with it more worth the money spent. I was totally appalled at the comment about Hepatitis C. If someone had any other life threatening disease would it have been made light of in a movie of this caliber? I think not.I was left totally disillusioned and disappointed and very glad I didn't let my grand-children watch this obviously prejudiced movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"Anybody who knows the original TV series to any length will be able to see how the whole industry can't hold a candle to what it once was (just as proven by the Beverly Hillbillies and other such movies - do you really believe there's an actor on the planet today that can hold a candle to Irene Ryan?). Why anybody likes Will Ferrell in the first place is beyond me. He's a baboon faced Jim Carrey wannabe with a 5 year old brain. Kidman is as cute as always, but come on - if you think any of these actors even come close to having the skills of Montgomery and the rest, you're a moron. Have you seen the original Uncle Arthur, Aunt Clara, Gladys Kravitz, etc?. \\"probally the most Romantic Comedy I have seen\\"??? Your critique is equivalent to your grammar. All that consider this romantic please stay away from us folks in the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Worse...","review":"Ok, Nicole Kidman is a fantastic actress and there could not have been a better choice for Samantha, except of course Elizabeth Montgomery. Will Ferrell on the other hand? I don't know about the rest of the moviegoing public, but I've grown weary of him. So many movies in so little time, with so little range, of course he's going to wear thin. Michael Caine is quite good, but aside from a few magical moments, the movie was underwritten, overacted, and sadly underwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, blah!","review":"This movie really tanked, sorry to say. Nicole Kidman was terrific in her role, but the script was lousy, there was nothing funny about it, and everyone left the theater feeling let-down. The only good thing about this film was the cute house they had Nicole's character living in; I kept staring at the architecture and the decor. I spent most of my time during the film wishing I could live in a cute little cottage like hers. But the movie itself was just plain awful. When is Hollywood going to get it? It's all about the script, folks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwww","review":"Bewitched is not funny. Kidman is annoying and Ferrel is misscast. His Darren isnt funny at all because it relies on 50s humor. The plot is as thin as paper and the spin of actor playing actors playing the characters isnt genious. Carell is great though, the only shining star in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comedy Fantasy","review":"A fun movie. Predictable storyline but well acted with some good one liners and some good sight gags. There is nothing deep and meaningful in this movie so it is ideal for some light entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cursed not Bewitched","review":"This movie was a total disappointment. Although Nicole Kidman does resemble Elizabeth Montgomery, especially her nose, the movie just wasn't worthy of her. I do not find Will Ferrell to be in the least funny, nor was he anything like Darren. There was no chemisty in the movie. It was completely boring, in my opinion. I loved the series and am purchasing it as it comes out on dvd, but I have no desire to own this movie. Bad casting, other than Nicole, and weak, boring plotline are my reasons for letting it sit on the shelf. Absolutely nothing magical about it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away...","review":"Under no circumstances submit yourself to this abomination of a movie. You can actually feel your IQ drop as the movie progresses (the same effect was also detected when watching an episode of The Anna Nicole Smith Show). The only way i'd ever watch this again is if Mystery Science Theater 3000 came out of retirement. You've been warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, really Boring!!","review":"Boy this movie was really, really boring. I can respect they tried to put a twist on the old tv show plot but frankly if you were attracted to this movie in the first place it's because of the old tv show. The plot's really convoluted where the plots between the tv show the characters are making and their real lives run on parallel courses but with diffferent supporting characters. Then nicole kidman's character reveals the power to turn back time so she can undo unraveling plot points like they never happened, geesh. The entire time there is no chemistry between the two leads, Will Farrell was probably not the best casting decision either for the guy, for the most part, was supposed to be the up-tight straight man basically killing any potential humor unless you're tickled by Will Farrell's antics whom serves the purpose of Jim Carrey in latter-day Jim Carrie comedies."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have been warned!!!!","review":"I bought this hoping to watch a nostalgic G rated movie, but I got a D rated instead- D as in dumb. The plot has an IQ below room temperture.I forced myself to watch the whole thing since I paid $12.00 for it, but should have trusted my first reaction and pulled the plug. ANY of the original TV series is better than this bomb.If you already bought this, don't tell your friends you've seen it.I'll just add this to my free AOL disks that I'm gluing together."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Classic TV Series Ruined","review":"I've never been a big fan of TV shows turned into movies. I can't think of one that was any good; However, I had high hopes for one of my favorite classic TV shows in the hands of Nora Ephron. Wow, was I disappointed! In the special features Ephron talks about how the movie would have failed if they simply remade the TV show, and maybe she's right, but what she created was downright terrible. The normally great Nicole Kidman was horrible and not even the usually funny Will Ferrell could save this bad movie. The entire plot is silly. If you liked the classic TV show, don't rent this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disgrace! SAVE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I'm a huge fan of the original TV series. This trash in no way, shape or form has any resemblance to the TV classic. NONE! It looks like the script was written by a high school freshman. It's amazing that this was put out by a studio. They should be ashamed. Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bewitched","review":"Absolutely loved this movie! Nicole Kidman is awesome in this role! Highly recommend this movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think it was that bad","review":"Ok so maybe I wouldn't have cast Will Ferrel as Darren but still it wasn't as bad as that. I think the movie was just as fantastic (fantasy-land i mean, not awesome) as the tv show. I thought all the actors did a pretty good job since it was a comedy. I thought it was pretty funny; maybe not laugh out loud funny, but amusing, diverting funny which can be just as good. I was at first a little distracted by Nicole Kidman in a comedy role but strangely, it worked. Same goes for Michael Caine. I liked it. And by the end, I thought the whole Will Ferrel thing worked ok too. The entire movie smacks of being a musical even though it isn't but its so ridiculous (in a good way) that I think it would have been better as a musical. As for the chemistry, yeah there was no sexual tension, but it was a much sweeter thing than that: Isabel is in love, experiencing new things and emotions for the first time, and i think them as a couple sort of worked out quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed it","review":"I enjoyed this movie. I saw it in the movie theatre though and it was one of those few days where I get off to the movies and leave my hubby at home with all the kids. Since I tend to be happy anytime I'm having a moment to myself my opinion of the movie could have been skewed by the mere pleasantry of having a moment alone!! Having said that, I saw the tv series and knew going in this was not an exact remake. I thought it was very cute and enjoyable to watch. It even made me almost like Nicole Kidman who up until now was not a favorite actress of mine. I thought she was very enjoyable in this movie and I found it to be a lot of fun. Not the funniest movie I've ever seen but I'm pretty hard on comedies. They are my favorite genre and I like them to be laugh out loud funny. I don't give 5 stars to any movie unless it's got me rolling in the aisles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"this movie is horrible! I bet all of those in it hope it disappears. Nicole Kidman is good in it but the overall story is very boring, this is a waste of money and time, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star just because of Michael Caine","review":"The movie is a total failure but seems that Michael Caine could even shine on this one. He is the total actor but I cannot imagine the life of me, WHY he got involved in this garbage of movie. I hated the Ferrel guy, annoying actor! And the one that looks like Tom Cruise. It seems to me that Nicole got involved in this movie to shred her bitterness on her ex. The plotline, the guy that is disguised as her ex, all seems clues to the real motive of this bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad!","review":"This movie was so bad I wouldn't even give it one star!

I still love Nicole and Will as actors but they should have skipped this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT","review":"THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD ITS PAINFUL! Honestly, I dont know what nicole kidman was thinking. Its really horrible. Dont waste your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kidman is NO Montgomery!","review":"I gave this upcoming flick two stars rather than one or none because it appears to have a decent director and Shirley Maclaine will probably be excellent in the Endora(esqe) role ... and of course I haven't seen it yet. However, to cast Nicole Kidman in a role based on that created by the magnificent Elizabeth Montgomery is utterly ridiculous. Nicole is an over-rated, mediocre actress who isn't capable of offering the charm and depth to the character that Montgomery did in the original.Yes, I am a huge Elizabeth Montgomery fan and it would be nearly impossible to live up to her legend in my opinion, but Kidman is far from the answer for me. If the powers-that-be had cared more about the \\"art\\" of the project and less about having a box-office hit, they might have chosen a better route and used an unknown actress to play the part!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Sad","review":"So a movie version of the TV classic. Yeah, right. The characters are not the same, they are only borrowing the title to draw people in. It's gonna be horrible, and almost certainly a huge flop. Even if you are going to \\"remake\\" something like this, you can't betray your audience by changing the characters. Since I'm all thumbs, I'll give this ten thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bedeviled, yes ... Bewitched, never!","review":"What a huge disappointment! We watched this film as a family and not one of us liked it including my daughters who are fifteen and nine. This film banked on the success of the TV sitcom and threw in a few big name actors. The storyline was weak, the script was bad and the acting??? Michael Caine was the only redeeming quality and therefore is entitled to the one star I gave it. Even Shirley MacLaine seemed to act as though her name alone could carry her. If you're a fan of Elizabeth Montgomery's Bewitched don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, awful, horrible, wretched, boring!","review":"This movie is not-at-all what it pretends to be. You'd think you'd be getting a humorous re-telling -- something in the spirit of \\"The Brady Bunch\\" movie perhaps -- think again. This contrived mess features a skeletal plot about a humorless Will Ferrell trying to get a completely unenthusiastic Nicole Kidman to do a new TV show based on \\"Bewitched\\". Within 10 minutes, one feels that he/she is already fed up with this movie, but willing to give it a chance as I was. Don't give it a chance. It stinks. This movie is terrible. This is perhaps the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life, and let me assure you, I am one serious movie buff. I cannot use the language I want on Amazon to describe this movie, because my review would be censored. Don't waste a dime on this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN ALL MY STARS! WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!","review":"I loved the TV series, and I think Elizabeth Montgomery would turn in her grave, this movie is so bad! This is Nicole Kidman at her most hateful. That stupid little voice she put on. If this were the first movie I've ever seen with her in it, I would never watch another movie with her in it. Will Farrell was just as hateful.The idea was good that they were going to do a remake of the series in the movie, but the writing was so bad. Another movie that is an insult to human kind. Hollywood must think we are really stupid to fall for this movie. It could be that little kids will like it, but for an adult, no way! I don't think I can watch a Nicole Kidman movie after this. I have no respect for her work after this.I was very dissapointed in this movie. The TV series was so wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So poor","review":"Incredibly poor. The scenario is one of the weakest script ever written. It looks like they improvised a minute before shooting.No originality at all, nothing funny, nothing interesting, nothing new. There is no story, no plot. Totally flat, inconsistent, unbelievable, illogical.Nicole Kidman is as nice as usual, but the fact that she plays such an idiotic witch is not at her advantage.The only good part is the 30\\" extract from the original 1964's bewitched...Pathetic, a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bewitching good time!","review":"A bewitching good time at the movies.Guys will love Nicole Kidman,Girls will love Will Farrell.Will Farrell is a riot, whileNicole Kidman is adorable!Magical Chemistry!5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have loved...","review":"This is how I imagined this movie would be...I imagined a woman named Samantha living in modern day New York, who happens to be a witch. She meets and marries a mortal man, who happens to be one of the top advertising men in New York. Now, I see them moving into a nice house (preferably the same \\"modernized\\" house from the series). And across the street live a couple, whose wife is VERY nosy; their name: the Kravitz's. And the rest of the movie would be about this couples' misadventures with Samantha's bothersome mother (Endora), father (Maurice), aunt (Clara), uncle (Arthur), cousin (Serena), and all the other meddling friends and family. I do, however agree with the casting of Nicole Kidman. I think that she will somewhat do the role justice to the late, great Elizabeth Montgomery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than I expected","review":"When I first noticed Bewitched on the rental store shelves, I tried to recall its run in theatres, and couldn't. This didn't improve my opinion, since most direct-to-video films aren't deserving of being pressed onto DVD. Nonetheless, I usually love what Will Ferrell has done in TV and film, and Nicole Kidman is even more adorable at (almost) 40 than she was at 20, so I decided to try it out.What a pleasant surprise! A cute story, excellent pacing, and fine acting by the headliners and secondary cast, make for a fun, inoffensive take on the '60s classic TV show. Kidman is charming and Ferrell delivers a bit of his over-the-top expressioned comedy that turned films like \\"Old School\\" into hits. It's very re-watchable, so I'd suggest you skip the rental and just pick up a new copy for twice the cost, and save much more in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER GOOD EXAMPLE OF BAD MOVIEMAKING!!!","review":"Horror of horrors who would even try to duplicate the classic sitcom's premise??? Why would anyone want to fill Elizabeth Montgomery and Dick York's shoes?? No one ever could. This film failed at the box office and with good reason. Most movies based on popular sitcoms always fail because they cannot match up to the genius of the original. Hollywood must be desperate for stories to do this. The script is bad, the acting is bad....everything about this is a good example of bad movie making!! Hollywood needs to stop doing this!!

The film is a remake of the old Bewitched TV series with a fun little twist on it. Funny that I'm not really a Nicole Kidman fan but she dazzles in this film and really, no one else could have played her part as well. Will Ferrell was just as funny as usual and to be honest I really can't see someone else playing the roll either. This is just one of those funny film that leaves you smiling when it ends. The film is good for the whole family and I would strongly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN! FLEE!","review":"There are not enough expletives in the English language to describe just how awful this circular piece of trash is. Use it as a small frisbee. You will get more enjoyment out of it.Inspired by the popular television, \\"Bewitched\\" sports some big names, and completely squanders their talent, (which is not insignificant). The fact that people like Nicole Kidman, Will Ferrell, Michael Caine and Shirley MacLaine could not lift this foul stench of a movie above the cesspit of mediocrity should sound warning bells to all and sundry.This movie succeeded in putting me off anything with Will Ferrell in it for a very long time, (I am still in therapy and dealing with deep emotional scarring). Only now have I started to give his movies a chance, and enjoy them.Basically, avoid this movie. Find a blackboard and run your fingernails down it. You will enjoy yourself a whole lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only good thing was Uncle Arthur","review":"I would save my money in buying this movie: story line is awful, and Nicole Kidman is no match for Elizabeth Montgramey. The only good thing that I like in this movie was the small bit part that featured Uncle Arthur."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and funny","review":"I'm not really sure why this film seems to be rated so poorly. It's a cute, light film about a modern day Bewitched. I think some people were expecting a simple story about the actual show, I think this film was better because it avoided that easy storyline and went for something a bit more involved. The story is about the remaking of the classic television show Bewitched but this time it's been retooled so that Darrin is the star (Ferrell). In comes Samantha (Kidman) who actually is a witch and hilarity ensues. I really enjoyed the film and thought both Kidman and Ferell had some very funny moments. I also thought their supporting cast was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideous","review":"Absolutely the worst movie I saw in a theater during 2005.

Excellent resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have","review":"Being a new parent, and starting it off with a bang - having a preemie/sick child is not easy. All the Doctor/nurse jargon is hard to keep up with.

This literally is the complete \\"preemies for dummies\\" guide. Throughout the book, they even place commons questions and answers- which are really helpful considering there are so many questions to ask when one finds out that there baby is at risk for prematurity. It starts with your baby in utero - through your childs first years after the premature birth. Also, this edition is the older edition, so it's not as expensive (I found mine used $5- but was told that it was practically the exact same thing as the newer edition) Great book, my husband and I feel we are well prepared now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential for all parents of Preemies!","review":"When my daughter was born at 27 weeks I bought about 8 books about Preemies! This is the ONLY one that I would recommend to other parents. It is easy find answers to specific questions and explains things very clearly. While there is no substitute for getting an explanation directly from your child's neonatologist, the book often gave me enough information to ask better questions and ask about things that may not have been addressed. I found this book to be an excellent resource even after my daughter left the NICU. That was a little over 2 years ago and I have a happy,healthy,beautiful, and very smart little girl! Get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference for Parents of Preemies","review":"My parents bought this for my husband and I two weeks ago when our little girl was born at 29 weeks. We have both found this book very helpful. My husband read is constantly while I was still hospitalized and I have been reading it since I came home. The NICU is an overwhelming place, and the nurses and doctors do their best to explain things in terms us non-medical people can understand. This book has thus far proven to be an excellent source we can reference on our own. It explains things in lay terms and the glossary in the back is excellent. If we don't understand something the nurse has told us, we just find it in this book and read on it. It has really helped to keep us calm and informed.I definately recommend this book. We will keep this book for as long as we need it and I'm sure it will continue to be helpful as our little blessing grows up."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete guide for parents of preemies","review":"With segments written by doctors & parents, this guide is a complete volume for all your questions.

The first chapter, detailing the author's escape from France during the Nazi German invasion, is dramatic and somewhat interesting. The rest of the book consists of short sketches dealing with German history from World War I to Hitler. It says very little and since the book lack notes, it could even be somewhat confusing to those ill versed in German history.The author was a dissident Nazi, expelled from the NSDAP by Hitler himself, and hence forced to flee for his life when the Nazis took power in Germany in 1933. Otto Strasser's brother Gregor was another Nazi dissident, murdered at Hitler's orders in 1934 during the \\"night of the long knives\\". However, this particular book says relatively little about this. A more interesting work by Otto Strasser is \\"Hitler and I\\", reviewed by me elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!

Springer, 1899-1991, wrote numerous magazine & newspaper articles as well as two books: February: American Myth Month and War for What?I highly recommend the book, not just for it's content, but because this is one book the neo-Unionist absolutely hate; like a burr under the sadle blanket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"It's easy to see why Heaven's Time has been nominated for a RITA.

Her classic book Rubyfruit Jungle was a gem. As THE \\"coming out\\" book of it's time I share the sentiment of millions who feel it will always be sacred. However,I was shocked and totally disappointed with Rita Mae Brown's attempt at writing her own story. The person she reveals to us in Rita Will is beyond ego strong. She is ruthlessly self-absorbed and many times cruel. Everyone (else) is wrong, or less than, or not as smart or not as significant as Rita according to Rita (with the one exception-- her cat.) The book Rita Will reveals Rita as a sad and shallow person, with high marks only for narcissism. Best to avoid this book and re-read Rubyfruit Jungle instead.

Kit was received in the specified time frame and I was satisfied with its design and instructions. However, if you do not have any electronic experience, the instructions would not be specific enough for you to assembly the kit, as being able to read and decifer a schematic is asolutely required. Also, experience with microcircuit soldering is necessary. The reason for the four star rating is due to the instructions/schematics which do not entirely correspond with the actual wiring of the circuit, hence the requirement for electronic experience. The product description does not make any mention of the circuit's output being momentarily activated upon the initial input trigger, this makes a difference when this action is undesirable and presents the need to personally design an addition to the circuitry to eliminate this momentary output."},{"rating":"2","title":"For drummers with a light touch","review":"Grip is great.

It's the story of a futuristic penal unit used as canon fodder by a brutal totalitarian regime, and then left for dead on a hostile alien world after the invasion of it goes wrong. It's extremely grim and depressing, but the story is very good, and Milan does a good job of bringing the characters to life.

Scary fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"These bars taste pretty neutral. The taste won't wow you or anything, but, if you have sensitive teeth, the Agave Nectar may harm them, or cause them to hurt. Agave Nectar, is a syrupy, super sweet sweetener, that's been proven to be as unhealthy as High Fructose Corn Syrup, yet it's the featured sweetener in this bar. Not good.Also, these bars are ROCK hard. When the bars are created, they're pressed so tightly, that you REALLY have to work to chew them. I don't like that. I prefer a bar that's softer, less chewy.These bars are all wrong. The formulation is good, besides the Agave Nectar, but Jay, don't pack the bars so tightly! And Re-Formulate! Put Yacon Root/Tapioca Syrup in it to sweeten. Has prebiotics, minerals, and offers sweetness."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Disappointing, but Music is great","review":"The DVD contains no footage of Virgil Fox playing the instrument, but an art show on the screen; so the DVD isn't worth it, but the music is typical Virgil Fox, full of expression and fun to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Things we shared so long ago\\"","review":"Brainstorm is an interesting mixture of Queensryche and Judas Priest during their respective peak years. The former influence is especially noticeable with the splendid arrangements and sometimes unusual added touches such as singing a chorus in a different language or computerized backwash during a guitar break. The latter influence is apparent in the absolute heaviness that is brought to each song, some blistering guitar solos, and in the mostly mid-range vocals that sometimes elevate to shrieking heights reminiscent of Rob Halford. Normally this much obvious influence alone would be enough to downgrade an album, but the production value is extremely high and each song stands on its own force of will demanding to be heard. There is not a weak track on this album and for me, at least, this is a way to relive the glory days of the aforementioned bands with a modern day production sheen. Highly recommended. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Listen!!","review":"I am a Brainstorm fan as they have won me over with their brand of metal. This cd is not as good as Liquid Monster, but it still has plenty of pop to it. All the tunes are well written and the arrangements just rip right along.

He was blown away by it, and so was I. The guitarwork is amazing without being flashy or show-offy, and the whole album has a nice solid metallic crunch to it, like a monster tank rolling through a parking lot full of cars. So if you like old-school metal from the early '80s with clean vocals, then you definitely need to add this to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infectious Metal","review":"4.5 Stars is more appropriate. This is my first listen of this band; and I will be honest, I DO NOT like any purely progressive or power metal. I just KNEW I would not like these guys. What a pleasant surprise. I believe the underlying theme is simply basic metal, which gives the foundation for such great appeal. I hear a little Iron Maiden in there, a little Dream Theater, a little Symphony X, alot of early Nevermore (Sanctuary), and listen closely for a little Anthrax style thrashiness. Some of the crunch riff changes are simply amazing. These guys have song writing flare and a ton of instrumental talent. I hope they can continue the momentum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an album indeed !!!! Get this CD now !!!! < : )","review":"Wow. I wasn't expecting something this good.

The vocals are good too. I tend to like the light-growly vocals such as a Matt Barlow of Iced Earth but Andy's are really good aswell.

All of the band members were extremely talented. Unfortunately, we get just a few glimpses of the lead guitar player in action. The commentary was interesting, but less dialogue and more music footage would be preferable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Editing Ruins Brilliant Jethro Tull Performances","review":"Poor Ian Anderson! It's not clear to me if Lerner edited this film or merely shot the original footage, but whoever did the edit apparently does not care much for Jethro Tull music.It's so frustrating to watch incredible concert footage interrupted every 30 seconds by some angry young man enjoying his 15 minutes of fame.I find this DVD virtually unwatchable and heartbreaking. It's not about the band or the music, this is a DVD about the end of the 60's except it was not done very well even from that perspective.If you love the band, brace yourself for disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"where are the rest","review":"My favorite period of Tull but I'm very dissapointed that they omited classic & one of my favorite tracks like \\"To cry you a song\\" and \\"With you there to help me\\" in favor of some stupid audience interviews & other documentaries.

I should hunt for a bootleg of the full performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"an easy read","review":"I read this book in one or two days and really enjoyed it. This book is almost a nuts & bolts book - a narrative about how the author's trip turned out day by day. It's more about the hike itself, and not very much about pilgrimage, spiritual or personal. I met the author in a business meeting, so it's refreshing to actually meet someone who has done the walk - just a normal guy and his wife taking an adventure vacation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book...","review":"I have to agree with the previous reviews. This book is excellent and a definite MUST READ!!!As a result of the book, I am more patient with my child, am actively challenging his mind with a more enriched environment, and am a better parent as a result of it.Sadly, the parents that need this info most will never be inclined enough to read it.Thanks Diamond and Hopson for acquiring the knowledge to write this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent food for thought and reference guide","review":"The book is really tough going for the first +- 80 pages with the discussion centering around the anatomical structure of the brain and its development and was a little over my head. However, having said that, if you perservere, it is an excellent read and I found it hard to put down once it moved on. A tremendous amount of food for thought and a superb reference guide, full of recommendations and ideas on how to enrich your childs life. The author is an inspiration and I will definately refer back to this book for years to come. It really challenges parents to 'up their game' and understand the vital role they play in enriching and shaping the future of their child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed signals","review":"This book certainly is interesting in the first half, but as you inch towards the end, you come to a section that suggests books, toys, etc. for boys and girls of progressive age levels.

It is strange to see this as a 'modern' reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy reaging","review":"I was caught up in the information.

It didn't give many examples of things that you could do to nurture my child's intelligence, creativity or Heathy emotions as the title suggests. Most of the book is very scientific and just talks about how neurons work and the research the author had done. I didn't learn anything new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title is misleading!","review":"If you like reading case studies and research on brain development, this may be the book for you. But even that was very redundant in this book. I never thought reading about the brain could be boring, but this author manages to make it so. She reiterates over and over (and over!)that children have 5 senses that need to be enriched, and dedicates 1 or 2 pages per chapter actually talking about 'how'. The chapter organization was way to broad (for example grouping 0-5 in one chapter). She even manages to offend the reader in her approach for what not to do. If the reader has enough insight to purchase a book about brain development, I am guessing they are smart enough not to hit/yell at/neglect their child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!! Brain research for every parent and educator.","review":"This book is a must read for parents and eductors. It approaches what is being learned about the brain and breaks it into sensible categories of chronological development that all parents can understand.

What an exciting adventure to be part of the process which shapes and molds a child's brain!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious old news","review":"Diamond's study of rat brains 40 years ago was an important one, but it serves poorly as the basis for a book of child development advice. This is the most tedious book on child guidance I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe for raising stressed-out, obsessive kids.","review":"If you think your child's brain works like a rat's, then you share the company of Diamond and Hopson. Better change your nursery into a crawl-through maze and trade in the play-pen for an exercise wheel. The idea that stimulation increases brain cell connections in rats is interesting and explained very well, but there is no way to test this in human infants. However, it makes a good case for over-achieving parents intent on establishing home baby academies. I read cover-to-cover looking for supporting evidence that adults who were over-stimulated as babies are filling Ph.D. candidate positions in our universities. It is a shame that the authors do not give more credit to the human brain's ability to stimulate itself, arguably a major distinction between animals and humans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the mark","review":"On the surface, the authors seem to treat the subject of enriched environments for children throughly. However, there is no mention of the most basic tool for maximizing a child's brain power: breastfeeding! Human milk contains ingredients essential to the proper development of a baby's nervous system, most notably the myelination of nerves. In fact, some studies have shown that babies who are not breastfed lose up to 10 I.Q. points as a result. Why, then, have the authors of this book failed to cover this issue? This omission leads me to question the validity of the authors' theories. I would therefore not recommend Magic Trees of the Mind to other parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The complete track listing...","review":"Since the product description does not show the complete track listing, I have listed it below:1.

This size of doll is perfect for a young girl who is not yet ready for the American Girl dolls.

After untying the rubber bands on its hair, it became totally messy and frizzy.while the doll was pretty and it had the scent, the hairband came off its hair in less than a day while my 3 year old was playing with it. Though she loved the doll, she avoided carrying it as compared to her soft, fluffy teddy bear which she carries all day long, tucked under her arm.The doll's body also 'small breasts' which I thought was unnecessary as these dolls were meant for small kids/pre-schoolers.Overall, I am disappointed with it as I paid a hefty price for its shipping here, to Singapore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"She is gorgeous.

The things that I really don't like are the remote contol has to be aimed exact at the unit and the button pressed hard to get the unit to respond. It only has one button for both skip and fast forward or reverse so you have to hold the FF down to get it to fast forward. When this works, without skipping instead, it only goes either 2x or 8x.

Do I realize how much I enjoy Hiassen!!!","review":"I enjoyed Tim Dorsey's first two novels, especially Florida Roadkill (which is what Orange Crush should be classified as). Dorsey seems to have thrown this together without any real direction to the story. His attempts at humor mostly fall flat. The characters are so absurd that it becomes tiring reading in a very short time. Marlon Conrad, the governor who has \\"seen the error of his ways\\" sounds an awful lot like he was stolen from numerous Hiaasen novels. Serge Storms, the key character in the first two novels is totally wasted in Orange Crush as Dorsey tries to make him respectable. The rest of the characters are quickly forgetable and not very funny.This was the third book in the series that I had autographed by the author, if they don't get any better than this it will be my last. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"the craziest, most outrageous writer","review":"tim dorsey's photo looks exactly like a sloppy florida beach bum. in this 3rd book, he portrayed the republicans as bunch of pirahnas and hayenas, while made the democratics looked like a bunch pigs. this is exactly what the images that i have put on these two great parties. this novel is so outrageous and crazy but somehow when he wrote the transformation of the governor, i was deeply moved. tim dorsey can write, that's for sure. but his books are all so overwhelmingly crazy and messy, and the wild rides might make your head spin out of control. he's making the whole florida like a cesspool and nut house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Dorsey","review":"Ah, another Serge Storms adventure, I just cannot get enough of my hero.

It's so loaded with nonsensical sentences that, after the first chapter, I wished the autor would stop it and after the fifth chapter, the last chapter I could bring myself to read, I laid the book down. I feel so strongly that this is a bad book I'm compelled to write this review and warn off other potential readers. The author tries to be Carl Hiaisen and fails miserably. I found nothing to laugh at. My most common, oft repeated thought as I tried to give the author the benefit of doubt was, \\"Now where did that come from?\\" I'll not pick up another Dorsey novel. I gave it my best effort and was overpowered by the inanity of the book. I found no redeeming features."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASCINATING PERSPECTIVES","review":"A very addictive book. I wanted to re-familiarize myself for this review and couldn't put it down so a few hours later I had read it through again. Reveals the human being and chronicles the ups and downs and the artistry of Reed, for a \\"thorough dissection of the Rock 'n Roll animal\\" - and this animal has sharp fangs and a tendency to bite, one might add. The author is obviously a fan, but a very honest writer who never hesitates to tackle controversial issues. Very interesting also for the light it throws on other artists and sometime collaborators like John Cale, Nico and Patti Smith. Reading this book whets one's appetite for the music again - surely the best recommendation.

Three are gone, and the feeder is not a year old yet. My feeder hangs under the house overhang and so is not rained on; no problems with the spring, though the \\"stop\\" that keeps the cage from going too far down fell out fairly soon (I just put a piece of wire in its place).

Within 2 weeks of putting it out, one of the copper leaves fell off resulting in one of the feeder holes being exposed. The squirrels very quickly took advantage of the situation and have now ransacked and ruined the feeder. I called Woodstream, the manufacturer of this Perky Pet product, and they would not make good on the feeder - I'd owned it for just slightly over their 30 day warranty. What a waste of money!

I covered that hole with tape yesterday and it's still going strong, but the tape is ugly so I'm buying a new one. It's the best feeder I've ever had, and has a constant population of chickadees, blackbirds, twohees, finches and sparrows, with juncoes (and squirrels) cleaning up what falls on the ground. It's expensive, yes, but I expect to get several years out of the replacement as well. UPDATE.. not the same as the original, & broke after about three months.

It is appropriate for any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author may know skating, but not much else","review":"I am a former figure skater and mystery lover, so when I discovered this series I was elated to bring my two interests together. I am very disappointed. To begin with this book is not well written. Books like this should be a fast, entertaining, easy read. I had to literally plow through the author's text. Then, the heroine - a TV researcher - found what she thought was a clue: a shorter than normal fax. Her conclusion was that it was European paper...when any good researcher, traveler or businessperson knows that A4 paper is longer than US paper, but slightly narrower. It is definitely not shorter. This was not a mention, which I could excuse, but for much of a book it was the only clue the character had. I lost faith. It is too bad the idea of the series is a great one with all the politics and drama that goes into skating, but this entry is definitely not a gold medal winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively and Amusing","review":"If you enjoy curling up with a cozy little mystery with an interesting twist then I highly recommend \\"Murder on Ice\\".Figure skating fans in particular should enjoy this charming tale but even those who aren't skating fans will enjoy the mischievious sense of fun that the protaganist, a researcher named Bex, displays as she races to solve the murder of the judge before the championships end."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you need to cheer up, or get some hope, this is the book","review":"This book is so powerfully moving that every time I pick it up - I must have read parts of it and/or looked at the pictures dozens of times - I get weepy and feel so grateful that in this complicated world, there are still such wonderful examples of kindness and compassion.

I'll never forget Bea, the beagle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Lover","review":"I saw this book many times up for auction at the Beagle Rescue sites but was afraid to purchase it because I thought it would be too sad. I read the book slowly one night and found it to be a heartfelt story about a much loved pet. As a beagle owner, I could relate, and laugh, about the stubborn beagle behavior of Bea. A little preachy in the end about what you can do about animal experimentation but otherwise a great read for beagle lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment from a Beagle Lover","review":"I have been owned by three beagles in my life, and I speak about them in a much more animated fashion than the author of this book does. I was thrilled to get it; I love any dog story, and if it's about a beagle, so much better. But I was disappointed with the way the book flowed. Much time was spent on the time right after aquiring Bea, and dealing with her adjustments, and a fair amount of time was spent on her declining years. But I felt the middle part was really missing. It was more about trials and tribulations than about the satisfaction of seeing a dog become an adjusted member of the family. I found the book depressing and sad, and the last chapter was too preachy for me to handle. She also borrowed liberally from her prior book. Very disappointing all the way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bumpy ride,in your shaken world","review":"i read this book many years ago,i remember having nightmares for weeks on end,seeing strange things glowing at night,hearing sounds,never sleeping,they were after me.i finaly returned to my old self,life went on,i still have a hard time beliving that the book isnt real,or is it? im so glad its in my book collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Informative, entertaining, mysterious...a must read for anyone who is interested in learning about the importance of getting off planet earth, because a time will come.

That being said I should be able to use the text on my own and learn the material despite my profs short comings. This book didn't give enough examples and also has no answers in it anywhere. I needed answers so that I could teach myself the material. This book also introduces a lot of new vocabulary and grammatical practices without any explanation.Also, there is an online program that goes with this book called QUIA. Never use it.

They said that I would have to purchase the CD separately! I wouldn't have a problem with that, except that the book cost me a lot of money, and it really wouldn't hurt Amazon if they just included the CD with the book -- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BOOK SAYS \\"CD INCLUDED\\".

I was nervous because he didn't ask for it and it was pretty expensive. Granted it's only been a month but he LOVES it! Not only that it's my favorite toy too. No batteries, no plastic and so much fun. I enjoy building with him and see how one day he will be able to build them himself. I am not a big \\"get on the floor and play\\" mom, but it's actually not annoying to build this toy.It's very high quality and even the box it comes in serves as a nice way to store the pieces in an organized way.My only concern will be the marbles with a baby on the way. We've already talked about the importance of being careful with them (he still has months of not having to worry). Probably will start to use only during the baby's nap times down the line.Awesome toy, highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought 2!","review":"MY SON LOVED THIS SO MUCH WHEN WE SAW IT AT AN UPSCALE KIDS STORE, I WENT ONLINE AND PURCHASED 2 FOR CHRISTMAS!

I CAN SEE HIS MIND SPINNING WHILE HE WATCHES THE MARBLES TRAVEL THROUGH ALL OF THE HOLES AND JUST WONDER. (SO MUCH BETTER THAN AN ELECTRONIC TOY) IT IS DURABLE AND A COOL MODERN TOY.

We looked at the plastic marble mazes, but decided to go with the Quadrilla because it seemed more durable. It has been one of the best toys we've ever purchased. I can honestly say my children play with it every day, and now that my son is older (almost 6), he's constructing his own marble runs...quite elaborate. He and his younger brother will spend hours trying different combinations. This toy is in our living room, and when guests come over, they think it's a sculpture. I'm considering buying more pieces for his sixth birthday. This toy is well worth its cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quadrilla okay, but not great","review":"I have played with Quadrilla at toy fairs and found that, while it's aesthetically appealing (forms, colors, etc.), it actually has limited appeal in the long run -- there are only so many things you can do with it. I vastly prefer Cuboro and Chaos Tower for complexity, variability and beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish We Would Have Bought the Cheap One","review":"We paid a lot more for this marble run than it's plastic counter-part because I wanted something sturdy.The problem is that putting this marble run together takes a long time and it falls apart easily. Each piece is so heavy it has to be perfectly bablanced and supported. If you are not on a perfectly level solid surface it falls apart. Forget using it on a carpet, you have to be on concrete or hardwood. It took so long for the kids to put it together they found it frustrating and quickly became bored with it. There are also less assembly options than you'd think there would be. It certainly is solid though. I'm considering selling it on Ebay and replacing it with a plastic one that snaps together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great songs!","review":"I very much enjoyed this album of original songs, especially the song \\"War of the Day.\\" Even though the album was recorded before 91101, it fits.

It's gentle on my skin but gets it really clean. Many times, when using a facial cleaner, I have to use an exfoliator on top of the cleanser to make my face feel like it's been cleaned, not with this soap though!This soap is gentle on my face and doesn't give it the harsh red tones that cleaners with peroxicde do. The only problem I have is that I tend to get dry patches on my face after using this cleaner. However I don't think it's this cleaner in particular but just how my skin is. I use the Dramatically Different Moisturizer with it and my skin feels wonderful!I have also noticed, as some other reviewers have, that the pump lets out more soap thatn you need to use. So I use about a half of a pump instead of a full pump.This is a great product for a great price. The BEST time to buy this product is when they are doing their giveaway packages, then you get to try some of their other products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"In general in not worth to get super expensive face wash. Even if the face wash has high levels of active ingredients ( whether for acne or anti aging ) they stay on your skin for a minute and then get washed off.

As for comfort these also excel. I would highly recommend these for anyone on a budget that does not want to spend a small fortune to get some of the other headphones.

This model has so many cutcorners I will be taking it back soon. Flimsy construction, though lightweight, will not withstand the test of time. And a general -cheap- looking headphone design that is oversized is very unattractive to me. Sony sells similar 25$ headphones that look good and are very durable with gold plated headphone connections as well that are not present on this Koss model of headphones. Spending the extra 5$ to 10$ on headphones is worth everyones time and money, especially when product longevity is a concern.

They omit the whole top end of the audio spectrum, i.e. almost no treble whatsoever. The bass is way too strong as well, so all-in-all they provide a completely unbalanced sound.

It seems the review is appearing for other products too.The holes giving access to the thumb stick, volume button, and zoom button are horrible. The case shifts a little and pushes a button or, most commonly, presses the thumb stick one direction or another. For example, my case liked to push the thumb stick down. The volume button got pressed somehow and my rhino went mute. I promptly cut the plastic away from the buttons. Problem solved. Only other problem was fogging between the display and the transparent plastic. Solved by cutting away more plastic and using adhesive screen protectors. Messed up the fit a bit too.I recommend just using adhesive screen protectors.

He rants about everything and even takes a moment to talk about his son, which was very touching....until the end. Then it was just funny. I cannot recommend it enough.

Shirley McClaine reminded me of my ex mother-in-law and that thought sends shivers up my spine.\\"My Life Without Me\\" does try hard and is well acted. The film is certainly believable. Indeed, the very concept of coming to terms with one's imminent death must truly be a struggle. This would be especially the case for the young. In Sarah Polly, a star is born!However, in spite of its charms, the film never really captures the viewer. The plot, to the extent that one exists, is tediously slow.

I became so frustrated I decided to just rip the cord off and buy a Whals(sp)? massager.If you don't mind something big and you have aches and pains, get one of those. This thing is durable. The vibration is exhilerating. It does require an outlet, but trust me, if you have shoulder or lower back pain and just want to relax, it is amazing. Cheap, too. Lots of nubs to interchange. If i come home and have foot pain or shoulder pain, this thing makes the pain go away within a few minutes of applying it to the afflicted spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"When I buy a product, no matter how inexpensive, I expect it to work.

This movie though is not. It does not follow the books very well at all. It represents a small section of tribulation force (the second book), and it does not faithfully follow the story in the book. The acting has gone down hill from the first two movies, and the story is just not very compelling. If you have not read the books or seen the first two movies, you will have no clue what is happeing in this movie. If you did read the books, you will keep asking yourself, \\"was that in the book?\\" The answer in most cases is no. If you see the movie, but haven't read the books, read them. They are much better than the movie. I was very disappointed, because I really was looking forward to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't meet expectations.","review":"As a fan of the Left Behind series, this movie was not as good as the original.

This movie was so far fetched i might as well watch independance day. Seriously, when in the book did the Trib force all perish, i understand this was the last movie they decided to make but they could of left it somewhat respectable. I mean, the ending was indeed funny, i still cant figure out why the president becomes invincible at the end of the movie, and ends up being the main character.This book may be good for someone who have never read the series, but to those who have it seems to be an insult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left behind - World at War","review":"I was completely dissapointed with this movie. I have to say that the Left Behind series is the BEST!!! The movie does not even come close to do it justice. This is a story of what the world will be like at the time of the Rapture. The story involves two men one a journalist the other a pilot and realizing that they were left behind and now they face the truth and must fight against the Devil or antichrist.

He has nothing to do. Buck has no GNN to work for. Nicholae and Buck never meet in this one. Nicholae has none of his staff from Tribulation force. Bruce Barnes death scene loses its value due to having to get a different actor than the guy from the first 2 movies. What happened to IVEY? no explanation! Where is Heim? Where is Ben Judah? Where is Bob Carlisle and his influence on the music? They are all gone. Slow dead mumbled movie with a few great special effects. I didn't wait all this time for Left Behind 3 to see special effects. This movie could have been so good. Best way to sum it up, It feels like a Lou Gossett Jr. movie with Buck and the cast as guest stars instead of the other way around.So Terribly Sad as Nicholae would say."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment..............................","review":"As Konyikoff said, \\"Boring\\".

To keep it short and sweet, many of the same characters are present from the 1st 2 films(which were true to the book), however, this poses a great disappointment for fans expecting to see an adaptation of book 3, as Cloud 10 veers away from the continuum of the book series. It's a story within itself and the story seems to be thrown together.

The new formulation is much much much saltier than the prior generation of Power Gel. Not that we don't need electrolytes during activity, but if you are thinking of this as the old style gel.... it really is not. This is more of a concentrated electrolyte drink that has very little similarity to the other products I use -- Hammer and GU.... no more branched chain amino acids and no more antioxidants. I suggest GU for great taste and all of the key ingredients for a great energy gel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the product in picture.","review":"The actual product shipped was not the one pictured on this page. The ones in the picture above are the normal ones you would find at GNC, Vitaminshop, etc and I'm sure that most people are used to taking for races, games, events.However, the ones Amazon shipped look different and are labelled \\"4x sodium\\" on the front of each pack. That translates to 200mg of salt in each packet. They taste salty, the texture is different/watery, and they require a whole lot more water to wash out the salty taste. The original powergels taste great, have great texture, and require about 8 oz of water to wash down (great for the middle of a foot race).They advertise on each packet that we sweat out salt (\\"electrolytes\\") and need to replenish it with these gels. I just wanted carbs to finish the race. They're call carb gels, not salt gels. Try to find and order the originals.But other than that, this is a great price for them and they work (even if they require more water to take down)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gloria Hippo from Madagascar Movie","review":"Great service, fast delivery.

Darin's attitude to life, his being angry and sometimes rude, I don't like him too much, and, in contrast with his son, I consider Sandra Dee's choice to not have romances after her husband death, a beautiful, romantic, loyal one.

I loved what a great job Kevin Spacey did portraying Bobby. This book, written by their son, Dodd Darin, reveals candidly many things that the movie did not go into. It is very well written and shines light on many of the mysteries which always surrounded this golden couple.

I wasn't sure if I would like this as much as their older stuff, but it turned out to be great.(This review is for the 2003 edition titled Tour De France Soundtracks, however, this is not truly a remaster but a repressing as it was already recorded on high quality digital equipment.

Those few parts that I had been unable to hike because of the long distances between trail-heads were of special interest to me, but turned out to be unrevealing--maybe I hadn't missed anything! Descriptions of flora and fauna were pretty general, esp. the flora, and so not very instructive. Finally, the book needed an editor--lots of grammatical and spelling errors and typos.

It picks up very well, and I liked the bagless style (not sure why they bother with a HEPA filter though--dumping the dirt from the canister would be a nightmare to people with allergies.) I did have problems with the lower hose getting blocked, but though it was a pain to clear it, I was still happy overall with this cleaner.HOWEVER, it's completely broken in less than a year of average use (vacuuming twice a week). The end of the beater bar broke because some of the plasic part that held it deformed from overheating. My vacuum repair shop said they could fix it with new parts, but that it would just happen again. They also said they see Eureka vacuums all the time because they're not built to last. I wouldn't recommend this cleaner, and won't buy Eureka again because I can't afford a new vacuum cleaner every year.

What plot line there is is silly and nonsensical, the characters are all too strange to be even partially believable. He's trying to cash-in on a better writer's turf, and isn't very clever.

I didn't purchase this myself (I received it as a gift), but I still feel that this isn't something to spend money on. Maybe at most like 50 cents.

Of course, like all good puzzles, the solution was understandable once I looked at it. Each of the puzzles is visual, demonstrated in a diagram with excellent coloration. Many involve the computation of missing numbers, some are pattern (mis)matching and others involve following a maze.While the puzzles are always challenging and frequently frustrating, they are enjoyable. Many studies have proven that the brain is just like a bicep, the more you flex it the stronger and more functional it becomes. In that context, the puzzles in this book are like a dumbbell, although sometimes they will make you feel like one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puzzles that look easy but are often quite difficult","review":"This is a terrific book.

I don't need a fiction paperback to tell me how to raise my dogs - that's why I took them to obedience school for three years! I could have overlooked the \\"I know SOOOO much more than you about dogs\\" attitude if the mystery (either one of them) had been interesting, but I was bored stiff by the time I finished. The only redeeming quality of this book was the description of the way the dogs behaved. That, at least, was interesting (you would hope someone as obsessed with dogs as Susan apparantly is could at least make their descriptions entertaining, and they were, somewhat.)

This guide to the island seeks to acquaint first-time visitors and seasoned naturalists alike with the natural wealth and ecological fragility of Matagorda. The book also tells the human history of Matagorda - the Karankawa Indians, European explorers, Civil War-era settlers, lighthouse keepers, and the U.S. Air Force, which used Matagorda for a bombing range during the 1940s and 1950s. There are appendices on plants, wildflowers, and birds as well as maps and line drawings"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive book on Matagorda Island","review":"This is an excellent text.

Hayzlitt is a master at boiling down messages into layman's terms without sacrificing the power or complexity of the idea. You might be able to argue with him on certain points, but because he takes no assumptions for granted, you'd be hard-pressed to poke holes in his key messages.

It is a well thought out beginning to Peter Pan, and Never Land. I also loved that it wasn't just a boy having all the adventures and doing all the saving, the girl in the story Molly did her equal amount of adventuring, and saving as well.

I can't believe this made it past editing!As far as being a prequel to Barrie's Peter Pan, this book misses the mark. There are too many blatant inconsistencies for this to be anything but a shallower \\"re-telling\\" of Barrie's richly woven classic. These are not the characters we knew and loved; this is not the Never Land we dreamed about at night. Pixie dust is now nothing more than \\"space dust\\" which causes strange and unpredictable genetic mutations on contact.

I have been reading it out loud to my family and am tired of having to correct the obvious errors. It's not just a typo here and there, but glaring errors, like words missing from sentences, that should have been caught on editing and trip the reader up making it impossible to thoroughly enjoy this story.I am not a perfect writer, I am not a perfect editor, I don't pretend to be, but I do read a lot of books out loud to my family and this book is riddled with more editing errors than anything we have read previously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read!","review":"This was a fun read.

What happened to Peter before losing his shadow? That was were Ridley and Barry took off flying with a prequel to the beloved Peter Pan. This book is an action packed adventure that children will love. Many of the magical mysteries of Peter and his band are explained as more questions arise. When we heard the two authors talk they did say that a sequel to this prequel will be following soon. There were times that the book seemed to bounce back and forth. The good guys have the trunk, the bad guys have the trunk, the good guys have the trunk, etc. Yet, the story unfolds well and will hopefully put Peter Pan back on stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs an editor","review":"This book is just OK, not great. There are several typographical errors, which I haven't seen in a mainstream book in quite a while. When the authors describe the pirates' sails, you know it is actually their extremely immature fantasy. Occasionally it is obvious there are two writers, eg, the word \\"tentatively\\" is used twice on the same page to describe someone's actions. The editor seems asleep at the wheel. If you are really interested in Peter Pan, it's worth a read; it not, I'd pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book to Share With Your Kids","review":"The story in this book and its sequals is far more entertaining than the Disney movie from which they are based.

This book is fantasy. It is about an orphan named Peter who got sent on a ship. Peter meets a girl named Molly. They try to save a treasure called Star Stuff.

We love reading a chapter or 2 everynight. We enjoy the adventure, and suspense this books to offer younger readers. While it is true that this series does have nothing to do with the original book and Peter Pan, I love that it creates a whole new mythos of how Peter Pan became Peter Pan. She and I are looking forward to reading the second book, and we just picked her up the third and fourth books in the series. Just the right amound of humor, suspense, and swashbuckling adventure for the group it's aimed at. Though the boom is thick the chapters are short and easy to read, keeping it interesting for the older and younger readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book!","review":"As an adult, I personnally enjoyed this prequel to Peter Pan. Dave Barry et al have created an imaginative, kid-friendly adventure story reminiscent of Harry Potter, but set on island populated by natives, mermaids, and pirates. My family just finished listening to the audio CD, which I also recommend. It is read by Jim Dale, the reader of the Harry Potter series. The story had an 8-year-old, a 13-year-old and my husband completely engaged. It is great for long car trips through the desert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to get the background down...","review":"This would make a great bedtime story for kids. It's a great way to introduce children to chapter books (read them a different chapter each night until the book is finished) and since it's the prequel to the commonly known Peter Pan it's a great way to give kids the history of the famous boy who would not grow up. It did have a few slow sections, but they were mostly in the beginning, which is common for many long novels.

Nothing much happens until they get off the ship, then the island is rarely sparsely and drably imagined. With Dave Barry as one of the authors, I thought there would be a lot more humor, especially in a book aimed at younger people. The crocodile is ho-hum, the Indians are ho-hum, and Tinker Bell's appearance gets a whole page. Flat and uninvolving novel. Sorry, guys!I hear the play made from this is quite good, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just finished reading this with my 8 year old son--he summed it us as \\"Wow!\\"","review":"This was a fun read from start to finish. It started quickly, and then kept going all the way through the book.

You will not be able to put this book down. Even though I really loved how this book was always moving, in the center of the action the thing I most appreciated was how this book explained literally all the questions one might have about Peter including ow he got on to NeverLand and why it was named that, how Peter came to be able to fly, who the lost boys were, and the past of Captain Hook. This book is a must read that I strongly recommed for fantasy lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My God.","review":"So this is the prequel? I can't believe this book received a good grade. J.M.

It's as if neither of these writers ever read the brilliant original they decided to cash in on. It's as if they based this book on half remembered events in a disney movie they saw when they were 10 years old. It's as if they had no idea of the themes, or characters J.M. Barrie created.

Even though Peter, the main character is supposed to be the real Peter Pan and live on Never-never land, there are many inconsistencies that other reviewers have pointed out.I read this book first, then I read Peter Pan because I wanted to know what it was about. When I read this book alone, I really liked it because it is a reasonably well-written adventure story with all the basic parts. There isn't anything really extra-ordinary about it.This is not a bad book, just a normal one. A worthwhile read, but don't expect anything stupendous or mind-blowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids like it","review":"Bought this for an after school program. Kids seem to like it. It isn't the best quality though--sewn very unevenly on the sides. Also think the price is high considering I saw a bigger rug at a local big lot store for 1/3 the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Entertainment","review":"We bought this for my 4 year old son who loves to play with cars and trucks. He has spent many a mornings,(not waking us up at 6 am), playing alone in his room driving his cars through the neighborhood on the rug. After he is done he rolls it up. We often bring it with us to Grandma's. Great toy! In addition, because it is a rectangle and not a square there is plenty of room for him to play on one side and his 2yr old sister to play on the other with minimal arguing for space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Any ol' rug would have worked just as well","review":"My kids walk on this rug, they sit on it and play, but they do not drive vehicles on it. After the first week, they seemed to stop noticing it was designed like a little town, with streets etc. It was just a rug they could hang out on and be more comfortable than on hardwood floor of our kitchen extension. My daughter just turned 6. She likes to sit or lie on it and draw. My 3 year old son likes to set up his 3-D Hotwheels tracks and ramps on top of the rug. Nobody wants to play with the freaking thing the way it was meant to be played with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roads Rug","review":"I got this rug for my 2 year old grandson and he loves it so much. All his cars and trucks get a work out on this carpet. He gets it out as soon as he comes and plays with it all day long. The roads don't all connect, but he doesn't seem to care. He already knows all the buildings and parks the appropriate vehicle near by, even the little train engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"car road rug","review":"I bought this rug for my grandsons for Christmas. The older boy who's soon to be five years old layed down beside it and played with it for quite a while. The younger boy who just turned two was not so interested. I'm sure they'll play with it more after they tire of all their other presents. I liked it because it's easy for small arms to reach across the rug and drive their cars on all the roads. Their parents liked that it was narrow and didn't take up much room and was also easy to roll up and store in a corner. I would recommend this rug for anyone looking for a car rug for their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Purchased this for my 2 1/2-year-old grandson. Few things he likes better than cars and trucks and this has been a hit.

She loves playing with cars and we thought this would be a great way for her to create an imaginary city. She love it. I read other reviews about how the rug slides around. We don't have that problem on our carpet. The other plus is how easy it is to roll up and store away. Much better than a car garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning Carpet","review":"This Learning Carpet was purchased for our Grandson who is 3 years old. He absolutely loves it and plays on it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2 boys love it!!!","review":"This is one of the best toys we ever purchased for our 2 toddler boys. We have had it for over a year, and it never gets old. It takes up virtually zero space, and it is easy to take out of town for entertainment in a hotel room or cabin. The other plus is that it's long and narrow so 2 or 3 kids can play on it at the same time without getting in each others way. My 3rd baby is even going to get to play with it when he's old enough because it's still in excellent condition! We love it, and it was worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandson loves it!","review":"4 year old grandson is having a lot of fun with this Giant Road carpet.

I personally love Shareefa's voice because it is gritty and she sings so powerfully. Or rather she sings with emotion. But if youre into \\"Hip Hop Soul\\" -- you know artists like Sunshine Anderson, Alicia Keys (from her first album), Keyshia Cole and people like that -- well you would appreciate this album.

Jimmy Heath was a major contributor to hard-bob & later had a great influence as a player & composer. Wynton Kelly did some of his finest work with Miles but he also left a large volume of work as a leader. Ron Carter & Jimmy Cobb left their marks in the jazz world as well. But what about Don Sleet? This offering proves Sleet to be a soloist of distinction, a player with a warm brassy tone but a softness of delivery. He's more lyrical than Dizzy and sound easier on the middle register. The two Clifford Jordan compositions, \\"Brooklyn Bridge\\" and \\"The Hearing\\" are outstanding but Sleet really shines on his own composition, \\"Fast Company\\". It is a blues infected theme that shows Sleet was truly \\"sleek\\" with tone & command of the group.

Using 13 gallon bags and the fit is fine. Would have been 5 stars but their definition of a quiet close lid is a little bit of a stretch. It doesn't slam but it's not what \\"spring-tension dampener mechanism slows the lid closing\\" (on the box) makes you think."},{"rating":"1","title":"16 month lifetime is too short","review":"Like mentioned in another review, the pedal mechanism to open the lid broke -- in my case after 16 months -- Too long to be replaced under warranty, but too short for a product of quality. In this case this was a household with two adults and no children -- so excessive or rough use was not the problem. The lug that secures the pedal to the lid mechanism is plastic. After too much cyclic stress it appears to have worn out and broke. Another complaints (as also mentioned in other reviews) is that the capacity is too small relative to the size of a standard US tall kitchen bag. Pros include an attractive clean design, and good operation (up to the time it broke)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Lever Mechanism Design - BUT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"Same story here as some of the other reviewers. After a year of gentle use, the plastic pedal assembly cracked. I got a few more months out of it by bracing the plastic piece with a steel plate, but the plastic later failed at the joint of my repair.Sad to use all that metal in everything except for the part that takes all the force. Consider spending more for a can that has a metal assembly. It might be worth the extra money to avoid annual replacements.UPDATE:My complaint to Simplehuman about the lever was resolved in less than a day, and a new lever was promptly shipped. They claim that the design has been improved for better reliability. We will see.I would have granted another star for the good service, but can't change the rating.

Since this is a graphic novel that is meant mostly to entertain imo, I hope that the \\"professional\\" reviewers from the mass media will cut Malice and Pekar some slack and not hold it up to the scrutiny that that poor sap James Frey has been put through. In the same way that I doubt that Frey's stories were 100% truthful (as has been proven ad nauseum by The Smoking Gun, then Oprah, etc. etc.), I don't expect that Malice's stories are always spot on truthful; but so what?

The latter group probably makes better use of the name, though, as they're big, loud, and flashy. This Celtic Thunder is much more restrained and, in my opinion, much more tasteful. They play straight-up, no B.S Irish music, and do it well.I would not rank them in the same league as the great Irish bands that started up in the 70s, say, Planxty, or The Bothy Band, or De Danann.

I would suggest looking at other wireless headphones if you're looking for some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely repititious","review":"Yes, the quality is poor, but beyond that, the repetitiveness is maddening! The odd side step/arm twist exercises go on for eternity and don't seem very effective. The one positive is that the video is safe for your joints but it's not the best workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this boring video","review":"I'm shocked by the positive reviews of this workout. For one thing, the video itself seems very low quality. The music and background are both bad. Also, the background people are unprofessional. They look like they're going to crack up every time the camera's on them--plus they don't seem like they're even trying.I could overlook all that if the workout were good, but it's not. It's so BORING and not very challenging. For example, for about ten minutes all you do is right punch, left punch. I almost fell asleep on my feet. And there's another part with this weird arm choreography that is just so ineffective. It seems like it's just for show. This workout doesn't meet my definition of cardio at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"I just recently bought the video and was eager to try it based on the other reviews that people had left. When I got it, I popped it into the VCR to watch and I have never seen a more poorly made video. It looks as though someone grabbed a camcorder from their closet and decided to make a workout tape. I was very dissatisfied with it and found that all it was basically good for was a laugh as the exercises were not very effective. I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone, and definately not for the price that I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Intro if you have never tried yoga, or tai chi, or qigong","review":"This is a very nice looking video, really good production. But there is little theory here and you have to reverse the moves in your head. Consider this an appetizer toe-in-the-water course. What you get is a few moves, you do not get any complete form.If you really want to learn Tai Chi, and do not have a local instructor (or the time) and want a DVD go straight to the masters in Sunrise Tai Chi (YMAA) DVD (2005). YMAA stuff is always top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tai Chi Beginner Kit","review":"The instructor uses a \\"mirror\\" method of teaching the moves.

The Author does not write in chronological order. The first page starts off about the victim's dogs!! Then back and forth between the shooting and the trial. Nothing much about the backgrounds of the victim & the people involved in the case - just a few sentences. It's hard to keep up with who's who and how they know the victim and his wife who was convicted of having her husband murdered by her lesbian lover. I recommend that if you want to read about this case then buy \\"She Wanted it all\\" by Kathryn Casey - she is a great writer and gets to the point - not going on about dogs and the weather. I really don't know how Suzy Spencer got her book published - its just too disorganised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't make heads or tails!","review":"I shouldn't be writing a review of a book I didn't even finish.

This one was so bad I couldn't finish it. I am an avid true crime reader and usually can plug my way through even the not so great ones, but this was just awful. It was hard to follow and the writing was so poor I just couldnt get into it at all. This is a fascinating case and I HIGHLY recommed the one by Kathryn Casey. It was one of the best true crime books I have ever read and a much better account of this case. Save yourself some money and skip this one..I dont even understand how it got published. This is the first time i have felt strongly enough to write a negative review but if I can save someone else from reading this utter trash heap of a book the time was well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst true crime books I have ever read","review":"This book about the Steven Beard killing was very difficult to follow, and jumps around frequently so you are never sure if you are reading stuff that happened before the murder or after the murder. The pictures in the middle are interesting, and not in the far superior book on the case All She Wanted by Katherine Casey so that is why I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fortune Hunter","review":"I also can't get past the first few chapters. This book sounds like the author's notes published in stream-of-consciousness. There's no real order to it. It doesn't appear to have been edited, either. If this were the first true-crime book I read, I'd never read another. My problem is that I didn't read the reviews first. This book is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Bad Writing","review":"Suzy Spencer must be extremely well connected because she sure can't write. The writing is disjointed, and the story very poorly told. In fact, about 80% of the book is a play-by-play of the trial, almost like reading a trial transcript. But then there are the stomach-wrenching metaphors like, \\"He had the tiny, compact butt of an aged but active cop with legs that looked like hard, thin branches of mesquite.\\" Please spare me, Suzy. Oh, and let's not forget the part of the trial where she describes a witness' answer, \\"'Absolutely,' Her face and jaw line were square like The Jetsons' Rosie the Robot.\\" If you are considering reading this book, be prepared for a long, boring, confusing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time I invested in it.","review":"This book was such a chore to try to read, I barely finished it. The writer bounced from one thing to the next, and I could never figure out where she was going or why. Plus, most of the book is comprised of boring court scenes that read like they came right out of the transcript. The language is at times colorful, but that's the only thing worthwhile about this book. The descriptions of people stung me as downright mean. It got slightly better the farther I got into it, but not enough to salvage the read for me. I wouldn't suggest any friend of mine read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor writing","review":"The story can be somewhat compelling and interesting to follow but the writing is very poor. I can't believe Suzy Spencer got this book published. There must be a shortage of true crime writers because the writing is unbelievably bad. Information is thrown at you from no where -- sudden references where there was no introduction -- you have to use your imagination and piece it together. For example when she writes about Cole, Celeste's husband after Steve dies. She writes that Cole is a construction worker by day and a bartender by night at the 311 club. Three pages later she writes \\"the unemployed Cole.\\" When and how did Cole become unemployed? This is just thrown out there...he goes from a guy with two jobs to being unemployed. Bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"She is the worse writer EVER","review":"I can't even beging to get into how horrible this book was.

Nothing was in sequence. I'm making a note not to buy any other books written by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!","review":"This book is so poorly written I'm not sure I can call it a book at all. It's more accurate to call it a jumble of courtroom notes and imagined recreations. The individual vignettes don't make any sense, and there's no sense of continuity from buildup to crime and then aftermath.If you're interested in the Steven Beard murder, get the book \\"She Wanted It All\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I wrote a review earlier and gave this book one star. Then I thought it over and figured that might be a little harsh. I do like to be fair. So, I deleted the review now I'm giving it two. The reason, the editor must have some blame in this book. I can't unload it all on the writer. It's a jumble, and I found it difficult to read. I didn't finish it. Got to a certain point, and it just didn't seem worth it. So there it is, my thoughts, and I'm standing by them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down","review":"This book reads like a trashy novel. The smut factor is high, and it seemed that Spencer attempted to dehumanize every person involved in this story, including Steve Beard, the murder victim.

I also can't believe how Steve Beard would \\"hook up\\" with another woman so soon after his wife of many years died (let the body get cold, for Pete's sake).And why DO these grossly overweight, unattractive, wealthy older men PERSIST in the delusion that bimbos half their age are interested in them FOR THEM?I felt for the twins.

I blindly bought this thinking perhaps it was a collection by the band \\"Modern Man\\" from early 1980, who were produced by Ultravox singer Midge Ure. That is not the case. I guess this band could be called synthpop, but they're more like pop rock from the late 80s. The lead singer sounds like Richard Marx, the music is comparable to Cutting Crew, Johnny Hates Jazz, and other light pop bands of that style from the late 80s. The music is really not very memorable, and not even one track stands out as strong single material, which would explain why this was never heard on commercial radio.Even the album cover is deceiving. A two man duo with the name \\"modern man\\". Immediately you're going to think 'new wave synth band!'

I use the biographical information at first (it's perhaps a little dry for middle schoolers, but on the other hand, each biography is only about 5 minutes long), and then when the narrator has finished, there are a few more minutes of paintings shown with just music in the background. My students answer questions based on the biography for the first part, then during the second part they note colors in French that they see in each of the paintings.From a teacher's viewpoint, some of the artwork includes nudity, so you have to decide if that will be an issue for your students/parents/administration before showing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambient Art DVD Exceptional!!!","review":"I was expecting a lot and this DVD is it!

Of course, maybe if I'd bothered to read the book description and seen the bit about insect larvae, I would have had a better idea about how wrong I was . . .While there's nothing particularly inappropriate for a younger audience in this novel, Golden doesn't pull any punches. At turns gruesome, exciting, and hilarious, this is a book that readers of all ages can enjoy.Golden has created a collection of colorful, vivid characters, each with a distinct and individual personality.

They cover 30 movements more than 60 themes, and profile around 110 intellectuals. The last part of this 787-page book touches on the role of media in the French intellectual life, from newspaper to radio and TV, via journals.The style is enticing and to-the-point (well done to the group of editors). And each article provides a short list of useful references for those who want to learn more.I can't see any drawback - definitely a 5-star volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter birthday gift","review":"This was a birthday gift so i really cant give it a review.

I didn't expect to enjoy this set nearly as much I have.While the presence of certain characters is missed, the new characters introduced in previous seasons were actually builtup well enough to fit in right along 90210 originals Steve, Kelly, Donna, David and Dylan. The only down part of the season iswatching Noah spin out of control again ala David in earlier seasons and Gina leaving a ways before the end never to return. Beyond that it was still very enjoyable and for show's 10th and ending season to be only a notch below what it was at it's peak says a lot. Some classic stuff (Dylan finding his father is alive), and surprises (I forgot a grown up Josie Davis was on several episodes).

Simpson trial began educating us about the complex molecule DNA found in the cells of our body. Now Ron Fridell continues our education as he unravels this complex biological science and reveals the drama of DNA's discovery and early use. Today DNA evidence convicts and exonerates criminals, traces our ancestors' origins in the Human Genome Diversity Project, and helps protect wildlife and feed a hungry world. Yet, the future promise of DNA research may be the most important of all as the Human Genome Project unlocks the intimate secrets of who we are. In this book, DNA Fingerprinting: The Ultimate Identity, Ron Fridell clearly explains what science believes: Knowing the genome in the human body may lead us to longer, healthier lives and to our ultimate identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent introduction to the racing rules.","review":"This might have been titled: An idiot's guide to the racing rules. It assumes little or know prior knowledge of the racing rules. It is organized by situations you will encounter in a race, applying the rules to various common situations at the start, upwind leg, rounding the windward mark, etc. All explainations are illustrated with cartoon-like diagrams that clearly illustrate the application of the rule. There are citations to the relevant rules for every situation, and the rules in full are at the end of the book. I'm just getting into racing, and found it to be very helpful in explaining a complicated subject. I'll refer to it again and again.

Level design makes no sense, if you leave a room after killing a monster and return, the monster is alive, the cut scenes are choppy, many times you get knocked back into a previous area and have to battle through it all over again.

Other than that there isn't a whole lot that is great with this game. Instead of being fun it gets boring and tedious. The weapons are cool though but that isn't enough to save this game. The concept of 2 people able to switch on the fly was cool but there isn't really a huge need for it. You could get through the whole game using Eliot and not touch Dogs once. The most tedious thing about the game is the way the characters run/limp. In the beginning of the game when a Eliot/Dogs has very little max life and they get hurt they will start limping. My god a turtle could run faster then they do. Even when Eliot and Dogs have max life a turtle could probably still run faster then they do.

Example: when using the look key \\"L\\", as soon as you release the \\"D\\" butten, the view springs back to the direction your facing. Which can seem like a \\"Tug of War\\" match (against the computer) when your trying to zero in on something you're not directly facing.And I'm sorry, but the characters are dorky looking and that really has alot to do with taking the game serious. It has a strong plot and you've gotta be this goofy looking guy who can't even jump.If it had controls like the \\"Tomb Raider\\" games and a plot more like the \\"Mario\\" or \\"Zelda\\" games, or mabye even \\"Double Dragon\\", I'd have given it 4-stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is good for about 30 min","review":"I played this game and got really frustraded with it quite a bit the graphics are cartoon like and nowhere near resident evil I didnt like it very much not enough clues at times you don't know what to do next.

For a game that is suppose to have 128bits, this games graphics are really horriblly done and give dreamcast a bad name. The controls in the game are just impossible. It can be a good game if they improved the graphics and the controls of the game. The characters you get to play walk and run around the place like they have a wedgy or something. The weapons in the game are kinda cool but no where near the RE series.

Technic's girder-like pieces would be perfect for reproducing the tower's members, at actual angles. But Lego can't seem to get past the concept that the Technic system is only to be used for vehicles, not buildings. This doesn't even get the color right (It's brown). I would pay this hefty pricetag for a Technics version of the Eiffel. But this?

I really like Spanish music, which is why I bought it, but there is just a salsa-sounding synthesized beat in the background that didn't get me too excited about the exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible bad quality!","review":"When I first put this dvd on, I thought I was watching an old, worn out videotape. The quality of the screen is very bad, I think it was a bad copy from video to dvd.Apart from that, the workout is definitely for beginners: the moves are very simple and not challenging at all. But most of all, I thought it was very boring. Just doing a lot of the same repetitions.

It's a nice story of redemption and perseverance...and the tidbits that Mr. De Vido drops in about ex-champ Sonny Liston provide a nice backdrop against the story, as well as a poignant reminder of a life that was doomed because of reasons often beyond his control.The details of the fight game - from training to the women to the actual fights - really made the story come alive for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate story telling","review":"Who wrote these reviews? The author and his mother?This is a simple-minded, cliche-ridden story. Ok, it's got a good hook (Sonny Liston as likable role model) but otherwise, it's a lame, feel good, happy-ending story of the poor-boy-makes-good-in-the-face-of-adversity genre.The 20somethings who may or may not read this should not forget: Sonny Liston was the prototype for the present generation of boxer. It's his sort that ruined the sport. He's a felon who beat a second-rate champion and immediately lost his title to a loud-mouth upstart. To make him a misunderstood hero is revisionist history at best and pure trash in reality. The author as much as admits he knows nothing about the man but used him as a device.I give it 2 stars only because the author knows something about the game. As a novel, however, it's junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great handbook for Physics students!","review":"I am a Physics Ph.D. student and I have had this book since I was a freshman.

As we are all One, it is also part of our journey.

During a session, they found that Linda and Jean had been twin sisters in a past life in France around the second century, who had been separated as teens. This knowledge allowed them both to experience healing.If past lives and past life events interest you at all, then this is the book for you. In chapter 10, she takes you on her soul's journey through many lifetimes, starting in 6,000 BC in Egypt and going to 1850 AD.A great story that's well written.

Yes, the plot is hard to follow. Yes, there are some moments where we do not understand the imagery. But Akerman is doing these things intentionally. We should not feel as the same when we watch a blockbuster movie. Akerman takes away the viewer's knowledge of symbols and events and places us out of reach with identification of the characters of the film. This allows her to create a world in which we as the viewer do not judge. There are no good or bad guys. You are not cheering for one person to succeed. You learn all you can about the characters and accept them for the flawed human beings that they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Akerman's 1st feature. Often sad, sometimes absurdly funny.","review":"A 3 part film, with little plot, following a young, neurotic woman first stuck alone in her room over a period of days,then hitching a ride with a truck driver on her way to meet her female lover and developing an odd relationshipwith him, and last spending the night making love with her lover, then leaving.The images, though often interesting, don't have quite the power of Akerman's best work, and while some momentshave a real charge, sexual or emotional, others feel awkward.Certainly intelligent and complex, and wistfully touching in the end, but somehow missing that that step to greatness,the first third is very strong, the second almost as good, but the last feels less complete, and the 15 minute love makingscene is sort of awkward in that it's very explicit, but never seems real. Less might have been more in this case.But, for any flaws, this is well worth seeing if you have any interest in Akerman's impressive body of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"THANK YOU!!!","review":"Thank you for this!

The strong emphasis on religious processions is not representative (go to Seville for that), and viewers get no clue about most of the city's architectural and natural beauty. The camera dwells on a scene (the university guys singing) without explanation of what it means, while it rushes through others (the bridge over Tormes) where further viewing angles were expected, based on the voice description.

Well, because Chris Moore is the writer. Called one of the country's best satiric writers, Moore has a talent for at once presenting a serious subject (death, Christ) with excellent research and a unique approach, being deeply respectful, and then throwing in a zinger or 20. One page will leave you pondering big questions and the next will have the beverage you just sipped come out your nose as you laugh out loud.In A Dirty Job there are assorted characters - Charlie, of course; his daughter Sophie, fellow death merchant Minty Fresh, and some really creepy bad things who live in the storm drains of San Francisco. Oh, and the two hell hounds. That's all I am going to tell you. Buy it, read it. If you share it with anyone else they will keep it, so plan ahead and buy a few copies up front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"Chris Moore is in fine form and really shows his skill as a writer with his latest effort. I would rate A Dirty Job as my third favorite Moore work, just behind Lamb and Bloodsucking Fiends.The story zips along at a nice pace, making this a great choice to read on a long flight as I did. The only reason I give it four instead of 5 stars is that it wasn't quite as funny as some of his earlier works. But still a very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Best?","review":"Christopher Moore's latest novel is only a bit less of a triumph than \\"Lamb\\".Charles Asher, a neurotic, Type B, nebbish of a man comes to life through the tragic death of his wife the day she gives birth to Sophie, their first and obviously only child. Remarkably his new life is as a merchant of death, and perhaps the only living man who can save the world from the death throes of the \\"Forces of Darkness\\" that have lived for centuries under the streets of San Francisco, seeking to recover strength derived from the souls of the dear departed, in order to rise to domination and destruction of the world above.Moore's characters in \\"A Dirty Job\\" are loopy and hilarious. Hardly a page goes by with out a laugh at the macabre and the ridiculous.Silly stuff? You bet. But the story is poignant and meaningful as well. Charles Asher lives! I can't wait for Moore's next novel. He is a contemporary treasure creating works that entertain, amuse and make one think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, irreverent diversion","review":"My daughter got me this for a holiday gift.

I would not say that Christopher Moore is ripping off Terry Pratchett, but the idea of Death as a transporter of souls is very similar to Pratchett's Mort, with San Francisco substituting Ank-Morporkh. Even then this could have been a much better read if the plot were not so slow developing. He could easily have written a much more enjoyable and concise book if he had kept it to about 250 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't think of a more entertaining book!","review":"I listened to the audio book and enjoyed it enormously. I can't think of a more entertaining book. I'm a Christopher-Moore convert now."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Can't Laugh at Death...","review":"This book is ridiculous, absurd, and psychotic; I mean that in the best possible way. Christopher Moore is totally insane. It's really the only conclusion I can reach after reading his books. If I were forced at gunpoint to compare Moore to someone, I would say Terry Pratchett, but that comparison doesn't really do either of them justice. It's like apples and oranges (well, more like madness and insanity) - you can't really compare them. This may not quite be his best book, but it is certainly very funny and worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Death walks with a cane...","review":"This is first Chris Moore book I've read and I'm glad I've discovered this writer (this is his 9th book, so I've got some catching up to do!). This book reminded me of Anansi Boys by Gaiman, so if you liked one, you'll probably like the other. I say probably, because Moore is a bit loose with the crude language (which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars).The characters in the book will keep you laughing, and the story will keep you wanting to read more moore.I saw Moore at a book signing and he's just as funny in person. Go see him on tour if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Disappointment!","review":"Christopher Moore used to write really twisted, fall-off-the-chair-laughing funny books. However, since he has discovered \\"Big Themes\\" (with \\"Fluke\\" and now \\"A Dirty Job\\"), he seems to have lost his touch. \\"A Dirty Job\\" has a moderate level of weirdness (I loved the hell hounds blowing soap bubbles!) but the humor is weak compared to his earlier books. If you want good Christopher Moore, go back to the early days: If \\"The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove\\" doesn't make you laugh until tears run down your face, you need to check your pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Because You Suck","review":"I bought this book because I read 'You Suck', which totally engrossed me, and this is sort of a follow-on book. Kinda. A plethora of strange but very endearing and entertaining people inhabit the book, and the story is actually really good. I enjoyed this book very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cartoonish, flat and tedious","review":"I agree with the minority of the reviewers who described the characters in this book as 2-dimensional. The characters are extremely cartoonish and speak in strained, unbelievable dailogue. I could practically see the author pausing to try to come up with a \\"clever\\" comeback or \\"snappy\\" repartee. I felt like the author was trying waaaaaaaay too hard and that everything was very strained. As a result, the book was a tedious read. I think the concept and characters would have worked better as a comic book, since the characters were so 2-D anyway. I am a big fan of funny, absurdist books (the Hitch-hiker books are the epitome of this genre), but this book seemd like it was trying too hard to be funny, absurdist, or for that fact, engaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Icky","review":"This is the first book by Christopher Moore that I have read, and I have to say that I am terribly disappointed. This author receives so much hype and I am wondering how much of it is deserved. This book was just boring and just plain dumb. I really didn't like any of the characters, the plot sounded like fun but ended up just being dull.I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Thankfully, I got it from the library, so no money was wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to be tickled!","review":"If you've walked around any bookstore in the US of A, you would've seen Moore's crazy book covers and titles just as I did, yet I never picked one up until recently when my good friend let me borrow A Dirty Job.. and now I can't thank her enough! For this reader's twisted sense of humor, A Dirty Job was not only a great pleasure to behold but is now one of my top 5 faves of all time (and I do some readin). If you enjoy the likes of Douglas Adams, David Sedaris, Gaiman's Good Omens... or even if you've never heard of these folks but enjoy the quirky irony that is Life, Death and all between and happen to Guffaw at the complications, do yourself a favor and pick up this book. It will tickle your humor bubble and give you warm fuzzies in embarrassing places. I am now collecting the rest of Moore's delights much to my pocketbook's dismay, but my excitement easily overruns my guilt. Thanks Mr Moore for adding to my reading enjoyment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's A Killer","review":"The author must be channeling the soles of Timothy Leary, Kurt Vonnegut and Jim Henson. We're talking about, yet another, weird, funny adventure from the warped mind of Mr. Moore. He doesn't have a knack for creating individuals who seem uniquely their own. All of them are quick-witted and two steps away from acting like vaudeville characters. John Updike or Alice Munro he certainly is not. No matter. I read Mr. Moore for the laughs and wacky scenarios. He's a great choice when I need to decompress. You got to hand it to the author, he successfully pulls off a funny adventure pertaining to death. Unlike Mr. Moore's book, Lamb, religion is not the major item holding this book together. If anything, reincarnation is front and center. It would be quite the overly sensitive person to find the story offensive. If you've never read Mr. Moore, this is as good a place to start as any. Very fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"This book was chosen by my book club and we all loved it. I, personally, loved the author's creativity and humor. I also loved his imagery. At the end of his book, I went to the website with pictures of the artwork that had inspired his squirrel people and found that my mental image was almost spot on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the oddest novels ever","review":"\\"A Dirty Job\\" is my first Christopher Moore read -- and honestly, I'm not sure what to think. I give the novel 4 stars because Moore's worldbuilding intrigues me to no end; I don't know how much of it is based on actual mythology and how much he just made up, but it's pretty incredible. His character development is enviably superb. I never had a question as to which character was speaking, whose POV I was reading, or whether or not a particular action was \\"in-character.\\"On top of all of this, I very much appreciate the dry, sometimes self-deprecating sense of humor that infuses every page. The novel doesn't contain many laugh-out-loud moments for me, but I read the entire thing with a smirk on my face.The only reason I didn't give the novel 5 stars is that there were several places where I was utterly confused as to what was happening and had to re-read entire pages to figure out what I'd missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book!","review":"Let me start by saying that I've read every book written by the author. He's a great writter!I would not recommend that you start here if you have not read Blooksucking Fiends or Coyote Blue. Other characters make appearanaces in this novel that add to the book and you'd miss some of that if you just started here.That being said, this is another fun ride by a fun author. I laughed out loud several times which is a sign of a good author. The story doesn't take itself too seriously, yet I really enjoyed reading about the plight of the Beta Male. And considering that I am one, I was reading about myself to an extent. :)Try it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"this book,along with \\"fluke\\" and \\"lamb\\", is one of christopher moore's greatest hits. i have read \\"stupidest angel\\" and the most recent \\"you suck\\" the latter being my least favorite so far. this book is funny from beginning to end and a very enjoyable read. if you are into this then definitely check out \\"Good Omens\\" by neil gaiman and terry pratchett. moore rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Moore's best books","review":"In Moore's most recent book he follows the life of a recent would-be grim reaper. The main character faces the difficulty of being a single father, along with the trials and tribulations of being a \\"soul collecter\\". Luckily his new child is nannied by his lesbian sister, and his two neighbors a Chinese and a Russian women. Through the help of these and others he journeys through the adventure of being a soul collecter, and his young daughter grows up to become \\"strong like bear\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"No Comparison","review":"Been a Pratchett fan for a decade, and a Moore fan for a week. Having just read A Dirty Job today, I can say that Christopher Moore knows how to pull a joke without requiring a rim-shot at the end to tell us when to laugh. The book moves at a pace that is steady, without ever being tedious, yet mild enough so you don't lose track of where you are in the story. So, if you want a book that will have you laughing out loud constantly, and leaves you feeling good at the end, I can't recommend \\"A Dirty Job\\" highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful read","review":"I don't remember a book that made me laugh so much. I enjoyed the peculiar plot, the interesting characters and Moore's hilarious way of describing things. His genius is in the way that he depicts dark events and characters with wit, clarity and empathy. It was just a wonderful, funny, delightful read. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun as usual","review":"As usual, Moore delivers a fun and darkly quirky book that focuses on the supernatural. The overall story is great (how can you NOT love a book that features a character named Minty Fresh?), but my favorite parts of the book were in the smaller moments, such as the different analyzes of the personalities of Beta Males, the woman who adds \\"like bear\\" after everything she says, Charlie's attempts at street slang, and his recovery from mourning. You can pretty much predict the reveal at the end, but it's worth sticking around for the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbled and Overrated","review":"\\"A Dirty Job\\" was my first Christopher Moore novel, and will probably be my last. I was captivated by the story line as I read the dust jacket, but found that the writing was not nearly as interesting. I thought the author spent way too many pages with humdrum matters of no real interest, and very little addressing the actual theme of the book. Although wanting to relate sympathetically to the book's hero, I just wasn't drawn in enough to care about him. The action began in the final quarter of the book, and you had better suspend reality before reading it. I actually couldn't wait for the book to end so I could move on to something more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It interested me at times but other times I just could not get into the story","review":"Right when reading what the book was about I was excited to read the book but was overall dissapointed. First off I have never read a Christopher Moore novel before so i dont know how her writes or his humor and so on. Sadely from the start of the book i could not get into it, by page 100 I got into it and found it enjoyable and funny at times, sadley by page 200 I lost interest again when hardley nothing happend and the story draged on. Overall I was upset with the book and would not recomand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"This was my third book by Christopher Moore and I am now intent on reading everything he has written. I love the way he weaves his stories with such clever humor that is right up my alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and funny","review":"Christopher Moore and his demons again... this time with totally new and original concept of \\"death merchants\\". I liked this book because:a. It's not LOL, but, as with best Moore's books, it is witty and \\"tongue in the cheek\\" funny.b. The idea is original - I can promise you you've never read anything similar. Again, as in \\"Lamb\\", Moore takes serious subject , but you will be chuckling all the way till the end... and then thinking about the book weeks after you finish it.c. I just loved both baby-sitters in this book. Thankfully, Moore is politically incorrect - but (or because of it?)very accurate in his exaggerations and absolutely hilarious.4 stars - I thought the ending is too predictable, but it may be just my interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"This can be funny in parts","review":"Review of the audiobook: I was looking forward to this one. I had read Lamb and enjoyed it even though it had many objectionable parts to it. I couldn't get over the swearing in this one. To much. I if you can get past that then you would probably like this book. I couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I usuallly buy Christopher Moore books at the store, but this was a great way to do it and it came right away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"A friend recommended this author, and I have loved every book of his I have read.

It is my favorite Christopher Moore so far, (although it's hard to top \\"Fluke\\")!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I actually recommened it to my friends","review":"I got to the \\"kitty\\" part and laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes. I had to stop and email my friends to tell them to pick it up. Two of them plan on reading it, or something else by him soon.On a less light note, it made me feel better about the whole death thing. I'm going through a tough time with a family member facing his mortality (he's 85) and this is just what I needed to give me hope of an after life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Too funny!","review":"I just discovered Christopher Moore's A Dirty Job. I'm halfway through the book and have laughed until I cried 3 times. The premise is far to zany and nuts to try to explain but it has to do with a beta male becoming death's minion. The writing is witty and funny and dead on humorous observations.Moore is completely irreverant as witnessed by one of his other books \\"Lamb: the lost gospel of Jesus's best friend Biff.\\" so if you offend easily, these books are not for you. But, if you want to laugh and appreciate a dry, intelligent humor, RUN to the bookstore and get all the Christopher Moore books you can find."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent read","review":"This is the first Moore book I have read. I thought it was ok. The story was pretty original and somewhat entertaining, but I just don't share his sense of humor. I love dark, bizarre humor, and that's what brought me to this book. My favorite author is Chuck Palahniuk, who, as many of you probably know, has an extremely dark and twisted sense of humor. I just didn't think that this book was all that funny. I admit, it did have its moments. There were times that I laughed pretty hard at this book, but these moments were few and far between. I saw many moments where this book was trying to be funny, it just seemed to me like Moore was trying too hard. I would be willing to try reading a Moore book again, but from what I could tell from this book, you need a very specific sense of humor to really enjoy this him. It is dark, but I thought it could be really corny and dumb at times too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"This book was too silly. Not to mention that because everyone has the exact same sense of humor..a dry obvious wit I was always aware that I was reading a book written by one person rather than engaging in all the characters.

Not to mention that the lead character is more neurotic that Woody Allen. b-o-r-i-n-gI could see this being a cartoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"I love Christopher Moore's insanity! This is one of my favorites. It's begins with a loss, but then it develops into a bizarre trip through the eyes of \\"death\\" and makes it a crazy adventure. The storyline is well done with wacky characters, creative villains, and a heroic child who knew she was in charge all along. A bonus is that some characters from one of Moore's appear in this book. If you like Moore's books, this is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read at a break neck pace.","review":"Christopher Moore's novel A Dirty Job does for Death what Gaiman and Pratchett did for the Armageddon in Good Omens. Funny, outrageous, and the very definition of \\"Don't want to put it down\\".It may not be the most insightful book to grace the shelves, but it's one of the more fun books to be released this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"D is for Death","review":"A question...What would happened if you were death?That is what Charlie Asher thought he was. Charlie saw a man in a mint green suit taking his dead wife's CD from her hospital room. Then strange things happen suddenly to him and his family. Here begins Christopher Moore's A Dirty Job (ten CDs, twelve hours, unabridged recording, Harper Audio).Fisher Stevens seems to have too much fun with these characters as he narrates his book. Director Rick Harris keeps Stevens well paced and FOCUSED in his narration.In the hands of author Christopher Moore, who has previous written The Stupidest Angel and Practical Demonkeeping, he makes the idea of death funny. He writes great humor and it comes out vocally. He pokes his stick of fun at death, evil, Internet dating and antiques.On a personal note, I recently suffered a few losses in my life lately and this book helped with its humor and wit..something we need more of in this worldBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a rip off by Amazon!","review":"I can't believe I just paid 6 bucks for a 300 word digital article!

If you're mathematically inclined like me then you will agree with Aronson of Evidence Based TA that the math in this book is subjective.This book is not completely without merit. It helps to understand what mistakes others might be making and the author is a truly sincere and honest writer. I don't doubt that he's made money as a Chartist using his methods. Unfortunately, it is too subjective and you'll probably lose money following this book (in the long run) without some more accurate measure of testing.

Though the science is adequate and the logic occasionally interesting to follow, the author cannot hide his thinly veiled sexist victorian philsophy. The text is full of barbs aimed at feminists, prostitutes, female scientists, and just about everyone else who doesn't happen to buy the religious right version of morality.

Fans of every age will read with fascination this \\"can't put down\\" saga of the making of a Hollywood star. Not only did she perform water stunts that at times were truly death-defying (some while pregnant!), but her ability to deal with the denizens of the casting couch and studio sleaze reveals a woman as smart as she was talented and beautiful.Put this at the top of your must-read list.Then, pass it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes for shock in order to sell books","review":"One wonders of Ms Williams is so desperate for cash that she has to tell something that she knows will hurt the family of Jeff Chandler. Between that and her allowing Fernando Lamas to keep her from her children leaves me terribly disillusioned. I used to think she was terrific. Now, I think people could just read Globe or one of the other sleezy newsmagazines and get the same results."},{"rating":"1","title":"esther williams in love with esther williams","review":"good grief it must have been hard to make these movies with out co stars.she told directors how to direct,swimmers how to swim,designed costumes filled and cleaned the pool and still had time to slander a man who loved her. and on top of all this she gave up her 3 children for a guy who had a greatpenis. how lucky we are to have her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Williams is All Wet","review":"I never had any feelings about Esther Williams one way or another before reading this book (thank goodness I took it out of the library and didn't pay for it!). But now I actively dislike the woman.Did we really need to know that Jeff Chandler was a transvestite? Didn't the thought, \\"gee, maybe I should just keep my trap shut about this?\\" ever cross Williams' mind? And did she realize that her unsympathetic, sarcastic and unfeeling reaction to Chandler's confession would paint her in the most unflattering light?Utter garbage--not very well written, shrewish gossip.

Very Good Book !!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A self important woman still diving off the backs of others","review":"If you are of an age which allows you to remember Esther as your favorite pool pal don't destroy your fantasies with this book. Following endless self aggrandizing tales of \\"besting\\" the moguls of Hollywood with her youthful wit and intellect the book descends into a smarmy tell-all about people no longer with us. When not outsmarting the movie industry leaders Esther recalls the size and power of genitalia belonging to husbands, lovers and even acquaintances. Of course, what would you expect from someone who allowed one set of genitals to keep her from her own children for 22 years! As she says at the close of this effort, referring to the Olympic medal, \\"Even I never won one.\\" Good reason, Es, as this book goes to show - you are no champ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Million dollar Mermaid debut as movie star","review":"I loved this movie even as a child.Red Skelton's sketch at the ballet class is not only a riot but a classic act. The story itself is simplistic.Red is left pactically at the altar by afurious Esther Williams. Red follows his wife only to be confronted by the fact that she is teaching at an all girls school.And so the fun begins. Loved Xavier Cugat's numbers andalthough not a fan of Harry James still enjoyed the movie.Ifyou are after an old fashioned 90 minutes of entertainement then I suggest you get Bathing beauty. Oh, it is also Estherfirst staring role(I am enjoying her autobiography at the moment).Recomend it.PS review refers to Bathing beauty movie and her book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I was always a huge fan of Ms Williams, along with a lot of actors of that era. I was looking forward to reading her book. It was well written...but...I was shocked to realize that she is the type of woman who HAS to have a man in her life. Even to the point of choosing Fernando Lamas over her children.I'm not sure that I believe the story about Jeff Chandler in the dress, but who cares. It seems that a lot of other actors and friends dispute Ms. Williams' story. Either way it was very tacky to write about it. Actually, I had a hard time giving it even one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"the million dollar phoney","review":"Esther Williams has a very high opinion of herself(undeserved).Her films seem insipid now. In the telling of her life she was cruel to people who could not defend themelves,and she comes out smelling like a old fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illusions Shattered","review":"Tawdry. Sleazy. Clueless. One searches for words to describe this tell-all book by one of Hollywood's golden age icons. Esther's career suffered and came to a premature end because the industry and public weren't able to take her seriously as anything but a mermaid. With this incredibly banal book, she has finally proven them right. Rarely have I read of a more wasted life. Her self-destructive marital history alone is enough to make one wonder just what is inside that beautiful head. If you have any fond memories of the lovely young woman who captivated movie audiences during the 40's and 50's, stay away from this dreadful book and retain your illusions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seem like a good idea at the time?!","review":"Having been a huge fan of Williams movies I looked forward to reading this book. However, Ms. Williams drives her main point across-that one should never expect too much of their favorite stars. The book seemed more like a way of therapy for Ms Williams, who seemed unable to realize the responbility that her behavior lead to some of her problems. I find it bizzare that in one chapter she can be staring down Mayer and four chapters later cowaring under an oppressive husband. I was disappointed in this biograpghy. While lengthy, it had little depth or writing style, other than as shock vaule. But, if you like books that are short on substance and long on style, by all means read it. My recommendation, check it out from the library"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good watch","review":"I've owned this watch for about two years by now and I'm very happy.

I cherish my dog-eared copy among my most prized possessions :) Of course, when I read it these days I notice many things that I just didn't understand when I was ten years old (some of the kids in the story are twelve and thirteen years old, and to me at the time it felt, like, _old age_! :)))) I think that Lindgren wrote it as a TV series first, and later turned into a novel - which actually helps understand some of the story better: it does feel as if it's made for TV - and I'd love to see the original series simply to enjoy more of the book's simple but magical world. Seacrow Island is an absolute must for every child or adult!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for study and information.","review":"We have been using this for a bible study, and it has generated lots of response.

After, it is'nt the skiiers minds on display, its their physical prowess and courage no doubt but some of the conversations are really terribly sophomoric and perfect for passing out on the couch, funny that should happen watching a ski movie. The worst part is you see some heavy powder skis, you see the mountain tearing up and coming down right behind the skiier and the film cuts away to some other guy doing overdone backflips somewhere. The elegance and art of skiing is lost and one has this feeling of never really seeing a full run. Youtube posts are much better. A bit of a waste of money and time. Well, the producers made some revenue since I bought a few of these. Verdict: dont bother, go to youtube, search for extreme skiing, ski jumps etc. much better content and fully loaded clips"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lynn Cheney made a mistake, same for Victor","review":"Lynn Cheney made a mistake with this novel; that mistake was letting her husband know of her primal yearnings to become the first female vice prez of the usa.

Her real-life husband, Dick Cheney, is also 59 and has, of course, just survived his fourth heart attack. Is the book cursed? In 1988, when the novel was originally published, Dick Cheney suffered his third heart attack and underwent quadruple bypass surgery. Twelve years later, the novel reappears and Cheney's heart fails again. In addition, There is something else in Mrs. Cheney's book that might give Mr. Cheney pause.

Of course, it's easy to get the likeness of characters like Darth Vader, Boba Fett and clone/stormtroopers, but still impressive. The paint job is spot-on and it's very durable. The trooper is a great action pose, stepping over the dead trooper. Very cool. A must-have for SW fans and movie collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well done game, but be careful.","review":"Vigilante 8 really surprised me. I was expecting an updatedTwisted Metal, which Vigilante is, but it surpasses TM on every level.The graphics, music, and weapons are the best features on the game. Some minor problems are there though. It can be hard to control the cars, especially in the air and on the water. You eventually get used to it, but there is a learning curve. The physics engine has some issues as well. If you're not careful, your vehicle will bounce around the screen like an out of contol pinball--causing a game crash/freeze or having to start the level over. However, I highly recommend the game, especially if you like Twisted Metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"well good game but....","review":"I bought mine from a seller named nutter678 and recieved it perfectly....FOR PLAYSTATION!i still play it i have evry system but DAMN brand new dreamcast and i cant get a game for it. good game though."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Game Of All Time","review":"Everything in this game is beyond amazing.

He would have safeguarded his name better by dying before he wrote it. The book is full of irritating anachronisms like some silly, adolescent pretension at parody. He pretends to take umbrage at pedants who complain that Macbeth was not played on stage before 1610 by pointing to some obscure performance of 1590; but ridiculously asserts that that the same highwayman who robbed Oliver Cromwell also robbed Cardinal Richelieu. His historical allusions have no sync, and his irritating allusions to B-grade actors, directors and cinematic cliches add to the unsatisfactory mayhem of a storyteller's mind who is past bothering and disdains his readership.

While avoiding arcane technical descriptions, which would be mind numbing to most of the public, he takes the middle ground, weaving personal vignettes with an above average description of the scientific and engineering details. However, his true gift is apparent in his personal description of some of the unsung heroes who made this journey possible. The reader is introduced to individuals like William Pickering, Bill O'Neil, John Casani, and Linda Morabito, just to name a few. These people, who are all but unknown to the public, and their remarkable spacecraft deserve their moment in the spotlight. However, as former JPL Director Dr. Bruce Murray once wrote, \\"there are no parades for robots.\\" Perhaps, this book will be their march of glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and informative","review":"Journey beyond Selene, like one of the reviewer has said, is a engaging, anecdote filled book.

It is an interesting turn around. The originators of the TV series Star Trek looked at the research that was being done and extrapolated this research into their characters. In turn, these characters were looked at by researchers to see how their research might really be carried forward.In this book, Dr. Penny Baillie-de Byl, an Australian university lecturer has in turned looked at the research being conducted and tied it back to the TV show characters. She looks at androids and at purely projection characters such as those that are generated on the holodeck.The chapter I liked best was her discussion of the Turing Test, a test Alan Turing devised to determine if a machine could think - (what's think, what's a machine).

They are quality videos to watch whenever. My favorites are of course the most popular, Thriller, Bad, and Black and White.

Needless to say, I think this is just a bad DVD collection. From the outset, it seems like this DVD was put together in an hour. No time was taken to make it interactive, with extras, or any other bonus material. Some of the videos seem grainy and are apparently different from the one's you may have seen on MTV.

For the last 15 years he's interviewed 144 people from all over the world, so the book combines an analysis of ancient wisdom along with modern experiences of mountains which include the science and spirituality of mountains.What I particularly liked was that Cooper offers no easy answers in reading the mountains. He is wise enough to know that there are only more and deeper journeys of the intellect and instinct. But he also realises there is paradox too. The mountains are accessible and inaccesible, fascinating and beguiling.For anyone who wants to understand how mountains have entered and keep their place in the human consciousness, this is the book they need.There are other sacred mountain books (Bernbaum etc) but Cooper's is the best. It's scholarly, clear, challenging and insightful.Douglas Henderson"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could have gotten the same out of a broken plastic hangar","review":"I purchased this at the same time I purchased a larger back massager.

I've used it nearly two years now and it's amazing. A staple of my daily activities.This back buddy mini is made of a much shoddier, much weaker plastic that widens upon pressure, right out of the box. Imagine trying to apply pressure to a knot in your neck or back with a slightly flimsy piece of plastic... Exactly.I bought this as a gift, and I regret it. It isn't completely worthless, but comparing it to the deluxe model isn't even a contest. If you have the money, get the back buddy. You'll be grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"back massager","review":"Works great. Can easily take it to work with you, especially if you have a desk job.

This tool is so handy---it's small enough for me to carry in my tote everywhere. The only drawback is that the knob that does the massaging is pointed which can be a little too intense for certain areas. I wish the designers would make one this size with a rounded knob. But another plus---the other end is a back-scratcher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless- except as a backscratcher","review":"This is absolutely the worst massage product I have ever experienced. The knob is sharp and uncomfortable. The material is not sturdy enough to actually apply pressure to a trigger point; instead, it bends and feels like it is going to snap in half. I recently tried out a full size Theracane and I will be getting one of those. I will say, this has a backscratcher on one end and that is delightful except that you can buy a backscratcher at basically any gas station near a major highway.Also, mine came with a sticker of San Francisco on it which makes me think it is a cheap Chinese import (which might explain the quality) instead of being a helpful therapeutic device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Flimsy - Get a Theracane instead","review":"I have a Theracane, which I absolutely love (for my neck and shoulders), but I wanted something smaller for travel. This one is a good size, but it's too flimsy (bendable plastic) to get enough pressure. Also, unlike the Theracane, the tip is pointy and a little sharp instead of being rounded and pain-free. P.S. It's flesh-colored, so you're bound to get some phallic jokes too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for travel, but only barely so...","review":"I get huge relief from theThera Cane Massagerand have recommended it to several friends who have thanked me for the recommendation because they, too, are so pleased with it. But, the Thera Cane was too big and too heavy to add to my suitcase on a cruise where the air lines' baggage limit was 50#, and I had lots of other stuff that I needed to pack. So, I bought the Body Back Buddy, Mini. With a little bit of work, I could indeed reach some trigger points near my lumbar spine and hips, but I could not in any way come close to the degree of relief that I got with the Thera Cane. On the other hand, the Body Back Buddy, Mini was light-weight and low-priced, and it fit comfortably into one of the front pockets of my suitcase, so for my trip it was better than nothing...but not a whole lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective, OK as back scratcher","review":"The tool bends too much and there is no sufficient leverage for it to be effective for me.

It is as I remember him from Montreal in the 60's at the folk clubs...and even my high school for a benefit concert...and as I have seen him repeatedly throughout the years since amnesty permitted him to return to the states. I love his studio productions...but it is the complexity of the musical structure and lyrics hidden beneath the apparent simplicity of his guitar and voice on this recording that reveal this true artist for what he is: a senstive, gentle man, who sings from the heart.This recording is, in my opinion, testimony to what has been the underpinning of Jesse's career since those early days in the drafty coffee houses like the Yellow Door and the New Penelope....

So I couldn't help but want to check Mr. Ford's books out. But must admit, as a lover of Michael Connelly, I have high expectations, and was afraid they might be unmet. They weren't. What a wonderful treat. To have a writer who could continue the drama and tension throughout the book with extraordinary writing and character development ... and at the same time ... take me to places we had seen in our own GB 46 was such fun.

Instead of putting the package under the overhang, the individual placed the parcel in a plastic bag outside in the rain. By the time I fetched the box, it had become a reader copy. painful even to look at. The fault, as I see it, lies equally between the seller and the post office. As it is (of course) impossible to obtain redress from either party, I have tossed the book into the camping trailer, thinking to read it next summer on our next trip.

He devotes as much space to a pigeon receiving a medal as he does to Foch. Some analysis of the social, political, & above all the technology & science of the War would have been helpful in understanding the carnage. He portrays the War in a vacuum. Gilbert seems unsure of his audience. Historians looking for explanation would not be satisfied. The general public would be hard pressed to find a theme, other than slaughter, & consequently would be wading through a repetitious mass of facts with only the names of the battles changing. The book is very helpful for collectors of ancedotes and perhaps trivia. A few more maps of the battlefields would have been handy. Tuchman, & even Taylor, give a far more challenging picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"a mediocre treatise of a key historic even","review":"Gilbert's book tries to hard to be all things to all readers. He never quite hits the mark. An over abundance of research is presented throughout with little concern to larg issues.Gilbert spends far too much time concerned with minor players and as a result, trivializes their sacrifice.The large questions at the strategic and operational level are not thoroughly explored in favor of a tedious exploration that seems to recount the delivery of each shell and bullet.Too see a history with tactical explanation done correctly I direct you to \\"Delivered FroM Evil\\" by Robert Leckie (WWII)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic overview","review":"Gilbert's one-volume account of World War I is replete with the high level content expected in a single-volume history. This text discusses various root causes of WWI, all major battles and the socio-political atmosphere of all combatant nations, both during and after their participation in the war.Gilbert does not stay strictly with an overview perspective, but rather puncuates key moments, whether they be policy enactments or key seconds in a fierce battle, with eye-witness accounts. These hands-on perspectives serve to move the point of the text from a mere history lesson to a cautionary tale of poignant significance.This text is a fantastic start for anyone interested in studying the basics of WWI.

This one was cheaper.When I had finished reading it, I began referring to WWI as the \\"Poet's War\\" because apparently it was fought primarily by poet's and philosophers.I finally went and purchased Keegan's book. Read that, not this. It doesn't cover the build up to war as well as Keegans. It doesn't cover the grand sweep of the battles as well as Keegan's. It doesn't explain things as well as Keegan's. It does list a lot more poets who took part in the war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the beginning","review":"Like the reviewer called \\"Corndoc\\", I thought the best part of this book was its focus on personal stories.

It isn't. It is as simple as this, if you want to believe the lies that the British and French General Staffs were telling their governments and the people, then this book is replete with them. However, if you wish to read the historical facts about World War 1, then you should read one that contains actual facts rather than the opinions of this author.whale"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort by Date","review":"I'm not privy to the specific tchniques that Gilbert used in compiling this volume, but one suspects that he compiled a large computer database with each entry carefully dated. He ignored any large scale accounts such as analyses of campaigns and battles and, instead, concentrated on personal accounts, letters, and poems. (He apparently discarded none of the latter). Finally, he sorted by date, edited this chronological assortment of personal accounts, and called it a \\"complete history.\\"The result is a disjointed, small scale view of the battlefield with little insight into the large events that made up World War I. One is left with a sense of the incredible stupidity of the political and military leaders that led to the senseless slaughter of millions of men. If you didn't already know that, then buy the book. If you already knew this essential fact about WWI, there may be better (and more complete) histories out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Apologist's Tale of WWI","review":"I was extremely disappointed with Martin Gilbert's The First World War: A Complete History. Gilbert gives very short shrift to the Central Power's perspective. Gilbert painstakingly documents every instance of German excess in Belgium while ignoring the effect of the Allied Blockade, resulting in the \\"Turnip Winter\\" of 1917. While it is important to document the savage brutality of trench warfare, the British war poets quoted by Gilbert cannot claim to speak for the majority of combatants on either side. This work falls quite short of being the complete history of WWI."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it!","review":"Material is too old.

However,Scientific American is not doing the public much good with such old material. They first published this book for $11.95. It seems that W. H.

The running exemplar has he uses (Toyota) illustrates his theoretical arguments quite elonquently. The book also highlights the limitations of his concept of collaborative advantage, and his closing chapter illustrates how cultural differences (here with Benz) can keep this strategy from becoming reality.

The book takes the reader through the initial successes and the ultimate failure of the German U-Boat program as seen through the eyes of one of the few men who has lived through the entire war in a German sub.

Solid adventure!","review":"Not often that the defeated soldier/sailor documents a war experience, so it is interesting to learn about the war from the German perspective. Werner is clearly not a literary genious, these pages read more like his diary, and one suspects the tales have grown a bit over between the fighting days and 1969 when the book was published. Some of it is clearly self-aggrandizing. But a very fine summer read for me, and if you enjoy action-adventure this will be a great book for you. (I read \\"Iron Curtains\\" immediately after finishing Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air\\" about the Everest adventure, and the similarities of adventure-tragedy are apparent between the two books.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"riveting","review":"An amazing true story of the U-Boat war. Mr Werner is a survivor and a very strong willed man. Werner's tale of the U-boat war had me glued to every page. I was gripped with the tension of the cat and mouse game that the German U-boats played with the Allied escorts. The desperate struggle to survive was replaced by an equally desperate lust for life when the crews were in port. It was also interesting to see Werner slowly come to the realisation that the war was lost. Seeing this from a German point of view rather than the Allied view was new for me. I think this book was a great read and thank Mr Werner for recording his experiences so that they are not lost to history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes \\"Das Boot\\" seem tame by comparison","review":"Not to take anything away from \\"Das Boot\\", a fine book and an even finer movie, but the underlying tragedy of this story is as unrelenting as it is gripping. Even if fully half of the perils that U-230 and her crew faced were \\"embellished\\" in some way (and I'm not claiming that they were), the story that remains is so harrowing as to beggar belief.

You will get to see Wagner and Powers fulfill everything you wanted to see here, they make love, they fight crime, high-speed chases, gunfire, intrigue, jetsetting, you name it. Also, any fan of 80s detective series will enjoy this. The list of 80s detectives is not short. Magnum P.I., Moonlighting, Rockford Files (okay, 70s), Remington Steele, Miami Vice, and so on all share the conventions of a bye-gone genre.

It also included footage of a couple \\"gags\\" but what I would really like to see in future season releases are \\"bloopers.\\" And, I certainly hope that each season release has commentary on at least one episode, perhaps that one that is a favorite of the two stars of the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actors Prevail","review":"Actually, until I bought this DVD, I had forgotten how silly (or simplistic) most of the plots were. However, this is more than made up for by the charisma and ability of the actors. Stefanie Powers is absolutely gorgeous, Robert Wagner is easy to look at, Lionel Stander is a hoot, and \\"Freeway\\" is adorable. It is hard to believe, watching this, that Wagner and Powers aren't truly married and madly in love.

They'd get caught up in some twisted mystery and end up trying to catch the bad guys. It would always end with the two of them together with a corny line and a kiss. Max their buttler and cook and driver was pretty cool too.Back in the day, this was the show that had all the right elements to make it a hit.

I had to go to Wikipedia to supplement my knowledge so that I could understand the book. It was wordier than it had to be.

The book is full of wonderful prints of art works and reading the comparisons between baroque masterpieces and modern installation art and paintings increases my pleasure in both.In addition, Mieke Bal is a prominent narratologist, and her discussions of the narrative aspects of the visual art she discusses are fascinating. She proposes a narratology that surpasses the limited formalist categories, and theorises a narration in visual art, both in art with textual components and seemingly abstract, or at least non-figurative art.

This was a tremendous (and I hope embarrassing) oversight on NOVA's part, as there are several breeds of chickens that have feathered feet.

The movie is enjoyable, but don't expect it to be as good as a classic like DRACULA or FRANKENSTEIN. If you enjoy films like THE BRUTE MAN or CAPTIVE WILD WOMAN, you will enjoy THE MONSTER AND THE GIRL. So why only one star? The DVD has audio drop outs starting at 8 minutes into the film. Universal and Amazon are aware of the issue, but the problem has still not been fixed. It starts in the beginning courtroom scene where the prosecutor is saying the word \\"fingerprints\\" but you only get to hear \\"finger...\\" It continues from there with frequent audio dropouts. It is a problem wit the DVD because the old VHS tape does not have these flaws. If you must have the film on DVD, then buy it, but beware that the static dialogue is annoying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"A piece of junk.

The lyrics are funny, poignant and thoughtful; often all three at once. The music is well written, lyrical and powerful without overshadowing the meaning of the words.

You know, the kind you walked out of the theater singing? After seeing the film version of Phantom of the Opera and seeing this show last night at the Pantages, I seriously wonder if any Broadway writers remember how to write a song. Where are the \\"Maria\\"s? The \\"When you're a jet\\"s? The \\"Sound of Music\\"s? Nowadays they just crank out verbose, meandering showcase numbers for the leads to just belt away...and nothing more. I'd give my right nut for another Grease, another Tommy, another Rocky Horror Show, Hair, Camelot or man of La Mancha. I know people want to see a musical about the Wicked Witch of the West - I did - but let's call a spade a spade and admit these songs go nowhere (and trust me, I know of what I'm talking about, being a songwriter and musician for many years). Neat premise.

However, if you don't really appreciate musicals, I doubt you're going to enjoy this.

I wasn't quite sure on some of the lyrics which is why I bought the C.D. instead of the download because it comes with a complete song lyric booklet as well as pictures from the Original Broadway Cast.

Sure, the lyrics are semi-cheesy, but it's a combination of amazing, talented voices and decent written material.

The power of Idina Menzel's voice is incredible. There cannot ever have been a show-stopper like the stunning \\"Defying Gravity\\" in the history of the theater. \\"For Good,\\" the beautiful duet between Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, is perhaps the most poignantly engaging ballad about friendship ever recorded. Other bests on this cd are \\"Popular\\" (Chenoweth is hysterical to boot), \\"What Is This Feeling?\\", \\"The Wizard and I,\\" \\"I'm Not That Girl,\\" and the beautiful love song duet \\"As Long As You're Mine.\\" Also notable is \\"No Good Deed,\\" the song during which Elphaba truly becomes \\"Wicked.\\" Although I'm not a fan of most of the other tracks, this cd is a must-have for these eight tracks alone. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly Amazing","review":"I bought this cd because so many people had told me how amazing it was. I bought it and the first song came on. It actaully scared me because of the loud hit. But I started to listen intently. Idina Menzel (also Maureen in RENT) gives her best performance to date. Her range is incredible and her voice is perfect for each song. She has a very low mysterious voice and a powerfully high section especially on Defying Gravity. But she also shows she can contain its power on For Good.Also Kirsten Chenoweth who is best know for Tony award winning place on You're A Good Man Charley Brown, stands out with her voice. She has a very operatic voice at times but it suites so many different styles. Its absolutly perfect for the part.Overall I was completely pleased with this CD and know that it will go down in Broadway history as an amazing and unique show. Here is my top 5 songs1. For Good2. Defying Gravity3. As Long As Your Mine4. What is this Feeling?5. No Good Deed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice!!","review":"I'm taking my 13 yr old to see the show next month and wanted to get her the CD to listen to the music ahead of time! She loves it!!

Wicked is a magical and exiting new musical with tuneful songs by Stephen Schwartz and an exiting book by Winnie Holtzman. There are no flaws with this show. Tony Winner Idina Menzel steals the show as Elphaba, Kristin Chenowith is terrific as is Joel Grey.This show lost to another creative and fun new musical called Avenue Q, so if you are thinking of seeing that, go ahead, I think that's great, but I suggest Wicked more. Listen to this CD and you will see why. With meaningful lyrics, suberb vocals and tunefull songs, this is the real winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked (2003 Original Broadway Cast)","review":"What a wonderful arrangement of music.

I haven't been able to see \\"Wicked\\" on stage, but just listening to the fantastic vocals of Idina Menzel and Kristen Chenoweth, oh how I wish I could. As the Amazon.com reviewer said, the songs from this production are not exactly Cole Porter, but the star turns by Chenoweth and Menzel make some of the mediocre lyrics tolerable. Also great, but often overlooked, is Joel Grey's performance as the Wizard. His big song, \\"Wonderful\\" is a hoot to listen to. Among the many songs on this CD \\"Popular,\\" \\"Defying Gravity,\\" and \\"Thank Goodness\\" rank as my favorites. \\"For Good\\" and \\"As Long as You're Mine\\" are also very good. For anyone who loved the Wizard of Oz or Gregory Maguire's novel, Wicked, this is a must-have CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wicked\\" is Wonderful!","review":"I love Broadway shows and music, and this CD did not disappoint!

(In fact, I had to buy another copy when the first one wore out!) The music is so fresh and real, with singers/actors singing to an actual orchestra instead of studio equipment altering the sound. All of the songs are well-written and passionately sung. (You can hear the emotion in the singing) The best part of this CD, I think, is that even people who never saw the play can follow the plot and enjoy the music at the same time. Of course, I highly recommend seeing the show since it was fantastic, but if you decide not to, the CD is still nothing short of mesmerizing. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked is Wickedly Good","review":"I didn't get to see the show with the original cast -- so I'm glad I could get this CD.

Idina Menzel is a such a powerful singer. She is THE Elphaba and definetley deserved the Tony for \\"Best Lead Actress in a Musical\\" back in 2004. I also love Kristin Chenoweth. She's hillarious, and she can sing anything. She is also THE Glinda. The two of them always sound great together and solo. There's nothing I dislike about it.

I like all of the songs but my favorites are:No One Mourns the WickedThe Wizard and IPopularI'm Not that GirlDefying GravityThank GoodnessNo Good DeedFor GoodFinaleI like the finale because it is a great way to end the c.d.

One day I asked about the show and, hearing it was good, I decided to buy the CD. I am a big fan of musicals and was excited to explore something new to me. When the CD arrived I immediately popped it into my computer. The music exceeded my expectations. The score is full of energy and drama and I greatly enjoy singing along. Idina Menzel's voice is so spectacular (as Elphaba) I can't get enought of it! Kristin Chenoweth (as Galinda) has a quirky but likeable voice and the rest of the cast is strong as well. Although I was able to glean bits of the story line from the music, I have decided to read the book now to fill in the gaps. I hope to see the actual show when it comes my way in August! This CD is a MUST HAVE for all musical lovers and should become a \\"classic\\" over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This musical is amazing.

I was completely blown away. Stunned. It was nearly perfection. Such a great, creative spin on the old story. I found Elphaba twice as compelling as Dorothy. I had to buy the soundtrack while I was there. I have not stopped listening to it since. Wicked is full of fun, playful, beautiful music. Easy to sing along to and harmonize with. It was the best production I have seen on stage, and this recording takes me right back to the play like I am there. I get to relive it all over again. \\"What is This Feeling\\" and \\"Popular\\" are such energizing, exciting tracks, and \\"Defying Gravity\\" is the perfect Broadway catch song. All the songs are great, but those three are my favorite. Honestly, I am not sure if I would love this CD if I had not seen it live, but then, that is true with most musicals. Wicked is a must have for any theater and show tune lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oz-some","review":"I just had the honor of seeing this show on Broadway, and let me tell you it was the most amazing and brilliant thing i have ever seen in my life.

Don't hesitate to buy this CD, the sonsg will be stuck in your head for ages, and you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic, Pure and Simple","review":"Seeing this play is perhaps the most exciting moment of my life of enjoying live theatre. We all know the story of the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and this is the music that explains why one witch is good while the other is \\"evil\\" (really, she's just a misunderstood animal rights activist).

If you love musicals, you will love Wicked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ding Dong, This Witch Is D.O.A.","review":"I've never read Gregory Maguire's cult novel this bombastic musical was based on, but if it's half as pretentious as Stephen Schwartz' unoriginal songs and its over-wrought score, then lucky me. After witnessing the elaborate, multi-million dollar train wreck on stage, I approached the soundtrack with trepidation but swore to realize that they are two separate entities. On CD, Chenowenth sings sweetly enough and her comic timing is precise, but the tone of her affect is parody - it's as if she is winking at us. Idina Menzel, so good in \`Rent', here sings so over-the-top and so forcefully that any character nuance loses any iota of emotion and the big number \`Defying Gravity' lies flat due to her dissipated power - the 'showstopper' that ends act 1 becomes it's anti-climax. My one sentence review of both the show and it's soundtrack: the cast of TVs \`Fame' Meets Cirque De Soleil. My grade C+"},{"rating":"1","title":"unPopular","review":"While the score has a few terrific numbers (Popular, Defying Gravity), this one is, at best, uneven. The opening number is awful. Others are laughable. I really enjoyed the book and was terribly disappointed seeing the show. I have enjoyed much of Stephen Schwartz's earlier work. I gave this cast recording repeated listens and never warmed to it. Despite all the praise, Wicked is just not up to par for me. Some of the lyrics are pedestrian. There is little character development or plot advancement through song. The Wizard's songs are awful. The show never decides what it wants to be about or whose story it should be. The leads are terrifically talented and deserve a better written show. IMHO, Avenue Q absolutely deserved the Tony over Wicked."},{"rating":"1","title":"It made me laugh...a lot","review":"So after not being able to finish the book because it was so boring to me I listened to the music from this musical and read the whole synopsis. Actually it sounded like an interesting story and the music was at times stunning. However I would often find myself laughing at it for all it tried to be. It seemed almost like every song had to be a power ballad just to prove it was a good musical and ever song could be a hit. It didn't succeed. It just doesn't have the magic that some musicals have. \\"For Good\\" was the only song I thought was stunning and came close to those moments others musicals have that everything is just seems so unearthly and amazing. Other than that it is good, just not unbelievable like Sound of Music, Big River, The Phantom of the Opera, Lion King...it's just not in the ranks with those."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few standout gems, but I think it plays better on stage..","review":"I am so disappointed. After my sister in law saw the show she raved about the soundtrack so I got it. I really do not like it. Aside from a few gems, like \\"Popular\\", there are no impressive things in this show. The choral numbers and wizard songs sound like an odd mesh of gospel and ragtime. Maybe I am just not a fan of Stephen Schwartz's work. This guy brought us Godspell, Prince of Egypt, Hunchback (which by the way should never have been animated or turned into a musical). I just suggest reading the book or maybe to go see the show, the performers could really turn this mess around. All in all, this show has no charisma and a lot of simplictic and repetitive music that sounds like it was written in the early 80s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh ... music doesn't carry on its own","review":"The music of Wicked was so so. It wasn't terrible - but most certainly wasn't worth all the praise it's been recieving. I got the CD because of all the fabulous reviews ... but I would be careful in buying over just that. I personally haven't seen the musical on Broadway. From photos I've seen (and the number performed at the \\"Macy's Thanksgiving Parade\\"), it looks like a spectacular work of eye-candy and choreography ... however, the music on its own doesn't carry. There's an inconsitancy in the style of music, jumping from rock-musical (a style which I personally don't prefer, and dominates most of the album) and some typical Broadway. The text is poorly written as well. The only song that I felt was well done was \\"Popular.\\" The music is unfortunately wasted on some very talented performers. It's probably one of those shows where you need the entire in-person Broadway experience. The CD on its own, though - don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sondheim still has it","review":"He always could write a song...

If you like musicals, you'll enjoy this, believe me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turly Amazing Musical","review":"This is a truly amazing musical. The sets, the acting, the humor and the dramatic touches all lend to an excellent story that transports you back into the Land of Oz, but told from a different perspective. The Cast Recording album, like most Broadway recordings, captures the main songs and pieces that advance the story. While not a substitute for the real thing, this album evokes memories from the show and also entertains those who haven't yet seen the production.Truly a first rate album and production! I see Tonys written all over this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW - Powerful broadway is back!!!!","review":"This is an amazing soundtrack. I wish I could give it more than 5 stars! You will want to belt out the songs along with Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel - what powerful female leads! The volume cannot go loud enough for Defying Gravity!! Joel Grey is sensational as the wizard. The soundtrack reminds me of the days when you would sing along loudly and happily to the broadway soundtrack. Chenoweth, one of my personal favorites, has an amazing voice and is full of life. I saw Wicked in Philadelphia with a great cast, but this original recording is second to none. Enjoy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wicked - the most amazing broadway play ever.","review":"I just saw wicked this past Saturday and lemme tell you, i think everyone should go and see it.

Idina Menzel gives me chills every time I hear \\"Defying Gravity.\\" You'll know what I mean when you hear the last 20 seconds of the piece. Overall, a hilarious (\\"Popular\\") and heartfelt (\\"For Good\\") show, with voices to boot. Get it, and love it... for good."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!","review":"This edition of the Wicked soundtrack is wonderful - i bought it about a week before seeing Wicked on Broadway for my first time (and it absolutely blew me away), and it was nice to hear the songs and get a feel for the musical numbers in the production. I recommend it to everybody who enjoys musical theatre, be it you've seen Wicked yet or not! You will find yourself strangely addicted to the songs and listening to the soundtrack repeatedly! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"I was originally reluctant to listen to this album because, in all my years, I have never heard a single Schwarz song which I liked, let alone an entire soundtrack.Until now.From the Opening \\"No One Mourns the Wicked\\" to the final bars, here is a score filled with humor, pathos, and pure soaring, hummable melody. And the accompaniments aren't bad either.And of course, the performances are top-notch, as about every reviewer has recognized.It is destined to be a classic of the musical theatre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My child and I adaore this cd.

Thank you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern broadway everyone can enjoy","review":"I have not seen the show, so I can only speak to the cast album, but I have to say this is a show I have thoroughly enjoyed. It does not have the intellectual challenge of, say, a Sondheim show, but it gives you memorable melodies and snappy, inventive lyrics that play across a wide range of emotions. I teach choral music, and I have used the album to introduce my students to \\"new\\" Broadway- they love it! Highlights for me include: What is this feeling?, Dancing Through Life, Popular, For Good, and the amazing Defying Gravity. I would love to see the show in person someday, but until then, the cast album is a lovely treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"If you saw the show and enjoyed it, you'll love this CD.

She taped \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" and \\"No Good Deed\\" for me, and the addiction began. I'm now the proud owner of the CD and it's on constant rotation in my car.The vocal talent combined with a captivating score make the incredible story of Wicked compelling and heart wrenching. \\"Defying Gravity\\" takes my breath away every time.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wicked Good","review":"Here's a great example of a spectacular show in which the spectacle enhances the story, rather than hides the fact that there isn't one. [Insert name of Andrew Lloyd Webber show here]What I like most about the show is that, unlike many popular musicals, it has ideas, especially those espoused in the Wizard's numbers: that people need a common enemy to pull them together, and that history is written by the victors. Both of those notions are very timely indeed. But the great thing about Wicked is that in works on a populist level as well.The show has some minor flaws: most of Elphaba's numbers end on a reeeeeeaaaaaallllllly looooooong nooooooooooote, which gets a bit much after a while, although the suburban school girls and soccer moms eat it up. And the power ballad in the second act, \\"As Long As You're Mine,\\" is generic and superfluous. But on the whole, Wicked remains a funny, affecting, and satisfying show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kansas here I come","review":"I love this sound track and can't wait to see the show.

When I came home, I happened to see my sister's Wicked soundtrack lying around and decided to listen to a few songs my director had mentioned. Well, they were awesome, and I borrowed the soundtrack for a few days to learn all the songs. I printed out the lyrics from a website, and now I just go around singing them all day long! I'm going to NY this summer and I really hope to see Wicked, because I know it would be totally amazing to see these songs that I already think are awesome performed on Broadway!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FEEL WICKED!","review":"Simply put.......this is as good as it gets!

Seeing it all together, is a completely different kettle of fish to just listening to the score. Excellent stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"a musical tragedy","review":"Gregory McGuire's \\"WICKED\\" is one of the best fantasy novels I have read in years. This is a complex, political, sexual, psychological novel, so I was understandibly shocked with I heard that it was being \\"musicalized\\" by the ever unsatisfying Stephen Schwartz - then I discover the McGuire admires his work! That's like taking your best effort and flushing it down the toilet!I saw the musical - great performances (save Joel Grey \\"phoning it in\\") - great sets & costumes - and SUCH A HEADACHE by the end of the evening (and WHY did they HAVE to CHANGE the ending?)Trust me the novel is GREAT FICTION (an exceptional work) - the musical is CRAP - derivative sloppy CRAP - not at all up the the standard of the book.Trust me - this show lost the Tony's for good reasons! - Read the book and forget the show (although we can all count on it being on the road for years to come - go figure) - face it folks, most of Broadway is about selling tix - not the quality of the show!Caveat emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Show","review":"This show is horrible. The music is substandard. The story is moronic. How it can appeal to anyone over the age of 10 is beyond me. Turn your brain off before turning this CD on. It's a disgrace to the talents of Menzel and Chenoweth. It's an embrassment to Joel Grey. It sounds like a bad version of all the rest of Schwartz's shows. And it completely bastardizes the source material by Gregory Maguire. If you like the book WICKED this show will offend your sensibilities. If you have an appriciation for well written shows, this WICKED will offend your sensibilities. Don't waste your time or money on this CD or the tacky and childish show is represents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst musical of all time? Probably.","review":"Banal, mainstream fluff for the crowd that enjoys musical adaptations of Legally Blond and Disney movies. A great concept completely ruined by music composed for the lowest common denominator. Simply singing your dialogue does not make it a \\"song\\" -- and such lame, corny dialogue at that. Utterly agonizing to sit through. Somehow, it managed to knock Phantom off the top of my worst musicals list. If there were a Musicals for Dummies book, this would be the first chapter. Parents do themselves and their children an utter injustice by seeing this; what a way to warp one's conception of what musical theatre can and should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype Gone Wild","review":"This is a classic example of people jumping on the bandwagon for a play which despoiled the great Oz of L.

It even hand a song which goes like this.....[see, Spamalot]."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S WICKED THIS MUSICAL HAS NO MEMORABLE MUSIC!!!","review":"A 5 star review means the BEST. Sorry, this musical doesn't even come close. When you're throwing 5 star ratings around, you're throwing them in the direction of My Fair Lady, South Pacific, Phantom of the Opera, Oklahoma, Hello Dolly, and many musical scores more. Who do all these 5 star raters think they're trying to kid! They must all be members of the cast.If this musical is noted for anything, it's for the most un-memorable music I've ever heard in a Broadway musical. It's lucky to get a 1 star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"best in show!","review":"If you are looking for music to lift you up and make your day this is it!

You've written a wonderful score with witty, intelligent lyrics. I've seen the show, and some of the music flew by me a bit too quickly (I loved it nonetheless).

Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are phenomenal as Elphaba (The Wicked Witch of the West) and Glinda respectivley. The song \\"Defying Gravity\\" is worth the price of the CD alone.

Wonderfully written, very witty, I would reccommend for an easy read before bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lover of Musicals","review":"Wicked was the BEST musical EVER!!!!!!The music will blow you away, especially the singing!

When you first listen to it you are bound to love the songs. Popular is certainly a show stopper (or a cd stopper). The finale is more of a disapointment. joel Grey is fantastic in WOnderful! idina menzel has a very strong voice. You will definetly fall in love with the songs which could be a bad thing. After you listen to the cd so many times it will get on yur nerves and you will never wwant to listen to it again!! I would sugest buying this only if you are going to see the shows, or else however great the music is you wont understand it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite part GONE!!!","review":"I love the play!! but one of my favorite parts was completely gone!! the part where they are dancing when Galinda gives Elfaba the witch hat as a joke and she ends up dancing with Elfaba and then they all start to dance with them, the start of it is shown the the camera goes down and the the rest of the scene is omited!!!!! I was VERY dissapointed!! and most of the time all you see is where the face of each actor is a big shining light so you can't see their faces. it was ok BUT NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to mourn \\"Wicked\\"","review":"Wow, this is an amazing soundtrack. I saw the musical in New York with a school group and it was amazing. I was so glad to see that the soundtrack brought out the best of it. Kristin Chenowith and Idina Menzel- their voices harmonize sooooooo wonderfully. The best examples of that is in \\"What is this feeling?\\", \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"For Good\\". I was simply stunned. I really liked how they never stayed in the same key for long, it keeps things interesting and makes for some very powerful songs. Simply a wonderful soundtrack. Couldn't have been happier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickely Good...","review":"Nothing compares to Wicked!! The CD is amazingly AWESOME!! Every time I listen to it my favorite song changes. Every song on the CD is FABULOUS. Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth are the perfect singers for this soundtrack and both are extremely talented. I highly recommend buying this Wicked CD, you will definitely not be disappointed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!","review":"I knew that I wanted to see/hear Wicked as soon as I heard the words Kristen Chenowith, but it was Idina Menzel that blew me away. I loved all of Kristen's numbers, but I knew that I would...with her amazing range that I came to love in her CD \\"Let Yourself Go\\". Not to mention her countless other musical additions to her resume. Close your eyes during \\"Popular\\" and you can see little dynamo wowing everyone with her voice. You can hear the smile in her voice. It was Idina that captured me completely though...I had ignorantly never heard of her. But her voice in such songs as Defying Gravity and No Good Deeds takes listeners to another level. Honestly it made me want to re-watch The Wizard of Oz, and root for Elphaba. Buy this CD, and support Broadway!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wonderful!\\"","review":"Stephen Schwatz's Wicked is absolutely amazing. Kristin Chenoweth (Galinda/Glinda) and Idina Menzel (Elphaba/Wicked Witch) have an incredible chemistry with their stage presence and graceful voices. Pieces such as \\"Defying Gravity\\" definitely give each bragging rights along with the moving \\"For Good\\". Joel Grey, the Wizard also is able to show off with Sentimental Man\\" and \\"Wonderful\\". This is definately a great cd to own especially because Kristin Chenoweth has recently left the show and Idina Menzel is also scheduled to leave soon as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defying Sanity","review":"To be entirely honest, I listened to this CD with quite high expectations, having heard so many rave reviews about it from all my friends. And admittedly, the vocals are fantastic and the plot is somewhat more original than the usual Broadway fluff. But other than a few standout songs (three or four at the most), I found this pretty standard, run-of-the-mill stuff. The music is far too poppy and synthesizer-driven (it reminds me of the eighties), the lyrics are often awkwardly phrased (verdigris?), and most of the characters I found so fascinating in the book (Fiyero and Elphaba, namely) were completely stripped of any and all color in the musical. There's no new ground covered here, no fresh ideas or characters; just a few good singers, some mediocre songs, and a watered-down plot. Major disappointment. I suggest Avenue Q for some real entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good concept, lackluster implementation","review":"True, the concept is a brilliant one, but as the editorial review indicates, the songs get in the way of the story. The lyrics are typical of Broadway in that they tend to be very matter-of-fact, i.e. \\"I'm mad!\\" \\"I'm sad!\\" \\"We're mad and sad,\\" etc.But hey, if that's what Broadway fans go for, and it seems that they do, who am I to judge?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. Not for everyone.","review":"For pages and pages back, this show has got 5 stars... oh, well. This show seems to appeal to many, but after sampling it myself, decided that it was not for me. The characterisations are dull, the songs are boring after the first playing, the orchestrations pathetic to say the least. The whole show just smacks of \\"appealing to the general mob\\" syndrome which is starting to take over this amazing genre.The lyrics are tacky and the music predictable. The essance of musical theatre is simply that that is implied by the name - drama for music. There is none of that in this musical. Certainly there's minimal acting in tracks such as \\"Defying Gravity\\" and \\"Popular\\" - it's not done very well, for starters, and the rest of the tracks feel like disjointed 3-minuters on a pop album.Save your money for real musical theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"O-ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"The 1 star is for the set designer. The show itself was awful. Slow and boring. The (way too many) songs are easily forgetable. Even with the visuals I found myself nodding out during the first act. I'm amazed at all the 5 star reviews for this CD. There must be some hidden subliminal messages in the tracks or something. This has to be the worst broadway score I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!!","review":"All the energy and brillance of the live performance! Defying Gravity was uplifting and empowering, Popular is funny, perky and clever! Loved it!

This musical absolutly deserves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ehhh....","review":"The chorus on the CD is fantastic, but sometimes the leads fail to shine. This is not any fault of their own, I blame the music. Stephen Schwartz has written much better material.

Idina and Kristin's voices are amazing. Even though they are totally different they mesh together so well. The orchestration is amazing as well. I love that almost whenever Elphie does a song its percussion and brass driven [almost like a lurking shadow effect] and when Glinda does a song its mostly strings and woodwinds. This CD is just genius. And the show is amazing defintaly go see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't get Enough!","review":"This music is perhaps one of the most cleverly and beautifully written that I have ever heard! I love it! The lyrics are amazing, and having the original cast recording is fantastic. I recommend this to anyone who loves musicals. Its beautiful, heartfelt and uplifting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Amazing","review":"Although I have not been a fan of Schwartz's work in the past, I could not keep myself from picking up Wicked because the book was wonderful and I adore Kristen Chenoweth. She has such an amazing voice. Once I listened to Wicked, I had a new respect for Stephen Schwartz. As usual, the music is very \\"now\\" and has a lot of pop to it. The major highlights are Idina Menzel's \\"The Wizard and I\\" witch is unbelievable, especially at the key change; Kristen Chenoweth's comic turn on \\"Popular\\"; the thunderously amazing \\"Defying Gravity\\"; Joel Gray's big number \\"Wonderful\\"; and the touching \\"For Good\\". Besides the leading ladies, Michelle Federer has a lovely little part of \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and Norbert Leo Butts does and excellent job on \\"As Long As You're Mine.\\" Also, Menzel brings out both the good and bad sides of her Wicked Witch in the beautiful \\"I'm Not That Girl\\" and the soaring \\"No Good Deed\\". This is a must have for any musical lover's collection. A Wicked Good Show!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OOOhhhh...Kristin....","review":"This CD is Amazing...Oooh Kristin!!

I feel everyone can connect with from the first lyrics of the songs. Every song is well written and original.

We saw an internet article that mentioned Friday Night Lights. Apparently those who saw the first season were up in arms about the potential cancellation of the show. So we decided to watch the first season. We were blown away. This is perhaps the best TV show we have ever seen.

The camera cannot be still. It wiggles, pans erratically (changes speed during the pan, and wobbles), zooms in and out--and rarely comes to rest for more than a few seconds. The jump cuts are constant. I waited until the DVD came out to see this show, and was really looking forward to it. What a shame. Great acting, script, concept. Horrible camera work. The continual, frentic, amateurish, relentless hand-held jerky camera makes you sick, literally. It's probably not as disturbing on a small TV screen, but I have a large projection TV and the show looks like an endless earthquake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best series ever!","review":"Get ready to become addicted, stay up too late and move your mind to Texas for awhile.

So many characters to introduce, and a dramatic device that cuts back and forth between interviews and \\"real life\\" doesn't work very well. It can be hard to follow and the jumps in time are odd. But once you get past that, the series hits its stride. Excellent writing, fine acting, and a show that respects its audience as well as its characters.

It was as if I took a normal shower and didn't rinse out the conditioner.I was in much too fragile of a state to really buff or towel dry my hair, so maybe that was part of the problem.It was worth it to use this once to get out the grime from an accident/illness/etc, but not worth the price after that. For more than $5.50 PER USE, it should've worked better. I wasn't expecting miracles here, but this was really unpleasant.I cannot imagine using this on a normal day like some of the posters are saying.

Then she gives each song life, with a voice that is not only technically proficient, but also passionate.Deedee reminds us of the moment we first fell in love, the simplest joys in life and guides us through darker moods. The title track is a recipe for what we would all like in a relationship and \\"Lessons I've Learned\\" relives the pain of a bad one and the wisdom gained.This is an album which should be heard with someone special or alone while staring out a window on a rainy day.

The construction of this device is simple, yet solid and sturdy. The Surround Station isn't for everyone because only one person can enjoy the excellent positioning of the speakers.

I had another set that had it but it wasn't magnetized. If you are disassembling an iMac, I would recommend you get all the screwdrivers magnetized because the T6 screws are too small and so they might get stock inside your computer if you are not careful. This set also don't bring a handle, but I had that as well, so for me it wasn't a big deal. If you don't have it, you also need to buy the handle separately or buy a set that brings the handle.I used this on iMac mid 2007 and after I replaced the hard drive the computer is flying.

The screws did not indicate which size bit would be needed. After receiving, I did further research as the box indicated the size. After looking at what a set with a spanner #14 would cost w shipping, I thought better about ordering.

I have found three bands that rise above the rest - Altan, Deanta, and Capercaillie - and, while the members of all three bands are fine musicians, Capercaillie is blessed with the haunting voice of Karen Matheson. I have read some criticism about Capercaillie's forays into non-traditional work on their later albums and, indeed, there are two such songs on \\"Sidewaulk\\". Personally, I like the mixture.

The shredder automatically runs for 2 sec. after the paper has run through, to help clear the cutters, but after running a dozen sheets through -- one sheet at a time -- there was a massive clump of shredded paper jammimg the cutters on the underside.

A pair of cheap scissors would shred faster once you factor in the time spent clearing the jammed mass of paper that will accumulate after only 3 or 4 sheets of paper are fed through one at a time. I have no idea why, but paper circles back up into the blades creating a tightly bound mass that shuts the motor off. It is terribly annoying, and to make matters worse, little bits of paper gets everywhere when you try to free the mess from the blades. Avoid this shredder like the plague.

This is the honestly the best cd I've heard in years. Music has been so unoriginal and lame lately and P55 has been able to break the norm. They have combined jazz with really heavy and funky guitar rhythms. Every track on this cd is wonderful and almost every song sounds like a different band/style. They will stay in my top 5 bands for years Im sure of it...check out 'This Life', 'Texas', 'Lou Evil'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Way overrated! Who said this was the album of the year? The vocals are horrible, the musicianship....HA!

It's just after listening to the excellent \\"Introduction to Mayhem\\" I expected a little more out of Primer 55. Still a great buy, and it only cost me $... on the day it came out at Best Buy! Any Primer 55 fan should own it, and definitely check out their older one. It kicks ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer!","review":"After checking out a bunch of the disposable (...) to come out this year, anyone can say that this was one of the best rock albums to come out this year. If you were to pick up the new 2001 Slipknot release, Iowa, then shelled out the cash for THE NEW RELEASE, you would agree on this would get at least 4 stars. It has a lot of good hard riffs, and all the songs are killer. Also, even though it carries the Tipper Gore proof of exhibition, it doesn't have that much of a reason for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One step higher","review":"Wow, the last P55 album was fairly decent (I think I gave it a 3star) NEways, \\"(the) New Release\\" as unoriginal and uninspired as the title may sound,is actually pretty darn good. It certainly renews my interest in the band. There is a definate leap in progress since Intro to Mayhem. Better music,better lyrics, a new drummer and bassist, both of which are very talented. There are some surprisingly Jazzish moments on this album (didn't see that one comming) Jason's singing voice has definatly improved. I look forward to future P55 music and hope they stick around, and hopefully keep up these moments of genius. Good work.My highlights:: This Life, Texas, Tricycle, Lou Evil and Hesitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Upset with Primer","review":"I bought this cd for one reason. One lousy reason. To hear curses. Yep, i dont care if Primer bagged the guitars and drums and just screamed a barrage of curses in my ear. 73 curses in one cd is just pathetic, and think Zeppellin averaged at least 40 curses per album. So get with it primer, we the fans, love your God-awful guitar and God-awful pounding of the drums, but we are all in the same boat, and until you curse more, this boat will never set sail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Softies!","review":"Bah, Primer 55 should have stuck with what worked in Introduction to Mayhem - anger, heavy rhythm, and fast paced metal. Instead, they decided to take the other direction. I didn't like how they tried to combine, what I could only describe as, jazz and heavy metal. There were a couple/few good songs, but they had harsh language in these songs...and since I accidentally got the clean version, it ruined the album for me. If you liked the first Primer 55, I would only recommend getting this album if you can get it cheap AND with explicit lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll pass.....","review":"I bought this cd with no idea what to expect. I took it home, and i started listening to it, and at first i was impressed. The first track was a very good song. There is my star, just for that song.

I must warn you that this album is pretty boring. The melodies are tedious and the beats are dull. I think that one of the problems why this whole album is boring is that the drums and bass were indeed simulated on some machine and end up having the same lifeless feeling throughout. The guitarist also tends to play mediocre solos. There are clearly some hypsters writing reviews here, trying to sell this product.

Its a good thing i bought Bad Company's Lp as well otherwise i would have been stuck with the sound of ILS. Don't be fooled on the fancy looking cover and tracklisting.

He is the holiest man I've ever met (I met him in 1992 and 1993, spoke with him for only a few sentences)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shaky Ground","review":"There are several major weaknesses in the author's hypothesis. I read the book when it first came out, sent a copy to friends in Zuni and recently spent time there discussing the book with them. A few points are worth noting: There is no mention anywhere in Zuni oral history of the kind of contact claimed, very little input is evident directly from Zuni, except from Ladd and Nahohai.While the book may seem provocative to an outsider, it doesn't seem to have much credibility with those who know Zuni history.The larger issue of early migration routes fits with current thinking, but the quantum leap from the Pacific Coast to Zuni is a bit of a stretch. If there was contact, as claimed by Davis, why is there no link with Hopi?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't really think it is true","review":"I am a Zuni and I have read the book and I think some of it might be true, but nostly I think it is false. Zunis in no way look like Japanese. The pictures of the two zuni boys kinda look japanese, Most all of the Zunis look like other indians in the southwest. But I maybe wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak hypothesis","review":"The only decent piece of evidence presented by the author that could be seen as supporting her thesis of a Zuni-Japanese connection are some apparent language similarities, and even with that she does admit that there is a problem with ensuring that her transcriptions of Zuni and Japanese words into the Latin alphabet are truly accurate representations of how the Zuni and Japanese say those words. The rest of the evidence ranges from intriguing-but-weak to downright laughable. But the book does offer some good background information on the Zuni people in general, which just manages to save it from being a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Zuni Enigma","review":"The author's thesis is compelling, but the information is conjectural and not fully developed in the text.

I found Hazel Denning's writing style to be very boring. I actually lost interest in the points she was trying to make about halfway through the book. Clearly the author is presenting only one side of the spiritual argument - which makes perfect sense as she is writing from her own experience.

If you like great acoustic music, songs that make your soul sing and your hips sway, then this is the CD for you.

Sweeping guitar hooks, powerhouse vocals, and songs that just grab you and won't let go. I was in a band with Brian their drummer, and he is one of the greatest musicians I've ever had the honor of playing with. What makes this record so unique is how each song blends into another with its own style and mood. It's as if they have channeled the high power intensity of Cheap Trick's Budokan record and married it with the modern hooks of Our Lady Peace's best singles. This record comes highly recommended, and Rolling Stone magazine should remember these guys for their \\"next big thing\\" issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story","review":"Wow, what a family and what a tragic ending.

The F6 is a love letter and an expression of gratitude for Nikon's rise to success through 35 mm SLR photography.

She was more then just a country singer. She was one of the best singers period. Some of that shows in this CD. Her version of Bill Bailey Won't You Please Come Home is one of the best ever recorded. She grabs this tune and gives meaning to every word, starting off slow and then swinging it to a fast finish...jazz at its best all the way.

After all, the plot sounded really interesting. Maybe it's just me, but from the very beginning, I was bored to death. On one hand, you have these two adults who are attracted to each other, but they just don't really do ANYTHING about it. Frankly, I was really turned off by the fact that the guy was really naive when it came to landdwellers (us humans) as compared to his world of sea. After all, he was able to live among us...I really had to struggle thru the book, and found it perfect for the young children to read as there wasn't anything in there that could really classify the book for adults only. Even the brief moment when they actually had sex (towards the very end, mind you) it was so vague as to leave one wondering what actually happened here.

Apparently, Keith Jarrett has put the lid on Jack's drumming. Just keep the beat and throw in some interesting, but subtle, fills. When Jack runs his own groups, it's a different story. I've found this problem on most of his CDs. His drumming is so out of control that he unfortunately ruins the cds. Schoefield is great, as is Goldings. Jack, on the other hand, just bangs away. Nothing subtle here. A big, expensive disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start but a page turner from mid book to end","review":"All in all the book was involving and left me wanting more. The story line and setting was fairly different and the descriptions and characterizations were well done. The main characters were portrayed a bit weakly at first compaired to the fast action they went through from the middle to the end of the book. My biggest complaint is that it was setup a bit obviously for a sequel - i.e. the denowment left me feeling unsatisfied. So where is the sequel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game, Too Short","review":"This game slightly differs from the other Spyro Games we are all used too. The Gems look different, there are no purchases from Money Bags or much interaction between the other well known characters from Spyro.You are able to use your own spells by drawing them on the touch screen as they are eventually taught to you.You get to learn alot more moves in this game from the dragon elders, which can confuse the younger players.The game is fun, but far too short.

Spyro on the PlayStation 1 is brilliant, and Spyro on the GBA (excluding Spyro Orange) is not quite brilliant but still really good. Spyro on the PS2 (or GC or Xbox) is only decent... And now there's this. I was excited for this, I was hoping it'd be great like the GBA games or brilliant like the PS1 games. But... It's worse than the PS2 games. It really is. It's really easy and really short. The ending kinda leaves you hanging (and they never made a sequel to wrap it up?!), and some of the gameplay mechanics are just kinda poorly designed. Controls are odd... I own this and play this because I'm a Spyro fan, but if you are not a Spyro fan don't get this game. -Trent Foreman, Author of Nightmare"},{"rating":"2","title":"A so so game","review":"It's so lame, all because of the chracters' movements. It's like, they walk forward, and when they try to turn, they pause. Then they turn around in the same place. Then they go. But Spyro runs faster. The other thing is that Spyro runs so slow, not like in the other games. It's the most boring game ever to me, but maybe to you it won't be. At least I think the background is good! Good job Spyro the Shadow Legacy makers! Woo hoo!

Then you're supposed to freeze the LIQUID for hours *after* you mix it! C'mon folks! I just want some ice cream, not a rocket science project!! Give me a break!!

A Great Ice Cream Maker...","review":"I did 2 receipes from Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream & Dessert book this week-end and I was amazed by the results.The French Vanilla ice cream was the best we ever had... and so simple to make. Chocolate one was very good too.I would agree with the other reviewers -- use cold ingredients, and start your ice cream as soon as you take the bowl out of the freezer. I let my bowl freeze for at least 1 day before using it. I put it in a plastic bag, and then put a zip-loc bag of ice in the container just to be sure.Also don't expect to get solid ice cream! None of the ice cream maker can do that. You have to put the cream in the freezer a couple of hours to get a perfect ice cream.No ice, no salt required like for other ice cream makers.I highly recommend this product...

Certainly pays no attention to evolution. This is too bulky for storage. If it were 2 pieces, a bowl that sits in the freezer and a base, that would be fine, instead it has the bowl in the freezer, the base, and a cover a little bit larger than the bowl, thus it takes up 100% too much storage space in my kitchen.

But here is the kicker, her brother made the comment, \\"oh yea, you're supposed to put it back in the freezer again and take it back out and redo it.\\" ERRRRRRRRRR I was fuming mad. WHY? because he read the reviews right here and saw the product was crap and the cuisanart was BETTER.

Their freezing compond doesn't work at all for most people.

Last night my son had a bed accident and when he woke up I could see that the pillowcase was wet. Surprisingly when I took the pillow protector off to launder it (for the first time - I've only had it for two weeks) the pillow itself was wet too. Perhaps this is a waterproof product when the wetness is left on for a short period of time, but it definitely isn't when the wetness is there for several hours.

With the exception of a creepy crush (you'd have to read the first few books to know what I'm talking about. This was the second in the series), I find the stories enjoyable and I like Jenna Blake, the female protagonist.If you like your stories with a little more substance ala a King, Brown or Grisham novel, then the relatively simple nature of this story, or any of the Jenna Blake novels for that matter, may not be for you. However, if you're just looking for something to read to get you to the next stop, these simple stories of a young Medical Examiner learning her craft while trying to keep her grades up in college, appease her friends,...and evade the occasional murderer, then you may find these novels to your liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog-Fight","review":"There is a great deal of interesting and valuable information in this book, but it is nearly ruined by extremely poor (or no?) editing. There are numerous, distracting typos as well as sentences that have obviously been rewritten but not had the original wording removed. Chapter subheadings are often followed by text that has little or nothing to do with the supposed subject of the section. Frequently, the author digresses into pages of information not related to the heading or even the title of the chapter! There are also very lengthy quotations from WWI flyer's diaries or action reports that, while interesting as memorabilia, tend to be redundant and add little to the narrative. Many of these sections could have been shortened to better effect. If you want a book about WWI in the air, find a used copy of Reynold's \\"They Fought for the Sky\\". You'll find it much more fun to read and less aggravating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obscure gem","review":"Outside of Tennessee few are likely to have heard of, let alone listened to, Melissa Webb's 1999 self-released debut.

The scanner will not tell you the frequency is already in the bank, so when you are scanning and the scanner stops on a frequency and you add it it always accepts it even if it already exists.

This is not terribly distracting once you get used to it but it is noticeable if you're listening for it at all.2. The touted feature that's supposed to make them more comfortable doesn't seem to do much at all for me.3. The cushions are fairly comfortable for what they are but they are a tad small on my ears and this becomes a bit scratchy and uncomfortable after a couple of hours.I'd buy them again if I had a tight budget and needed a set of compact, portable headphones.

I tried these out with a variety of genres and they held up. They are also extremely light weight, comfortable and adjustable. They fold up neatly in the supplied case. The only thing that might prevent you from buying them is the eccentric design. They have that '80's sensibility which you will either detest or find retro. For the price and excellent sound, I'll go with retro. You truly get a lot of sound quality for your money, and if you can live with the odd design, you will not be disappointed.

My first pair broke after a year -- and I am very careful with my equipment. I only use them at my computer, they don't travel or get abused. They fell off my desk and the right channel is now shot. Anyway, the sound was great -- very warm with fantastic bass and accurate highs. They sound nearly as good as my entry-level Grados, but are much more comfortable to wear for extended periods. But buy two pairs now, or plan on replacing them later.-edit-Several years later, I am back to say that the two additional pairs I bought are both going strong and they are still the best quality/comfort/price combination in the world. I have more accurate in-ear phones that cost $200+, but for comfort and long listening sessions, these can't be beat. I hope they are never discontinued. The design looks dated and a bit dorky on your head, but once you hear them, you won't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koss fooled me twice.....","review":"......so shame on me!! All that's left to do is warn you not to make the same mistake. The description above states a lifetime warranty for these headphones--I wonder how that works? And does anyone register $30 headphones for the warranty to work? Who knows where my original paperwork is. I know--shame on me again!I've owned the fantastic-sounding Koss Porta-Pros twice, and after enjoying them for about 9 months, the wire coating on them started to fray. No amount of duct tape rigging will prevent the deterioration of the flimsy material. Nor can you prevent the eventual crackling, then loss of sound in one ear. Can't Koss put an extra $5 on the price to house the wires in better material??"},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds like 2.99 earbuds","review":"After reading other reviews, I was really looking forward to getting these headphones. The design is ok and the portability good, but the sound quality was no better than the $10 cheapo headphones I had been using. Don't get me wrong...for the price, I wasn't expecting Bose. But I did expect some decent sound. You can't play certain songs because the bass makes the speakers rattle really loudly. And I don't mean hip-hop or rap base...ANY base, country, pop or whatever. When I first heard it, I thought the sound was coming from somewhere in my room. If I had to do it over again, I would invest another $20 bucks and get something better. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the design...but that's useless if the sound sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light & flimsy","review":"These are not what I expected based on the reviews I read & price paid.

When I received them I was absolutely astonished at how cheaply they are put together, and was very disappointed. The cable is so thin and flimsy it literally creases from gravity. The metal feels like strips of aluminum from a can of soda. That being said, I was FLOORED by the audio quality. Make no mistake, the two months it takes you to break these, you will be gushing over the crisp balance and the deep, rich bass. My left ear blew out, and instead of taking advantage of the warranty, I chucked this one up as a loss and found the Sennheiser HD 202's to be exactly what I was looking for at this price. I would suggest you check those out instead if you are in the market for this caliber of sound for the sub-$30 dollar price point (and who isn't, really)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Headphones","review":"These headphones are amazing.

Amazon's discount really makes these a great deal. I picked them up here for about $30 and not less than a week later saw the same cans at Urban Outfitters for $50. The sound quality is very good for the price. Music is rich and full, the only complaint I have is that the bass is exaggerated slightly. However, if you listen to a lot of bass-heavy music, e.g. rap, techno, it's nice to have portable headphones that can deliver where a lot of in-ear headphones fall short. Occasionally the metal strap pulls out strands of hair, but that's pretty rare. I would highly recommend to anyone, especially those who don't care for in-ear headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome ..

Not until I recently purchased a Zen Micro did I decide to test all my headphones on this MP3 player. Needless to say, other than the Bose QC2 set, which is essentially in a league of its own, the Koss beat out every other set I own. This includes both Denon and Sony closed systems.I guess the style and seemingly awkward design made me initially think these headphones were a bad purchase. So, they were relegated to the bookshelf until the Zen player arrived. I have to say that the goofy looking design is just that. However, the sound quality (clarity, separation, tonal balance, etc.) is exceptional for an open ear system. Nearly every bit as good as the Bose except that the ambient noise distracts from the experience at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Amazed","review":"I worked at Koss from '77 - '84 and designed the element and final sound for the Porta Pro.

Yeah, only I paid to have the broken headphones shipped to the replacement center (AND I had to send a money order along with it so that they could ship them back).

Apparently, this headphone almost sounds as good as my 200 dollar Beats by bull(___) HD.For a price of 40 and the incredibly small size, this headphone is simply amazing. Bass is reasonable enough, though some House music, metal, or dubstep can make the bass sound all mixed-up and rather disgusting than clear; however, if you want some clear bass you might wanna look at headphones around 300-400 or even higher :). Other than that, I didn't find any part of its sound quality less than I expected. Besides, I didn't even expect any bass to be in this tiny headphone!I use this whenever I am doing some exercise, and so far I find no need to buy another earphone or a light-weight-on-ear headphone.Great job Koss, I just simply love this.

Their design allows them to be folded up nice and small for portability, however sometimes the clips that keep the metal part in come loose with moderate use. A note for those with longer hair, it can become caught in the band if the size of the headphones adjusts while it is on your head, which can pull them out and be very annoying. As with \\"on ear\\" headphones, there is no noise isolation, but these can get very loud if you want to drown out other noise, though this is not recommended as it has the potential to damage hearing and there is going to be considerable sound leakage to the external environment. Another qualm to these is that they cause some pain on the outer ear after being worn for quite some time. There is a setting switch which will reduce the pressure that they put on the ears which helps, but they will just snap back into the original position if they are moved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the earphones!","review":"This is the second pair of Porta Pros I have.

I compare there sound to be very similar to the Sennheiser PX 100-2 headphones with a slightly more emphasis on the Midrange versus a slightly more Bass on the Sennheisers.

Bass is good for irritating you after a while and helping you get hearing damage.

I was really looking for something durable and these haven't let me down. It's been nice to be able to fold them up and stuff them in with the rest of my luggage. They still look like new even through all that I've put them through. Not being big on spending, I've gotta mention the lifetime warranty was a huge plus along with the price.Sound quality is also great. For the same sound quality you could easily end up spending over $100 on other brands. Sony has some nice headphones at similar prices, but they don't fit my needs as well. These other brands will make you sweat each time you drop them. I can just toss these things around and not worry about them.A small issue is the fact that these aren't over-the-ear headphones, so after about two hours of listening your ears will start to hurt if you have the adjustable \\"ComfortZone\\" set to firm. But don't fret, it is adjustable."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd time is NOT the charm","review":"I had a pair of Portapros for years and years. When they finally wore out, I didn't feel bad replacing them. I bought a second pair on Amazon last year (2012) and the wire at the plug has already broken on them despite careful use.

At first I thought they are (as others said) put too much stress on the bass, but after a hour or so this feeling fades and you're left with perfect sound and very rich bass.As far as comfort goes, they are great as well. With 3(!) different stress zone (from Light to Firm) I can wear them for hours without any ear pains. Also, I just love the way they collapse to a tiny ball of metal ;).Few minor complains would go about the very thin structure of them. If you treat them nice, they will function forever, if you don't, they WILL break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made and will fail.

I paid for them with birthday money so I wasn't really thinking much about the price. These are definitely not noise cancelling headphones. However, they are good headphones. I do no like earbuds and these are a good substitute. They are comfortable even with my glasses. The adjustment is good especially the one to keep the speaker tight against the ear. That's what they call noise cancelling. These are equivalent to normal headphones slightly pushed against your head. The sound is good without having to keep your hands there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Darn Good","review":"these headphones sound very good for their 30 dollar price tag. the only thing that bothers me about these headphones is the low volume..im probably gonna end up picking up a cheap amp but all the way up on the iPhone isn't that loud due to the fact that the semi open design is present. however, that allows for a open sound which sounds great. another thing is the build quality, its not necessarily bad but when i first moved the headband sliders the metal part detached from the slider..i couldn't find a way to put it back in so i just left it and it still works fine. the portapro that i received had the iphone straight plug. i would have liked the other one but that's fine. i have subs in my car so i think the bass is perfect for a pair of headphones which people seem to complain about but the sound is balanced enough so the mids or the highs aren't over-powered. just in case some people are wondering, these are way better than the klipsch s4 and the sony mdr-xb500"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Judge a Book by it's cover","review":"Pros:- Great Sound- Crisp, deep bass- Very ComfortableCons:- Not very good looking (Personal Opinion)- Sometimes, the band may catch on to my hair (Not often though)Aesthetically speaking, these headphones are ugly... but once you get over that, the sound quality is amazing, and the headphones are surprisingly comfortable.

Definitely would recommend these"},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound is simply the best","review":"Why does a cheap set of headphones with weird plastic ear-cups and a metal band that catches in your hair get so many five star reviews? Because they sound amazing. Nothing in this price range even comes close. Most people compare these with the Sennheiser PX100 II.

They are very comfortable and the sound is rich and full. I've worn them on long runs, and they don't slip or slide and they still feel good on my head after an hour or so. They have much better sound than the Sony earbuds that I used to use. Plus, they still let ambient noises in so cars aren't going to be able to sneak up on you. I can see why Koss hasn't redesigned these headphones in many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound for the money","review":"The sound quality is excellent. Very comfortable.

I kept my MP3 player in my pocket and was never very gentle with it, nor the headphones. Audio worked despite the fraying, but planned on trying out lifetime warranty service (I believe it costs $6 and price of shipping to Koss). Didn't get to personally check out the lifetime warranty claim since my headphones were stolen.Assuming that Koss makes good on their lifetime warranty.

I'm not an audio buff at all, but after listening to music (even video games) on these things, I cannot and will not go back to anything less.

After hearing the deepest purest sounding lows I have ever experienced through headphones (in my life!), along with excellent midrange and highs, I wouldn't have it any other way...and I won't! If cheap sony behind-the-ear headphones or lousy iPod ear buds are the best you've heard, invest what little money it costs to get a pair of these and listen to a good ol' CD.

I was (and still am) impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss headphones excellent quality for price","review":"Koss 152059 headphones: they have excellent sound and comfort for under $50, particularly. i do not travel enuf to justify the more expensive \\"noise eliminators\\", but I do insist on high quality sound.p.s. they are not as big and funky looking as pictures show.

All friends who are accustomed to junk earphones that come with the iPods are just amazed when they listen through this!- Comfort! You just don't feel them on your head after some time.- Lifetime Warranty! I bought them at Amazon in 2004. Was having some troubles with one earpiece not working properly, and all the foams were gone. I got them repaired absolutely free (just paying the shipping costs), and that too in India! They are like new now.- Price! Bought them for $35 at amazon.- Portability is decent. They fold and don't take much space.CONS- Sound leaks.

The great thing is if you catch the cable on something or drop the ear pieces and they start buzzing or break something, they come with a lifetime warranty and you can send them in to Koss and they will send you a replacement all for $6.

The Koss Portapro is portable AND has great bass response. The work great with my Android phone and can be \\"rolled up\\" to be carried in my motorcycle jacket or computer bag without getting crunched. They are very light and do not feel heavy or bear down on your ears even after listening to music with them on all day. The sound is night and day better than any ear-bud could be and are almost as good as the Pro 4AA.

But more than that, KOSS is amazing. If there is a short, a problem (and there have been about 4 over the years), they give you a lifetime warranty on the headphones, and have either fixed or replaced them for a nominal charge to cover shipping and handling. I recommend any KOSS headphones not just because the sound is really good, but because they stand behind their product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"I listen to music constantly and I must say the sound quality of my new Koss Prota Pro headphones are awesome.

If you're in the market for great headphones at a very reasonable price, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portable headphones for the price","review":"I use these about 4-5 hours a day at work for listening to a variety of music genres. When they arrived from Amazon a few weeks ago, I had a eureka moment - I had owned a pair of these in high school and college...how could I forget their unique design and fit? Very old school. But the bottom line with these is that they are built well and fold up nicely, which is important for the amount of traveling I do. They have a lifetime warranty, if anything should happen to them. Best of all, the sound is really quite excellent, especially for the price. I mean for @$35, how can you complain? They aren't $600 audiophile headphones, but they really do sound good and have a nice bass response too. Frankly, for anyone who wants to get a good pair off headphones for walking around town, working in front of a computer, or exercising, why not consider these?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product Especially Considering Price","review":"I've been looking for a decent set of headphones for a few months now. I personally do not like earbuds and also didn't want to break the bank for a set of high end headphones. Aside from the look, the Koss Porta Pro Classics are the best headphones I've owned or tested for the dollar. They have a very rich tone. Some reviews call them bass heavy but I think the sound is perfect for Classic Rock, Alt Rock and Hip Hop which is what I listen to 90% of the time. They are very comfortable on your head and extremely light weight. The portability is a big plus, the fold up and fit in the accompanying carrying case that ends up being just a little bigger than a digital camera case. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones I've ever owned","review":"Love the sound, bass is amazing overall nice powerful sound.

I have no other high end heaphones exerience to compare against.BOTTOM LINE: I have only used these phones with my I-Pod. They are a wonderful replacement for the I-Pod ear buds.

It is a joy to hear music through them. Rest rather comfortably on the ears too. They also have a lifetime warranty (supposedly). This is $40 you cannot spend better on headphones. I also own a set of Bose in-ear headphones ($100) and this Koss model sounds as good or better, although much different design, I admit.A few minor criticisms, however. The design is rather crude but seems durable. A small, overhanging metal piece exists on each side where band connects earphone; these may contact ears and cause discomfort. Cord is rather long and heavy; set should come with a cord clip (to clothes) to help with this but doesn't. Sound will bleed out considerably; others will be able to hear your music clearly when volume is up.All in all, you can't miss with these for $40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for the 80s. Just good by today's standards.","review":"These headphones provide the best bang for your headphone dollar. For a sub $40 price, you can get a headphone that is better than twice its price. But it is not better than most premium headphones that cost over $200.The bass, which was great by 80s standards, can't handle the lower frequencies as well as high end Shure earphones. Otherwise, there is very little distortion of the sound.The level of detail in the sound is impressive. I did hear many sounds (mainly percussion instruments and background guitar music) which I couldn't hear with my inferior iPod headphones. But again, the level of detail is not as good as Shure earphones.If you are on a budget and want to replace your uncomfortable and inferior iPod headphones with something superior, then this headphone is great.

Occasionally I throw them on and it feels like they're pressing on my ear, but just take a sec to adjust them, then they are fine for hours (or days, but I haven't worn them for days). The way they fold up is pretty good, but I wasn't able to get them into the bag easily. The case is more a bag then a case. Volume is good with them too. I haven't checked sound quality much other than everyday listening. I'd expect them to be fantastic in that category as well. Worth the 32 dollars that I paid, and probably would've accepted a larger price if I couldn't wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vey disappointed with built quality","review":"I was looking for decent quality foldable headphones and decided to buy this item primarily based on the positive reviews on Amazon. I don't know what these reviewers were looking at but for me it turned out to be an extremely poorly made product. Sound quality is relatively fine but the look and feel of these headphones is quite cheap. The plastic parts have sharp edges; the ear piece attachments are flimsy and covered by foam padding found in dollar store headphones. The adjustable head strap is made of thin steel strips and easily catches on hair on your head and certainly not comfortable to wear. Save your money buy something else. I'm sending mine back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke quickly and warranty is misleading.","review":"These headphones initially were a pleasant surprise with good sound, fit, and styling. However, after less than a month and very little use at that, the right headphone stopped working. Although it has a lifetime warranty, you not only have to pay to ship it to Koss for service, you also have to pay an additional $9 for return shipping irregardless of the defect. The return shipping is already about 25% of the total cost of the headphones new to begin with. Add the price to ship it initially and you're looking at spending approximately 50% of the total headphone price in order to take advantage of the so called lifetime warranty. Of course they offer a lifetime warranty, it's not worth it for folks to use it. This is a bad deal. Don't buy it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird design, good comfort","review":"It fits so easily to head and no pressure to ear, comfort zone controls are awesome, after few hours of usage you won't even notice something you are wearing.Initially I was confused how to use the comfort zone controls, we have to adjust that button when you wear it.Audio is better than my other headphones, overall I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb beautiful rich sound for 40.00","review":"Im a BOSE man when it comes to head phones.

The return policy calls for you to ship the items back to Koss + $9.00 shipping and handling. I stood up and literally tore the cables out. In my own defense, they're not secured in tightly. I still give the headphones four stars because I believe they're stylish and the sound is really great. They really fit a comfortable niche for those that do not want sound-isolation; and, they have a really strong ability to throw sounds and convince you that you have more than two sound channels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but VERY uncomfortable","review":"Based on other reviewers' comments I decided to try the Koss headphones. Unfortunately, these are the most uncomfortable headphones I have ever worn. I wear glasses which I believe is the reason. I have since purchased and have been wearing the Sennheiser PX200 headphones. Although the sound quality is not quite as good, the comfort of the PX 200 is superior.

These are by far the best headphones I've heard that are cheaper than $150 dollars. The only downsides are the lack of noise isolation and cancelation and if you care about looking fashionable. They size up easily to higher end headphones in terms of sound quality. if you're not a stickler for buying big brand names and don't care about how they look, this is easily the best buy you'll find."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful when using these headphones","review":"I really enjoyed using these headphones until they broke.

I also travel with headphones frequently, so something that can fold up is a big plus.The sound from the PortaPro Headphones is excellent, especially for the price. Bass is nice and solid and everything sounds crisp and clean.The problem is that I can only comfortably wear them for about 30 minutes or so before my ears start to hurt. I find I'm frequently readjusting these things, which frequently causes my hair to catch in the top band and actually pull hairs out. That just adds to the unpleasantness and makes me more annoyed when wearing them.If you only wear headphones for short periods, these things are great and I would recommend them, but if you're going to be sitting at your desk at work for 8 hours and want a pair of headphones to wear the whole time, these may not work for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I got these for a plane trip. I thought that the lack of batteries would lower the performance, but they worked great! I use them on the train every day now.-Great value for the price-Lower score on comfort because the design makes it inevitable that a hair or two will be yanked from my head whenever I wear these.-Very compact design.

This is an average sounding headphone by comparison. nothing to write home about. I got the Sony V6 and those are very good, glad I got those, would like to try the Audio Technica m50 one day. I also got those really popular panasonic earbuds here for like $5.87, those also suck, the JVC Gumy earbuds sound way better. I think those earbuds represent a good value like the Pinnacle PN8+. I know that's not an earphone but the Gumys really are that good of a value at 7 bucks. anyways I might give these portapro another chance...probably not though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best available for the price","review":"I love the Koss Portapro. I bought them about one and half years ago and have enjoyed them every moment since. I did extensive research before buying them because the brand I used to get consistently broke after a few months of use. I was tired of trashing headphones just because a piece of plastic snapped in my backpack or a wire pulled out from the speaker.The Portapro design allows you to fold the speakers up when you're carrying them. This is surprisingly effective at keeping the headphones from breaking in your backpack, purse, etc.Sound quality is excellent, especially given the price.In a world where consumer electronics are essentially designed to break and be replaced, I am amazed that Koss keeps on doing its thing. In short, brilliantly-designed and built to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect exercise headphones","review":"The fit is both tight and comfortable; very usable on pretty much any exercise machine. Earbuds aren't an option for me given the weird geometry of my ears, and these are just perfect. The folding design works well in a gym bag, too.Plenty of bass, and more than enough volume when driven through my cheap MP3 player.

There is a three-position selector on each side that allows you to adjust the pressure from \\"Firm\\" to \\"Light\\"; but it resets itself to \\"Firm\\" immediately if you release the pressure on the earpieces. You almost need to make the pressure adjustment with the headphones on. A related issue; the headband is made of a very \\"springy\\" material that wants to collapse to the smallest position, making it necessary to readjust the headband for proper fit each and every time you put it on. Other than that, a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koss PortaPro headphones","review":"I bought 2 sets, for my wife and I to use with a portable DVD player, on a plane.

I'm very happy with my purchase. They have great sound quality, the clarity of the bass really stands out. They are also comfortable. One consideration: the headphones do not keep sound in or out. So if you're looking for noise isolation, these won't do it. Nonetheless, these are great all-around headphones, and are still a good deal at the normal price tag of $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing headphones as predicted","review":"What can I say that the other reviews haven't said?

The Koss PortaPros came up a lot as the most quality for cost, so I decided to give them a try. I've had them for about a month now, and I love them! I've used them to block out my younger siblings, so I think they work great ;) And I love being able to fold them up and put in the pouch included in the package. Overall very convenient and good quality sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!!","review":"I love my Portapros, the sound quality is better than all the earbuds i've had before, its a great change from earbud's to headphones.

If you use the Sennheiser cx300, this will sound like CRAP.No sound isolation, i already knew that, but i thought everything else would make up for it. There's like no bass, barely any. The volume sucks, has to be louder.At first, after reading all these awesome reviews, i thought i was going crazy. But i plugged them into my computer, my mp3, my ipod, my stereo system. They're horrible.I expected this, most over the head earphones have leather cups, these had foam. They make your ears hot. And they exhibit horrible sound. Oh man, returned these the next day. Have to pay shipping costs. Don't buy these. Please.

Seriously?","review":"After hearing the crisp, full sound of my cousin's Koss PortaPro Headphones, I had to buy a pair of my own, especially after the fact that my awesome old Skullcandy headphones failed after 2 1/2 years of service.Awesome, they arrived 4 days earlier than originally projected, so I open the box to find a shiny new pair of Koss PortaPros. I had about 5 minutes to sample the awesomeness before I had to go to work, so I fold them up (neat design, by the way)and fit them into the tight (as in physical, not fashionable) carrying pouch and set them on my dresser.The next day, I have more time to actually use these guys, so I pull them out of the pouch. This is where I need to warn buyers before getting these headphones.THE POUCH IS TOO TIGHT, WHEN YOU PULL THE HEADPHONES OUT, NO MATTER HOW CAREFUL YOU DO IT, ONE OR BOTH OF THE EARPIECES WILL SNAP WHERE IT SWIVELS.[...]UPDATE: NEVER MIND THE WARRANTY IS AMAZING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible delivery","review":"Ordered mine weeks ago and its yet to be delivered.

Since mobile phones are not known to be able to drive lows anyway - perfect match.Very good alternative to the inside-the-ear types that I, personally, cannot tolerate due to the feeling of something foreigh plugging my ears and lack of air circulation.Kid takes them to school and has no problems with peers or administrators.NO, these are NOWHERE near full-size Sony MDR-6, but they are perfect for what they are - mid priced PORTABLE headset for low to mid-price portable electronics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound quality, so-so comfort","review":"For sound quality, you would be hard pressed to find something as good in this price range. True, there's a few products out there (some Senn earbuds come to mind) but you could spend a lot more and get something that doesn't sound this good. Don't expect any isolation though, these are open to the air (as most of the best sounding headphones are).For comfort, they are so-so. They're not the worst I've used, but the band isn't particularly comfortable. The design is also prone to catch hairs (I have short hair so it doesn't bother me so much, but once in a while it catches one and rips it out).The styling is very 80's, which, well, makes sense, since they were designed in the 80s. I guess that is good or bad depending on what you like.Oh, the \\"case\\" they come with is useless. You'll never get them to fit back in the case. I think the bag itself is physically large enough to contain them, but the opening is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in everyway!","review":"These headphones are not only great for listening to music. But I bought them for playing electric guitar, piano, and violin thru them for prartice. The extra ohm \\"60\\" makes the diff over the 32 ohm ones on the market. I didn't want the big bulky studio ones that feel like you are wearing football helmet after a hour. These are feather lite and really can't even tell they are on your head. You line 6 Pod users or other multi effect users, well lover these. the extra ohm does make a diff in tone. No ice picking or high shrill. Rich bass and tone through out. Very pleased with them. As well as the tone for MP3's. Very rich tone all the way around. At 60 ohm you won't notice that much of a diff for mp3's. But for playing musical instruments thru them, the extra ohm makes a BIG diff in tone.Well be using these with my Line 6 Pocketpod and guitar on the shady back porch all summer long.

I have used for four months now with no issues.

I wanted what everyone wants; quality, comfort, sound, & a great price. After literally spending hours of comparing 'expert' opinions, specs. etc., the Koss PortaPro was the winner of my quest.

These things look like Dyna-Soars, but sound AMAZING!! I can hear bass riff's and details that I had no idea where on the cd!! They have a much better frequency range than any portable headphone I have ever used. They are a little bit cumbersome but still fold up into a small circle thats pretty easy to carry. They are not comfortable to hang around you neck, they are a bit too tight, so it's either on your head listening or take em off. They do have a lifetime warranty and have been made for longer than you might want to admit. They look very retro, but don't let that fool you!!The Koss PortaPro's sound AMAZING!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"These headphones produce great sound, much better than the cheap earbuds I am used to.

Most CD portables are fairly low powered and don't have the power output required to drive many of the headphones available on the market to high volume levels and still acheive good quality sound. The result is usually muddy and maybe even slightly distorted, especially if the music being listened to contains heavy bass. Not with the KTXPro phones. I was impressed with the clarity and volume levels that they can produce with just a portable CD player that runs on two AA batteries. The bass response of these phones is quite good, and I have found that only a slight bass boost or maybe none at all yields pretty balanced sound. They are probably the best twenty dollar headphones I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"These are great headphones. I especially like to use them at work.

Talent, charisma, etc. is the very thing that draws the public to a star; but there must be a boundary drawn between fan adoration and psychopathic drama. I don't believe Barbra has any record to set straight, especially on Oprah.

I, personally, have been an admirer of BS for many years. Her music has moved me and her many accomplishments and causes make me realize that she is a positive role-model for women. I did find the book interesting because I didn't know about her early family life or her associations with so many icons. If this book were about a man, no one would think a thing about it.

Surely Freedom of the Press does not include such poorly written trash with nothing but libel statements. I'm sure it won't be long before Barbra sets the record staight with a book of her own and I'm sure it will be well worth the wait. I wish that Christopher Anderson would crawl back under the rock from whence he came."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This book is fascinating. There is so much I didn't know about Barbra's life and career and this really revealed a lot to me. If you're going to read one biography this year, read this one. I highly recommend it for long-time Barbra fans as well as new ones like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Done!!!","review":"I can't tell you how sorry I am that I took the time to read this book. Christopher Anderson accomplishes nothing more here than Barbra-bashing. It's almost as if he's collected National Enquirer stories over the past few decades, lumped them together, and called it art. But Christopher Anderson, after reading this book, I would have to say has hardly the talent to create any kind of art, unless of course, it's with his feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"BARBRA -THE WAY SHE IS....GIVE ME A BREAK!","review":"I found this book for the most part to be pretty much a bore. Not without a few stories that did make me grin a bit. But, It is hard to take anyone seriously who writes in print that William Wyler directed \\"Patton\\".I mean...that should come as news to Franklin J. Schaffner! That was just one of many. I would have red-penciled the copy I read but why bother! ...The other stories...well.... enough already! I think it's time for Ms. Streisand to pen her on story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"This is noothing but a re-hash of old artciles from the rumour mill. Nothing new here and a not a very good read. Couldn't finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echoing Other Reviewers","review":"I hope other people don't make the mistake I made and actually purchased this book. Really, the reviews that denounce this book as hogwash and Christopher Andersen's representation of Barbra Streisand are pretty accurate. It was such a waste of money but I have to say I was fair warned. I just can't believe I was so stupid and didn't listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashment of everything that's come before","review":"This is nothing more than a rehashment of other books, articles,, gossip, rumor, facts previously known, etc. A tabloid Hollywood work. Really not worth any low price. Anderson is not known as a classy writer of Hollywood biographies. When Streisand pointed out an error regarding her sister's wedding, Anderson retorted with, \\"That's one small error.\\" Streisand says that she will not go into further errors, so we will not knowhow many others there are for sure, but I bet there are quite a few. Leave it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repulsive","review":"My friend called me up and gave me a bit of a shock. She told me she bought this book \\"Barbra: The Way She Is\\" and the only thing I could say was, \\"Why?\\" She didn't have an explanation but asked me if I'd like to read it. I spit my coffee out laughing but eventually decided I would take a look and see what it had to say. And, as we all know -She's a tyrant and hurts all those around her. Nothing surprising there, is it? Her demure looks (even though a bit odd) are a facade. I have never been able to call what she does as \\"singing\\" but I could tolerate her a lot better if she would stop voicing her absurd opinions that have nothing to do with her crap music. She's called an \\"entertainer\\". Entertain us and shut the hell up Barbra, you sound like a Holly Wood Lemming committing career suicide every time you open your mouth. I suppose I should at least comment on the writers ability to write well.... anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Reading","review":"I guess there's a lot you can say about Barbra Streisand - actress, singer, director, producer, conceptionalist, humanitarian, philanthropsit, concerned American citizen. Unfortunately the author said none of it. In fact he said nothing worth repeating. I guess for some reading is believing, but in this case it's not even close."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER","review":"I don't know how a book like this even got published. It has nothing to do with the Barbra Streisand I have come to know and love over past 4 decades. Obviously Christopher Anderson has an axe to grind but perhaps he should do it where it might have some positive use ... say the Republican mega-machinery or the war in Iraq?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk-Food Hatchet Job","review":"First let me say that I had no hard, pre-conceived notions about Ms. Streisand upon starting this book. I had heard, like everyone else, what a pain in the -ss perfectionist she could be. But this book is just one gossipy anecdote after another. In the final pages, he tells us that she is going to record her 60th album, and after all that reading, I had only heard about a handful...The way he relates her life, she was too busy being a narcissistic b-tch to have time to record 60 albums. I'm sure there's truth to the stories, but this can't be the whole truth. I wish I'd read a more thorough biography on her, not this gossip column of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I guess you have to be a drug addict, war monger, or done time in jail to be appreciated in our society. I guess it's not enough to be a respectable human being struggling to live a decent life in an indecent world - as if that were not struggle enough. At least it is an honorable struggle. But rather than find the interesting points to write about in that scenario, one must be subjugated. At least if the approach in this book were an intelligent one it might have been a little more interesting, but here it is lackluster and tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worthy of Barbra","review":"This book is simply not good. It is unbelievable to me that someone so crass would even attempt to articulate someone with such elegance and class.Better to buy a Streisand album you don't have or perhaps even a DVD. You'll be glad the money was spent on something you'll undoubtedly enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"People Who Hate People.......","review":"Why write a book to make someone unhappy.... Then again, why write a book if the person one writes about has passion, compassion, and a desire to live a truthful, artistic, perfectionistic, and full life AND the writer has little or no interest to (try to) understand. Perhaps only a person who does not admire, like, or understand what makes a true fully human being. I think the book is about writing about someone the writer knows little about and, as a writer, lacks the intuition to see how truly special this person is as an interesting subject one can learn to appreciate as a reader. And also.....Not a greatly written book technically either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all recommended!!!","review":"After reading this book I can't help but be concerned about the integrity of our publishing houses. Even if a writer is heavy handed in his criticism of a subject, is there not an editor who pulls in the reigns so that we can at least have a bit more of an objective read? In this case neither the author, the editor, or the publisher considered integrity into the equation of producing this book - which ironically is the antithesis of what Barbra has stood for in her life and work. Barbra has often stood in unflattering light to preserve the truth and integrity of a piece. I wish someone who was working on this book had absorbed even a slight bit of that trait. Not at all recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the vendetta?","review":"Boy, does someone have an axe to grind with Barbra or what? OK, so it's not big news that Barbra Streisand can be difficult to work with, is a perfectionist, may have a high opinon of herself. But the author takes every opportunity to knock her. Even those who had to work with her on movie sets where she might have been demanding admit that her suggestions, her know-it-all attitude was often correct. And can Barbra do nothing right? Early on he takes her to task for her lack of grooming, later on for her fastidious dressing and nails. With this author, Barbra couldn't win. The entire book has a gossipy feel to it that made many of the observations suspect. Bottom line? Next time I'll look for an objective author, not someone out to malign his subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard-bound Tabloid Story","review":"\\"Barbra: The Way She Is\\" isn't a biography so much as a 412-page National Enquirer story, offering more gossip than insight on its subject. The author and his editors don't even bother to check simple facts like who directed \\"Patton\\" and what was Jack Nicholson's debut movie, calling into question other assertions Christopher Anderson makes in his book, like all but claiming Streisand had affairs with Bill Clinton and Prince Charles. I'll admit I couldn't put the book down, but when I was done I wished I'd spent my time reading something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"Going against advice from some friends, I decided to buy this book. I wish I hadn't. I have learned nothing new about its subject, Barbra Streisand. I did learn something new about its author, Mr.Anderson: he must be unable to separate truth from fiction, truth from vicious lies, truth from horrible, unsubstantiated rumours, because reading his book is like plowing through issue after issue of the National Enquirer.It's a shame books like this get published and read. i do hope people are able to see through the lies.Barbra Streisand deserves better.And so do the readers of this publication.SK"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding...","review":"I wish I had spent my money on something better written. It amazes me that this can get published yet so many other authors complain about the lack of opportunity. But I was stupid enough to buy it so I guess that is my answer. Save your money or donate it to a worthy cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Redeeming Qualities Whatsoever!!!","review":"I can't say much about this book except that I hated it so much I couldn't even finish it. This book has no redeeming qualities whatsoever! It's mean-spirited and only intent is to tear Barbra Streisand apart and for that I see no point. If your looking for a good book, look elsewhere. If your looking for \\"something Barbra\\" choose any of the many offerings from her extensive catalog. Good riddance to this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Voice!","review":"I tried to say before that this is a one-dimensional look at a multi-dimensional talent yesterday, but I guess I have to elaborate on that for my review to be posted. I'm afraid though, if I do elaborate, that my post will be removed because of the explosive words I would use to describe my personal dislike of Christopher Andersen's non-talent for writing. But rather I'll just say how inappropriate I thought the book is and hope that my review is appropriate enough to be posted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kept me reading","review":"It's written on a negative slant, but knowing this I enjoyed the book and come on, some of its true! It doesn't deny her phenomenal success and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hateful and Awful","review":"This book is not a biography but rather a littany of volatile slurs. So much mis-information when in print seems to count for the truth. This book is the furthest thing from the truth or from Barbra Streisand. I recommend you buy the double CD The Essential Barbra Streisand instead. You'll get far more than your money's worth and more hours of enjoyment than the pain it takes to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLY PUT","review":"I've read other books about Barbra but this is the absolute worst. Christopher Anderson gets his kicks from trashing well-known and well-loved people. I guess that means he must really hate himself. I know I'm not very fond of him or his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible story-telling!","review":"Christopher Anderson is an obvious bully who has taken his cutting pen to defame an enigma. Those of us who have been with Barbra for a while are well aware this is not the definitive Streisand biography. Additionally, it is not even worrth the read. When does such antagonistic attacks change a work from non-fiction to fiction or even science fiction for that matter. This kind of story-telling not only defames its subject but defaces the First Admendment which was created so as not to oppress the truth. His kind of lie-telling greatly stretches beyond those boundaries and abuses a right in an irresponsible manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING??","review":"Was there nothing good that he could have said about her? Surely being famous for 40+ years she must have done something right...according to this author, NOTHING!! Don't waste your time or money on this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Biography?","review":"This is a character assignation more than a biography of Barbra Streisand. The book description is nothing close to the contents of this tabloid laden content. If you're looking for a true Streisand biography this book will only keep you looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drib Drab","review":"I was more disappointed with this book than I can say!I've long been looking for a biography on Barbra that has the excitement about it that her performances have, the allure about it that a glance on screen can give, and the thought that a photo can provoke. Nobody so far, least of all Christopher Andersen, seems to have gotten it quite right. I've read a couple of previous Barbra biographies, believe you me, nothing new here. Certainly the convention has been to treat Barbra Streisand as a controversial subject. And I've long stopped trying to figure that one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even marked down it's not worth the time","review":"This book is a travesty none of which is believable. The author must be incredibly insecure to attack Ms. Stresiand in such a manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Crock!","review":"The thing that is so grotesque about Christopher Anderson is that he makes his living decomposing the lives of people who are most admired. He uses their names and images to sell books - if you can call them that. I mean they have pages that are bound together, but they hardly enlighten or are even fair in spirit. The only thing Mr. Anderson reveals in any of his books is his own pathology."},{"rating":"1","title":"As Barbra sang once \\" I 'm still here\\"","review":"I started reading the book last night, so by the few pages I have read so far, I can agree with many people in the sense that no matter what people write about Barbra, those who love her - as I do - will not change our minds for reading some biased book. Are we humans? Yes, and for that reason we are far from perfection and eager to achieve it, so what's the point? As long as people like him continues talking or writing about Barbra, we, Barbra's fans, are happy to see that her name and her work are still something that people like him envy. I wonder if anyone will ever think of writing about him ( except when he writes about other people). We have to thank Barbra for still being here with us, in spite of every piece of comment that people make of her and her art, because, after all, WE ARE THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD FOR HAVING BARBRA !And yes, she is not perfect, but does that mean that we are not allowed to love imperfection?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"Christopher Andrerson has never been a very good writer let alone an important one.

I mean there I was reading the first couple of chapters and really I tried to enjoy this book! But in the end I only made it to the point where Barbra is about to film \\"Funny Girl\\" and I simply gave up.This guy seems to be adding whatever he can to make Barbra Streisand anything but what she really is., a true talent and a great humanitarien."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Read for Starved Babs Fans","review":"Any UN-authorized biography of any celebrity is always considered less than truthful and gossipy. It doesn't mean that a lot of the material isn't true. Gossipy? Why else do we read them! Does any celebrity actually want their story told by anyone other then themselves? I found this one on Streisand to be a great read and wasn't able to put it down. I don't doubt for one moment that there is A LOT of truth in BARBRA: The Way She IS (Of course a lot of the material is probably exagerated, but who cares? Barbra's recent \\"Truth Alert\\" comments in her ranting whacko website would indicate that this author has definantly \\"hit a nerve\\" with her....(too bad, so sad)...She's tough, she can take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Word of Truth","review":"The author must think the public is so stupid to believe anything he's written in this book. It's not even written well, let alone written with honesty and integrity. This is NOT the way Barbra is, but perhaps it's the way the AUTHOR IS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom line - This book is TRASH!","review":"Bottom line - This book is TRASH! It's author is nothing more than a gossip columnist who loves the sound of his own pen. Apparently Mr. Andrerson can't think of anything original to write about on his own and must resort to defaming popular figures in order to validate the space he takes on the planet. He is out for nothing more than to make money at the expense of someone else's hard work and earned station. His treatment of Streisand is far too contrived and poorly crafted for my taste. His approach to one who has inspired so many millions is uninspired. Perhaps Christopher Anderson should begin to look for another line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those Who Loathe","review":"Christopher Andersen loathes everyone he writes about from the get go (or haven't you noticed) simply because he loathes himself. No big Psych degree needed here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided!","review":"This book did absolutely nothing for me. Barbra is such a fascinating person as well as being an extraordinary talent. She speaks her mind truthfully as to reveal exactly where her heart is. She has stood up, donated, and helped raise fortunes for meaningful causes throughout her brilliant career. She certainly deserves a better treatment of her life story than this. And so do we."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD Reader Mercilessly Mangles Words and Names","review":"The narrator cannot even correctly pronounce the last name of the subject. It was so irritating to hear the mispronounciation \\"StreiZand,\\" a mispronounciation which Barbra Streisand herself has denounced publicly many times, I returned the audio book.The fact that the narrator also mispronounced other names, such as that of legendary stage actress Eleanor Duse, Leonard Bernstein, David Susskind, Yves Montand, John Gregory Dunne, and just about every famous person in the book, did not ease the listener's frustration. This reader did not research what she was paid to read. She also was unable to correctly pronounce simple words like \\"dour,\\" and \\"stilt walker\\" and generally butchered the English language.As irritating to listen to as being tailgated on the freeway.Don't buy the audio CD unless you're a masochist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely no new facts, no new insights","review":"This Christopher Andersen character is a mercenary writer who simply pops out a book on whomever happens to be popular at any given moment. Diana AND Diana's boys, Jackie AND Jack, but he was bound to run out of material, and now he's turned to Streisand. The result is a droning, uninteresting piece of People-style journalism with absolutely no new personal revelations and more importantly, no new insights into Streisand the cultural icon, or Streisand the artist. Bland. There's nothing in this book that wasn't covered first in Randall Riese's \\"Her Name is Barbra\\", then in James Spada's \\"Streisand: Her Life\\" and finally in Anne Edwards' \\"Streisand: Her Life.\\" These three 400 page books cover all of it with much more detail and insight than Andersen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying","review":"After the long anticipation for this next book in the series, I found it to be pretty satisfying. Gaia finally has Sam, and she finally has her father. However, it has an interesting twist. Instead of Gaia feeling more pain and getting into more trouble, Ed and Sam are taking that role. The book had less of a cliffhanger than most of the others, and had less action like the others in the series. Though it was very good, it wasn't the best. I am still interested to see what happens when Gaia gets back to New York in the next book, and I can't wait to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Missing is by far the best of Francine Pascal's many books.

As a novice to Tai Chi, it is very hard to learn by just watching others.

The only problem is that it is very difficult to learn a physical action from a DVD, no matter how good it is. Still, he is good enough that he is able to convey the 'feeling' behind the movements so that a serious student would be able to work through the whole practice and learn it from the video given enough patience. The content of this video is actually five stars - I gave it 4 simply because of the difficulty of learning from a DVD. If you are serious about learning Tai Chi Chuan, look in local yellow pages for Tai Chi, but also Kung Fu, as Tai Chi is often taught in Kung Fu schools. Beware of martial art schools giving 'black belts' in Tai Chi Chuan, or Kung Fu, as Chinese martial arts don't have 'black belts' at all - that is a Japanese phenomenon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understandable","review":"Very detailed.

BUT it also has the distinction of being an appropriate read for the *children* of long-ago campers, and I have already told my kids that they should definitely read it. I smiled and chuckled while reading the first paragraph, and I am still smiling and chuckling several hours after finishing the novel in one sitting. Ofer Aronskind has a real gift for bringing his readers into the scene he is creating, and his use of strong imagery and gentle humor makes for an entertaining and engaging story in which every person can see him/herself in some capacity. I can't recommend this book highly enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard on knees","review":"This video is not very challenging, and hard on your knees. It is about half squats.

Unfortunately, it is very thick, but not moisturizing. My skin feels tight and dry within minutes of using it. It gets worse overnight. If you use too much, it kind of beads up and rubs off. Does not sick or, does not feel emollient. It is not irritating, I do not get red or burn from it, so that is good. I use it as a body lotion, but at $28 for 2 ounces, it is not worth it. Your better off with Origins or something else."},{"rating":"1","title":": WARRANTY no good!","review":"I would have given it 4 stars but the poor customer service from Fellowes marked it down. Cost vs performance, product is good.'Customer Care' A true measure is when one has problems with the product and how the Co. responds. Fellowes does NOT stand behind their product. The 5 Year Cutter warranty given by them is not worth the cardboard it is printed on. 18 months in and I am having problem with the cutters. Fellowes throws in a host of excuses and is unhelpful. I now have a piece of $99 (when I purchased it) junk.I would have gladly come to some resolution that even require me to pay for a repair. But, no, they will not or cannot help, thus Fellowes OD1200 has to be thrown in the garbage (their recommendation)Do your own homework/research.

It takes me 5 seconds to do my hair and that is great! It adds texture to your hair so you barely have to do anything to style and make it look good. Very easy to make it work well! One can of gel also lasts a very long time since you only need a small amount of gel for each use. It is the strongest gel I have ever used (it could hold up a small mohawk).An IMPORTANT NOTE though on how to use it: wet your fingers with a very small amount of water, rub the gel in between your fingers, then put the gel in your hair. Without the water, little white particles can be left in your hair from the gel. Only a very small amount of water is needed and also a very small amount of gel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hold","review":"I really like this product. I love my hair to be stiff but not waxy.

First thing I want to point out is that I have had none of the problems others are having with the sync software. I use Outlook and it has worked perfectly from the start.I will complain a little about the firmware. At places, there is some outstanding interface design. Then at other places, it gets darn awkward. The most obvious awkwardness is that you cannot exit or back out from some places via the touch screen, but instead must use the side buttons. If you have the stylus in your hand, this becomes very cumbersome.I'm hoping these problems are obvious enough to be fixed soon.Yet, the size and functionality must be weighed highly. A slighly limited PDA that isn't perfect that I'm willing to carry everywhere is much more valuable than a perfect PDA that is too big to easily carry with me (and thus does not get used)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where oh where have they gone","review":"Another great idea developed, improved and just when they have it just about right...it goes6000 has touch screen which works surprisingly well and 2Mb ram which if you use the device for what it was designed should be plenty"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rex Rumor Central","review":"Even if the Rex 6000 turns out to be the best invention of mankind, I have to give it a 1-star rating due to Xircom's (or Intel's?

That's $140.00 for all seven packages. They're also selling the excellentSex and the City - The Complete Series (Collector's Giftset)for about $200 -- and though sometimes that price inexplicably drops or goes up by a few bucks, I've never seen it go as high as $220, which is the price they're currently asking for this one \\"collection\\".If you actually purchase all of these, in their flimsy plastic packaged glory for $220.00 when you could get the entire thing for as low as $140 by simply buying individually, the more fool you.

Why did the first and second disc of each season play beautifully without any problems at all? I have NEVER experienced any problems on my players before. If the manufacturer is aware of the problem, why not list the players that it will not have problems!!! Why offer these for sale this way? Why can they not manufacture them without the problems????

I tried the first two discs and they both just pixeled out and froze. I tried them on our DVD player as well as our computer. I had the same results on both. This is really too bad because the packaging looks great, and the series is definitely worth owning, but this particular product has serious problems.

The writers bear no small amount of responsibility for allowing the world's womenfolk to drift further and further down a ghastly path of promiscuous, unstable, self-gratifying misery.

Unfortunately, as a person working normal 9-5 hours, I was unable to watch all the discs early enough to discover the problem discs until the 30 day full-refund period had elapsed.

I made a mistake on taking my time that it elapsed and cannot return it. I may have to purchase this episode to download it so I can be able to watch it. Bummer!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE!","review":"I actually bought this in 2009 for my dad for his birthday. He has since watched them all and gave it back to me so I could watch them. I remember the DVDs came quickly. Also when I bought this I got it for about 80 dollars. Some DVDs had a white papery cover on them. The case itself was a lighter pink and velvety. Very pretty. The inside had each disc clearly marked and also a episode summary or quote from that episode. It also had pictures of the stars when separting each season. Probably not a dad gift unless he was super into the show ( I was really young when i remembered my dad watching this). Perfect for a fan, a collector or anyone that loves SJP! Lots of extra features! I was young when the series was on HBO. It was nice to see the whole series and also understand it. I was like oh... thats why dad would make me leave the room lol. (Im 23 now!) It really is a must buy item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy, very poor quality","review":"DVDs are of poor quality in general and Season 3 Disc 3 cannot be played. Not sure why Amazon still sells this given the multitude of negative reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratched Discs","review":"A warning to anyone thinking about buying the Collector's Giftset. I purchased it through Amazon and two of the discs could not be viewed because the discs were damaged. I returned it and received a refund. Subsequently, I purchased the set through Costco and, again, there was at least one disc that could not be viewed. I returned that set as well and got a refund.To anyone considering the purchase of this giftset, I recommend that you keep your receipt and check each disc (by playing it)so that you can return it if you get one or more bad discs. For anyone giving this set as a gift, I would let the receipient know of the potential problem so that they can exchange it."},{"rating":"1","title":"major flaws within the CD","review":"I bought this collection a few years ago and had great difficulty with the CDs skipping around and indicating that the computer was attempting to fix a problem.

I decided to return it for a refund instead of an exchange, since I'm not sure that the next set I get will be any better. It's a shame because this box-set would be awesome if so many weren't defective. On the plus side, Amazon has a really easy return process, so I'm glad I ordered it from here.

I was so happy to finally own the whole set before the movie came out. After reading the reviews of bad disc I decided to watch some tonight. I could not even get the first disc out! It was glued to the paper! After removing it I attempted to clean the glue with a disc cloth, it did not matter. The disc will not play and skips. I tried the next disc which was also defective on the back, glue and marked, and it would not play. I did not even make it passed the first page which is the two discs. This is a great looking set but quality is very poor. If you want to look at the box this is for you. If you want to watch the discs, buyers beware! Not even 12 mins. and it is still skipping all over terrible quality! I am returning these and will not be asking for an exchange due to the fact other buyers have the same problem. Sad, it was a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Substandard Packaging","review":"What the description for this box set doesn't tell you is that it is half again as tall and half again as wide as a standard DVD, so it won't even fit on the same shelf as the rest of your DVDs. And as nice as the suede album cover might look, inside it's just a ring binder with cheap cardboard DVD holders. Definitely not the high quality boxed set I was looking forward to. And I really was looking forward to having a decent box set of Sex and the City, since the individual season DVDs had such flimsy plastic cases (very prone to ripping at the edges if you open them at all frequently).Now I'm kicking myself for having sold my individual DVDs to buy this boxed set. Maybe in another few years they'll come out with a box set in which they do *not* skimp on the packaging. SatC is the only series I've seen that has such consistently shoddy packaging. I really don't understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad About Sex in the City","review":"Love, love, loved it. I watch the episodes all of the time. I can't get enough of Sex in the City.

A few months later I was frustrated to discover that some discs would not play at all, so I called Amazon and they let me send it in to exchange for a new set. I had the same problem with Round 2 so I returned it within the 30 day window and used the credit to give the Deluxe Edition a whirl. I'm much happier with that one. All the discs work - yay!

It walks you through the long and frightening process of getting a loan with sound advice and forms that inform and educate.What if turned down?

It assumes the reader is an intelligent adult (not a \\"dummy\\", if you know what I mean) who doesn't know much about the SBA or getting money from same. It then goes about giving you all the steps needed to understand what the SBA is, does and how you can take advantage. It doesn't make it sound \\"easy\\" but it does make it sound doable. The book is very detailed, which you want in such a book, but doesn't read like a textbook. It combines down-to-earth advice and experience, with some hard and fast rules and steps to success.Although I haven't read every book on the subject, it's hard to imagine there is a better one out there. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the sba loan book by charles h. green","review":"This book taught me alot about borrowing money with or without the sba's involvement. very easy to follow and to comprehend"},{"rating":"2","title":"nail brite whitening scrub is terrific","review":"I've been using this product for several years as my hands get really dirty in the garden.

Tech support told me just to plug it in again everytime I use it instead of leaving it attached. UNACCEPTABLE SOLUTION. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant study of Renaissance politics","review":"I was astonished to see that somebody gave this book such a low review; I'm a professional historian and can firmly say this is the best history book I've read this year. In this work, Martines has performed a very important service: he has to some extent \\"debunked\\" the myth of the Medici as sweet, kind, gentle art patrons who rule by love over their equals. By focussing on the Pazzi conspiracy to murder the two leading Medici in 1478, Martines has addressed head-on the question of why so many people wanted to murder them, and how Lorenzo consolidated his position in the wake of the assassination plot. It's a dark, bloody, and very convincing Renaissance that Martines portrays, interweaving the Medici family with the Florentine and Italian political world of the time. The book is brilliantly written; after reading a library copy, I went and bought my own because I know I'll be visiting it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing read","review":"I must agree with the other reviewers who found the book a tough go. The actual narrative of the plot itself takes up very little of the book. The majority of the text deals with the complex interweave of family politics in Renaissance Italy, but much of it seems tangential. Engrossing it certainly is not. It's too bad, as I had high hopes for the book. I wonder if some of the other reviewers actually read the same book that I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book drops the ball","review":"This historical era is so much more exhilerating, complex, and intriguing than this book conveys.

Why isn't there one out there?"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if you're not interested in the medici","review":"This book is about everyone BUT the Medici. Has lots of info (especially on money value fluctuations) but disorganized, chopped up and, unfortunately, they made even the Medici dull. Hard to do, or so I thought. Try another author on the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder and Revenge","review":"The \\"rule\\" of Lorenzo \\"the Magnificent\\" Medici in Florence was always fraught with danger. He was not a king or a high elected official, but he effectively controlled the city during his lifetime. This book details just one of the plots against him, and the one that came the closest to killing him and changing the government of the city. It failed, but Lorenzo's brother was murdered, and the revenge taken against the plotters and their helpers and members of their families was brutal indeed, even by the standards of a much more brutal age. The book is riveting when it talks of the plot and its aftermath, but there are long stretches about Renaissance banking and such that are just mind-numbing. These stretches are what kept me from giving this work 5 stars. Otherwise, it is an excellent read, and I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's she saying?","review":"If you like droning music with the volume turned up just loud enough to drown out the highly-processed voice of the lead singer, you've come to just the right place!This is probably the first CD I've heard where the backup singers are actually louder than the lead.

I felt that the charachters were just too uninteresting they didn't grab my attention like they should to make a good story although I was intrigued by some of the book's points such as the earthquake and the civil war I felt that it could'nt compensate for the above. So all in all I can not recommend AFTERMATH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like it!","review":"Let me preface by saying that I really like Levar Burton. His work on Star Trek and Reading Rainbow is great. I love to watch him act.BUT! Levar should spend some more time practicing before he publishes any more books.Levar has an *excellent* idea with this book. He is a very creative individual, but his writing is too choppy and plain. I was unable to relate to the characters, and topics were introduced to quickly.If this book had been several hundred pages longer, I would have been able to read the whole thing, as it would have necessitated more descriptive language and more attention to detail.Burton should not give up hope. His ideas are fascinating, just presented without enough detail and character development.I will buy one of Burton's books in a few years, because I believe that writing experience will improve his style. Possibly you will see a rave review from me for a future Levar Burton novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still on my mind","review":"When I read this book a year ago, I considered it not much more than a good try. HOWEVER, a year later I still find myself thinking about Levar Burton's vision of our future. So here's to you, Mr. Burton, for having written what has ultimately proven for me to be an influential book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fool's gold in the pot at the end of the Reading Rainbow","review":"Evidently, in the real aftermath all of the truly talented writers have perished. This book was painful to read, to the point my penance for once again allowing myself to be mesmerized by name recognition was to finish it at any peril. I can only hope the target audience is the age group most likely to be familiar with Mr. Burton's work on the PBS show.The storyline, set in the not too distant future under internal conditions of civil war, economic collapse, and impending natural disaster was promising. Unfortunately, the text was presented in as primordial of fashion as I can recall for any work of Science Fiction. Character development was minimal, the science largely contrived, and the flow unpleasant to follow.On the other hand, Octavia Butler, to whom the book was dedicated, would probably be an actor of only elementary skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book should be read by every aspiring Author!","review":"For this book is proof that anything can be published! Whenever I am in need of inspiration I just read the end of this book and remember somebody actually got paid for this! As far as the Author is concerned: I like Mr. Burton! He has entertained me for years... Roots, Star Trek, (Also in the Movie with Steve McQueen who plays a Modern Day Bounty Hunter) and I am not saying he cannot write! But this book just does not pass the test. Pace is ok, Characters thin, but the Plot is contrived and the reader feels it while reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What can I say?","review":"It stunk. It reaked. Burton should stick to acting (even though he's not great at that either) and leave sience fiction to those that really know what they are doing. This book was so poor I counldn't even finish it. Unfortunately, he had to use this piece of fiction as a forum for his political agendas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely a first effort","review":"Some of the ideas in this book are promising, but it just doesn't read all that well. The characters are one-dimensional, despite rather forced attempts to give them some depth. There is far too much use of passive voice, and the narrative is choppy. By the time I was 1/3 through the book, I could see pretty clearly all the way to the end. To be fair, there were some high spots. All in all, though, I was glad that I got this one from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, but not great.....","review":"The premise of a near-future America devastated by civil war, economic depression and a monster New Madrid fault earthquake forms an interesting and initially promising backdrop. But Burton's neophyte writing skills are painfully evident in the one-dimensionality of his characters, the amateurish approach to the scientific, and awkward prose. I can't help but wonder what someone like David Brin, John Barnes or Octavia Butler would have done with this story. Another thing I didn't like too much were the almost-cartoonish racist overtones applied to the characters and overall story line. Maybe if Burton would have been less proccupied with these and more mindful of writing a more coherent story, the book would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think that Levar Burton had a good theme to build on. He was trying to say that we should correct the schism between the races, which is a wonderful endeavor. However, times it came out a little too much against \\"the white man\\" and that disappointed me.I don't think the book was too badly written, although there was one page where a paragraph was almost word for word repeated in the one below it, but it didn't really capture my attention or my sympathy. I kept reading hoping it would get better, but it really didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Levar Burton takes a \\"STAND\\" on the world's end","review":"Similarities can be found between this first effort by the former \\"Star Trek\\" performer and the classic novel by Stephen King. It is also obvious that Burton wishes to tread waters covered by sci-fi literary icon(and fellow African-American) Octavia Butler.The book is easy to read, the plot development adequate, and the occasional \\"action scenes\\" hold true to a person familiar with episodic television.\\"Aftermath\\" may not belong in the category of great literature, but it is an entertaining and engrossing story.I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novel with potential fails to deliver.","review":"I must admit that I purchased this novel because it was written by Levar Burton. This, I believe, was what his publisher was hoping. The novel has some interesting concepts, but much of the action hinges on the existance of a fantasy- like healing device which was not believably realised. The protaganists are pleasant enough, but seem devised to provide racial harmony at the expense of realistic characterisation. Much would have been helped by judicious editing (Is it believable that a scientist who works to develop an electrical device wouldn't know whether 200,000 volts would be fatal?). I doubt that Mr. Burton would have had this effort published without the strength of his name, which is a pity because it is a good attempt which does show some promise. It just isn't ready yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"La Belle Ville","review":"Outrageous as the Belle Ville that it portrays, City Unique is much more than a thoroughly-researched and extremely well-written account of two of the most exciting decades ever lived by Montreal: it is also a literary testimony that brings to life the past behind the city's present and future. Weintraub's book flows just like the Saint-Lawrence - you glance at its troubled-though-delightful waters and wonder what you'd find at the bottom... Well, here's your chance to take that to shore, from the accounts of characters as memorable as Lili St. Cyr to the unravelling of a city torn in half by a street called The Main, whose every corner tells a million stories, with anglos on one side, francos on the other, and everything else in between. By one of Montreal's finest journalists, City Unique is an absolute must in our quest to understanding what lies underneath the city's cosmopolitan and multi-cultural enchantment today, as belle now as it was then."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Montreal that is gone forever","review":"Weintraub has painted a wonderful portrait of what life was like in Montreal back in the days before the separatists wreaked havoc on the fabric of the city with their language police and sign laws. Daily life in Montreal during the 1940s and 1950s is vividly portrayed in all its variety, from the infamous Padlock Laws of Premier Maurice Duplessis, to the padlock that held stripper Lili St. Cyr's chastity belt in place. The style is journalistic rather than scholarly, and breezy but informative. Weintraub (who is a Montrealer himself) interviewed dozens of people, and their stories are neatly integrated into his historical account of the major events and figures that shaped the era. Highly recommended for anyone who loves Canada's most flamboyant and fascinating city."},{"rating":"1","title":"learning a new language","review":"Originally, I thought the interactive format of this product would facilitate my learning Mongolian.

However, this particular model is missing two important features.First of all, the rack sits flat in the bottom. Second, the rack has handles along the long edges. Meanwhile, the roaster handles are of course on the short sides. The four handles combine to \\"lock in\\" a fixed space -- you can't have bird that's legs hang over the pan for example. Newer roaster models I have seen that are optimized for turkeys and birds have a three angle \\"cradle\\" rack, which I think would be much more functional.Overall, this is a great deal, and I'm sure it'll work well for pork and beef roasts, etc. And we did fit a 20lb turkey in the pan (in a bag) without the rack, so it's not all bad. But, it could be better. The nonstick is very nice, cleanup was a snap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent roaster...","review":"Does the job well from oven to stovetop.

This pan will not fit in most residential wall ovens and may not fit in many slide-in and drop-in, non-commercial ovens.As it is cast from aluminum, the option of bracing the pan solidly and using a hydraulic ram to reduce the overall length is not available. The handles are riveted as you would expect from Calfalon, which means the sole solution would be to slice off one or both of the handles. In the case of my late-model Jenn-Air I would have to slice off both handles to get it in lengthwise and one handle to get it in sideways which would negate the value of a handle in any event.Also the posting notes that this item comes with an unspecified coupon.

Almost every match is poor except for The \\"Triangle Ladder Match\\" and \\"Triple Threat Match\\". The actual main event was a flop, with people selling longer than they should have just so the Mcmahons could divert the action away from the wrestlers. Mick Foley and the Big show's presence in that match was clearly just for appearance's sake. Most other matches are forgettable.

It did have some good matches like the Triangle Ladder Match and the Main Event but to see HHH, the WWF's biggest heel to walk out of WMania the champ was wrong. This is the 1st WM where the heel walks out champ and it spoilt the event. Mick Foley or the Rock should have won the title, more ratings and sales would be produced if one of those guys won.

It had a very solid card and delivered some very entertaining matches and story lines. The Triangle Tag Team Championship Ladder match was the best match on the show. It saw The Dudleys defending their Tag Team Championship against Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz. The match lasted about twenty five minuites and saw the ladders come into play alot, as well as plenty of tables. The main event for the World Wrestling Federation Championship was brilliant (it was also Mick Foley's last wrestling match). It was a Fatal Fourway Elimination Match between Triple H, The Rock, The Big Show and Mick Foley. The ending was a complete suprise because almost everyone thought that either The Rock or Mick Foley would walk out of WrestleMania as WWF Champion. However, because of Vince McMahon and a chair, Triple H retained the Championship. All in all, WrestleMania 2000 was an excellent event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest WM ever.","review":"Many people put down this ppv because a heel won the main event at WM. A thing that has not ever happened at WM. Everyone has to look at it this way because you know happened Vince McMahon did the unbeleivable. What he was really doing was taking wrestling up another knotch to show that anyone could win at WM. Besides that was not the only match what about the ladder match. Now that was unbeleivable all the moves the wrestlers were great. Showing that wrestling pulls out all the stops.

In his books, he gives make-overs to celebrities, and normal folks as well. His celebrity makeovers are amazing- in this book, he transforms Martha Stewart to Veronica Lake! You will be amazed and entertained by these makeovers, even if you don't need the make-up tips (but who doesn't need to learn from the best! ). This is a great book to leave on your coffee table for guests to flip through. It's fun to try and guess who the celebrity is (Gwyneth Paltrow as James Dean? ).

Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star Is Born!","review":"Definately the pinnacle of Kevyn's star-studded career this book is DRIPPING in celebrities from cover to cover! Each super star poses as Kevyn's canvass and boy does he go wild! Highly creative, highly impressive, highly glamorous! The only problem of course being that you would need the face of a celebrity and the talent of Kevyn to pull off most of the looks! But oh well Kevyn showed his own star power in this book before his tragic and too-soon death. He will DEFINATELY be missed by film and fashion elite and by the millions of fans and acolytes he acquired!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glossy and flashy photography, not much else!","review":"This was such a dissapointing book full of flashy photos and Kevyn's sometimes silly anecdotes. Yes, there are instructions for creating all of the looks - but is this realistic? Really come now, are any of us going to try to make ourselves over into Joan of Arc, Cleopatra, James Dean, Clark Gable??????? This is just another vehicle for the author to showcase his magic on the human face (he is an extremely talented artist in his field) however, he is not giving us anything new since his last book and frankly, some of the contents of this book are rather bizaar.

While not a self-help manual per se, this book shows the amazing transformations that can come as a result of makeup alone. I found it very useful for providing an overview of different techniques--for example, the effects of combining light/dark mouth with light/dark eyes; the use of neutral versus more dramatic colors; options for shaping brows, eyes, and lips; etc. While most of us will never come anywhere near Kevyn's skill level, this book provides at least a starting point for incorporating some professional tips into your own makeup routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kevyn is a brilliant artist!","review":"This is the second time I have purchased a book by Kevyn Aucoin. I also purchased (and reviewed \\"Making Faces\\" which I loved) and I absolutely LOVE him. He is without a doubt the most talented make-up artist in the world. He is amazingly talented and takes make-up to a higher level. It is true art that this man creates. I am astonished and awed every time I see his work. There is so many wonderful and creative ideas that are certainly within the reach of the average woman.

Kiara Kabukuri and Amber Valetta \\"...in a dual composit image that \`suggets' the merging of the world's races.\\" His concept here is an excellent representation of his uncanny ability to see beyond the obvious. If you can look at this book (or his two previous books) with this same \`eye' as Kevyn did possess, then you can fully appreciate his book (s). A great example is of \`Linda Evangelista' on pp. 144-145 (actually Alex Peruzzi) done up like Linda from his The Art of Makeup p.111. The resemblance is unbelievable. So do not expect to get an incredible makeup lesson here, this is just a vehicle to showcase more of his incredible work.Bottom line: A must-have for any MUA's inspiration library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The illustrations are beautiful and everything is written well.

Unfortunately, the author only has enough Mars story to fit about 50 pages so he feels the need to alternate chapters between Mars and flashbacks. Not only does this get annoying, but it would seem that every person on this Mars mission had some horridly freakish childhood. Also, Mr. Landis' personal obsession with the cesspool city of Cleveland shows as multiple characters \\"coincidentally\\" went to college in Cleveland. Anyway, if you want a Mars book pick up the Kim Stanley Robinson or Ben Bova series'... this one is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is \\"Hard Science\\" then I don't like it","review":"I can't say I enjoyed this book. As is epoused in the sleeve-notes, the writer has a significant amount of real NASA-related experience. I found the book far too reliant upon actual scientific details than having any real story. Page after page of technical-details does not constitute the type of Science-fiction to keep the reader (or me at least) involved. There are no actual mind-bending ideas in this novel, it is simply a modern-day pseudo-thriller padded out with too many references to details like 'UV-energized sulfur radicals'. If you like sci-fi based around unique and previously untried concepts (such as a Philip K Dick novel) I would suggest you will find this book somewhat stale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay Science, Bad Fiction","review":"The science (as you might expect) is pretty good, but as fiction this book falls flat. It has no dramatic tension, two-dimensional (at best!) characters, and an ending so abrupt and so lame I almost threw the book at the wall. Spend your money on Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars Books instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent plot, no sympathetic characters","review":"This book is reminiscent of the old 50s hard science fiction, where the science is believable, but the characters are cardboard. Even with half of the book devoted to flashbacks to explain the motivations and personalities of the various crew members, not one character is sympathetic or memorable. It is difficult to root for anyone to get off the planet. An earlier review suggested that the book had a surprise ending. (Note: Semi-spoiler to follow!) It is telegraphed about a third of the way into the book which of the crew would make it to the polar area. Even the \\"surprise\\" person who sacrificed him/herself was easily predictable.Mr. Landis' short fiction is excellent, and he should stick to that format."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dissapointing","review":"I really have nothing good to say about this book, so I'll keep this short. The characters are horrible, cardboard cliches. The plot is dull, and completely devoid of any exciting moments. And worst of all, the descriptions of Mars itself are utterly uninspiring. A brand new, never before explored terrain, and the author can barely string three sentences together about it. Avoid this novel at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard sci-fi?

Not a bad book, but not great either. The old plotline of \\"who will give up their life for the others\\" has been done before. Lately, better, by Michael Flynn in \\"River of Stars\\". There is a lot of babble with not very interesting characters. Hey, if I had to choose between \\"Paris Hilton - My life story\\" and this book, I'd choose Mars again.

The reality of WALKING or DRIVING from the southern hemisphere to the north pole of Mars? I think not. Astronauts having sex in the space station? No. And don't even get me started on the ending...

Foley was a constant presence in Austin's music community until his untimely death in 1989, when he was shot and killed by the son of a friend, in the middle of a domestic dispute. This album comes from a live show recorded weeks before his death -- it's a striking performance, ranging widely in emotional tone and musical strength. It shows Foley's strengths and weaknesses -- the honest anger of his songs about petty-minded harassment by local cops are vivid, but artless, while his more accomplished pieces -- \\"If I Could Only Fly,\\" \\"Clay Pigeons\\" -- are simply gorgeous.
