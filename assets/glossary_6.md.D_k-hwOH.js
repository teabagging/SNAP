It would appear that the manuscript was in loose-leaf form, someone threw it down the stairs, his widow reassembled it in random order, and thus it was published. I have never seen such a hopelessly disorganized technical textbook before. Holm jumps into discussing things midstream, then many chapters later (if lucky) you will find the introduction, definitions, etc. that might make it feasible to understand what he was earlier in the midst of.If you want to understand electrical contacts, read the book by Paul G. Slade, instead. This is more current and never was thrown down the stairs at all.For a more basic, but clear (not muddled!) introduction to the science of contacts, read the \\"Ney Contact Manual\\".

For example, he mentions a Double peng in Ward Off, and gives a verbal description which defies me and then says it is a sense of \\"two events unfolding in step,\\" \\"like watching two different-sized cogs meshing in mutual rotation.\\" Duh!Definitely not recommended for beginners, and very confusing to the intermediate."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost silly","review":"As a long time Taiji student/teacher I can vouch for the solid principles and concepts presented.However, the author's constant attempt to construct his prose in a magical, mystical package was almost too silly to read.he seemed kind of full of himself, as if he was the focus with his esoteric poetic sentence structure.It's worth getting just to enjoy his attemot to be deep, dark and authoritative."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect book for a little farm","review":"This is a great book, it gives you a lot of important information it is like having 8 or more books in one.

Right off the bat, the authors mention GMOs and defend their existence by claiming that man is always going to be looking for better ideas, so there's no point in arguing their merits! They admit that GMOs are not strictly 'cross-breeding', but restructuring DNA at the cellular level (and NO ONE knows what will come of that), but again, simply shrug that off as progress. There are other unfortunate misconceptions in it as well, and not a lot of detailed information regarding the various breeds of animals, nor why you should husband one type over another depending upon your needs. All-in-all, this isn't about sustainable homesteading, more like how to create a smaller home version of modern factory farming techniques. Not what I was looking for, at any rate..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource book!","review":"This book was very beneficial in all aspects of raising small-farm animals.

I'll definately buy more indepth books on the types and breeds that I want to include on my future farm. No one should expect a wide-ranging overview like this book to cover everything.The book covers major topics within each animal type such as popular breeds for the homesteader, purchasing options, feeding, housing, handling, management, breeding, health, and butchering.

As an MD interested in nutrition, I can heartily recommend the recipes in these books for the good of your heart. Well done, authors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best bean cookbooks","review":"Lots of good tasting recipes that really are easy to prepare. Each recipe has a small chart identifying protein, fat, carbohydrates, calories and fiber content per serving.The best tasting recipes all seem to begin with sauteing onions and garlic then adding the rest of the recipe. This is a great way to make tasty bean recipes.Pressure cooking may be the best and fastest way to cook beans, where beans don't have to be soaked and salt and other acidic ingredients can be added during cooking which greatly enhances the flavor. Pressure cooked beans are so much tastier than canned or slow cooked beans it's a shame pressure cooking isn't included.

This book does help with the ideas, and I particularly like the flavors of the dressings that have accompanied the salads. Though in the case of the dressings, and some of the seasonings/spices added to many recipes, I did reduce the amount used, as it seemed a bit over the top (just my opinion). I consider it an easy adjustment though, and have had good results when I have. One thing I wanted that was missing was any burger recipes. I have tried recipes to make burgers, with mixed results, and I thought it would have been a great addition to this book. Perhaps the book \\"More Easy Beans\\" by the same authors has one.

Easy Beans agrees in the overview on page 16, and then all but one of the lentil recipes take over 50 minutes. (Some bean recipes are faster, when they use canned beans.)

It is a shrill, turgid and polemical screed about doing over the American government. The hero, if that term might be used, overthrows the government in a putsch. He then institutes a radical restructuring of American society, along the lines of a socialist fantasy.The book was written in 1912 and thus predates the rise of Lenin, Mussolini and Hitler. Yet it carries within itself the echoes of those fanaticisms. If you are an American and actually want to read this miserable screed, do so and be grateful that it remained a dark fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loser","review":"This one may be historically important but it is boring and poorly written.

I only could easily find the Danco MX1 valve which fits the valve body, but is not compatible with the old metal lever and knob. I had to buy a Trim Kit with the more modern plastic knob and temp lever [still metal on the escutcheon.] All is good again. No more drippage.PRO-TIP - I couldn't get the old metal temp lever off to save my life. So, I tore it off, essentially. And found that there is a hidden-from-view screw that secures the lever. It's behind the long skinny part of the lever. So, put a screwdriver parallel to the wall, behind the lever, towards the center and you can then loosen the screw and avoid my rookie mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I wasn't expecting much.

I contacted Pfaltzgraf, and they told me I could use a ceramic cleaner to remove the marks. This did work; however, the next time my flatware (knives, fork tines) came in contact with the piece, the gray marks were there again. (They do not come out in the dishwasher). I was told the marks are due to the high quality flatware (a certain percentage of silver/softness); however, I have never had this issue with other dinnerware. I am going to have to replace the entire set, because it irritates me every time I pull out a marred dish. Now, aside from the gray marks, the actual integrity of the ceramic seems to be deteriorating, and there are small brown stains that will not come out with the ceramic cleaner.

Dean Cain is a charming, sweet(or is he?) fireman whom she reluctantly falls for.This is Lifetime and not Hallmark with some non-family friendly themes including a love scene, you get to see Dean's bare back, but still pretty mild by today's standards, but really there's no language, nudity or violence."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was very entertaining.","review":"The only problem with this movie is that I wish Dean Cain could have been in each and every scene.

Often partners don't understand what their husbands therapists are trying to achieve, and the reasons we ask then to do certain things. This chapter gives partners an explanation and also gives commonsense advice on how to cope and when to call it quits.There is also a great section on angry boys as well and how to stop passing anger on.this is my number one recommended book for men who just feel angry and frustrated and don't know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good book","review":"Very good and honest.

The major obstacle is getting \\"your loved one\\" to begin reading. Once that is achieved they will relate on many levels with the information in this book.

The character in the novel who work within the cigar factory relate to the lector, who has come to give them education in the form of his novels, in many different ways. Affairs, deception, and love occur at the hands of one man and the Tolstoy novel. This much deserved Pulitzer Prize winner never allows the reader to drift. Each word appears to be carefully chosen by Cruz to enstill some sense of dramatic and literaty awe. I found myself laughing, crying, cheering and smiling at the characters relationships and Cruz's amazing ability to create a wonderful story.

Overall though the H&G software was a good buy and fairly easy to figure out how to use but I wish it had pre-made polygon rooms to cut and paste.

Room layouts and adding furniture have been a breeze. The software has given us a very good picture of how big the rooms need to be and how the furniture will fit.She's had some trouble figuring out mutliple floors. When she added the basement and then switched to a 3D view, the house was shoved sideways off the basement. We never figured that out. Adding stairs to the second floor is another function that she also hasn't quite figured out.But overall we are enormously pleased with the software. It gives us plenty of design power without overwhelming us with complexity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Product For The Money","review":"This software is fairly easy to use. Building the roof can be challenging at times if you want anything out of the ordinary. I suppose I could call support and they could probably walk me through it but I just haven't had the time.

However, some of it could have been omitted: The Boy, Dressed in Black,Wishing Well,Hate To Say I Told You So,Bull-Dog. It is easy enough to skip over the misses and just listen to the hits. The biggest disappointment is the overall sound quality--horrible. The old Red Bird and Mercury vinyl LPs that I own sound much better. There is a glitch in the beginning of Give Him a Great Big Kiss that just startles your ears. The liner notes contain some inacurate information--for one thing, Marge Ganser died from cancer not a drug overdose. This album only gets 2 stars because it does have my favorites--guess I'll just play the old vinyl though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!!

I finally gave up and went on line to buy a cable. I then stumbled upon these reviews and after then checked my printer instructions and sure enough, no USB cable is included and no black printer cartridge. Locally, the cable will cost $35 with tax. Then you still have to buy the black printer cartridge. Bad, bad Amazon for not warning buyers that the price does not include the printer cable and black ink cartridge! I am very disappointed in Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Printer.","review":"I bought this printer for college just to print off some notes, and papers for class.

Don't buy it. I have three cartridges left and so I have to get another one of these but after a HP printer going the same way in Ireland I bought a Canon over in Dublin and it was fantastic, however because the power supply is different I gave to my brother in law and thought that I would give HP another try. Well, after just 8 months of owning the thing it just up and did itself in...so I helped to put it out of its misery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing fancy, but functional and great product overall","review":"It prints fast, with a good print quality for documents, but it seems to go through ink quickly. There are also occasional issues when setting it up with different computers, including inability to auto-detect the printer. In other words, the plug-and-play would not always work, forcing the user to download drivers from the HP website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!!!","review":"Looking back on the reviews before writing this makes me laugh. Printers don't normally come with USB cords anymore regardless of the manufacturer. This is a very decent model that works perfectly and surprisingly clear output compared with the simple navigations. The ink is not expensive but don't buy this if you are printing all the time. Buy it if you need to print a few times a week and you won't see the ink drain like water. I have a printer for my photos, printer for large quantity printing, a printer for scanning/faxing and this one for quick prints. I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware: You will have to factor in the USB and Black Ink Cost","review":"Nowhere in the product description did they mentioned that the USB cable and the black ink cartridge were not included.

Not too expensive, but it does the job perfectly! Don't get it if you're looking for amazing quality, high-capacity, specialty printing, etc. This is a great printer for regular home printing. It is pretty small, so it fits great anywhere, and it only uses two cartridges. So far, I haven't had any issues with it, and I've printed a lot of different things. Color and black-and-white...not a speed demon, but fast enough. I would give it 5-stars, but we're not talking the holy grail of printers here.

The worst junk was another HP printer that I made the mistake of buying at the same time that I got this one. If you want a printer, that jams, is hard to use ( you basically have to reprogram you computer over and over every time you want to switch from legal to 8.5\\" x 11 \\" paper. Also, if you have to cancel a print, it just gets stuck, and you have to close everything that you are working on and re-start your computer every time over and over and over.................), uses tons of expensive ink because it prints badly over and over and over............., then this is the printer for you.

I've sold a lot of this set as well as having it in my own collection, and in none of these sets has there been more than a small booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly disappointing high tech speakers","review":"After reading many positive reviews from people such as Chris Breen and in particular learning about the features for wireless configurations, I started out with a positive disposition toward the Audioengine A5. The design and technical functionality immediately give one the impression that this company knows what its doing.Thus, the shock is even greater when one has the first listen. Sound is certainly subjective, but the A5's interpretation is flat overall and sometimes distorted. Although the A5's provide a healthy low bass, the high range isn't crisp and the mid range is sometimes distorted. It could well depend on the type of music. Whereas Led Zeppelin sounds pretty good, other types of music such as Jazz or Classical leave much to be desired. In short, my opinion is that the A5's aren't a viable selection for anyone with an ear for a broad range of music. If you are considering the A5's, please give them a thorough testing first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just enough","review":"Excellent design, perfect construction, but the sound can improve more.

I followed all the troubleshooting tips in the manual and bought a ground loop isolator from RadioShack. Still no luck. I saw many people complaining about the same problem on the internet. None seemed able to solve the problem, so I sent them back. Then I got some Prodipe 8 monitors that work perfectly with my Airport Express in the same location, have much better sound and absolutely no hum. They were also cheaper than the Audioengine 5. They are quite a bit bigger, but if you're worried about the size you could get the smaller Prodipe 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speakers died after about 1 year","review":"As others attested in reviews that convinced me to buy these speakers from Audioengine, they sound great. Unfortunately, after about a year the left channel sound output died and I've been unable to troubleshoot it. The left speaker just puts out a muffled distorted cacophony of noise. Tried connecting a different speaker to isolate the source and it also played with extreme muffled distortion so I suspect something is fried in the amp. Eventually I'll get around to taking it to a local repair shop, but I'm sure the repair cost will be high. It's frustrating because these were quite expensive and I've never had speakers die before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio Engine speakers","review":"Nice looking, good frequency response, excellent power!Size is just right for apartment living.My 1st venture with Audio Engine, but not my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, clean sound.","review":"I've been around speakers quite a bit, auto audio, home, and studio. As far as most self powered setups go these are of the cleanest sounding 1/8th inch jack/connector speakers I've used, even compared to balanced sets. Though a little light in the very low end, they don't offer themselves to the desire for a sub, are slow to admit distortion at the higher volumes and handle extend use (18+ hours) with acceptable heat levels.The usb power adapter on the left speaker is handy, as is the top input for mp3 players, but doesn't like abuse. The volume rheostat is smooth and precise, but cuts the right speaker off at the lower volume levels.To any point, the acoustic quality is grand and well worth the cash, the construction is solid and classic and though I say some things may be delicate I am very rough on my deployment toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to the hype","review":"Quality fit and finish, beautiful design elements, user friendly connections and interface, and rich, clear sound that will transform your world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maxwel, maxwell, maxwell","review":"Maxwell used to teach working class people physics (as part of his socialist convictions) at the University of London among other places and these elementary books are a product of those lectures.

Critical scruples that fail to recognize the true stature of this opera are grounded in a false, pseudo-sophisticated concept of music and drama. Acording to this mindset, the very virtues of Der Vampyr are cause for complaint. Instead of straining at an aesthetic gnat, the opera delivers a wallop. In some respects Weber's Der Freischutz is a better opera but not by a wide margin. The vampire subject calls for fierce, melodramatic treatment. Marschner expresses that sort of candor from the overture forward. The subject is not dainty. Instead of asking with Eliot's Prufrock, \\"Do I dare to eat a peach?\\" Marschner's Ruthven confesses his lust for blood with emphasis on the German word \\"Lust.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A little known german opera.

The nature sounds were pleasant and varied. It had all the features that I wanted: projected time, nature sounds, and iPod dock. More bad things: it was impossible to focus the time projection so that it was not blurry. Although there were many adaptors for different iPods, mine did not fit very well and charging of the iPod was not supported (I have a newer iPod, my husband's older iPod fit fine and charged fine).The seller was excellent, communicated well and accepted my return.

I would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within days","review":"It was working ok for a couple of days and then then 'spa' sounds became overrun with static and the next day all of the lights stopped working.

The rest of the team should be fired. This clock is TOO BRIGHT! Even the power light is a beacon. I had to put nail polish on the power light, and black electrical tape over the clock portion.PLEASE: 1) Make the clock red instead of blue. The blue is hard to see. 2) Put a dimmer that has a dial. These are insanely bright. 3) Sell your audio on iTunes.

The first part of Appendix C has many of the commands necessary to boot VMS with various options -- but not all of them.The book is incredibly dated, too. While it has most VAX models, which went out of production 15 years ago, it doesn't have all the Alpha models. And the boot commands for Alpha are buried in the middle of the text instead of being included in the Appendix. Fortunately, all Alphas use the same boot commands.This book doesn't include the HP Integrity servers (which replaced Alpha), which has a much more complex boot process.

This version is hundreds of pages and thousands of sections shorter than the real \\"Greek Grammar\\".

It is during use that this product fails badly. The blades pivot on a pin, of course, and the tension on the blades is supplied by a spring. When I was younger, the tension on tools like this (scissors, clippers, etc.) was adjustable and controlled by a fine-thread nut/bolt arrangement. Unfortunately, on these clippers, that arrangement has been replaced by a fixed (non-adjustable) rivet with the tension is fixed due to the lack of a means to adjust that tension. As a result, the tension isn't sufficient and if I try to trim anything more than a half dozen blades of blue grass at one time, the blades separate and the grass jambs between the two blades. In my view, this is a very poorly engineered product and useless for the task intended. I bit the bullet and tossed these in favor of a new set of clippers.

When we think of good adult books we should think of Nabokov (\\"Lolita\\") or Neal Drinnan (\\"Glove Puppet\\").For such a short novel the plot goes in so many ways, yet stays entirely coherent. Written in the first person by a 20-year-old, the boy's mood changes with his age and with the story. The writing, however, is consistent from cover to cover.The story is fascinating and will take the reader through a whole range of emotions. It makes one wish the author had been paid by the word, so the novel would infill every detail.Australians have been turning out great stuff for decades. Here's another outstanding novel. Since it's short everyone should take the time to read it.

While it is advertised as a mix of broccoli, alfalfa, and clover what it really has is just clover.Anyone that's been sprouting for a while can easily tell the difference between clover and alfalfa (even though they are incredibly similar), and the last six batches I grew were ALL around 80% clover.Clover and alfalfa are both fairly cheap sprouts, where as broccoli is not. I don't quite understand why they can't have a simple 40/40/20 mix of the three and call it a day. As it is, I believe the mix contains around 80% clover, 15% alfalfa and a whopping 5% broccoli seeds.Paying $15 for a pound of mostly Clover is a rip off, since other sites sell that seed for half the price.You would be better off buying a pound of clover AND a pound of alfalfa for less than $17."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"Just new to the sprout eaters club.

I use the rower in all ways suggested, and feel as though I'm getting a great workout.Cons: for long workouts, a padded seat would be better than the hard plastic.Overall: I am very pleased with the product.

I thought, why is the company displaying such a large ad to upgrade to the Deluxe product. I still have no clue. I own two other CD burning products, which unfortunately do not convert from Microsoft's WMA file format. Adaptec's software is horribly buggy. My error rate on over 30 CDs was about 35%. That's correct: one of three CD writes failed. The first couple of writes, I thought, might be the result of other software interfering. So, I closed ever single program under Windows 98SE except Explorer and Systray, and still obtained this awful success rate.

I have seen the movie twice and I honestly believe that it is the best American Pie movie out of the raunchy trilogy. The movie is very funny, but it will probably only be funny for those that liked the first two because well, it does get pretty raunchy. What's different about this movie compared to movies like Porky's and Fast Times at Ridgemont High is that it has a lot of heart. These are actually characters that one can really care about and that makes the experience even more enjoyable. There a couple new characters that you are boumd to love including a woman named Candace and Bear. But Seann William Scott's Stifler is used quite often and will remind you that even the biggest jerks can redeem themselves in one way, shape, or form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best","review":"having seen the premeire, I know this movie and wont BS you, though wont spoil too much of the movie. But lemme just say that this movie is a great way to round out the American Pie series. Seann William Scott toally grabs the spotlight with scenes like the dance club and the \\"truffle\\"!!! Also it makes for great laughs as you observe \\"Finch\\" and \\"Stiffler\\" switch personallities as they try to impress \\"Michelle's\\" sis \\"Cadence\\". (sry if thats too much, but believe me its nothing compared to the entirity of the movie). I just hope that animal activists dont try to cause a nusince over the \\"cake scene\\" and try saying its Animal cruelty.

It hooked me from the opening music, to the nostalgic conclusion. It really showcases Seann William Scott's talent, and after viewing the first two movies, I just can't understand why they were so succesful without all that Stifler action.Another plus (which many think of as a bad thing) is the fact that characters such as Vicky, Nadia, and Oz are gone. That really made the movie for me. I just didn't like those characters, and I thought they brought the first to Pie's down. They're just so boring, and ditzy, and, honestly, repulsive.

The movie should have been called \\"American Stifler\\", cause Sean William Scott OWNS this movie. His interaction with the characters (namely Finch) is hysterical, and every moment he is on screen, you will be laughing. The dance scene is brilliantly executed. Stifler is great.

What you saw in the previews was about the extent of the jokes -- and those weren't funny at that.The only worthwhile part of the movie -- if a part can be called worthwhile; nothing could have saved this disaster -- would be the acting of Seann William Scott. His ability to critique each moment with one of his memorable quips was somewhat interesting. Even with him, I still give the movie only 2 stars.If you must see the movie in order to finish out the series, get it from the rental store or a friend, but do not buy it.

Like the first two movies, this one is an average comedy with some funny characters who can make for the lack of a decent and creative plot. The jokes haven\`t changed, going from predictable slapstick to utterly childish stuff, and for the most part the laughs are forced as they deal with trivial, unsurprising situations. Even though Jim is the one who\`s getting married, Stifler seems to be the central character here, getting all the attention and acting in a particularly annoying way. But I knew what to expect anyway, so this isn\`t much of a disappointment, although it\`s probably the worst movie of the series. Still, it\`s a passable flick to watch with some friends and laugh once or twice. It isn\`t supposed to me more than that, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim & Michelle Ties the Knot...","review":"American Wedding is the third film in this series of comedies and in this episode Jim (Jason Biggs) is tying to tie the knot with Michelle (Alyson Hannigan). Knowing Jim from the previous films, the story is about to go wrong somewhere and it does so right from the beginning when Jim is about to pop the question. In the shadow of continuous blunders, Jim's father (Eugene Levy) is spicing up the slap-stick humor with his intentional good-will. Despite the jokes, the story falls flat on it's face because it consists of one silly joke on top of another which prevents it from taking off. In the end the audience will have had several belly-aching laughs, but is left with an empty cinematic experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad mouthed","review":"MAYBE AMERICAN WEDDING SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED AMERICAN DISASTER.TOO MUCH FOUL LANGUAGE THAT WAS OVERDONE THAT EVENTUALY LED TO THE MOVIES DEMISE,IT ALMOST BECAME A BIG BORE.IF NOT FOR THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN QUITE PLEASENT.NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS AMERICAN PIE,THE DIRECTOR JUST RAN OUT OF IDEAS HOPEFULY THIS WILL BE THE LAST.SEE IT AT YOUR OWN PERIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cinematic Disaster","review":"I would rather suck on a tail-pipe than watch this film again.

There is no information about what species of wild yam was used, so people could use the non therapeutic one and wonder why they are getting pregnant. Also no information was given to how much milligrams of wild yam was in each capsule. A person could use a capsule that contains a smaller mg's of the product than this lady trialled while still consuming the number of capsules they recommended because the trials capsule were 200mg of wild yam where their's was only 150mg capsules. They may be potentially at risk of pregnancy. Therefore more research needs to be done to get the exact amount and species used.

If you are looking to have your child understand another culture and somehow relate it to them -- THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU -- no matter what country/continent/culture is your focus. The little girl ponders about how her day would go if she lived in a culture so remote in lifestyle. It really makes you appreciate our conveniences, yet brings us to respect and reflect on how that must be to live so differently.

It doesn't go over the year and it just kind of squeezes your ears to stay on. It doesn't cover your ears very well.4. The head band is not round, it's square because of the folding option.

Does not look real great, but does the job for me.(Oily skin can make the material become stiff after a few years,or is that ears?) The cord length is approx. 10ft.and does not present any problems, being that it is rather thin, so handle with care!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD FIT & CHEAPLY MADE","review":"Sennheiser should be known for their High-End Sound Head Phones. The EH-150 is clearly their entry product. They are uncomfortable to wear, since the foam presses against the ears - unless you have tiny ears. They look cheap = no golden connectors, cable is just a cheap long wire. FORGET ABOUT THEM and spend 40 bucks more and get their HD 280 PRO (those fit like a glove, are very well made, lasts forever AND sounds great) - I have two. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I bought these headphones to replace a pair of Koss UR-20s that I had for about five years. After reading the reviews of the Sennheisers, I figured they would be a good step up from the Koss headphones. Not so. The fit is terrible, the cushioning does not fit around your ear, but rather presses directly on it. I found that the headphones fit so tightly that I would end up with an imprint of the plastic grill inside the headphone cup on the middle of my ear. I can only wear the headphones for about twenty minutes until I have to take them off because the pain is too distracting.The second point, where I thought the Sennheisers would definitely be better than my old headphones, is sound quality. These headphones have a much more pronounced bass response than my old headphones, which I considered to be quite bassy. This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I find that it colors the music too much. They also distort badly even at low volumes. They are worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphone","review":"I have been searching for a headphone that is comfotable, has excellent sound quality and is not super expensive. I found this to be a perfect product for my requirements. The sound is excellent anywhere I tried it: directly on a Yamha keyboard for playing notes/music, on a Sony AV to listen to hidef TV (TV) or PS3 games/blue ray movies all connected to the AV, or on my computer listening to music. They are also very comfortable on my ears and my head for long (1-2 hour) use.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice headphone set","review":"I have found these Sennheiser headphones to be comfortable because of their light weight and well padded ear pieces. I use them mostly sitting at my PC. The cord is nice and long so I can lean back, turn side to side, or scoot over to my file cabinets. I think the sound quality is very good - I listen to mostly rock, top 40, adult comtemporary, and some country. The enclosed ear design blocks most ambient low level sounds. I think these headphones are a very good value - an excellent value with a discount or on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser EH-150","review":"I wasn't sure about trusting the other reviews that I read about this product, but I did.

As far as being able to adjust them for better fit, you can move the speakers up and down a bit so if you have a really long head it will be aligned with your ears, but the clamping action against your ears will still be there.I also did not find the sound quality to be anything that would set them apart. Can not say that I would recommend these based on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bang for the buck","review":"I have an IPod and the ear buds that came with them drive me nuts.Also the sound is sort of flat. I saw the Sennheiser EH-150. I like the reviews and thought it would be a good buy. I was wrong. They were a great buy. The sound is rich,from The Boss,The Stones,the song Baker Street,ELP,or Coldplay. Just plug these babies in and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the sound in the world cannot make up for the lack of comfort","review":"Tremendous sound, etc., like everyone else says. However, it is absolutely unbearable to wear these headphones. At first you feel the pressure on your head like a clamp, and when that subsides you can't help but to notice that a fourth of your earlobe hangs outside of the hole provided for your ears.I know this sounds a little extreme, but honestly, as much as I enjoy the sound of these headphones, it is impossible to focus on listening for an extended period of time without your head hurting.I will soon be on the market for another more comfortable and more portable pair of headphones"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had read how well these performed as being noise cancelling, but I could hear everything around me just like any cheap headphones permit.

This is the best headphone I have ever had with the same price range. Only a little complain on the pain when listening to music after long hours.4 star as per the little ear pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!!","review":"I've got to say that this is the best headphones I've had yet, and I have gone through plenty of them. The sound is awesome for its price. The sound could be a little better, but that would cost you another $50.00 or more. Over all, I feel that the extra money isn't really worth it. The crisp sound you get w/ these are just fine. My only complaints are the size for packing and the sweat that the leather cause, but that is leather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Terrible comfort.","review":"how in god's name are these headphones getting superb reviews? You must have tiny alien-type ears for this to not hurt your ears.sound quality is meh, It sounds decent for a $40 pair of headphones, but comfort was absolutely garbage.I have normal sized ears and within 1 hour, my ears got bloodshot red, started heating up, etc.. It was just so damn uncomfortable.Don't buy if you have medium to normal sized ears.

Otherwise, it's swell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser EH-150 Hi-Fi Stereo Headphones Too Small","review":"After trying on the earphones, I return them since they didn't fit properly over my ears causing discomfort. Because of this, they didn't block out the ambient noise as stated in the product description. I recommend visiting local electronics stores to try on the headphones before ordering them from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"Sound is OK for the price, but they are very uncomfortable for an adult. They don't fit over the ears and are too tight. Cord is just the right length. Would be 4 stars if they were a little larger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much worse than expected based on other reviews","review":"I carefully selected these after reading many of the reviews and seeing the average review score was excellent,with cost fairly inexpensive. I was quickly dissapointed as I found the headphones to be uncorfortable and the sound was not very impressive. I then read some of the negative reviews and they are right on the mark. The headphones are too tight (and I have a small head), the cups don't fit over the ears; they give me a headache within 5 minutes. Not to mention, the sound is no better than my 5 year old, inexpensive Sony earphones. On top of all of this, the pair I received seemed to be defective as the right speaker hisses a lot. Plus they are a little bulkier than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound, but fit too tight","review":"I bought these Sennheiser EH-150 Evolution headphones 2 weeks ago and am quite impressed with their sound quality. One thing that I would change (if I could) is the tight fit that gets annoying after a while. After 2 hours the pressure points on my ears make me take it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confirmed: for micro-ears only!","review":"I read all of the reviews for these headphones before I went ahead and decided to buy them and try them out. Many reviews commented how small they for normal-sized ears. I thought maybe they were wrong.I've 100% confirmed this... I have normal sized adult male ears the headphones 'sat' on about half my ears. The sound quality is incredible, but not if after an hour or two your ear hurts from being smashed.I do not recommend this product. I've returned them to Amazon. 2 stars for sound only, not fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I got these headphones as a way to mow my six acres of lawn more enjoyable...I got a little worried about all the reviews saying they were not comfortable and won't fit around the ears...I am 6'2 180 pounds with a normal sized head and it fits perfectly...It drowns out the noise from my tractor and the sound sounds great...You can't beat this for the money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality @ a very low price ...","review":"Shopped online for days thru Amazon , then Apple , then read customer & technical website reviews - Common thread was that Sennheiser makes some of the very best - couldn't afford to go 'all the way' to the top of the line and decided that at this price for the \\"EH-150's\\", what the heck . I have been so pleasantly surprised and amazed by the overall quality of these headphones in EVERYWAY ! Best buy I've made in quite some time ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value on Amazon, questionable value if paying full retail","review":"At around $25 I feel content with this purchase. These will certainly outperform any cheapo headphones that came standard with your MP3 or CD player. They will also outperform most, if not all, entry level \\"upgrade\\" headphones you may find at the local big box electronics retailer (price range $20-30).On the downside the design is a bit clumsy for a model advertised as \\"portable\\". I would call them more semi-portable because of the bulky (albeight lightweight plastic) ear cup design. My other concern is that the design seems a bit fragile, the build quality and materials seem a bit \\"cheap\\". Even at this price point I was expecting a somewhat higher build quality due to the brand.In the end at the total Amazon price of <$27 these are an excellent value heaphone."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"They are not the most comfortable things in the world but do sound great.

Product arrived in excellent condition and it works well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"I shouldn't have expected much for the $15 I paid for these, but still I was disappointed that a full over-the-ear headphone from a storied manufacturer like Sennheiser could deliver such poor sound. The highs are tinny and strained, the midrange is non-existent, and the bass is overboosted and artificial-sounding. I've heard iPod earbuds that sounded better than these cans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below average","review":"The headphones are too small for an adult's ears. The sound is just OK, I wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound and durability","review":"These headphones are an excellent value. I've had them for four years, using them for music and video on my laptop and more recently for music and audiobooks on my iPhone.I usually keep them on the couch, where they are frequently sat on and squished under the pillows. Even with this abuse, they are still in great condition after four years. The only sign of years of use is that the thin, soft covering on the headband is just beginning to split.The only negative I've experienced is that they can get uncomfortable on my ears, but even that is only after wearing them for a couple hours, which I don't often do. I would expect any headphones at this price to begin to get a little annoying to wear after that much time.I'm not an expert audiophile, but I'm not oblivious to sound quality either, as I'm always adjusting my husband's car stereo for problems he doesn't even hear. These headphones sound great to me.Overall, a great value for sound and durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product/Great price","review":"I purchased these headphones via Amazon Prime, so my total price, including 2-day shipping, was $25.44. The sound is warm and accurate, and they are very comfortable to wear. I use them for my MP3 player, so I keep most of the cord tied together, just as they came out of the box.Between the excellent quality, and the low cost, this is one of the best bargains I've had the pleasure of taking advantage of in some time. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Satisfied","review":"I usually go through headphones like Kleenex, so the Sennheiser EH-150 Evolution was a very pleasant surprise for me. These headphones are a miracle: lighter than any pair I've had, and the sound quality is amazing. I've read other reviewers' complaints about the close fit of these headphones around the ears, but it doesn't hurt me or interfere with my listening enjoyment. Very effective for shutting out distracting noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"audifonos","review":"muy buena calidad de audio,cable de 3 m, livianos, y ajustables dependiendo de la persona quien lo use.

They are amazing, when I put them on and listen to music I can't even hear anything else that is around me, even when I am vaccumming, the cord to it is very long also which can be a good and bad thing. The only problem I have is that after wearing them for awhile your ears start to hurt, the cushion in the headphones is comfortable but if you have normal to big ears the rims of the headphones tend to grind into them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much","review":"You get what you pay for.

Not because of its style (at least not for me), but for its incredible picture quality. It is flawless for viewing DVDs and playing video games - enough said. One concern I had before I bought it was the glare. In the stores there is a glare. However, this has not been a problem for me. The only time I can see a glare or reflection is when the screen in completely black - which is never the case when I'm using it. I have no complaints, but will echo that fact that the base is stiff. But this is of no real concern unless you plan on moving or tilting your monitor frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Monitor","review":"This is the best LCD monitor I have seen at this price. It is bright, crisp, and the colors are very accurate after a little calibration. The contrast is also very good. The monitor is very clean looking and extremely futuristic looking. The response time is excellent and I had no problems with ghosting on either movies or games.The images seem to pop off the screen with splendid realisim. The only drawbacks I see are the 1 year warranty, and it would be nice if the base swiveled. If you can live with these two minor drawbacks go for it because you simply won't find a better display under $600.00."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beats the competition","review":"I looked long and hard at Sony, Samsung and Envision monitors before I bought this, and I have been very satisfied with my purchase.

The collections were a perfect blend of ambient mood and beautiful sounds that REALLY sounded like a secular holiday moment. I was convinced they would be the new sound track of the Holiday's.

And I would say it will probably take many more listenings for you to get completely sick of it, compared with the more saccharin options on the market. It is a lovely collection, diverse enough to make it interesting through-out, not at all repetitive. At the same time a quiet mood is maintained and each track follows easily upon the one before. One other thing I like about it is that we've gotten many years of use out of it--our oldest son (he's 7) has heard it since he was a baby and still enjoys hearing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best lullaby CD I've heard","review":"I received this CD as a gift when I was expecting my son without even realizing what a treasure it is.

I had never seen one before. We started using it when he was about 7 months old and it is fantastic! It is so cushy that it covers the whole high chair or shopping cart seat and he can lean his head on it if he's tired. It has a strap that you attach to the cart or chair and then buckle around the baby. It has a little pocket and it has loops so you can attach toys. It then folds into itself to make a bag with handles. I feel so great having him sit on this because it protects him from touching all the germs and he's comfortable. I read a review that said that you can't put it on with one hand (while you're holding the baby). That is definitely true, but I've been able to work around that.

Germs can go through cloth once it is wet from saliva. Then this material has been rubbed all over the cart and then I put it in my car etc. I just don't see the difference in that and not using it. My hands touch it, baby's hands touch it etc. I have enough to keep track of with a bag, baby, wallet, cell phone....I just dont have enough to keep track of a giagantic piece of material! My grocery store has those sanitary wipes outside the store by the carts and I wipe down the handle bar....that is far more effective against germs.

Do yourself a favor, at least look at Chubby Seats before buying any other cart cover out there!chubbyseats"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing you could buy for the baby and you!!","review":"I bought the first floppy seat when my son, Gabriel, was just barely sitting up. The infant carrier was bulky and heavy. I found this to be a big help. It's easy to take along because it folds up nicely. It's great because when I put Gabe in the carraige, I don't have to worry about the hard metal or all the germs! It also keeps my hands off the cart so I can get him snacks, hand him his Binky with out worring about washing my hands every 5 seconds. I now have the newer one (blue) with rings on it for Binky clips, toys or anything really. I keep the new one in my car, the older one stays in my husbands car. I also keep at Grammie's house for when Gabe and Grammie go out. This has served as a pillow and a rain shield on many occasions too. I just think this is the most wonderful thing for everyone!

He is a BIG baby (18lbs! 10.5 at birth!) and I am already using a car seat that stays stationary in the car. I bought the Floppy Seat hoping the extra padding would help my little boy. He loves being able to sit up and see what is happening around him. There are lots of loops that I hook rings and toys to, and a pocket for his pacifier. The belt holds him up under his arms and he seems to be quite comfortable. Actually, he used to cry while in his car seat at the grocery store, Wal-Mart, etc. Now he seems more content. If anyone is in the same \\"big baby\\" situation that I am in, I definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for every baby!","review":"This is the best thing ever created to protect your baby against all those nasty germs found in shopping carts.I am asked all the time at the grocery store where I got this.In restaurants parents that have their child sitting on the high chair without it, always ask me where I got it, and feel bad that they have their baby without it.

It is the absolute best."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cover not very practical","review":"I bought this floppy after reading lots of good reviews about it and I definetely wanted something to cover both shopping cart and high chair. After using it numerous times, I decided I don't like it very much. Yes, it's great to have this to cover and it's a two-in-one. However, I find it way too bulky for normal restaurant high chairs. I always have a hard time putting in on the chair and then trying to get the baby in. And since it's so bulky it doesn't stay in place well at all until the baby sits in it. Then there is no way to put this on either high chair or shopping cart with one hand. So I always have to put the baby down.In the end I wish I would have bought two covers, one for the high chair and one for the shopping cart. Now, I will just buy one for the chair, and use this one just for the shopping cart (since I already paid for it).So I would not recommend this cover if it's to be used for chairs and carts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest $40 I have ever spent!!!","review":"I cannot tell you how long this saved my little boy from catching one of every sickness, circulating out there! This is the greatest investment in the world. EVERYONE needs one of these.

My little one even slept in the cart a couple of times, when he was tired and we were out. The cover is very cushiony, washes well, and has nice little storage pockets for snacks, toys, bottles.....etc. Another nice feature is that there are little places to hook on your child's favorite car seat/ stroller toys.

I was made to pay shpping on something that was not even my fault. About a month later I received a replacement. It was ok for about a week until I washed it (on the gentle cycle) & the colors on that one bled together. When I called the company about this problem with the colors running together they were extremely RUDE and unwilling to help me.I have totaly wasted my hard earned money.

However, I didn't really like it because it's too big and cumbersome. The leg holes are too big and it leaves a lot of the cart exposed there, which of course is where my daughter wants to touch. This defeats the purpose of the cover. Also, it is very cumbersome and takes two hands to get it on the cart and forget about putting it in the bag unless your hands are totally free. I tried it in 3 different shopping carts and while it fit it left a lot of cart exposed through the leg holes. Needless to say I returned mine and got a Buggy Bagg instead. That thing is great. My daughter fell asleep today in the grocery store in it! It's so easy to use and fold up too. It is more expensive but totally worth the money. My advice would be to do your research before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the Best!","review":"This gives 100% coverage - even covers all of the big costco cart.

A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Floppy Seat Cover","review":"I am very pleased to have purchased this item. It is all that the manufacturer said it would be. However, if I had to say anything negative about it is that it is a bit troublesome to try and unfold it or put into place in the shopping cart or high chair while still holding my baby. I also find it difficult to fold it back up after removing the child. Juggling the child/infant in one hand and gathering it from the shopping cart or high chair with the other, and getting keys ready seems a bit challenging but I have gotten better with time. I now wait until I get back to the car to fold it back up, or just leave it unpacked until the next use. I am glad I bought it, helping to protect against germs is reason enough to purchase it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best for the money","review":"I received the floppy seat for my baby shower and thought it was going to be great. The concept is great but considering the cost of this item, I was disappointed. This cover does cover the entire cart, and has two toy loops, but that's it. For nearly $[...], I expected some bells and whistles. Almost immediately I started looking around for a replacement. Thankfully I found an alternative online [...]and for the same cost mine came with custom fabric that covers even the largest cart, extra thick batting, pillow, two toy loops, buckle, pocket up front so I could hide little treats for my 7 month old to help keep him busy, and a pocket out of his reach to put my keys, coupons, etc. All of which folds up nicely in itself with the a strap so I can throw it over my shoulder and go! My advice is to look thoroughly before wasting money on this simplistic version."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO CONVENIENT:(","review":"I just bought this floppy seat cover today and realized it would be impossible to hold your baby and try to put the cover on the cart at the same time.

The only complaint is that the pattern is not even (as far as dark print/light print) all the way around the plate--it looks like the pattern was applied darker on one side than the other. (I hear that alot about corelle-inconsistent coloring). I got this set to interchange with my French Lilac (which are gorgeous) and the red Classic Touch (red flowers).

The historical side of Christianity is one you rarely hear mentioned within the modern church.

Some of the author's statements are purely contradictory to all accepted Christian doctrine, thus throwing doubt onto other claims made by the author. At the same time the author never allows himself to entertain any commonly believed Christian views, further displaying his bias. I would not recommend this book because of the repeated failures to equally evaluate all potential views."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knocks your zapatos off musica from an old pro.","review":"I confess. I have no idea why I love this CD. It has nothing to do with anything else I listen to. But after hearing a cut of \\"Every little thing...\\" on the radio, I just had to get it. In fact, I sat in the car outside of work (already late on arrival) so I could hear it out. This is one of those albums that suffers from the pigeon-holing of American radio stations, so kudos to the few, electic stations that have figured out they can air it. Give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me dance!","review":"This is the best CD I've purchased in the last 3 years. Without a doubt. Raul Malo has a wonderful voice, and the songs are diverse and interesting -- ranging from slow and mellow to wild salsa. There is no way you can listen to this CD and sit in your chair. It just MAKES you dance. I highly recommend this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare Limited Edition Version With Bonus Disc","review":"This special edition was only available from a specific retailer when first released. It features a bonus CD with 2 extra songs not available elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Latin for my tastes","review":"I agree with the reviewer that called this a \\"daring\\" compilation. Mainstream fans of Mr. Malo's, like myself, who enjoy the Mavericks, may not appreciate this CD. Although I like the Mavericks music, which is sprinkled with Latin influences, the \\"Today\\" CD is just too much for me. I would urge people to download the samples before buying, as I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great band","review":"Raul Malo was recommended by WXPN. I had heard some of his work with the Mavericks and loved his version of Downbound Train on the Nebraska cover album. This is very listenable world music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fusion of Cuban Beats, 60s Anglo Pop, and That Voice","review":"It would be a mistake to call this Raul Malo's Latin Album, because it's not just about that. The frontman for the Mavericks turns out a solo effort that mixes American pop of both the 60s and standards eras with Cuban music, and the result is an album as varied as Malo's impressive vocal capabilities. The title track jolts you with blaring horns and an infectious, raucous beat. \\"Ya Tu Veras\\" is both lively and relaxed, \\"De Ti Me Olvidare\\" brings it down with slow soulfulness, and Latin rhythm underpins other tracks like \\"Every Little Thing About You.\\" On the other hand, Malo can sing standard/lounge tradition buttery smooth, as in the wonderful duet \\"Takes Two to Tango\\" with Shelby Lynne, and \\"Are We Almost There\\" ranks up there with his best Mavericks ballad moments. If you love marvelous voices or music with a Latin beat, go get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"muy bueno, raul!!","review":"another great showcase of Malo's smooth and powerful voice...i love the way he continues to blend classics with more contemporary choices. a great addition to anyone's collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Blend","review":"This is a delicious dish that blends many flavors. I love the Latin feeling of the brass, piano, vocals, and percussion. It does also remind me of Roy Orbison and Chris Izaak. His voice is so deep and gorgeous. I also love the guitar and flute riffs. But what holds it all together are the rythms. When I put this in I don't want to turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"more more more","review":"A very daring album. Mr. Malo has wrapped himself up with a great band and first rate material that crosses genres effortlessly.A model example of what a talented and creative person can do when freed from the constraints of major labels."},{"rating":"2","title":"A breath of fresh air!","review":"I heard \\"Every Little Thing About You\\" on my community radio station in Tampa this morning and could NOT wait to get this CD tonight. It is lovely, rich, captivating, fun, fresh. Support your community radio stations, people. No one else plays stuff like this. Now if I could only go buy my \\"two\\" so I could tango! Thanks, Raul, for putting out something we don't already hear a million times a day, every day. Completely different from Gloria Estefan's Cuban music CDs, but just as artful and engaging. More Cuban music, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raul Malo's New Songs Aren't Good","review":"I think Raul Malo has an absolutely terrific voice. However, this album doesn't do him justice, and as much as I like his voice and previous works with the Mavericks, I wouldn't buy this album. He needs a better song writer and musical arranger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in songs and voice","review":"I really expected great things from this man. Since we'd been waiting for a solo album since 1996.Unfortunately, except for a couple of the spanish songs, the CD is a major disappointment.Where is that wonderful, awe-inspiring voice we heard in the past?I dont think I'd buy another of his solo work. But heck, the mavericks have reunited. maybe we'll get something of \\"Cryin Shame\\" quality out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot stuff!","review":"\\"Are We Almost There?\\" is the incendiary make-out song of the year; roll over Roy Orbison and tell Chris Isaak the news! The rest is fine as well, with Malo bringing a wonderful sense of invention to this Tex-Mex mix-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Latin Takeover","review":"\\"Today\\" really picks up where Los Super Seven's Canto takesoff. Not quite as good as that disk, but pretty close."},{"rating":"1","title":"remix is not a remix---just added rap","review":"Well, I saw the alternate video for Get Right featuring Fabolous, and the song is actually REMIXED. This is not the remix. this is the same version as the second version available on the full Rebirth album, with Fabolous rapping on the original mix. And every other mix on this single I already have--that was a nice waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get Right","review":"It definitely can be so outrageous for manufactured acts to really try to chart up again. For Jennifer Lopez, that isn't a good sign. After her lackluster This Is Me.. Then, she hasn't found any way of touring, and performing on stage to prove you are a credible singer again. Her lastest single, Get Right, from her upcoming album Rebirth, really doesn't have a lot of beat in it. The beat outshines Jennifer's voice, which is very rare, but still not very well put. Sadly, this isn't a very good song, and for somebody like Jennifer Lopez, it is time to start touring for your music, and prove you can sing your heart out.Song: D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Large battery everyone should own","review":"If you own the Everio HDD camcorder you really need the large battery because you can shoot for a long time which is one of the benefits of a hard disk drive recorder.This battery worked great and I expect it will for a long time to come.

Highly recommend this for teachers and parents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, very good!!","review":"I liked this book very, very much. It leads you through David's whole entire life, not leaving out a detail, in my opinion. It's a wonderful source of information, and even has a place for interviews and comic strips. It gives you a list of all the summaries of The X-Files episodes in the first three seasons, which is very, very cool. It also tells you the plot of every sigle movie David has been in. If you want to know more about David Duchovny; actually getting to KNOW him better, I highly suggest that you buy and read this book. It has some really nice pictures in it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Highland Dram","review":"I enjoyed this good highland drama so far.The plots have been intreasting, and there is always romance.So far so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"My husband and I found this series a few years ago and fell in love with it.

Highly recommended for those who just can't seem to get enough of Britain's programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe me, skip this one","review":"I watched series 3 very soon after greatly enjoying the first two series. Disappointment is the only word for my reaction, and I'm trying to imagine why so many reviewers liked it. Only the beautiful scenery and Molly are there to recommend \\"3\\". It is as if all the humor and energy of the other main characters had been drained. Plots got very serious (new writers, surely), and the addition of the new bank character added gloom (she seemed to be in some psychological drama, not \\"Monarch\\"!). Romance in these episodes is unconvincing, and, after the tragedy at the end, there is no mention or appearance of the daughter and grandchild or other key characters in the first two series -- unforgivable! If you loved the first two seasons, as I did, then remember them fondly and let them stand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it - what happened to Katrina.","review":"I loved Seasons 1 and 2 - absolutely loved them. BUT, after waiting for two season to see Archie and Katrina finally get together and then have her, out of the blue, leave the show was too much. What the hell was that all about. All of a sudden she gets this dream job offer that we've never heard of and she's gone. No farewells, no goodbye party, nothing. It's almost as if she never existed. Certainly none of the characters seems to care. Yet we are supposed to believe that she loved Archie and Glenbogle? Bah, humbug. Actually, to be fair, I only watched the first episode. When I realized that she had been written out of the show I didn't watch, nor will I watch any more episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It.....so disappointing after the first two series!","review":"My husband and I couldn't wait to get Series Three.

US information contains many errors in the first edition. Example: Mount Pony Currency Vault for \\"North\\" of the Mississippi, should be \\"East\\" (the Mississippi flows North to South). The book is also full of the author anti-commentary, rather than descriptive analysis of the preparations. Does however have a map of Raven Rock which is rare to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Secret Bunkers","review":"This book is an excellent addition for the library of anyone interested in cold war facilities, radar and communication systems.

As such, the book is a must for anyone in education seeking to motivate students in the study of light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep feelings put into verse","review":"The title captures the essence of this book. Ronnie has put into verse the feelings that many of us have had throughout life, sincere emotional feelings. I highly recommend this book, even for those who do not normally read poetry.

Definitely a book you will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for your average 'Dummy'","review":"I'm not sure why someone who already knows SQL would want to use a \\"Dummies\\" book. If 'SQL for Dummies' is indeed meant for the average \\"Dummy\\" then it skips the most important aspect of this series - catering to someone who knows little or nothing about the topic.The jokes are not funny - and concentrating on the badly written text becomes increasingly difficult. The author does a poor job of introducing the SQL code and what each function does. He doesn't teach at all - which is what he should be doing.For a great introduction to SQL, try Judith Bowman's 'The Practical SQL Handbook'. It is a far superior text - an easier read, insightful, helpful, and most of all - it teaches a novice the ins and outs of complex databases and coding in SQL for the REAL world. 'SQL for Dummies', however, does not fit in with the 'Dummies' series. If that's why you want this book, then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was an excellent SQL primer","review":"I spent a lot of time looking for a book that actually covered ANSI 92 SQL, and even though I vowed a long time ago to never buy a 'Dummies' book, this one was an exception and worth every penny spent! My database du-jour (Oracle RDB) is not a particularly well known or used database and with the help of Mr. Taylor I was able to create some very complicated embedded SQL statements, allowing my client to make some pretty important multi-million dollar decisions.

Obviously, no one told the author. Taylor writes to the level of persons already familiar with SQL basics, and more complex programming languages. I had to look up definitions for his definitions.

I bought one of these and the clock stopped working within just a few days. I exchanged it for another one and the clock would not display after only a few hours. This is obviously not a fluke - but a major, recurring problem with the product. Also as others have noted, if you want a decent-sounding docking station that will charge your Ipod and if you can find it on super-sale, this is okay. Definitely not worth more than $25, compared to other, similar products. The positive features are that it's small and easy to move around and really does sound okay for its size.

Why did I put all together? Because once we know God's 'correct' Plan than we can have 'realistic' hope for life and therefore we can have realistic hope. Realistic hope helps us to pray realisticly. Realistic prayer helps us to understand God's Will and therefore we can have realistic submission, obeying God and His Word. This is a foundational book that everyone needs to know if they care about Spiritual Life. I think this book is capable of creating a right spiritual atmoshpere where true spiritualty can grow.

First off, the mounting screws that came with it have small threads and don't look the greatest, and considering I went over the weight limit I made some adjustments, I drilled out the mount holes a little bigger to fit in some pretty massive screws I put into it. They're huge, I weigh 150 pounds, I hung onto the mount before putting the tv up with all my body weight hanging off if it and it didn't flex or budge in any way LOL.

The weight of the TV makes the mount tilt so this is very important.Also note that the vesa mount side is not centered over the wall bracket but is actually offset to one side by 2-3 inches.

It is VERY sturdy - solid to the wall if you will - and glides to and from the wall without any issues at all.

It's small and lightweight yet heavy duty enough to securely handle a small TV. I do agree with the other reviews that having a rotational adjustment would be nice. However I did ensure that it was hung level on the wall and didn't have any issues. Further there is a little play in the holes to mount the TV so you can achieve the same thing by loosening all of these screws a half of a turn and then \\"rotating\\" the TV to where you desire and tightening them down again.

This is the EASIEST install I have ever had to deal with in my life. I feel like I'm a tech in NORAD now with a second monitor. I had to get this cause the monitor I wanted was too big for my desk, but with this it looks like it's floating and I love the fact that it retracts nicely to the wall parallel to a painting. Plus, the tilt and moving and all that is smooth. You have to use the Allen wrench included to get the right tightness and it's fairly accurate, whatever that means. I used it with Acer V223W EJBD 22-Inch Wide LCD Display from Amazon, too. Is it inappropriate if I mention a different item in this review?

Oh by the way, throw away the wall mounting screws that it comes with and get something a little beefier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed","review":"The monitor mount had a joint that is meant for tilting the screen forwards or backwards. This joint is very loose and wobbly, even though it's tightened all the way, and causes the screen to tilt left and right and be crooked.When the whole arm is extended, the screen rests tilted to one direction so its obviously not level, and when the arm is retracted the screen rests tilted to the other direction and also obviously not level. This also makes it so you can't adjust the screws holding it to the wall to fix the tilt either way."},{"rating":"2","title":"It would have 5 stars if...","review":"Once up this unit is excellent... very sturdy and smooth. Great product for the price (competes with monoprice, but Prime is IT).I give 4 stars due to the tricky install.

I also recommend finding a stud and using high quality wood screws - I would never expect a drywall anchor to support a TV or monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Swivel, but if you are careful....","review":"Note there is no swivel (rotation) adjustment. If you think you won't need it, better be careful installing it. My walls are straight, but evidently not perfectly plumb. I measured to get the screws as much in the middle of the studs as I could and it left a slight tilt in the screen. Reinstalling with a level corrected the problem, but have you ever tried to remount something with a new screw hole that shares the original hole? A lot more work than it should have been...If you install carefully, no problems. If there is any doubt, get a bracket that swivels too.Otherwise good bracket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product - Great price","review":"The only negative for this product is the lack of a way to level it after installation.

The metal is sturdy and it was very easy to put up. I paired it with a 22 inch Vizio flat screen and you can completely pull it out and turn it perpendicular to the wall where it is mounted, and the tilt helps (I have it up for watching on the elliptical, so it's high; but the tilt means I can also watch from my office desk.)It comes with an anchor for Sheetrock, but I would really recommend mounting it to the stud!

I took off the monitor and experimented with the mounting plate it - regardless of how tight the screws are I can bend the mounting plate back with a moderate amount of hand pressure.

Very poor quality construction.","review":"This mount looked like the perfect mount. It has lots of good features and pivots in all directions. The problem is poor construction quality. The first thing I noticed after mounting it was that the TV was very wobbly. I have mounted many flat screen TVs with other brackets and never had one wobble like this. I traced the movement to the pivot screw that holds the mounting plate to the arm. When I tried to tighten it the screw stripped out. When you consider that I was using the enclosed hex wrench that is only 3 1/2 inches long, how could I have applied excess force to it? Then, about a week later I noticed the top piece on the arm was broken completely off so the TV was hanging by only the screw. So the bracket is now in the garbage. This bracket is rated for 33 lbs. The TV I mounted to it weighs 19 lbs, well within the limit. So it wasn't a case of product abuse. Save yourself money and headaches and buy something else because this thing is junk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money. Save with this product!!!","review":"I am very happy with this product.

I carefully measured and used a level to mount the swing arm on the wall, but when I hung the TV, the position of the arms and the small amount of \\"give\\" between the arm segments caused the TV to hang at a slight, but noticable, angle. You can tighten the arm segment joints, which helps the problem somewhat, but you won't be able to swing the arm around once tightened. The swivel adjustments only allow you to change the side-to-side angle and the vertical tilt, there is no way to fix the rotation of the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Install and Use","review":"I bought this product to mount a flat screen computer monitor to the wall. It installed easily and works great. You can pull the monitor out from the wall and adjust the swivel (for instance, parallel to wall or at an angle. If you need something you can adjust for different height users, then be aware that this under $30 unit does not adjust for height; you pick the height and that's the height it will be.

So I really have mine installed horizonally versus vertically. I screwed the bracket to the top of what would be my closet and I have the arm hanging down over the top of the wall. This way I wasn't drilling big holes in the side of the wall and the only negative of this installation is that the tv cannot be rotated from right to left (which didn't matter in my case). There is quite a bit of up/down play in this installation method. Thankfully the four mounting holes are symetrically square so you can rotate the mount around and use it in any direction.It was difficult finding a mount with this capability in the stores for less than $50 so I would say this was a steal.Per previous review recommendations, I used my own screws as I didn't want to mess with \\"pewter-like screws that strip\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"This is great for a small TV, but make sure you install it on a wall beam.

I'm using this on a boat and would of like to be able to adjust and lock the arm in a certain position but can't. Maybe I got a defective one? I will have to add some kind of strap so it doesn't slam back and forth over waves.

I am thinking of putting super glue on the latest one to make it stick.

They are garbage. The only reason I gave them a one star rating is due to the fact that there is nothing lower.

I had to remove the little pieces with a pair of tweezers. I made the mistake of buying four of these to have on hand. I ended up throwing them away and buying a factory Garmin mount from Garmin. I should have realized that the price was too cheap for them to be any count. If you purchase these after reading my review then you deserve what you get.

I purchased this suction cup mount after the original that came with my Nuvi 250 broke where the rubber meets the hard plastic at the base. It worked well for a month or so, almost too well. The suction was very strong (mounted on the dashboard disk that was included with my Nuvi) and recently, when I tried to engage the suction, the plastic lever in the back snapped off. I would probably have rated this item with 1 star had I not still had my old mount and could replace the lever from that one. Overall, not good. I bought this mount because everywhere else I looked, the prices seemed too high for a plastic mount... but as I have read in many reviews on Amazon: you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best history book available on the 911","review":"The author really knows these cars. He's owned them, driven them, and even raced them for the factory.There's a huge amount of technical information, but its presented in a informative and well-written way. The chapter on engine development is worth the price of the book alone; every design change is described and explained.Perhaps the only critisism is that Paul Frere likes the 911 too much. The disasterious self-leveling suspension episode isn't really mentioned, nor are the many problems that have occured with the 2.7 litre cars in the hotter climates of the USA.Overall this is a great book; if you have any technical interest at all 911s, this is the book to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"911 history from the Guru","review":"No living automotive author can match the elegance and technical depth of Paul Frere's writing. Accordingly, only Frere could produce such a book as this, dense with minute technical detail, yet balanced with a broad view of how Porsche designed, raced, and evolved the 911.The look on Frere's face as he sits in his own Carrera (in the color photograph section of the book) says it all: the 911 is a singular automobile, and this is the author to tell its story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Porsche Geek Guide","review":"Its simple. No one knows more about Porsche's that Frere. This book is incredible rich in detail and a great resource. Its not like the other books, which might look good on a coffee table but lack substance. This is THE book for Porsche. Make no mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing organization of book","review":"The information in this book is detailed and extensive. However I prefer a model by model organization of material but instead the author has chosen to organize by Engine, Transmission, Body, etc. This make the material really hard to use when you are trying to compare a car of a particular year with another. You are constantly switching between chapters of Engine, Transmission, etc. I also was disappointed by the sparse use of photographs. This books looks like it started out a long time ago and has been added to through the years without rethinking the layout of the information.By contrast, the book on the Porsche Boxster by the same author has a much better organization by chronlogical introduction of the different models. Within each chapter are the details on changes to the engine, transmission, body, etc. The pictures are also much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives the story but when did it happen?","review":"I had a hard time finding dates for each change in design. Why not say that the last air cooled porsche was made in 1995 when the body change occurred in 1994? All the book says is with the such and such model came the model such and such transmission. When? Dates are lacking but a good detailed accounting of the changes to Porsche 911."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again just another boring 911 book","review":"For those seeking references and technical data on their 911, skip this book.

It is so dissapointing- a huge departure from their previous work. While still very inventive, they apply their looped cut-up technique to vocal samples, in an artless way.Innovative? Yes.Groundbreaking? Yes.Painful? Yes.Listenable? No.It's just poorly done, and most of MOM's fans agree. If you are new to Mouse On Mars, I'd reccomend Iaora Tahiti, Autoditacker, Idiology or Vulvaland over this.

This one though, tasted pretty awful. Not like cookie dough, and not like peanut butter. More like I would expect silly putty to taste, like chemical treated plastic. I had two and tried giving the rest of them away to people at my gym. Everyone took one, no one came back for a second. I'd say they failed the taste test.If you're looking for peanut butter flavors, go withMet-Rx Big Colossal Peanut-Butter Pretzel Bar, 3.52 oz.

Maybe they just spoiled my taste buds for anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste pretty good with high protein content","review":"These are pretty good, considering they don't have any chocolate covering or other hidden fat in them.

I bought a compilation called Gothic Rock 2 on a whim when I was 16 years old at an underground record store I always shop at. Most of the bands that were on the two disc Goth Compilation was a nice introduction to the early goth sound. Out of all the bands that appeared The Bolshoi caught my attention. The name really stuck out for me and I was completely hooked by the song \\"Away\\" I thought it was an amazing song. For a few years I looked all over for there CD's but all I came across was the greatest hits. I was fortunate enough to purchase this album online. It's amazing and I love it. It's a shame not many people are familiar with The Bolshoi. Hopefully someone else will be lucky enough to stumble across this great band as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Minutely detailed, yet highly readable","review":"For a book on a fairly obscure topic, this is excellently organized and written. The author clearly has had intimate experience with minute aspects of many a tropo-link project, and he has been able to refine and crystallize his thoughts into this beautifully linear presentation.The only problem with Roda's \\"Troposcatter\\" is that it is a bit dated. He makes statements implying that bit-rates are limited due to the troposphere's Doppler spread and multi-path; in reality both these parameters of the troposphere are far less challenging than the corresponding parameters for a cell-phone channel. Clearly the book was written before the acronyms OFDM, LDPC and MIMO entered the communication engineer's parlance. So discount whatever Roda has to say about digital tropo-links."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"The \\"om nama shivaya\\" chant is great, but there is a flute solo intertwined with it that sounds like a jazz piece -- and is totally disruptive for me, completely breaks the meditative mood.

But the bulbs supplied are too wide and short for all but one house (I have over 20 houses, so this seems strange to me). The light bulbs that came with each house were a bit narrower and the base of each was taller to reach inside the house. It just seems that an expensive dept 56 product like this should more consistently fit dept 56 houses. It is all but useless to me. I gave it 2 stars because it did work with the 3 accessory items.

I have a balance scale, a digital scale, all the normal gear. But this is a system that was used way back in the day of black powder. It is a set of \\"dippers\\" with a sliding scale reminiscent of a slide rule. If you are too young to know what that was, google slide rule and pick \\"images.\\" The set doesn't cost a lot, and I think a person is wise to have a primary and two distinct backups for everything. My only real concern is that the sliding scale which tells you what dipper to use for what powder is cardboard, and won't last forever in the event you have to use it and do a lot of reloading. I am going to try to buy a second one from Lee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, reliable, accurate.","review":"Like other reviewers said, these dippers are great! Really easy to measure the powder charge you need. Consistency is easy, and no need to worry about any double or over charges. Some in between size dippers would be nice like others said, but I haven't ever really needed it. If there's something I need that this doesn't have I'll just use a brass case filed down to the correct charge.

Not signed to any current record label, traveling in a van instead of a bus, and playing small clubs may seem to some people as \\"amateur\\", while in fact he is one of the most unique artists of this generation.

Personally I love everything that Tim does. This cd is very good. Half is pure solo acoustic guitar while the other half uses effects and over-dubs. I highly recomend any Tim Reynolds cd to anyone because I truely consider him to be one of this worlds top musicians. For those of you looking for songs you may have heard played on \\"Dave and Tim shows\\" This cd has a few that were played on the 1999 tour.

I have been fortunate enough to see him live 3 times, and this album brings across the depth of his playing.

No grand slam footage or even matches with any quality opponents were showed.

I am desparate for a good historical novel that I can read and not want to vomit afterward but this is not it.

It was especially disappointing because I've had really good luck with Oprah's Book Club books.It just went on and on and on and felt like a Renaissance Faire version of the 12th century. Everyone was perfectly set up in their little roles and had all the proper costumes and speech, but it just felt so fake, and like Ken Follett learned everything about that time from reading poorly written fiction and going to Renaissance Faires.

More than disappointed, I was stunned. It seemed more like the work of a talented high school student. The book was actually goofy at times.The characters themselves have the depth of George Lucas creations. The plot connections between characters are clumsy, like a bad first attempt at Dicken's novel. The acts of cruelty wear the trappings of historical realism, but they are coupled with such juvenile inner dialogs that they are clearly there just to titilate the reader.Finally, you need the patience of a monk to tolerate the pace. Lovers of historical fiction are not afraid of long books. But unfortunately, the author and editor (if there was one) seemed to feel that the genre and audience relieved them of any responsibility to be disciplined and make choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre Obsession","review":"There is actually a lot that I like about the book - the characters, the sense of history, the twists of life that I think reflect what does happen in this world.

I actually pass over these parts now because they are so offensive and are so unnecessarily detailed in description that I get a sense that the author is enjoying himself. I feel almost like an unwilling witness that is forced to watch the painful acts. It gives me the creeps. I will finish the book - I am almost done. But I will skip the sequel. It's a bizarre feeling. The book would be so much better without the violent sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I started reading Ken Follett when I was in High school, which I had to for a project. I fell in love with the book - Flight over water. And I started reading more of his books. I got this one way before it was on Oprah's book club, and I loved it! He is such a great writer. I enjoy his eariler stuff, and more historical stuff. I read all his newer books (family gifts once they knew I liked him). But I have a love for this one! I sent it on to other members of the family to read, and my old copy is read well! I'm looking forward to the time to read it again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, a Must Read","review":"It took me 2 weeks to read it, but it was a great book. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent read...","review":"This book is a real page turner.

Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"About Ambitions, Dreams, and Hopes.","review":"Every once in a while, perhaps by chance, perhaps by skill, an artist is able to capture and present the elusive elements of human nature. This is such an occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"Follett does it again with a large cast of characters each complete with their virtues and vices, doing what they know how to do, living what they learned and occ. rising above or sinking below. Generations emerge weaving the tale, wearing the legacy of their pasts, breaking our hearts, raising a cheer. Follett pulls you into each of them. A don't miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time top five","review":"This is a compelling masterpiece. A true epic with complex characters and a unique theme. The twelfth century backdrop sets the stage for the Magna Carta shortly after the books conclusion. Amid a fast paced story is much food for thought concerning the separation of church and state and each organization's strengths and weaknesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I've never reviewed a book before, but I felt compelled to have my say about this one. I read a lot, and love some books, like some books but rarely do I really Hate a book. This is the one! I usually donate books after I read them to the library but this one I threw in the trash (recyclable of course). Imagine my disbelief when I heard there was a sequel! This book was the most over-the-top, excruciatingly boring, unbelievable book I've ever read. I knew I was in trouble when Tom's wife dies in childbirth and within hours he's having sex with a stranger with whom he's professing undying love. You all know the plot so I won't go on with it, but really it was bad. I couldn't even finish it. And I loved Eye of the Needle & On Wings of Eagles, what happened Ken Follet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"Simply one of the greatest books in modern literature. I read books by Tolstoy, Hugo, Dumas, and Dickens. Pillars of the earth is up there with them in entertainment value. Characters like Jack are developed so well it is as if I know them personally. The story follows that of a tragedy, however it is uplifting in some parts. It follows the lives of peasants, middle class, and nobility. Pillars is remarkably unpredictable! Characters react in ways I wouldn't expect; children grow up to be people I could not expect; and the story is fantastic! Please read this masterpiece. I like fantasy, and this gives me that element, but it also gives me the development of characters that I have been seeking. There is not a more entertaining book that I have read! Extraordinary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worthy of tv drama","review":"I couldn't believe how uncreative this story was. After hearing gushing praise from you know who I expected something better...much better. I found this story boring and predictable. I'm offended when an author can't create drama in a female story line other than repeatedly raping her. It doesn't pass as depth, drama or creative...and it doesn't get a free pass from this reader. Don't bother waiting for it to get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't see the dedication to William Golding ..","review":"The central plot of The Pillars of Earth is eerily similar to William Golding's riveting 1964 novel \\"The Spire\\" - fittingly described by an Amazon reviewer as \\"One of the finest novels in the English canon\\". I recommend you go with the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls you into 12th century life, despite its flaws","review":"I've never much enjoyed Ken Follett's books. What drew my attention to this in the bookstore was the title and the synopsis on the back cover. Based on my previous encounters with Follett's books, I put it back and moved on. Nevertheless, I was drawn back to the story, and bought it for the story.The writing is not great. The level of detail is jumpy, the characters cliched, and the sexual content is completely unnecessary. I *do*, however, recommend this book for its ability to simultaneously entertain and educate the reader by pulling you into 12th centurty life. It's so easy to look back in ignorance and misjudge those times. I don't know how historically accurate this book is, but it causes makes the reader to rethink assumptions about life in the 12th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, cliched, repetitive","review":"This book was terrible! What is the matter with all these people who think it's so great? I almost quit reading it a couple times because the plot was so tedious and repetitive and when I did finish, I felt like I'd wasted a big chunk of time on a massive piece of fluff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"an epic disappointment","review":"Several people had told me that this was one of the best and most fascinating novels that they had read, so I decided to give it a try and I was severely disappointed. Both the characters and plot were underdeveloped. The one positive aspect of the book was the description of the architecture. It was the one thing the author got right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts off well and just goes down hill","review":"The writing and storyline started out very strong but continued to go down hill as the novel progressed. It seemed as though the author lost interest in his own story and was just trying to meet his deadline.

Despite finishing the book, I developed little interest at any point in what happened to the principal characters. A real waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"This book succeeds as a supermarket checkout pulp fiction page turner but fails utterly as literature. I did read it in a few days and didn't want to put it down. However, the writing is almost childish and the characters are frustratingly two dimensional. The story is decent but some of the plot lines are so sophmoric I had to laugh out loud at times. There is no deep meaning to the book, it has no texture and reads like a children's fairytale. If you like your characters to be either pure good or pure evil then you will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"This book is a prolonged mess of words. There are too many undeveloped characters, a meandering plot, and an inappropriate amount of lewd content. Let's just say that the book could've been very enjoyable if it was 10-15 pages long--it didn't require a 1000. I know I'm in the minority in the rating of this novel, but it has no literary merit and was a complete and utter waste of my time.

The audio book would have been a nice touch, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"The story of the building of a cathedral in about the 12th century. Although the subject sounded dry and it took me a while to commit to reading, it was hard to put down. What I would consider to be a realistic look at life in difficult times while being inspirational. Well written, as Ken Follett does."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillars of the Earth","review":"This book is unlike any which Follett wrote and will totally enrapt the reader. It appears that Follett did great research in the architecture of cathedrals in ancient times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Basic Mid-life Crisis Male Beach Read","review":"I'm in complete agreement with J. Leonard -- this is obviously targeted at 40+ males who want a little vicarious rape n' murder in their summer entertainment. When the male protagonist, moderately-pregnant wife and two kids in tow, meets up with the golden-eyed witchy woman early on in the book, I KNEW that within a couple of chapters, the aformentioned wife would be out of the way (all together, now -- \\"Death by Childbirth\\"), and the protagonist and Witchy Woman would be ecstatically copulating. Feh.You want a thought-provoking historical novel? Read \\"Galileo's Daughter.\\" Leave Follett for the subliterates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must be an acquired taste","review":"A friend recommended this book as a good introduction to Follett's writing. Rarely do I put a book down without finishing it, so at least I can say this book was unusual. Although I would never discourage someone from trying a new author (we all have different tastes), I would warn a new reader that the writing style is thick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IQ","review":"There's nothing more to be said that hasn't already been mentioned by some of the more intelligent reviewers below.

I can't even loan it to a friend now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Pillars of the Earth is the best book I've ever read. I am an avid reader, but this one stands out among the hundreds of books that I have had the pleasure of consuming. The characters are vivid and alive. This is the first book I've read where I absolutely hate one of the characters. I highly recommend this book. Please, do not let it's many pages deter you. It is well worth every page!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Length of book a bit daunting but a compelling historical novel","review":"I've been wanting to read this for some time now but the length of it is rather daunting. This is a complex and engaging historical novel which spans 50 years or so in medieval 12th century Europe. What an undertaking for Follett! I'm not knowledgeable enough to know if it was historically accurate but I really did enjoy learning more about that time period particularly the glimpses into the hardships of daily life in that time period. The struggle for power for both royalty and Catholic Church was interesting too. I could have done without some of the graphic brutality. Overall I think it was a good book and would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"good history, bad plot","review":"I can't see what all the hype is about this book. I thought it was only a so-so book. I loved the Michener-esque style of telling history through a fictional story line. But the plot in this book was so bad. The entire book felt like it was an \\"I got you last\\" contest of one-upmanship. In one chapter the villain does something horrible to the hero, next chapter the hero gets even, next chapter villain gets back at the hero, and back and forth, and back and forth. It was really irritating to read. I plowed my way through the whole book, but I don't recommend this book to my friends. If you are interested in this type of history/fiction read James Michener or Edward Rutherford instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dark and Brooding Read","review":"I just don't understand why this author would take this story, with so much promiseand senselessly subject us to these sadistic characters. It does nothing to make the book more exciting, there appears to be no lesson to be learned it's simply meant to be entertaining sitting through rape and torture. To me it feels like a penalty I must pay if I wish to follow the storyline. I expected more based on all the great reviews and am somewhat disheartened that so many would think this work to be of such high caliber, frankly I find it disturbing, and I'm no prude I assure you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take My Copy","review":"Let us put aside the historical inaccuracies, the one dimensional, unrealistic characters, the stunted plot, the glaring omission of any sort of depth involving anything touched upon by the author, and focus instead on the amateurish writing style with which the author delivers this 'tale.'To be honest, I was shocked to hear that Follett was an established, let alone successful, author. I thought that he had somehow harried the publisher into putting this novel out, and that they had complied, crying 'mercy,'so that he would shove off.What a bloated, overrated, bland book.All of that said, I'm glad that so many others found enjoyment in the refuse. Maybe Follett will introduce them to further, greater works of the time period, such as...anything else, by any other author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get past the first 100 pages","review":"I picked this book up this morning at the airport, thinking it might be a good read during a flight. A lady in the airport said it was the best book she's ever read. The cashier said I'd love it. I wanted to like it, I just can't, it's terrible. I read the first 80 pages during the flight and I'm going to have to get another book for the return flight. The writing is very lame; the descriptions of the characters would fit in bad Young Adult literature. The plot is so unrealistic. The guy's wife dies and he proposes to a new woman the very next day (after making love to her in a dream-like state the very night after his wife has died in child birth and he just finished burying her.) C'mon....really? I'm done. Don't waste your time reading this book...there is so much better out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"settle in and enjoy this epic novel of historical intrigue","review":"I was completely enthralled by this book. The characters and setting are richly drawn and the story moves at a fast clip. I found myself looking up historical details continually, checking the story against historical record or simply getting lost looking at 12th century cathedral's. This is a true escapist book where the world within the novel truly comes alive. It reminds me of \\"I Claudius\\", there is nothing better than ancient gossip and intrique that peaks your intellectual curiosity. I do think it could have been 100 pages shorter though. The story starts to use similar plot statagies as in \\"24\\" where there is always yet another intrigue that the hero must overcome. We could have had one less horror from William and Waleran. The ending was a little to drawn out and thus was not fully satisfying. All in all though very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a Read","review":"This book is one of the best books that I have read in years. It is set in 12th Century England and the characters/settings/situations and drauma of the story are nothing less than riviting and dynamic. This was a lenghty book but was very difficult to put down. It is highly recommended if you are looking for a \\"hard to put down\\" story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect more","review":"As a book, I thought this was a great read and worth the hype - 4 or 5 stars. Well done Mr Follett.However, as an \\"Item\\", which is what the review creation page says I am rating - an Item, I was disappointed to pay $14.27 for a digital version of a book that has been out for 22 years, only to find it riddled with spelling mistakes and typos. I fail to see how I am getting value for money for this \\"Item\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chalk up another 1 star review","review":"I can't add much to the previous one star reviews. They've said it all and better than I could: This book combines endlessly repetitive technical descriptions, dime store Harlequin bodice-ripper romance, and gratuitous pornographic sex. On the strength of the initial 5 star reviews (someone actually equated it to Gone with the Wind), I recommended this book to my elderly father and decided to read it as well. What an embarrassment! The only thing it has in common with GWTW is the length...the major difference is that POTE is a page turner only because you can't wait to finish the darn thing and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Absolutely one of the best books I've ever read. When my wife read the book in connection with a \\"club\\" she participates in, she passed it along to me. Being a fan of mysteries and westerns, I had my doubts...almost 1000 pages and a historical novel? Jumped in anyway and could not put it down. Well written, fasinating story line and couldn't wait to find the second in the series, World Without End, which is just a good. Highly recommend both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My life is better off for having read this.","review":"One of the richest dramas I have ever consumed in any form. I fear for writing TOO much! At 1,000 pages, this is a beefy tome and yet I flew through it. It's easy to read with no loss of quality for it. Following the progression of the cathedral building was inspiring. Learning some about the time period was very interesting. But the tragedies and victories endured and won by everyone involved were spectacular! I actually started getting p****d off at the main villain halfway through the book. This guy terminally peed in everyone's Froot Loops to no end. The story was deep, covered many generations, and was just a joy to look forward to each day. Much of the human experience was packed into this book and described from many age ranges. I loved it. Just loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IF YOU LIKE THIS!","review":"If you enjoyed this story you must read \\"Marching With Caesar-Conquest of Gaul\\" What an amazing read and the best historical fiction since I read Pillars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book was highly recommended to my husband who is really not much of a reader, he will sit and read a few pages then find something else to do and the book will sit unopened for a week or so; in this case he started reading Pillars of the Earth and just never put it down. He enjoyed the style of writing and the story line. He now cannot wait to read more of Ken Follett's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I first tried to read this mess 10 years ago. After Tom, starving to death in a frozen landscape, has hot porn-star sex with a mystery woman in the woods, I threw it away as garbage.Then, my otherwise well-read parents kept telling me about how they just loved this book, and I read about how Pillars is Follett's masterpiece, etc. So I picked it up and made it half way through this time. Yuck.One night I put it down and picked up Bernard Cornwell's \\"Agincourt\\" and re-discoverd why I love reading and historical fiction. There was more nuance and joy in the first 10 pages than all of Pillars. Here is the ultimate problem with Pillars: there is no humor. It is a relentless series of calamities and tragedy borne by unhappy, humorless victims.Not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite piece of erotic filth","review":"How this book made Oprahs list is beyond me. Obviously she never read it. Follet obviously has some pre-teen girl rape fantasy issues, because that's what he seems to dwell on the most in great detail. Even better, the final conclusion drawn by a main character is that her childhood raping is what made her a successful woman. Hows that for womens lib?Follets knowledge of the timeperiod is limited to snippets of info inserted almost verbatum from other sources. There is very little in his characters that embody aspects of medieval life or philosophy. It's a simplistic, obvious story with no real twists or turns, and it could be transported to any time period simply by changing a few words here and there. I'm embarassed to have read it.If you like poorly researched medieval porn, this is certainly the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn and Violence For the Reading Level of Sixth Graders","review":"I'm so disappointed. I wanted to love this book but the writing is chokingly elementary in form and depth, graphically sexual and violent, and historically inaccurate. It's hard to slog through and not be simultaneously bored and horrified. Did anyone read this book at the publishing company? Is this really what we've come to as adult readers?Where is the complex character and plot development? Where is the command and usage of at least a tenth-grade vocabulary that would also be keeping with the time period?I heard so much hype that I expected to sit down at a Thanksgiving feast. If this was it, all that was served was fast-food. I'm worse for having dined and completely unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"After the first hundred pages or so, you get a lot of monks talking to monks ad infinitum.

Unlike many authors, Ken Follet tells a wonderful story without getting lost in the minutia of detail. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Book!!","review":"This book was great! It pulled me in from the 1st page! The character development in this book was very detailed, and you find yourself actually IN the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"Characters are what make a book what it is. The character developement in this novel is outstanding. You can feel the pain, as well as the love, the anger, and the joy of the characters. And oh... you feel the hate as well. If you've ever read a book or watched a movie where the \\"bad guy\\" made your skin crawl, and you simply wanted him to get the worst, then you would appreciate this book. I normally read midieval fantasy, but this historical fiction tops most of them. I love to read and will possibly read this once again. I had both my mother and father read this book, as well as a few friends, and they all loved it. Give it a try. It's a MUST READ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read","review":"This is an excellent book. It tells a terrific story that will capture and hold your attention. At the same time, amazingly, you'll learn some really interesting history and architecture while Follett's rich rendering of the time and customs will allow you to \\"experience\\" the book, if you know what I mean. You'll feel a part of it, rather than a witness. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling Read","review":"Follett virtually never disappoints; and I've found his historical novels thrilling and provocative on a number of levels. \\"Pillars of The Earth\\" may be his best ever. Thoroughly enjoyable despite accurate relation of the brutality of the era in which it takes place. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good one to take on vacation","review":"This is an awesome and absorbing saga about stonemasonry, religion, and politics. Ken Follett obviously did intensive research but also has a vivid imagination. Once you begin you can't really escape the \\"alternate reality\\" of this book until you read the last page, at which point you will wish it lasted longer. And that's saying a lot since this book is about 800 pages long. One of my top 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars Of the Earth is Potent Reading","review":"After reading World Without End, I had to read Pillars Of the Earth. I wish I had read Pillars first. Though it is not necessary to read both to understand either, to grasp the whole concept of this period in British history, both religious and political, you will not want to miss reading both books. I do recommend reading Pillars first only because I find it is easier to relate to the historical facts when you read them in chronological order. Even though World Without End was my favorite of the two, Pillars was every bit as mesmerizing and well researched and written. Ken Follett is a genius at storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"NGlorioso: Pillars of the Earth","review":"The best book I have read in years. This book gets better and better the further along you read. Twists and turns that keep you guessing and rooting for people and feeling for them through every one of their struggles. Hoping the book never ends but it must and it leaves you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"I think some of the hype around this book (of which there seems to be a lot) is a little overblown, but Pillars of the Earth is definitely an entertaining read. There are a variety of colorful and interesting characters and I particularly enjoyed some of the insights into \\"common life\\" in the middle ages (although I can't of course vouch for their accuracy). [SPOILER ALERT] I will say that I thought the rape-addicted character of William Hamleigh was a little overdone. The first time it happened, it fit just fine in the book and obviously served to develop his (evil!) character and serve as a plot device. The second time I can accept as another glimpse into his disturbed inner being (and another opportunity for the author to stir up a little hate in his readers for William). But eventually it just got heavy-handed and tiresome. We've already accepted that William is a terrible person - describing yet another sexual assault doesn't add anything to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"I am surprised that so many people raved about this book....perhaps my expectations were too high. I found the preface by the author to be more interesting than the story. In one word, SIMPLE. Simple dialogue, simple plot. I kept trying to find depth with the charactors to no avail. The whole story is one-dimensional. Interesting time and place but there was nothing compelling about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If there was less than 1 star, I'd give it that.","review":"Trite, Follett relies heavily on gratuitous violence to hold his weak prose together. Too bad, could have actually been an interesting cathedral story if better written! Beats me why everyone loves this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Surprising. For an excellent, entertaining author that has to be one of the most boring books I have read in a long time. It just goes on and on. Had the author used the language of the period, the story might have been easier to consume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing...","review":"I first read the book at the insistance of a friend, thought it was okay, and never thought about it again. Then this summer I was in Bruxelles Airport and I saw the book on the shelf and decided to buy it.What had I been thinking? I had obviously forgotten some of the detail, but the book itself is an absolute masterpeice! The intricate plots, woven together to make the full tapestry...

Every reviewer who has given this trash one star has already covered the ground, but I'm so mad at myself for actually reading the Whole Book, that I must add my two cents.Obvious plottingOne dimensional charactersAnachronistic language throughoutGratuitous violenceLame writingSilly nonsenseMy mother would have called it \\"tripe\\", and I suppose they would have understood that word in the Middle Ages too.I just read the first few pages of \\"Wolf Hall\\" by Hilary Mantel, set a few hundred years later and about that other King Henry and that other Thomas. What writing! and What a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"I'm only part way into reading this book - but it's one of those that I can't put down. Not only is it well written, but it is also a fascinating study of the period and a well developed cast of characters. I'm thoroughly enjoying Pillars of the Earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absorbing historical read","review":"Couldn't put the book down once I started reading it. Loved the characters, loved the building of the Cathedral and I particularly liked how Follet brought the rediscovery of ancient Greek texts such as Euclid into the story. So many things I liked about the book. Sure there was plenty of sex and violence, the story was set in the 12th century after all. Plus I assume we're all adults here so I think we should be able to deal with it. For those who don't like violence and sex in their fiction I would keep clear of this book, that will save me having to read the ridiculous negative reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good I Can't Start Again","review":"This book was so good that I can't bring myself to start another one. The last book I read was \\"A Man In Full\\". I truly enjoyed Wolfe's book, but Follett blew him away. Pillars of the Erath is the best book I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read","review":"This is honestly one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It seems to have everything. At first I didn't think I'de like the setting of the book but after reading only a little bit of it I loved it. It got me interested in the Middle Ages and I just loved reading about them in this book. I was enveloped in the book and honestly could not put it down. I recommend it to anyone, it is truly an incredible book. I wish he'd write another novel in this setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ye ole Bait and Switch","review":"I thought I was entering into a great work of historical writing, based on reviews and recommendations. Instead, it was unedited boobies and rape scenes galore, with a little Cathedral Architecture 101 thrown in. Bleh! I read all kinds of books, I'm not a literary snob by any means. But don't tell me I'm getting a serving of chocolate mousse and give me a mud pie instead. I'm so bitter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing","review":"This book was absolutely incredible, its plot is so complex and intertwined that I would recommend it for anyone. It is, however racy, but even me, a 14 year old, loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite simply the very best book you will ever read.","review":"After having read over 1,000 books, I can honestly say that no other story comes close. Every time I have urged someone to read it, they've looked at the cover and said \\"I don't think so,\\" or \\"It doesn't lok like something I'd be interested in,\\" but after urging each of them to at least read the first (short) chapter, not one of them could put it down. I've had people thank me profusely for recommending this book to them, men and women alike. It is an absolutely perfect, magnificent story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most incredible books I've ever read!","review":"This book is a magnificent and true-to-life story of life in twelth century England - the characters are as real as they are human and the tale that unfolds before the fascinated reader is as full of suspense, as it is of emotion and sincerity. Anyone, an average reader and a history buff alike, will fall in love with Pillars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel of ancient and heroic times.","review":"Pillars of the Earth combines history, adventure, romance, religion and architecture. This was the first book of Ken Follett's that I read and it will not be the last. This book turned me into a Ken Follett fan. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"cant finish it","review":"I chose it thinking it would be very interesting. The idea of cathedral building in the 1200s sounded fascinating. In the beginning the story of Tom the stone mason and his family really got to me. But then I got bogged down with the monks and gave up. I may go back to it. I rarely give up on a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pillars","review":"Too much graphic sex. I stopped reading. I had the mistaken notion this would be along the lines of a Michener novel. It certainly is not that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully thrilling historical novel","review":"This is one of my most favorite Ken Follett novels. He masterfully introduces many characters that are not too confusing to follow, intertwining all their lives seamlessly. Despite the length, this novel deserves each and every page. Follett succeeds in giving a fresh breath of life to this period of time, making characters from centuries ago seem real and even relatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"UN-PUT-DOWNABLE!","review":"This is the best book in the world! AMAZING! READ IT! (If you liked this book, you should also check out Shogun, even though it is NOWHERE near as good as Pillars of the Earth)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story.","review":"Just brilliant. Sit back for an amazing experience as you re-live the 1100's. I really felt like I know what it was ike to live in this period of time and what an incredible achievement it was to build such magnificent architecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried...","review":"I so wanted to like this book but after 100 pages or so I just gave up. The book is heavy like a bible full of so many unnecessary and redundant details. It's like someone is trying to read a story to you, not a book you get to digest and enjoy. I'm ok with a big book like this and people are free to write a 1,000-page book, but doesn't mean that 300 pages of it you can just throw in whatever on top of your head without editing them. I'm sorry but maybe I'm not quite there yet to appreciate this so-called masterpiece, but I just can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't wait to go back to 1120 A.D.","review":"While this book is big, toward the end I was wishing it was bigger! Each day I looked forward to the evening when I'd go back to 1120 A.D., or 1125, or 1140, and enter the English lives of the people facing royal intrigues and daily hardships. The writing is clean and engaging, the characters come and go at just the right pace, and we see their lives interconnecting over the years, which is quite satisfying. Reading about older forms of building construction, the tools and methods used, and the evolution of architecture were especially fascinating. It's a very enthralling, lively history lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST book ever!","review":"This is the best book I ever read! The details are incredible and we can really feel the characters' emotions. Where can I find more books like this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one word to describe the book: AMAZING","review":"One of the most exciting books I've read so far. I couldn't stop reading it all the time. It took hold of my life for a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"I have read and enjoyed several of Ken Follett's spy books, but this one is pure yack. My opinion is that it was ghost written. It's disjointed, contrived, wandering, and, as a result, almost unreadable. It's as though a few basic ideas and a lot of arcane words (repetitively used) were fed into a computer program and spat back out. Forget the sequel. Don't waste your money on either book...sorry, Ken, but this one is way below par. And way too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Language?","review":"Not good.I normally don't like to dog on other people's work... I mean, what have I done to give me such authority? Maybe it is because I started this book on the tail end of East of Eden. Perhaps it is just because it looks and smells like an epic. I'm not sure, but I do know this, this book reads like a high school sophomore wrote it. There are some times where I literally roll my eyes or shake my head as I read.Basically, I think it is a good premise. Even the plot isn't awful. The biggest complaint I have is with the language and storytelling. Most of the characters are two-dimensional or predictable. They don't shine. The treatment of sexuality is that of a 15 year old... it's overdone, awkward and slightly frenzied.I don't like to give up on books, which is why I am more than halfway done with this one. However, I couldn't guarantee that I will carry on until the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-researched? I don't think so","review":"I am surprised at how many people refer to the historical nature of this book and how 'well- researched' it is, etc.Very early on in the book, that sort of praise for this book is proved to be undeserved. Follett refers to a thief being hanged as being \\"..quite young, somewhere between twenty and thirty years of age...\\"In Europe in 1128, 20-30 years of age was 1) a huge age range and 2) certainly not young.On page 55. of William Manchester's book about the medieval world, _A World Lit Only by Fire_, one learns that 40 years old was an unlikely age to reach and that most people died well before the age of 30! Those who did reach ages 40 and older were like today's octogenarians, white hair, hunched posture, etc. So, how could 20-30 in age possibly be 'quite young' ?All Follett had to do was a little bit of research to avoid this error."},{"rating":"2","title":"very, very good book","review":"At first I really didnt want to try and read a fiction book that was over 1000 pages, but I must say this is a great book and I finished it very quickly and cant wait to read the second volume World without end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"A lot of friends and co workers have read this book, so I had to read it.

The author is an athiest. I can not support his material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"I did email the source for this book--felt the price I paid for just a regular paperback was high. Thought when I ordered it would be a larger size paperback, but it wasn't--and between the price and shipping, felt $15.00 for a $4 book was a lot. He sort of agreed, but apparently he paid more for it as well. Book was in good condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characters but you might want to avoid this book if...","review":"...You might want to avoid this book if you have been a victim of sexual violence. This book kept me reading through its many, many pages because of some really good characterization -- if I hadn't liked several of the characters so much, and found them so thoroughly human and real, I would not have waded through the long and rather tedious descriptions of the thought processes of designing a cathedral. While I understand that this was a violent time period, the graphic rape scenes were unnecessary and gratuitous. One can convey a sense of horror without putting the reader through that. I always wonder at a male author who finds this sort of description necessary - did he get a thrill from imagining the detail, or did he hope that his audience would? Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great from the Intro","review":"A fabulous book, captured my attention from the first second. I can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillars of the Earth","review":"I loved this book and have loaned it to friends, gifted it to relatives, and recommended it to many others. Ken Follett did a marvelous job in describing the building of stone cathedrals and other structures that have withstood the ravages of civilization and atmospheric catastrophies for hundreds of years. His fictional characters are quite believable, and I had trouble putting the book aside so that I could perform my daily tasks in the real world. This is a book for the ages, and I congratulate Mr. Follett for his accomplishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Build a Cathedral in a World Full of Violence","review":"A fictional account that concerns the lives of various people involved in and around the building of the Kingsbridge Cathedral. Set against the backdrop of civil war in medieval England, the story includes elements that capture the violence and confusion of the times, including rape, murder, arson, war, and political intrigue.There are wasted words in this lengthy novel--the author tends to rehash excessively--but the overall narrative is engaging and the characters are well-developed.World Without End is Follett's follow-up in what can be loosely termed a series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Book","review":"Wow. This is a terrific book. The story line revolves around the fact that the main character wants to build a cathedral. It is a good read. I could not recommend it higher..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating!","review":"I'm generally not much for fiction. I'd sooner pick up a book on business or psychology. However, Pillars of the Earth kept me riveted for two days with action, valor, chivalry, romance, long suffering, triumph and accomplishment. I've recommended it to friends many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome","review":"I enjoyed this book like no other. It is truly an epic tale and is a meticulous portrait of life in the middle ages that revolves around the building of a Gothic Cathedral. The charcters are superb and the tale is Follett at his very best. I would recommend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Vernacular in the 12th Century?","review":"The author has been praised for his research on this book, but the way the characters think and the descriptive words used are indicative of our modern era. For example, one of the character's thoughts describe sexual intercourse as \\"doing it\\"....really? Very weird for me, I think my expectations were way too high. I am really disappointed. It is like watching \\"Valkyrie\\" and trying to ignore Tom Cruise's accent."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW the best book ever","review":"When I first read this book I found that I could not put it down. It is the type of book that you could read over and over and still be suprised at the grandness of the cathedrals. The love story between Jack and Aleina is one for the ages. If you have to read any books this is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total piece of crap","review":"This is a violent, repetitive, silly waste of time. Offensive. Terribly edited. Don't bother. Read something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"It was my first time that I wanted to give up reading a book when I only have 1/10 left to read. sigh..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Novel I could not put down","review":"This novel was amazing,The characters are people that you can relate to. Prior Philip was the perfect example of a man of God that endured and overcame the struggles of a corrupt church. Through all the adversity he faced he managed to build the most beautiful cathedral Kingsbridge had ever seen.While he was not the only character in the novel that was significant his humility and selfness was inspiring.Great Novel by Ken Follet"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not \\"The Eye of the Needle\\"!","review":"This is one of the most poorly written fiction books I have had the misfortune to read. The plot seems to be made up as it goes along and keeps falling apart as if Follett is limping towards the finish line of a 200,000 word piece of crap that will weigh enough to sell for $30.Follett struggles to get through scene after scene with descriptions that are so awkward that sometimes you can't envision what the hell is supposed to be happening. He puts in little bits of history such as the \\"how many\\" game where people supposedly ate seeded bread after being ask a question like \\"how many years will it be before I get married?\\" and count the seeds in their mouth. Who knew? Also we have one character inventing futures contracts out of thin air and another constructing the first felting machine in history. All in 1150! Wow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"I don't care about historical accuracy - I was looking for a story with strong characterization. Tom's character was interesting - so was his 'girlfriend' - but too little was devoted to this part of the story. The 'gratuitious sex and violence' was annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic that people say best book they ever read.","review":"This is a dreadful book, unbelievable, needs massive editing and a good writer. It's an interesting story and should have been written by a good writer.When people say it's the best book they ever read, it is indeed worrisome.I am a very fast reader so could read it quickly but for anyone to spend much time on such dreck when there is real literature out there is pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vivid and pornographic","review":"In the introduction Mr. Follett indicates he followed his agent's advice to create a 'series of linked melodramas'. That seems an accurate description.The story is loosely based upon historical events in twelfth century England. It does show evidence of some background research.I do have an acute disappointment in this novel, because it could have been a great work.The rape and torture scenes are titillating, detailed and seem an exaggeration of a formula to create focus points. Ironically even within the text the author has Philip lament that it will be very difficult to purify his mind of such filth.Even the other tensions seem very much formula driven, the same pattern each time: despair, a great hope and seeming solution, then the 'bad guys' win and partially thwart the hero. The hero soldiers on. It reminds one of 'professional' wrestling.Same scene- just change the costumes for each round."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book You'll EVER Read","review":"I got this book because it was the book for my book club to read over the summer. The size was daunting but once I got into it, I was so happy it was long because I didn't want it to end. As a mother of 2 young children, I knew they'd be up early yet I HAD to read late into the night and FORCE myself to put it down around 2am.The way the characters wind around each other and how their consequences so appropriately fit their actions (both good and bad) is amazing.This is the book all others should be measured by. It does have its disgusting points, but when you consider who is doing the disgusting things, it somehow makes it fitting. Keep reading past it because its most haneous parts are so throughly rewarded.As an author myself, I wish I could measure up to Ken Follett's lofty standards but just consider it an honor to be in the same profession as him. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down!","review":"I read this book a few years ago at the recommendation of my sister. It did not disappoint. In fact, I am preparing to read it a 2nd time and have suggested it to my book club. It is absolutely riveting. I have to agree with a prior review that as you near the end, you will wish the book could continue on for a few hundred more pages. The character become so lifelike...it's as if Ken Follett is writing about people I know, and I want to know what happens to these people and their offspring over the next several hundred years. I never thought I would enjoy a historical book so much. It's a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This book is truly phenominal. Never have I gotten such a believable picture of what it must have been like to be alive in the Middle-Ages. But the historical detail aside, the romance and drama is so sweeping and sentimental (in a good way), you hardly notice or appreciate the historical detail. At least not the first time around. Can't wait for the sequel coming out in 2007!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books Ever Written. Period.","review":"I have read thousands of books in my life, and few have captivated me like this one. The author is known for his potboiler spy novels, but this is a serious work of historical fiction. Buy it, read it, and be dazzled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of Faith and Fate","review":"Lots of twists and turns in the fortune of man. Although it took many years there was accountability in the end. Man's (Women's) struggles to right a wrong sometimes takes a lifetime to come to the just end for both the good and the bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"pillars of the earth","review":"This was a wonderful look into the lifestyle and history of the ll00's, I could not put the book down. It was a great read. This was the second book that i read on my kindle from Amazon. I am now reading the sequel which seems be as absorbing and interesting as Pillars of the Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give 2 stars if I didn't even finish?","review":"I actually agree with the one stars. But there were some bright spots. Still, I couldn't get through the horribly inauthentic language, for instance, that the characters used.. I just don't picture people of this time period saying that someone was \\"hot\\" - or many other 20th/21st century vernacular phrases that showed a blatant laziness on the part of this author. It took even the faintest bit of authenticity out of it for me. I couldn't get lost in the story because the inattention to detail was so distracting. After seeing the reviews here, a friend also recommended it - before he'd finished it - so I purchased it. By the time he got to the end, he was sorry he'd recommended it to me. I agreed, and decided that reading this was not a good use of my time, so stopped reading it about two-thirds through. I even banished it from my Kindle. Bleh."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GRAND novel you will never forget.","review":"This is one of the few books I have read where I remembered the main characters' names. That is not hard considering how well each character is developed. This book is the most sweeping and memorable novel I have ever read. Here is a basic tale between good and evil told at a level most authors only dream of achieving. The story takes place in the in 12th century England-a time of destitution, squalor and petty rivalries for power. The reader is grabed by the neck on the first page and held until the last. I would recommend that everyone read this book for the history lesson provided despite the book being historical fiction. I have told dozens of people to read this book and all who have had the same reaction: Rapture. You must read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so much better!","review":"I had read this book a long time ago and purchased it so I could read it again. I was so disappointed this time around. I personally thought the sex scenes were really drawn out and even unnecessary. I realize that some of them were part of the plot, but they certainly didn't need to be that long and descriptive. For me, they detracted from the rest of the book.Other than that complaint, the book was an OK read. The story was magnificent -- how much egos can clash in medieval England on the way to building a gigantic cathedral. It wasn't very artfully written . . . the rich storytelling just didn't seem to be there for me, but it did an OK job relating the plot. The fact that the plotline was so well-thought-out was the saving feature of this book. Everything makes sense, and the plot is good, but the writing just wasn't all that impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engaging read","review":"Once again Follett has a tendency to get wrapped up in the minutiae of ancient architecture, buy beyond that he has penned an exciting, engaging story. Yes there's a good bit of graphic sex, but it's not a nursery rhyme. People do and did have sex, and might even have enjoyed it. I recommend it for those 18 and up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book.","review":"What a great story... Awesome read. I will probably re-read to ensure I caught all of the details. Thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not available to Australia","review":"I would dearly love to read this book but unfortunately it is not available to Kindle owners in Australia for copyright reasons. I sincerely hope Amazon will look into this issue as there are so many titles that are unavailable to me. It is a shame I didn't know about the copyright issues before I bought my Kindle... I may not have been so eager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Explicit X-rated sex","review":"Very disappointed with this otherwise good book. However, the detailed explicit X-rated sex scenes that describe in detail having sex with a virgin, and exploring women's breasts with ones mouth, are in my opinion too much for a historical book about building cathedrals to God.The wild woman and child in the woods is an atempt to insert year 2000 world views into year 1100 history. It fails.All Mormons and good Christians everwhere should avoid this extreme disappointment, Oprah Schmoprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"have not read the book yet...but the copy I was sent is extremely old and worn - with yellowed pages - what a disappointment.

At the end, you're left thinking what can I read that's going to top that.This book is a literary tapestry of medieval life. Out of five stars, this book deserves six."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the three best books I've ever read","review":"This is a must read book. Don't let the size intimidate you. When I first looked at this book, I thought it would take forever to get through. It took over my life ( I read while waiting for traffic lights to change! ). Great character development. At times you wish you could get inside this story and despence some justice. Many great moments in story will envoke a full gambit of emotions. Near the end of the book you will truely be sad to see it comming to an end. I would love to see a sequill."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ!!!!!!!!","review":"If there is one book you read this century, make it THE PILLARS OF THE EARTH. A tantalizing sequence of events meshed together to provide the reader with maximum drama, adventure, romance, and mystery. Ken Follett has done it!!!!! This gives you an insight to human nature at its best and worst, a powerfully moving read, once you pick it up there will be no putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I have read in a long time","review":"Five stars isn't enough. Compared to other books I have rated with 5 stars, I'd like to give this one 7 or 8. If you thought Rutherfurd's Sarum was great, you will find it overshadowed by The Pillars. When you get within a couple hundred pages from the end you will find yourself rationing the remainder because you really don't want it to end. Aside from it being a truly captivating yarn, it also left me with a strong desire to go take another look at a cathedral to examine those details of its construction that are so vividly explained in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book To Curl Up With","review":"Good book, informative, a very easy and entertaining read. Won't be soon forgotten, thanks to the view into that time period, the insight into cathedral architecture, the corruption of the times, and the characters. Slightly wordy just a few times and I skimmed a bit. However, as I read, as well as when I finished, I felt like there was something quite substantial lacking that could have made a good book great. Still, I would recommend to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillars of the Earth","review":"The Pillars of the earth is a must read. The complexity of the story is masterful from the first page to the ending. I couldn't put it down after beginning to read it. Ken Follett is a truly wonderful and gifted storyteller.Have just watched the mini series of this book (and bought the DVD) what a magnificent story. Well worth the effort if you liked the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, mesmerising, unputdownable!","review":"This is a fascintating account of the 12th century and while it may be gory in places, the truth of the matter is that these things really did happen and are still happening. The Pillars of the Earth gives you an insight into human nature and if people really were like that in the 1100's (my guess is they were), we really havent changed all that much in 800 years. An absolute must for fiction lovers and don't let the size daunt you, it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"First of all I think Ken Follett is a great author, I would recommend any of his books. I read Pillars of the Earth about 20 years ago and passed it on because I thought it was a great story. I recently ordered this book just to have it, I believe that this book will become a classic. I couldn't believe when I first started reading this book that I would be interested in a story set in the 11th century! You just get involved with the characters and want to find out if this man living in the 11th century ever gets his wish to build a church. Ken Follett really keeps you interested in the life and times in the 11th century, imagine that! I would challenge anyone who starts reading this book to be able to not finish it. A great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Emotion Satisfied!","review":"I was given \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" as a birthday gift many years ago and was told by my friend that it was the BEST book she had ever read. After glancing at it and reading the flyleaf, I decided that it would probably not interest me and I put it on a shelf for four years. One day while dusting I came across it again and, guiltily, decided to give it a try. WELL! I was in for such a tremendous surprise, not to mention the greatest \\"read\\" I've ever had the pleasure to experience!Now, I buy extra copies to foist on friends who have never had the pleasure of reading this extraordinary tale. I just wish there were more truly captivating books being written today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"This book is one of the best I've ever read.

Absolutely fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"I submitted this once already but will do so again (last time though).I gave this review a five star and appreciated the help they gave me after e-mailing them to let them know I needed the book ASAP.

Better yet, buy yourself a Christmas present now - on line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Follett is a Pillar of the Earth","review":"You know how, just sometimes, you feel really disappointed when you read a book? That was how I felt - because I had finished it and I didn't want it to end.It's amazing to read how complex society was all those hundreds of years ago. This is how your ancestors may have lived, trading commodity futures to ensure they get through another winter. Being named for your trade or the town you came from rather than a family name.An incredible read that you just don't want to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this or miss out on one of the best books ever.","review":"This is a great book. On my bookshelf, it is the only one that faces out so I can see it all the time, and therefore feel as happy as I was when I first read it. Every now and again, I will pick it up and read just a section of it - and know exactly where that lies in the story, because I've read it complete about 5 times. Why hasn't it been make into a movie? It is so cinematic. I absolutely love it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Thee to an Editor","review":"Poorly researched, poorly structured and poorly edited. Follett now suffers from Michener's Syndrome, where a pop novelist grows too powerful for an editor to do his or her job. As a historian, I was disturbed by the inaccuracies. As writer, I was disturbed by the weak and inconsistent internal structure and predictability. God forbid anyone views the history as accurate. This could have been three hundred pages shorter, and much better. It also seemed to be a direct rip off of Ellis Peters (A welsh monk during the civil war between Maud and Stephen? Been there, done that) Read Name of the Rose or, better yet, a real history book. Plenty of those in the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books needs ratings like movies for explicit sex, language, and violence","review":"I read a few Amazon reviews before purchasing this book. I wish I had seen the review by Ash. I agree that this book is \\"Utter Dreck\\". There should be ratings on books just as there are on movies about explicit sex, language, and violence.

Love the characters. I feel like I know them. This is how I like a book to be. That the charaters develope in front of you and then you know them. Love this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy read.....","review":"I loved this book the second time around as much as the first. Mr. Follett gives life to the cathedral as each chapter unfolds to dramatic characters and scenes associated with the construction of a massive building. If you are taking classes in architecture or the dark ages you will appreciate and understand the key words in his descriptions. I can't wait for the sequel.........I hope it is as page turning as Pillars of the Earth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much turgid melodrama in quasi medieval setting","review":"The main protagonists are ostensibly medieval people with very modern sensibilities in a setting with the trappings of 12th century medieval England by an author with very little understanding of the actual world.The big secret the chief villains go to such lengths to conceal is a conspiracy that assumes the conspirators could foresee the consequences of what they conspired to so they knew what the immediate consequences of their deed would be.Piffle.That kind of foreknowledge is deadly to historical fiction; it plants the author right in the reader's field of view.All this swirls around the building of a gothic cathedral. If that's what interests you, read David Macaulay's Cathedral instead. It's much shorter, is better researched, and is accompanied by nice sketches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grim","review":"Couldn't get through this one. After buying and getting half way through it, I learned that it had been recommended by Oprah. That surprised me given how tedious and violent it was. I even taped and watched some of the miniseries episodes, but didn't want to waste my time watching the last few. Historical fiction has always seemed like a relatively painless way to learn something if I'm going to spend hours reading, but this one was just too burdensome. I can't believe this cost several dollars--what a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever written !","review":"This has got to be one of the best novels ever written. Pick it up and you will not be able to put it down until you finish it. I only wish that Ken Follett would write another similar novel. He brings the characters and the era to life. This is a MUST READ book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Pop for the TV era","review":"Follet is a competent storyteller but he is betrayed by his compulsive pandering to the lowest-common denominator. This has the feel, the texture, the depth and the authenticity of those old 70's TV mini-series, full of romance, betrayal and as predictable as the four seasons. It has some merit, as pop pulp, coarsely written and very much aimed at the middle of the bell curve, but it is disturbing seeing so many people labelling it as \\"the best book ever\\". What books are this people reading? I don't mean to be disrespectful, and I am sure their devotion is sincere. What's more, I think that Follet is due some credit for telling a story that uses all the possible archetypes in fiction and manages to pull through a ton of pages, but... Even for popular fiction, this is simple-minded, digested and very much low-aiming stuff. It is puzzling to me that so many readers find this \\"the book of their lives\\". It makes me wonder about our lives, what we read and what we aspire to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum History","review":"Having never read a Ken Follett novel before (and I doubt very much there will be a second one I'll attempt), I picked up The Pillars of the Earth, even though the on-line reviews were highly mixed. It was l-o-n-g (primarily because of repetition that seemed to be based on the concept that no reader had a memory longer than four pages and had to be reminded continually of elements and individuals that had been made clear time after time), was rife with contrived, stilted dialogue, flat characters, and a perpetual deux-ex-machina approach to conflict. The focus on the brutality of some characters may have been historically accurate but the concentration in one or two characters seemed more gratuitous than necessary to any development of the point. The limits of credibility were stretched to the extreme throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.....Boring....","review":"I finally stopped reading this book about 3/4 of the way through.

Get an editor!","review":"Well I can appreciate anyone who can sit down and write a 1000 page book.But this was really awful. The writing is pitiful. Follett goes on for pages and pages of meandering diatribe. I found myself skimming through page after page and not really missing a thing! Generally poor story construction. Who was the protagonist again? Oh! thanks for getting to her on page 250!!!! Hmm and what was that little thing about the baby? Oh, forgot about him didn't ya'. I'm sorry but you can't put a baby found above the grave of his dead mother (ie lure a reader into an interesting story) and then NEVER do anything with him. You cheated your readers out of his story. Oh yes, the builder...you know then guy you open the book with...thanks for subtly killing him off after a more or less 650 page meaningless life.Ken seriously...a lot of words do not make a book!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"just didn't do it for me","review":"I wanted a book to read during my holiday vacation. I never read Follett before, and trusted the \\"Oprah Book Club\\" sponsorship. But, after the first 40 pages . . . I find it hard to continue. There is minimal character development, rudimentary plot, and gratuitous violence. I am not a historian, and I am sure the era in which the story takes place was violent, but in this story there appears to be too much. I realize the story is centered on cathedrals, but Tom is way too hung up on it - a 12 century yuppie obsessed with their career. I don't know why many (too many in mu opinion) can give this book more than one star. Follett preface claims about the ten years to write hints at an epic story. But, I think the ten years was due to the book being an afterthought, something to write when there was nothing else to do - a hobby. Instead of trying to engage you in the character's lives, you seem to be a third party, a voyeuristic trip through binoculars."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed every page","review":"This is a long book, but it is an easy read and the story lines are easily followed. I am a fan of historical fiction. This book is as good as they come. I enjoyed every single page and found all of the story lines equally interesting. A story about a monk and building a cathedral initally sounded suspect to me, but this story is full of rich characters and good story lines. It's much more than a story of building a church. It gives an excellent look into a past world and how life was lived by those in the middle ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillars of the Earth","review":"Something about this book grabs you very quickly and you don't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"winding story, good but pretty long.

I wish I could remember who it was so that I could smack them. Even when I bought it, the guy at the register at BAM said, \\"Oh, that's a great book!\\"Ok, it's not a great book. It's not even a good book. The dialog makes me feel dumb. Seriously, there is NO depth. Characters say things the real people would NEVER say. Plus children characters talk like adults.There is a lot of sex in this book for no purpose. Follett graphically describes rapes and murders in this book. Personally, I don't mind reading about those issues if it relates to the story. It just seems like the sex and violence is thrown in with no connection to character development or to the plot.So, if you want a mind-numbing read - get this book. If you read literature, skip it. It might make a good beach read for men. I think that some people might find it offensive...like my grandmother. She would put this book in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, my God, what a catastrophe --","review":"This author (if he can call himself that) writes for kindergartners.

Bad Guys stop him. PP outwits them and continues building. BGs try again to stop PP but PP outwits them and resumes building. BGs really get his goat next time... Or do they? Hold onto your hat -- PP outwits them yet again! By the 50th time this happens are you still being blown away? The plot was so repetitious it was painful!

By what standards are you judging this mediocre book a 'masterpiece?' No kidding, it's depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I question Oprah's literary tastes","review":"I question Oprah's literary tastes. She gushed over \\"Pillars,\\" saying she was sad as she neared its conclusion, knowing the read would soon be over. Please! The story wasn't particularly compelling, the characters not that well developed, and Follett's story--taking about 996 pages-- was about 600 pages too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Archetype of Bad Writing","review":"I'm a big fan of historical fiction and this book was recommended to me by a friend as being pretty good. His judgment always seems sound. That is until I read \\"Pillars of the Earth.\\" From the start, I was not at all impressed with Follett's writing (for instance, having a 12th century English peasant refer to his wife as his \\"soul mate\\"). I worked through about 200 pages, all with mixed emotions and suspicions about the writing quality, and then I read this: \\"He had been inflamed by Aliena and now he wanted to slake his lust with this one. She would be lively, he felt sure; she would wriggle and scratch. All the better.\\" For me, this passage pinned the bad writing crap-o-meter. With more than 800 pages to go, I knew I wouldn't be able to take any more of Follett's trite writing and what I think is very poor research. So I dumped the book. Your mileage may vary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of the Earth - a riveting book","review":"This book will make readers out of non-readers - it has everything from deviousness, piousness, and others twists and turns. It's a great book to share with others when done with it too.

Fewer than 100 pages to go and dreading coming to a close (as my friend indicated when she recommended the book). The characters are so well written, you feel you know them. I am surprised that over 200 people rated this 3 or less - I would be interested in what they include on their list of favorites. The building of the cathedral, though central, was simply a way to bind the characters, but those with an interest in architecture or cathedrals should find this aspect very interesting. I have always enjoyed visiting the churches of Europe and this gives me an even greater appreciation. Though 900+ pages may seem daunting, I read it in less than a week during my commute and often could not put it down once home. I was not a reader of Follett, but will likely read many many more of his novels if this one was any indication of his writing style and depth. Bravo Follett!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheapened a story with graphic sex","review":"The premise of the book was a great idea and the story could have been great. However, the writing style was not exceptional and it was overdone with detailed graphic sexual context. Follett cheapened his own book so instead or writing a masterpices (as he said he wanted to do) he just made a cheap book under the guise of literary fiction. Too bad..why would one suggest this book to one's daughter or son? Very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This was a very disappointing read, the writing is crass and hamfisted, and the attempts to incorporate significant historical events with unconvincing characters is amateurish. Steer clear if you are genuinely interested in history and love good writing. No subtlety here. I would give it no stars if that option was available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wildly inaccurate rubbish","review":"This novel was recommended to me by a friend, and I bought it based on reviews on this site. It purports to be set in the twelfth century, which, however, appears to have unaccountably time-shifted to the late 20th. century. For example, women are described as \\"hot\\", and 12th. century boys appear to know all about monkeys (this was in a largely illiterate era when there were no published books, no TV, and no public zoos, Mr. Follett).Other historical details are way off - Old Sarum Castle has apparently moved itself 6 miles so it's located conveniently next door to Salisbury Cathedral.The final straw for me was that my paperback copy had a full back-cover color shot of author Follett(taken by his wife), looking like a very self-satisfied chipmunk. I couldn't stand any more after 65 pages. Absolute balderdash. Avoid this book. Mine will be in the Laguna Beach Library used bookstore if you want a cheap copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll buy it for the historical details; You'll read it for the characters.","review":"The Pillars of the Earth is by turns scholarly and a guilty pleasure. If you ever wanted to know a host of architectural data about European cathedrals, it's there. The information about the cathedrals would be a cinematographer's dream. You can easily visualize the sweep and scope of England's early monuments to Christian worship.If you want to get to know a host of characters from childhood to old age, it's in there, too. The love story between Aliena and Jack the Builder move this story along. However, there are other highly interesting folks you will meet along the way in this historical novel that sweeps through the twelfth century. Thomas Becket appears in this story, but you'll have to read the book to see how his story entwines with others.After reading the Pillars of the Earth, I had to read the sequel World Without End.

It's well written, full of action, and well researched. It's about the many years it took to build a cathedral in the twelfth century, and doesn't spare any gory details. There's a satisfying hero or two -- or three-- and several well-drawn villians. Lots of building details, arches, vaults and weight-bearing problems, a couple of devastating fires plus a collapse or two. Much graphic sex, most of that from a male point of view. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this then ran out and got every book Ken had written!","review":"i will read and reread all of these historical fiction books by ken .

The book has not held up well. The characters are very one-dimensional, the melodrama is redundant and Follett passed up several opportunities to be far more interesting. The plotting is not always organic and often very predictable. For example, Ellen begins as a wild and mezmerizing spirit, but after a quick roll in the hay with Tom Builder, becomes a dull domestic character. William Hamleigh repeatedly attacks Kingsbridge. Bishop Waleran repeatedly plots revenge against Philip. Anything that could possibly go wrong here does. Ellen and Aliena are pretty much the same character, as are Alfred and William Hamleigh. This period of history is fascinating, but there are much better tellings of the tale out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I love this book and consider it one of Follets best works.

The characters were well-developed and I hoped they would be in an 'epic' style novel. There is plenty of time to get to know the characters and be invested in the story of each. Individually, however, I do not feel there were many elements of surprise. The only real twists came near the end of the story.

The historical descriptions were OK but the rest was truly disappointing. The plot repeats itself over and over again. The bad guys attempt to ruin the good guys. The good guys prevail. Then the bad guys come up with a new plot to ruin the good ones . And over and over again. The characters are all one dimensional. The language is too much 20th century for a 12th century novel. The sexual descriptions are at times almost vulgar. The romantic parts are truly shallow. It reminded me of a Daniel Steel novel. Not that I have anything against Daniel Steel, it just wasn't what I expected from \\"without doubt Ken Follet's masterpiece, and a story for all time\\" (from book backcover). Besides, if you want to write this kind of novel, you can settle with 300 pages top. Don't torment your readers with 1000 pages looking all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"A sequence of frustraded hopes and dreams. Even real life is less cruel. Depressing. As you read this book page after page you read about the worst in human kind and one scenario after another relates frustrated dreams, human cruelty, missery and depravation. Only bad people succeed one time after another. Very very undermining for the spirit."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated this book....couldn't even finish it!","review":"This book had potential, but I couldn't get past all the graphic sex and violence. And beyond being graphic, it was twisted and disturbing. I'm not a prude, but this was disturbingly over the top. I don't understand how people loved this book, I had to put it down. It was awful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has it all","review":"When I opened this book I was immediately drawn in starting with the first sentence. You get so involved with the characters who seem so real it is hard to believe they are ficticious. The pacing is perfect- just when you think the story is starting to bog down in details, the action picks up again. I learned so much about cathedral building, never realizing all the complex engineering that went into their construction. This book will make you want to go to England, stand in front of one of those magnificent buildings, and ponder about the people who built it so long ago..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand historical adventure !","review":"\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is my first read of a Ken Follett book, but will not be my last. The storyline of a 12th-century cathedral being built is intertwined with political and religious battles for power and is enjoyable and engrossing. Although Follett tends to get a bit too caught up in the details, the overall story is more than strong enough to carry this book easily and I had trouble putting it down. I would highly recommend it to any fan of historical fiction or anyone simply seeking a great story that they can immerse themself into."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't agree, Oprah.","review":"I've had a hard time with some of Oprah's choices, but this sounded like something i would like. After 500 pages i'm still not engaged in this story. i don't really like the characters and i don't think it's very well written. if you want a long, exciting, sexy story with characters that you would love to have in your life, try Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. Pillars just doesn't compare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"The first two reviewers giving 1 star were absolutely right. I am saddened that so many people are stupid enough to believe that because gratuitous sex and violence held their attention for nearly 1000 pages, this must be a good book. It is absolutely disgusting, poorly written, and badly researched. I completely regret the hours I spent reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible waste of my reading time.","review":"This book is five times longer than necessary and readers are rewarded little for their effort. A much more entertaining book about the dark ages and rennaisance is William Manchester's \\"A World Lit Only by Fire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potentially great story ruined by a superfluity of smut","review":"While I did come to love prior Philip and was intrigued by the herculean task of building of a grand cathedral in Medieval England, I was distracted by the modern-day language, the simplistic writing and the shallowness of many of the central characters.In many ways, this was a good story. I believe that, in the right hands, it could even be a great one. But the author seemed to revel in raping, pillaging and groping his characters almost as much as he focused on the meat of the story. As a reader, I really didn't need to be reminded--repeatedly--how much body hair, booty or bustline a character possessed. I wanted more storyline and much less gratuitous smut.A disappointing read after reading such hallelujah-laden reviews.In a nutshell, me no like."},{"rating":"2","title":"a modern classic","review":"I have read this book 3 or 4 times, and like a fine wine it only gets better over time. This is easily the masterpiece of all Ken Follett's work to date, and the novel is a tapestry of fascinating characters, woven together in a surprising and satisfying way. It is one I will want in hardback so it will last for generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ken Follet knows how to write characters.","review":"Ken Follet, is, in my view, the BEST character writer of these days. He can captivate you with just the thoughts of his characters, and wanting you to know more and more. You just can't stop finding out about these people."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I've ever read.","review":"I am a very active reader. I read a book every week. But, I must say that this is the best book I've ever read in my life. This story captivated and moved me. Read this book and I promise you'll be touched."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkable story","review":"This book is the most wonderful story i have ever read. From a masons point of view to the young girl who lost everything; and gained it all back. A story of romance, bravery, and sadness. One book that will never be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic already!","review":"I hope that Follett continues to write more books that take place in medieval times because this one was absolutely incredible! I'm sure to read this one over and over...you won't regret reading it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck is Correct","review":"My Mom tricked me into reading this. She gave me her copy and didn't tell me how bad it was until I finished it. I totally agree with the review by \\"ash\\". Soooooo poorly written. I try to read my height in books every year so the one good thing about finishing it is that it adds a couple inches to my goal."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a hardback....","review":"I ordered a hardback edition of the book and got a 3\\" X 4\\" paperback with some type of funky cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"BREATH TAKING!!!!!","review":"This book is my all time favorite book. I would recomend this book to anyone who loves a good romance, action and excitment. The fact that it is so long makes it even better because there is plenty of time to really get to know and love each charactor in the book. I could not put this book down. I now own it on my kindle also. Just when you thought the book was slowing down it picks right back up again and takes off with some kind of excitment. Just so you know, part two (World Wtihout End)is just as awesome a read, and of course it finishes off where the first book ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, long read","review":"There were times when I thought the story dragged a little but that is my only complaint. It is well researched, interesting, and has wonderful strong characters with diverse personalities from the simple to very complicated. I read 40 to 50 books a year and this is certainly in the top 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Set in the 12th century, Ken Follett skillfully weaves historical facts into a story with personal conflict and ambition. The result is brilliant - one of the best books I have read. There are surprises galore as the cast of characters interact with each other. It even moved me to go and do some follow up research into that period in England. Thoroughly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me away","review":"I bought this book on CD so that I could listen during my daily commute to work. It is so wonderful. The writer is very descriptive and it truly takes me away. I look forward to driving and cannot wait to share with my family when I am done. Anyone that I have mentioned this book to that has read it loved it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"how can I get the 6-8 hours I wasted on this book back? And I never finished it. It was painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put my phone down.","review":"From his own admission this is different to his other books. I can't comment as this is my first Ken Follett.I couldn't put my phone down...so many themes i'm fascinated by. History, architecture, the church, politics, the human condition and mans inhumanity to man.Also a great insight into the normal lives of some of my forebears :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"This magnificent and volumus work has been ruined in its publication using a print format that is so cramped and small the I have to discard it un-read. Frankly it should be withdrawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing pages","review":"Very disappointed that 32 pages were missing in this copy of Pillars of the Earth! And 32 pages were duplicated later! Of course the missing pages came at a pivotal part of the plot. I have never seen this happen before."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Books I've Ever Read","review":"The first time I read this book I thought it was one of the best I'd ever read and, 10 years later when I read it again, I didn't change my mind. It's one of those books that once you start it you'll have trouble putting it down. The story grabs you, the characters become real people, and you'll learn a lot about English history. (While in England I even went to Kingsbridge looking for the cathedral.) Don't let the size intimidate you - you're not going to want this book to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One hell of a book for a desert island !","review":"Ken Follett excels in this saga of 12th Century England. The constant events of its pages and wonderful characters jump out at you and made me wish i could have written it. I have read the author's other books but none have come anywhere near to matching the scope or adventure of \\"Pillars\\" - it would make one hell of a movie. Since books have a tendency to go out of print I have bought a spare copy for my old age."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent doorstop","review":"To read my review, simply read the other one star reviews, and then picture a bearded fellow who needs a haircut reading that book described, and reading every page, almost choking on every misplaced lack of metaphor, stiff image and repeated turn of trite phrase. In the middle of reading this, I actually had to read some of Anansi Boys, just to cleanse the palate and remind myself that all writing isn't terrible.Sigh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all its cracked up to be","review":"I got about 500 pages into this book and just could not keep reading. It felt vert repetitive to me and I had a hard time getting interested in it. At times it was interesting but it just feels like so many events continue to be dragged out to long. This is a book thats very long but I feel that the story could have been told in fewer pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book lacks depth ...","review":"This book is disappointedly shallow, the characters are underdeveloped, the details are boring, the events are not woven in an unpredictable way.It is a chore to get to the end, the language is modern, and the the author gets into too many distracting subplots. A diligent editor would have prevented all this and truncated the book to half size without sacrificing much of the substance.Get back to your modern thriller-writing, Mr. Follett and leave these historical thrillers to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Classic","review":"This is definitely one of the best books I have ever read. I read the whole thing in a couple days, I couldnt put it down. If you liked Braveheart, you'll love this. Any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs more about the cathedral and less sex/ violence","review":"I agree with previous reviews - too much sex and violence, not enough about the cathedral. The characters are interesting, but the story lines left me unsatisfied. Seven-eighths of the book builds up a story; then the last eighth wraps it up in a contrived, lacking way. Speech flops back and forth between historical and modern usages, the author switches between elaborate details and cursory explanations, and parts of the book are incredibly boring. I don't usually like the author's book, but I love historical fiction about this region and this time. The book was a disappointment. I'm glad I chose to buy the discounted version, and not the deluxe version. Disturbing descriptions of rape and murder - the descriptions contribute little to the plot. Descriptions of sex are gratuitous and graphic - they made me feel dirty and made me think even less of the author. Completely detracted from the book, in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the reviews here I was so looking forward to this book. Major disappointment. The pace is very slow and the battle scenes are too much. The sex is written as a sixteen year old boy would write them. I'm slogging through, hoping for more, at page 650 or so. I may throw in the towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very elementary writing style.","review":"I've read other Ken Follet novels. Some I have enjoyed, some I haven't, but I don't remember him ever writing is such a juvenile style. Much of the construction could have been written by a 14 year old. The story line is interesting, but it is too long. He uses the same tragedy 3 or 4 times. It gets much to technical about the architecture of the catherdrals, though that period of history does hold your interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely amazing","review":"This book is incredible. The character development is fascinating and the second half of the book makes you turn the pages like no other. Halfway through the book at page 500, I was so glad I was only halfway through the book. I can't say enough about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read....","review":"This is a great book for anybody that likes historical fiction. Follett really makes his characters real. I think that is what makes this book great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"I can't put the book down. It is a very interesting view of life in the 1100s. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book I have read","review":"This was a book that I could not put down. It was like a drug to me. I learned about what life was like in the early 1100's in England. It is a great story that takes you through all the emotions humans have.Our lives today are full of many conveniences that we all take for granted.After this I read \\"World without End\\" by Follett which is takes place in the early 1300's and it was just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Follett have an editor?","review":"Does Follett have an editor?, February 10, 2008By B Bard (California, US) - See all my reviewsThis book might have been good if some editor had taken a sharp knife to it. It is just turgid. Did Follett get paid per word? I have always liked Follett- he is usually a crisp, tight, inventive writer. I was profoundly disappointed in this & its companion book (I made the mistake of buying both at the same time). I suppose if you have insomia, this might be a cure, but I will be hesitant to purchase another of his books. Save your money & find something else to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I was given this book by my sister and was not disappointed. This type of book is a change from my normal reading selections. I liked it so much this is the second time I've read it and am looking forward to reading the sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too generous.","review":"I am amazed at how many glowing reviews this book has. It is poorly researched, filled with anachronisms, and it would have been too long with half as many pages, the characters are entirely flat; frankly I could go on forever. I tried to like the story and the characters, but I had to draw the line at four errors in fewer than 300 pages. An earlier reviewer suggested William Manchester's \\"A World Lit Only By Fire\\" and I whole-heartedly agree. Manchester's book is far more informative if learning about the Middle Ages is your goal. Wikipedia is more accurate, as unreliable as a source as it is. I should have known better that Ken Follett is not worth my time when I could not finish \\"Jackdaws\\". I am certainly not reading \\"A World Without End\\" or anything else of his for that matter. He is forever on my \\"Banned List\\".Another book I'd strongly recommend is Tim Willocks' \\"The Religion\\", which is exponentially better than \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible book!","review":"I bought this book for my boyfriend as I thought it would be an entertaining story. However, it turned out that it is very boring at the start and becomes more and more horrible - leading to a very detailled and disgusting raping scene. My boyfriend stopped reading the book... I read parts of the book myself and agree, it is unnecessary to write something in such a cruel way. I know the Middle Ages were dark and bad things happened but do we really need to sit down and read in detail how a girl is brutally raped? I find it very sick..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This \\"book\\" is nothing more than way too many poorly thrown-together words that have little bearing on plot, narrative, or character development. Five stars? I think most of these reviewers must be either a) bought-off by the publishers or b) 11-year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"Being a Ken Follett fan and reader of many of his books, I found Pillars far below his level of writing. The excessive violence, preditability of characters was inevitable. After reading the first three hundred pages, I just found it not worthy of the time spent reading this under par Follett novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad History, Bad Engineering","review":"This book probably seems accurate to people who know nothing about history, medieval building techniques or traditional monastic life. I didn't find the novel compelling as fiction, and I found it painful that so many reviewers claim to have learned from this piece of trash. It was predictable and boring, overly long and hardly stimulating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sex - too much violence","review":"The story is gripping, alright... if you're a man in heat. Every major character ends up either being raped, murdered or has major moral flaws. If it was a movie, it would easily have an R rating.My first impression of the literature by the way of creative language and sentence structure is that it's not impressive. Of course, with an editor, the grammar is right, but the analogies are weak, and the literary skills of the author are average at best.I kept trying to finish it, but (spoiler warning!!!) after about the half-way mark - after the pillaging of the town just outside the cathedral that was being built, and the death of the main character up to that point, I just couldn't bring myself to read the rest. I figured that I paid for the stupid thing, I should get its worth, but after a weekend's reflection, I've decided to put this one on the bottom of the pile."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've read to date","review":"I will be sure to read other books by this talented author. Do not be intimidated by the length as you will find yourself engrossed quickly. The character portrayal is a key element to this masterpiece. This work is extremely thought-provoking and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greastest books i've ever read!!!!!","review":"I just read this book for the first time last year and I fell in love. Don't be intimidated by the size of the book because once you begin you won't want it to end. This book is full of great characters(good and bad)that keeps you glued to the pages. Every emotion you can think of is what you are going to feel from begining to end. This book will be my all time favorite, forever. I hope you all enjoy it as much as I have and still do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follett's Best!","review":"I've enjoyed a number of Ken Follett's thrillers over the years but generally found his work inconsistent. A friend gave me a copy of Pillers of the Earth and convinced me to undertake this huge novel. What a surprise! This is a totally entertaining novel of epic proportions! Though it appears that several reviewers here on Amazon found the novel to be dull and lacking merit, I can assure you that my sentiments are with the majority that consider this novel to be exciting and interesting from first page to last. If you are a reader I believe most people will enjoy this novel. If you enjoy your evening sit-coms and 48 minute dramas, perhaps not."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most incredible","review":"I have read everything that Ken Follett has written...A Place Called Freedom was good, Dangerous Fortune was epic, Pillars of the Earth is a \\"Can't put it down until your eyes are crossed\\" wonder. You just can't stop until you are at the end, which by the way is the only ending of a book that literally made my eyes water....being a man makes that hard to admit...be that as it may, it is a tear jerker at the end....You have to read this book...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinsting trip back to medieval Europe","review":"A great historical novel, even more mesmerizing than \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" and \\" Cold Mountain\\" each of which knocked me right on my___ they were so good. Which isn't easy to do, I've been a round the block once or twice and read a book or two in my time. Do yourself a favor and get a copy of Pillars of the Earth, it is Follett's best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good historical fiction","review":"I was not excited at all to read this 970 page tome, but a friend loaned it to me and I have to return it in a couple of weeks.This is not a fast read for me (too many twists and turns), but it is a great book. The characters are interesting and compelling and the building process is fascinating.I will say that the writing style took some getting used to, but by page 100, I was good to go.It's a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Entertaining Saga","review":"I really enjoyed this book and its characters. It kept me interested the entire way. This is one of those 'must reads' for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"About 400 pages too long...","review":"And with that title I am not saying that I do not enjoy a long, epic tale. War and Peace felt like Of Mice and Men to me, so seamless was the writing. Follett, however, writes like an eighth grader, and at times the prose was so akward and cliche smeared, and the actions and thoughts of the characters so disparagingly over-written that I wasn't just annoyed, I was insulted. Follett seems to believe that the fans of his mystery novels would be his readers here, though his subject matter is a drastic departure. This is where the book fails miserably. A well crafted story, some believable and well-motivated and depicted characters are lost and swallowed whole by horrific writing, anachronistic language, and far too much monotonous and unnecessary over-description. Shame - with a proper editor and a little restraint, this could have been a wonderful novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard, one-dimensional, boring","review":"Is it possible for a person to be ALL good or ALL bad? Yes! If you are a character in this boring, silly book. I managed to wade through over 500 pages of this collosal time waster before I finally tossed it in the bin. Ken Follett could really have created a great story if he had invested more energy in developing his characters into real people instead of cardboard personalities. Sheesh. What a stinker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FOLLETT'S BEST","review":"Eye of the Needle and A Place Called Freedom are exceptional novels but this one can't be knocked down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly gripping introduction to medieval England.","review":"Ken Follett - do the sequel. James Cameron - do the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillars of the Earth","review":"This book contains 1000 pages, and you can't put it down. The writter made you feel you were part of the story....I will definitely read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!","review":"Ken Follet's historical fiction is a masterpiece. All characters and their stories are intense and interesting. If you like historical fiction, don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"I thought this book should have never made it to Oprahs list. It was so predictable and the characters so cliche. I am very very disappointed. Corny story at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"This book is amazing. I had low expectations. I thought the subject of building cathedrals would be dry and boring. But this book is definetly in my best top 10 books ever read and has thoroughly exceeded my expectations. I live across the street from the National Cathedral, and I now see it with a newfound appreciation. I now know what a flying buttress is, and it never occured to me that giant windows in a cathedral were a big deal.This was a great story, and I was very sad when it ended (which is usually not the case with a big door stopper like this book). Can't wait to start the sequal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long reading for long winter evenings","review":"You dive into this world, and though it is very cruel and unpredictable and very different to our modern one, you want to stay there. You start thinking as those people were, you laugh and cry with them, you get used to all those odd thing happening all of a sudden, you even get used to the fact that some people lived in the forest instead of living in a house.This is what happened to me when I was reading the book. At times I thought it will never end - but this was not a complaint but a hope.Unfortunately, it has ended, but I would really love to get back in time to that historical period. Ken Follett did a great job, and I want to thank him for this.This book I will always keep on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"i loved it","review":"My mother reccomended Pillars when I was thirteen years old. I read it furiously, not being able to put it down. The plot twists where fascinating and imagery incredible.

If you want to read a book that is truely an experience read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't be able to put it down!","review":"This book was past around my family, and none of us could put it down. If you're the slightest bit interested in English custom/history this is a good book for you. The depiction of the stuggle to power for both royalty and religion is compelling. I found it unreal how the characters really moved me to laugh, cry, and truly hate the villians. When you're done with this book, you'll want to visit every cathedral in England to see for yourself the amazing architechture that is still standing today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Keeper","review":"I don't mind reading books with 1000+ pages, but this book was definitely 500 pages too long (and these \\"golden eyes\\" just became very repetitive after a while).Unfortunately I had bought the hardcover version, so I kept reading, hoping at some point I would get into this story, but it just became less and less interesting.Well, I thoroughly enjoyed Ken Follett's \\"Night Over Water\\", \\"The Needle\\" and other WW II thrillers and I read lots of historical novels with close to 800 or more pages, but this one just doesn't do it for me.Of course I will continue reading Ken Follett, just not his historical novels. And definitely not the sequel to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"!Certainly not a keeper (I sold my copy at a yard sale later on)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in tedium","review":"Follett slogs along where Michener or Kingsolver might have soared. Michael Crichton gave us more excitement and far more valuable historical insights in \\"Timeline.\\" The ongoing theme of cathedral building is a compelling notion, but the author's handling of the characters and their interaction eventually becomes as tedious to read as the book is weighty to hold (nearly 2 pounds in its paperback form.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical fiction","review":"I'm not a huge fan of historical ficton, so I was very pleasantly surprised by Follet's _Pillars of the Earth_. Set in 12th century England, the story centers around the construction of a gothic cathederal. A wide variey of brilliantly written characters come and go over the generation it takes to complete the massive undertaking, giving a very human context to the stone and mortar construction. While Follet's characters will keep you interested, he also give a detailed account of how medieval buildings were constructed, with a fairly accurate feel for the social, political and economic interests that also come into play. For the lay reader, this is as good as it gets in showing life in the high middle ages. For the historian or armchair scholar there are certainly bones to pick, but the sheer entertainment value of the book warrants 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Superior Piece of Modern Writing","review":"Intriguing and detail-oriented writing. I loved how the details came together. One of my all-time favorite books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pillars of the Earth? I think not: medieval bodice-ripper.","review":"I don't understand how reviews of this piece of overburdened tripe can be so glowing. This is VERY POOR writing-after page 10 I wished they would all get killed-it was impossible to feel empathy with any of them. Honestly he goes on at length when unnecessary and there's barely a moment of interesting cathedral -building to be had. Could have all been told in 300 pages but would probably still come up short. Rutherford's London is a much better read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"I guess if oprah says it's a best seller, then it is, what's wrong with America - what oprah says is far from Gospel. I couldn't get past the first 75 pages, it is written like modern fiction, but it is supposed to be a historical novel? Not quite. Don't waste your money - go to the library if you must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny","review":"I realize this book has been out for sometime. But I just read it and found it a very corny story, which tries to please the 21st century reader with a story set in the 14th century. The author is trying to create an epic, but fails miserably. When I read this book, I realized even more the genius of Hemingway, Hugo and Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but I am thoroughly enjoying it. It is a great story with a lot of twists in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GLORIOUS ESCAPISM BUT SO MUCH MORE!!!!","review":"The Pillars of the Earth is a glorious re-enactment of life in 12th century England. Follett takes the reader on an unforgettable journey of discovery, education, religion, life, love, hate, death, vengeance, revenge, justice... Characters that you love, and hate, and love to hate jump out of the book and then seemingly disappear forever into the pages of history, and then come back into the story with a tear for the reader and a plot twist so profound and brilliant that it makes you weep with joy. It is like the perfect jigsaw. It's the perfect novel and certainly the perfect historical novel. This book is so much more than a story; it's a metaphor for life lived the way it was always meant to be lived.A Truly great and essential read.LR(Greggie)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I really like reading in my kindle and finding good books as this one. I recommend it if you like adventure stories full of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pillars of the Earth","review":"I was recently in Europe and viewed many of the ancient cathedrals. A man in the tour group expressed his disappointment that the laborers that contributed to the building of these magnificient monuments were not remembered. This book is a tribute to them and to the difficulties of their lives. If this book is true to the lives of the people of the middle ages, then those that survived were indeed the strong. Also, this book demonstrates how little people have developed from those days. I'm not speaking of material changes. We still have war, murder, rape , greed, and power hungry individuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite piece of literature to date!","review":"This book is by far Ken Follett's best effort in my opinion. I have read many books by this author and many others and if I had to dispose of my library with the exception of one book, this is the one I would keep. The book is filled with mystery, emotion and action......it kept me rivated and I was sad to see it end. \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" would make a wonderful movie if all concerned would adhere to the story line. Simply, I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not deserve one star","review":"It reads like a bad soap opera. It's shallow, amateurish, inconsistent, absurd and unbelievable. The characters, language, events, thoughts and motives could not possibly be representative of the setting. Probably the information on cathedrals and construction is somewhat accurate but it is not entertaining and seems out of context with the rest of the writing. The most glaring and detracting distractions are the many inconsistencies that occur over and over. Compare the descriptions of Jack on page 554 and then on page 808. The 6 typos I've found so far while not the author's fault just add to the general sloppiness of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Long Read","review":"Pillars of the Earth was an exceptional novel. Every character in the book becomes extremely developed as Ken Follet brings you into their world. If you don't have the time to read this book in a short period, don't worry the characters stay with you and it never takes long to pick back up where you left off. This is an excellent read for a long trip or vacation where you do have the time to put in to get to know the characters. The storylines are separate for most of the book and really begin to intertwine from the beginning. I recommend this book to anyone who loves historical fiction or who loves to be facinated with extremely developed characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great historical tale with nicely interwoven suspense","review":"Have read several of Follett's books, my favorite is Eye of the Needle. He is very skilled at creating enough suspense throughout the book to keep you moving along. In this book he describes the plight of a poor 12th century family living on the edge, and intertwines this with the rise of a monk through the power structure of the church. He is also able to clearly explain the basics of what it took to get a cathedral built in this period in an interesting way. The characters are well-developed, and for the most part believable."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great surprise!!","review":"I didn't know if I would like this book because it wasn't my normal style of writing. What a surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I've never enjoyed a historical fiction novel like I enjoyed this one. Loved the story, although I couldn't get into the architectural details; it just doesn't interest me. I did like how all the characters stories were separate but connected, I enjoyed reading from different perspectives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have read it several times, and will again","review":"I have enjoyed this book several times. it's one of those interesting books that weaves along throughout history, binding characters that you wouldn't expect. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beneath Follet's capabilities","review":"This was a huge disappointment to me. Given that Follet can write a decent book and my interest in the subject matter, it was very much a let down to slog my way through this soap opera of 20th Century characters stuck in mideviel times. Given that I had taken this 700 page tome to Costa Rica and wanted it to sustain the bulk of my beach reading I had little alternative but to read it, although every 100 pages I would flog it across the sand. Maybe if I had hit the surf it would have been ruined such that I would have avoided wasting further time on it. For those that want real adventure of this time period I would recommend you read The Archer's Tale (and follow on books) from Bernard Cornwell. Most of all I wish Follet would have read The Archer's Tale and seen what his book should look like. I won't go near Follet's own sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Poor Storytelling","review":"I tried to keep going, I really did, but I only made it 8% of the way through this book. I kept reading and hoping that it would get better, but alas it did not.The writing is extremely simplistic. \\"He did this. Then he felt that. Then he said that.\\" It completely abandons the \\"show don't tell\\" rule of all writing. I was completely uninterested in the characters and the plot. I would not suggest this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting","review":"Exciting all the way through couldn't put it down! Would thoroughly recommend it. Ken Follett sets the scene and takes you on a journey in an era where trickery and abuse is rife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you travel in Europe","review":"This book gives an incredible perspective to the way in which the cathedrals of Europe were built while also being a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pillars of the earth","review":"I found the book to be overlong and convoluted. I lost interest in it I am sure many others found the book and tv miniseries to be fascinating. This is just one person's opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"Not only was this book highly entertaining, but informative as well. Mr. Follett obviously did some research on historical cathedrals.The characters were vivid and the story will stick with me for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak, overrated, and pretentious","review":"Ok, I was told that this book was great way back before Oprah recommend it. I picked it up for a long plane ride and while it held my interest, it ultimately was a disappointing book.The Author somehow mixed up the idea that a lengthy, convoluted plot meant 'epic'. What you get in this novel is relatively flat with characters each given a few identifying traits.I have a feeling the Author looked through the book he wrote and realized it was quite boring, then did his darndest to throw in some violence and sex to add some 'realism'. While I have no problem with adult content, it seemed kind of forced in the R rated, \\"we want to show some nudity for realism but lets be careful not to show *too* much\\" kind of way.Same with the violence. A few of the scenes were just weak shock attempts.Overall, this seems like the type of novel written by someone who has a lot more faith in themselves then they should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follett","review":"The book was returned to the warehouse marked \\"wrong address\\" and a refund was processed. Expectations were not met for this order with Blackcastlebooks and Media on Amazon. I am not satisfied with this transaction. I responded with feedback and you did not address my concerns. You did not make this right. If you take customer service quite seriously and I haven't had a 5 star experience then this would have been corrected. The breakdown was with Blackcastlebooks completing the wrong address label and keeping my postage due to their error. My refund is off by $5.87. I kept the confirmation and the information I entered into the system at the time of the order was correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I'm afraid to try any other books by Follett. This book was a disappointment. I read half of it and couldn't go further. I skipped around to the ending. Where are the good authors out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent","review":"Too violent for my sensitivities, which is to be spiritually focused. Couldn't get past the violence, so quit reading the book. In general I don't like Oprah's Book Club choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical thriller","review":"I liked \\"Pillars of the Earth\\". Though long, it was never boring - quite the opposite, in fact. I was disappointed that the work lacked the thematic depth suggested by the title. I was also frequently confused by the cathedral terminology. While I'm interested in the Middle Ages, I'm not an architectural scholar. \\"Pillars\\" is very interesting in its depiction of daily lives - usual or otherwise. Suggested for entertainment over enlightenment. Perhaps \\"Pillars\\" is part of a new genre - the historical thriller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping story","review":"Ken Follett has turned his writing talent to the Dark Ages and crafted a story with characters I love. I'm not through the book, but the interweaving of the personal stories is fascinating, and the depiction of everyday life makes me aware of how easy our lives are in contrast to that of the characters. This book deserves all the attention and honors it has received."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Straight Skinny","review":"Extraordinarily wonderful. True epic read. Just when you think you cannot be suprised further...wham!Truly in the top five books on my list of all time.If I were to ever write a book this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorites","review":"I love this book...I read it when it first came out 15+ years ago and have read it a few more times since. A wonderful historical fiction novel, engrossing and fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, but completely worth the work","review":"In this book, Ken Follett provides us with an intricate story about building a cathedral. The characters are unique and well-rounded. There is action, suspense, romance, and interesting facts.Overall, on of the best books I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book,holds you fascinated from beginning to end","review":"Those who love Diana Gabaldon's books, would definitely love this one...The history in it is fascinating and I wish Ken Follett would write a sequel to it!!!!! It is one of the best books I have read recently...Definitely a 10 in my books!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Author is a Master Builder","review":"Mesmerizing tale of historical significance a look at early history of England,Frannce, monistary life and political intrigue.

Alas, if only I were a writer...GREAT BOOK--dont be intimidated by the size *grin*"},{"rating":"1","title":"movies characters in the middle ages","review":"About half way through the 1087 pages of the book I found myself thinking about the author as much as the characters. Where was the passion and mysticism of the times? Where were inspired and lofty thoughts arriving from middle ages faith? Perhaps the author does not believe in these things and couldnt imagine them.The plot and detail about the middle ages are interesting.But the wooden characters seem to reflect the amoral and secular people of our times and are cast backwards into the middle ages. This is Hollywood stuff.Perhaps the book was meant to be made into a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I asked for this book for Christmas 2007 because I wanted to read it so bad. It was painful to try to finish it. I have not read this author before, but have heard very good things about him. Needless to say I will probably not consider him a favorite. I wanted so much to like this book but I was very, very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Medieval soap opera","review":"I was looking for another Name of the Rose; better just to reread it. I was really disappointed in this book. I felt like I was reading Danielle Steele with some hangings thrown in for so-called historical flavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follett was going to write 1000 pages no matter what.","review":"Tedious. Crisis...Resolution. Crisis...Resolution. Over and over and over and over again and again. I am 2/3 through this novel and I am debating whether to just put it down and walk away. I find that the critical reviews here are more in line with my own. I realize that the kiss of death (literally and figuratively) for the main characters is good fortune. It never lasts. Good fortune means bad things are on the way. The villains rape, kill, pillage, and burn. Then they get a slap in the wrist and do it again. Over and over and over and over again and again. Did I already write that?The most accurate review that I have read here so far was titled...\\"400 Pages too long!\\"Why 2 stars? The first half was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written and a real bore","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews of this book. The characters are completely unbelievable and sound like 20th century people with 20th century sensibilities who have inexplicably been plunked down in the 12th century. What a way to take a fascinating time in history and make it completely boring. In the end, I plowed through this book just to see how he was going to tie up all the loose ends. As it turned out, the ones that were tied up were done so in a totally predictable manner and the rest were just left hanging. I don't know how stuff like this gets published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful","review":"I had held off on this book for a while simply because of the length. Now that I am, according to my Kindle, 54% in...I wonder why I have kept reading this far! Words, words, words with nothing being said. I also don't understand the amazing reviews. While parts of the book are slightly interesting I can't figure out why half-way through nothing has really happened. It make take 20 years to build a cathedral, but I can't believe it still takes that long to write about it. I think I finally decided to give up just now. Moving on..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's as good as \\"Gone with the Wind\\".","review":"I'm still reading the book, not finished yet,but totally fascinated and gripped by development of fates of different characters in the story.Although I'm reading a second book which I found it last week in the bookstore,worn-out book still brings me new feelings and excitement as it gave to its former reader.Love interwined with hatred,intelligence vs intrigue,and power of willingness and goodness finally overcome the evils.What happened in Dark age vividly presented by Ken through his magic pen,though the contents of the book differ greatly from his previous works, but effects are same,double the result of the Triple,bringing us to the daily life 800 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!!","review":"I was rivited.

Too bad the \\"learned\\" critics of our time are too short sighted to include this novel in the top 100 books of the century. I suppose they feel that true writing ability and talent has to withstand a certain test of time.I do not reread books. Pillars is the exception. I could read it on an annual basis. It is by far the best of Follett's novels as well as the best of any of his contemporaries. A must read.

I made it to page 800, 800 pages before I threw in the towel! Follet was all over the place, jumping through time when he lost interest in a plot. The sex scenes are over the top male fantasy crap. The discriptions of the building of the churches are brutally boring, I just skipped page after page. I am at a loss as to why people think this is a classic work of fiction. It's akin to a cheap romance novel that just goes on and on and on..... It is about 700 pages too long. Life's too short to waste on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"It's the best book I will ever read!I love itI wish it never ended..Thank You Follet for giving the world sucha great book to readI enjoed every secound with it ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, pretentious writing","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read. Pretentious, boring writing with no drama or tension. The storyline was mediocre, the characters unlikeable. Yet another example of a heavily advertised and marketed book with no substance from an author who might be talented but whose talent hides behind flowery, colourful language.This is a bestseller? Watching paint dry is more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow, don't buy this book. WARNING Please read","review":"Please do yourself a favor and borrow this book from the library. Please don't invest any money on this until you read the first 100 pages or so (if you get that far). You may save yourself some money when you decide to put it aside.I am a normal reader who enjoys most of what I start. \\"Pillars\\" was the most amazingly bad novel I have ever started. Please remember I am NOT a tough critic. This book is written for a 6th grade reading level. SO basic and uninspired writing. Plus the story is so elementary and contrived.Truly a bad book from a language and story perspective. What's left?Remember, borrow this, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"I had many people recommend this book to me and normally I love historical fiction, but I read about 250 pages of this and gave up(I hardly ever do that). This book is SO boring and has no heart. I didn't care about any of the characters and didn't care what happened to them- except the baby that is left on the side of the road to die. If you are looking for good historical fiction try something else- The Outlander, Gone with the Wind, The Heretic Queen- anything but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A crackling yarn","review":"Follett has given us a big, sprawling, magnificent story, rich in detail about 12th-century England, with memorable characters. As always, Follett is thin on characterization, but brilliant at plotting. I didn't want the book to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So very disappointed.....","review":"I had so many people tell me how wonderful this book is and how I HAD to read it. I am so very disappointed. While I won't deny that Follet's characters became intriguing to me, actually reading this book was SO boring and repetitive. Besides the fact that the same descriptions of people and places are repeated over and over again, honestly how many misfortunes can one character withstand? Even the misfortunes themselves start to run together and become repetitive - horrible men do horrible thing to good people, good people find a way to overcome and prosper, same evil men do horrible thing, good people find a way through, repeat, repeat, repeat, repeat....and FINALLY after 973 extremely long, boring pages you reach a less than satisfying conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please, Why Do People Like This??","review":"This is just about the worst book I have ever read . It is all predictably plot-driven with no character development. The men are ignoramous oafs who have no clue as to what is or why things are going on around them. The women can only be strong or intelligent if they are: 1) freaks who live in the woods; 2) hideous; or 3) raped and brutalized. The sexuality and the violence described is completely disturbing. Not to mention that I am not persuaded that the author has portrayed 12th century society. The speech and attitudes seem like something out of the 1970s, not King Stephen's age. The suspense was cliched and the writing just went on and on. Kill off the bad guys already, I thought, and be done with it. If you want good suspense, read Forsyth. If you want Middle Ages, read the Doomsday Book by Connie Willis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I looked at it and said - 1028 pages! No way I was going to finish a book like that, definately not with my record (7 months to finish 'Midnight's Children') Boy was I wrong; awesome...I would say one of the best books I have read. I actually felt like like I was part of the story and at one time did not want the book to finish! Folett has a way of keeping readers continuosly interested in the story, never boring and absolutely unpredictable, a lot of general knowledge about construction (and all very logical as well), and not difficult to keep track of characters as it is pretty difficult to forget the important ones. All together a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Book","review":"\\"Pillars of the Earth\\" by Ken Follett is masterful storytelling, to say the least. The man manages to weave together the lives of so many people that at one point, he actually fools the reader into believing that all of this really happened. The story includes every element and facet, beautiful or ugly, of human nature: anger, betrayal, confusion, joy, sadness, and my personal favorite, the romance between Jack and Aliena. This book is close to one thousand pages long, but there is a certain value behind every word, an intangible integrity. I am a relatively fast reader, and it took me almost two full weeks to read this book. I didn't put it down. Since you are reading this review, it is only safe to assume that you have never read this amazing piece of literature, so let me strongly recommend it to you. And don't flinch at the thousand pages. They go by like ten, and at the end of the book you will cry. Not because of the story, but because there is no more to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Historical Epics I've Ever Read","review":"I came very late to Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth--in fact I listened to the audiobook version after watching the TV mini-series online. Why did I wait so long? This is easily one of the best historical epics I've ever read.And although I didn't think I would originally like the topic or the audiobook--an epic about the building of a cathedral? with a male narrator?--I came to really enjoy the central story of the Kingsbridge Cathedral, and how it linked all of the central characters in the novel together. Follett is a fantastic storyteller, and the narrator of the audiobook really captured the different characters and storylines of the novel. After nearly 40 hours of audio, I definitely found myself wishing there was more!I highly recommend Pillars to fans of historical fiction. It's a great story, with great execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-Time Favorite Book!","review":"My sister gave this book to me, and it sat on the shelf for a couple of years. A book about Catholics, and the building of a cathedral, in the 12th century? I don't think so. Then one day, I picked it up. I thought that I should at least give her gift a try. I could not put it down! This book captured me from the very first page, and I didn't want it to end. It has now been well over a year since I finished it, and I despair that I will never again find another book that blows me away and takes me captive, as this book did! I felt that I KNEW the characters and the time period. I just can't find the words to describe the impact this book had on me.World Without End was okay, but not great. I am now reading Fall of Giants, and it just hasn't grabbed me. I wasn't even sure if I should bother finishing it, but I will try to stick it out. What am I supposed to read now?! I need another Pillars of the Earth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding novel!","review":"This book is very long but it's worth reading. One of the best historical fiction novels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling!!!","review":"I got this book from my world history teacher for extra credit and when I got started to read I couldn't stop reading it! I would spend 5 or more hours straight reading this book. I would recommend to everyone if they asked me about! I loved it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in a long time","review":"I originally read The Pillars of the Earth when it was published in 1989. I enjoyed it at the time. I was 14.More recently I had heard about the sequel and decided it was time to re-read the original beforehand. Wow. I'm having the hardest time forcing myself to get through it -- like some of the other reviewers mentioned I'm scanning the chapters for plot points to avoid the misery of wading through the writing. It's pulpy, the characters are one-dimensional, the prose is ponderous, and *everything* is laid out for the reader. The plot is interesting, but not novel. It's incredibly overrated, and I recommend you skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the fuss?","review":"I don't understand the rave reviews for this novel. Sure it was readable, but so are the Sunday comics. The characters were one-dimensional and really just completely uninteresting. Good guys: Jack, Prior Phillip, Builder Tom, Ellen, and Aliena. Bad guys: William, Bishop Waleran, William's mommy and daddy, Alred. Here's the plot: Bad guys win, good guys win a little until bad guys do something really bad, and then good guys win in the end. He described church architecture a lot, I suppose that's what got everyone so excited? Nothing that special, especially not for 970 pages.After reading these reviews I was expecting something on a grand sweeping scale like Uris's Trinity. But comparing the two is like comparing an All-star to a high schooler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd known","review":"I wish I'd known about the very graphic and violent sex scenes, not to mention the anachronistic language in this book. I love historical fiction and was not expecting \\"f-bombs\\" among other descriptive vulgarities. It was a frustrating read because the characters are great and the story compelling with a unique framework (cathedral building), yet every instance of swearing immediately pulled me out of the time and reminded me that this is just a book. A good editor, it seems, would have recommended far less gratuitous sex, gore and vulgarity. Too bad Mr. Follett lacked such editorial guidance! I can't recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"My wife and I read Pillars of the Earth together and in shorttime. We truly enjoyed the book. Having read hundreds of books, Ican attest to it as being among the best I have and likely ever shall read. Our reasons for enjoying the book concern the beauty in which Follet describes the lives of characters. So many subtleties exist in the interplay between characters, making it a masterful book. We are literally amazed with Follet's skill, weaving characters into a cohesive whole, which up to the very last pages, unwind into a grand conclusion.Contrary to some opinion here, I do not see how the book can be predictable. Granted, the characters of goodness prevail, but each step leading to that victory is as unpredictable as the twists and turns in real life.I find no fault with the historical accuracy of the settings, considering it is based on what knowledge we currently have of a period long ago.Cheers, Shaun Tonstad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge waste of time","review":"This book is redundant beyond belief. Why did the author feel compelled to tell us over and over again what we just read. Also, I found three major type errors. Didn't anyone edit this thing? The four page + rape scene was pointless, graphic and added nothing to the story or character. I struggled to even finish the book. I skipped the beginning of each chapter because of the repetition. The characters were hollow and unbelievable, especially the \\"villan\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"Because I get Starz, thanks to my cable provider, I started to watch the mini series and because I had to miss two episodes, I got the book from my library to catch up. Agree with another reviewer, the Oprah edition is a gorgeous book. Almost want to buy it just to display. My mother was visiting while I was reading it and she reminded me that I poo-poohed her when she was reading it a decade or more ago. So, Oprah and Starz exerted influence on a literary snob.Yes, the mini-series was a howler.............and yes, the book was simplistic......still, I picked up the sequel. Maybe because this type of book is not my cup of tea, I'm not that disappointed & actually sorta, kinda enjoyed both. Call it a guilty pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! It was so entertaining that it took me no time at all to finish it. I loved the way the characters' lives were intertwined throughout the story. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars keeps me guessing!","review":"I've been listening to POTE on audiobook. I listen while I do sewing/quilting. Loving medieval era stories, & combining the story while sewing - I'm in heaven. Ken's ability to keep us on edge with clumps of stories about each (set of) character(s) is great. I highly recommend this book. I would love to play the evil 'Regan'! Audiobooks rock & allow me to relax with a story either in my car or at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, and provides insight into 12th centrury England","review":"A very enjoyable and readable tale centered around thebuilding of a cathedral in 12th century England. The storytakes place in the shadow of palace intrigue, as two factionsbattle to be King. Provides insight into the politicalstructure in the days of kings and earls, and lets youunderstand what it was like to live then. And as thecathedral rises, you can see the trial and error that ledto the building techniques needed for the great cathedrals.One of my all time favorites. I'd love to find other goodnovels of the same era. Any suggestions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a soap opera","review":"Terrible book. The story line consists of lurching from one crisis to another. The sex scenes are way too graphic & over the top. I plowed on to the end but would never read another one of Follett's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little too much","review":"I like historical fiction and have read all of the brilliant books of Patrick O'Brian and Ellis Peters. I have never read Follett before and picked up this book on a friends recommendation.It's pleasant enough to read. I noticed that a lot of reviewers found the book to be informative concerning cathedral building, but there is much less information here than in the great childrens' book on cathedrals by David Macaulay.However, the feature of the book that started to alienate me was the gratuitous sex. It's like the author wrote the book without any sex scenes, and then went back and inserted them every thirty or so pages to keep the reader interested. Rarely do they set a scene or further the narrative. And in all of them, the participants have sex five times in an hour and the women always have an uncountable number of multiple orgasms.It isn't offensive by any means - it's just like a car with too much chrome added on."},{"rating":"1","title":"long, boring, painful","review":"I picked up this book with high hopes of a \\"great read\\" over Christmas break. Oprah raved about it...and so did some of the reviews. I TRIED SO HARD to enjoy this book. But it dragged on and on, the plot never really ufolded into anything new or interesting and the characters were flat and one dimentional. This book had great opportunity, but fell short in every area. If it were half as long and half as violent and brutal....it could have hope. Don't waste your time on this TOO long, boring book. Very disappointing. My husband also read it and agrees with my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent modern classic","review":"This is an amazing epic of biblical proportions.

It is somewhat similar to the book London and Serum, not by the same author."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all time favorite!","review":"This was, without a doubt, the best book I have ever read.

Even if you've never read a book before... even if you hate to read... READ THIS BOOK!!! Okay, now on to my second plea... stop saying that this should be made into a movie or mini-series... NO!!! Every book I've loved that's been touched by Hollywood has been ruined.And a warning to those of you who are avid readers, you will be spoiled after reading this. I read it a few years ago and I've yet to find a book that even comes close to being this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"The Pillars of the Earth is a well-researched and historical fiction novel, I found it captivating. I received a copy of it, along with the new WWII novel,The Triumph and the Glory, for my birthday and thoroughly enjoyed both of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like to read, or even if you dont, READ THIS BOOK !","review":"Pillars of the earth was the best book I have ever read....... by far. From the beginning to the end I was mesmerized with the characters and their rich history. I was also impressed with the research which Ken Follett obviously undertook to create such a great epic. The one point I wish to include is that even if you dislike Period Novels you will enjoy this one. To Categorize this book as boring historical fiction would mean missing out on one of the best reading experiences you will ever enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all-time favorite books!","review":"I love big historic novels, and as far as they go, this book has everything: politics, battle, betrayal, romance, and a lot of great Gothic architecture. I first read this book several years ago in it's physical version, on my mom's recommendation. I was so enthralled that I completed it in just a few days. When I got my Kindle Fire I knew that this was one of the books that I just HAD to download. It's been one of my absolute favorites for a long time, and I highly recommend it...it is truly epic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"Very well detailed book. I love the architectural details and life in general in those days. Got a bit winded at times, but I still enjoyed it tremendously. I plan on reading the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great story","review":"this is a wonderful book, read it years ago and am going to read it again so i can get caught up with the new book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, but not the whole story","review":"For me, this marvellous book was enhanced by my having already read Sharon Kay Penman's \\"While Christ and his Saints Slept\\". Penman's novel describes the deplorable behaviour of contending monarchs, Matilda and Stephen, which caused the horrific conditions endured by the characters in \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\". I highly recommend both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"My all-time favorite!","review":"I suggest this book to every avid reader I know. I have read it 3 times, and remember, this book is 1000 pages! This is great historical fiction, and an amazing epic novel. A MUST READ!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Follet is losing it","review":"This book had some interesting passages, but is in dire need of a competent editor. The ~1,000 pages should have been cut in half. Full of info-dump narratives about building a cathedral, and so on. The author's research floods too much of this work of fiction. Follet should have paid more attention to Hemingway's advice about leaving something out when he knows about it.The book lacks a strong plot-line and just rambles along episodically over several decades in time. Worse, Follet never misses the chance to tell the reader what his characters are thinking and doing -- often several times, just in case we're too dull to catch it the first time.The villains are two-dimensional, and, coincidentally, two of them repent and become humble monks in the ending. Unbelievable. Try \\"The Man from St. Petersburg\\" or just about any early Follet work instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhere between Utter Dreck & the Best HIstorical Fiction","review":"The writer describes numerous scenes of rape and other torture which such relish that the book became extremely off-putting to me. Too bad, because other than the repetitive overuse of certain literary devices, scatterrings of melodrama, and too many tedious technical explanations of edifice construction that belong in an appendix with illustrations; this book had the potential to be a brilliant epic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grossly Overrated","review":"I got sucked into reading this book for a book club. The only honest part of this book was the Preface. The author boldly states that when this was first published, he was surprised at its popularity. He wanted to write a book about his passion for cathedrals. That was the book's only merit. The characters are flat; the plot belongs in a soap opera. Not only did I suffer through this book, but I hopped on board for World Without End...which was doubly awful. But that's another review."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pillars of the Earth","review":"Very slow - very depressing - and when the main character deserted the new born infant on top of the grave site to surely die - I said - that's enough for me.....

However, I was pleasantly surprised. I found the book kept my attention, and I really enjoyed what was obviously a well planned and researched novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing skills bogs this book down","review":"Story is somewhat entertaining but the writing skills of this authors are bad and it definitely prevented me from enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Follett has done it again. This epic novel kept me awake many nights as I was drawn into the lives of it's very human characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"An amazing books that requires patience. I think this is Ken Follett's best book and even his newest sequel doesn't compare. In deference to some of the reviews I wouldn't say that this book will please everyone. But the ratings through Amazon and average ratings here will attest to the quality of this book. Definitely recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I finally got around to reading this book after a friend recommended it several years ago, and I wish I'd taken it up sooner!This is the colossal story of how the fictitious, 12th-century Kingsbridge Cathedral in England was dreamed of, designed, built, rebuilt and finally achieved its ultimate glory. The entire cast of characters, down to the very mundane aspects of their lives, is painted realistically and in great detail. I really appreciated that the author poured his heart and soul into telling the entire story, despite it resulting in a quite lengthy and intimidating book. I reveled in the amount of detail offered -- it only served to fascinate me further about this time period. The only thing that could have improved the story is if Kingsbridge Cathedral had been real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Can be Found in this Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This is maybe the second book I read that was not known as \\"suspense\\" or \\"thriller\\". At first I was doubtful if I will enjoy it but everything can be found in this book: murder, treachery, suspense, rape, love, lust, arson, torture. Regardless of what type of book one might enjoy, this has it all. Excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grim but Hopeful","review":"This was a surprisingly good piece of fiction from Ken Follett. A departure from his usual second-rate techno thrillers, Pillars of the Earth is a harsh and realistic look at life for a peasant family in the middle ages. For those who think that life is tough because they can't afford the new toys they want, this novel will show you what real poverty is. It's a great anti-depressant. Good read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Historical Novels of all Time!","review":"\\"One of the greatest historical novels of all time. Make sure you have an entire weekend with nothing else to do but read when you start this book.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great adult read","review":"Extremely well written. It took me just over a week to complete and I have a toddler. I am conservative so I must warn some that it is very sexually explicit and violent. I enjoyed the book-it makes you feel as if you are there- a great escape!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read for those who love historical romps","review":"For those readers who enjoy a long romp through families and history, this book fits the bill. The characters are well drawn and engaging. The history is fairly well researched but as presented a bit dull, (I have my MA in medieval history although I do not work as an historian.) The Middle Ages are an incredibly fascinating period of time and I would have appreciated a bit more background about the political climate during the time covered in the narrative. But it is a good read. One of those books to curl up with and enter a world so different from your own that you lose yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"fluff","review":"several friends suggested that I read this book because of my interest in the early middle ages/medieval history and literature. So as not to insult my friends, I said it was an interesting book. But here I will admit that the book was fluff. If you are looking for a book with staged intrigue, literary porn, and melodrama in lieu of exceptional writing, then this is a good book. I may not have enjoyed the book, but many others have and many will enjoy it simply for the frolic of a long convoluted story attempting epic proportions."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst","review":"Put bluntly, if this book is read and admired by so many, then there is hope for every historical fiction writer, even those in the Third Grade. I've always found Ken Follett on the whole to be one of the most over rated writers of our time, incredibly inept at plotting, expert at dulling every opportunity for suspense, sprawling time beyond his capability (Probably with one history book at his side as a guide), terribly insensitive to the human experience, exceedingly dull and disjointed story lines, and always leaving me with the questions---That's was all the hype was about? Are you kidding?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"First it was horribly boring. The story just goes on and on and on and on...get the point. There were several times where he could have ended it nicely, but no he had to keep going. Also, it was poorly written. Some sentences didn't make sense and I had to read them over a few times just to get it right! I couldn't wait for it to be done. Way too much description. He should stick to his other books. I bought his new one, but I think I'll return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it!","review":"I was so excited to read this book. I love historical fiction. I love architecture. Someone called it a thriller and I love a thriller so what acould be better?! Co-workers kept telling me how much they loved it so I was very anxious to delve in. But it just didn't ever capture my interest or attention. Just as I would become interested in a character or characters, the book would switch locations and move on to something or someone else. This happened over and over. I would read and read and hope to get involved, but I just couldn't. I finally decided to stop waisting my time, it just wasn't for me. I truly wish I understood the popularity of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A towering saga...I really enjoyed it!","review":"The Pillars of the Earth is set in 12th century England, and centers around the building of a Cathedral, in the town of Kingsbridge. It is a long book with over 1,000 pages, and I was a bit apprehensive when I first started to read it. However, I found the book a fascinating, exciting and enchanting read!The book has a fantastic range of characters, both good and evil, with all the range of human emotions. It is also full of political and religious intrigue. It is the sort of book you can completely immerse yourself in, and forget about what is going on around you. Its story and its characters will stay with me for a long time. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed -","review":"I am not a big novel kind-of-guy. I picked this book up principally to add color to a subject that I was reading about at the time - the history of the middle ages and the history of the Catholic church. I have to say that I enjoyed the book immensely because it seemed consitant with how it was in the 15th century. Ken Follett tells a nice story with a lot of historical accuracy... He multi layered the fictional characters within the framework of historical facts. While I don't see this book at a pure historical novel it has that feel to it.This was my first Follett novel. And, while I am not a historian, the storyline bumped up nicely with how people lived their lives in a world of an all powerful church and self serving political structures. Nice book and enjoyed it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumbing down the literate among us","review":"Let me keep this short. Read the review by Ash of Phoenix as it says what I would otherwise want to share with prospective readers about this moronic tome.The only thing more boring than the 1000 pages of this dreary, predictable, and tiresomely inaccurate \\"historical\\" novel is the pompous self-congratulatory preface by Follett.In it he describes the creative whim that prompted him to deviate from his usual pulp fiction, and he thanks the readers who've allowed this book to gather its cult following. Cult following? Well, okay. I suppose legions of people with the cult(ivated) tastes of a sixth grader . . .I looked at Amazon because I was curious to see what \\"people who bought this book also bought\\" and would not have surprised to see comic books and Cosmo magazine on the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This book owned me until I finished it. Thank goodness for the Kindle so that it could be with me all the time. I am surprised I never missed my stop on the train."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisely liked the book but ending was boring","review":"I didn't think I would like this book because I usually don't read historical fiction but surprisingly, I did. The characters were very well thought of and came to life as you read. You will find yourself hoping the best for the heriones and wishing bad things will happen to the bad guys. The story will pull you in and have you thinking about the characters even when you are not reading the book. However, the ending was a not the great ending I thought it would be. After reading a book of this length and this well thought of, you would think the ending would be.....more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pillars of the Earth","review":"This is a wonderful and thought provoking book.

What a relief! That was one really badly written book. No character development. Hackneyed writing. Repetitive descriptions. Plot plods along with occasional forays into sex and descriptive violence. It was nice of Follet to describe a bit about cathedral building which I think was the pretense for creating this dull lump of verbiage. Never knew that 13th century social values were so similar to those of the 20th century, but I guess the non-fiction I have read or courses I have listened to did not have their ear to the reality of the early middle ages as Follet did. Now I can move on to a well-written novel -- what a pleasure! [As a contrast to Follet's wooden style I have been reading William Trevor's Lucy Gault. What a different approach to storytelling!]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique blend of jazz and classical styles","review":"I love the Turtle Island String Quartet because of their use of a traditionally classical music ensemble to create a jazz sound.

I was able to use the flashlight for getting around in the dark and save the 6-volt battery flashlight for when I needed steady light for more extended tasks. Also, the radio picked up the Philadelphia NPR station (I live near Trenton, NJ) loud and clear and I was able to have updates and \\"conversation\\" on 2 AA batteries all day.

They were stored outside on a reel. I blew air through them before putting them up so the likelyhood of freezing water in the line is remote.

From the chase at the begining to the conclusion at the end, it was all typical Ranma. There are some great fighting scenes as well as a healthy supply of jokes to break the ice. The only fault with it were some of the scenes with Akane and Kirin, Ranma just was'nt meant to be that serious. (My humble opion.

The first 15 minutes of the film will confuse the hell out of you if you know nothing about ranma. The opening chase scene has every character ever created from the series. The plot is half boy/girl (Ranma has a transformation curse hence the tittle ranma 1/2) goes to rescue tempermental fiance. since first impressions are lasting impressions please do not let this be your first ranma tittle.

The movie was good in that it had a large cast an a few good jokes, but that is it. As for a DVD, it rates very poor. The sound is VHS quality, an the video seems to be lacking. There are not a lot of features which you would find in a DVD. What it does have is a nice character profile section which includes an animatied portion so you know how the charater acts.

The author may place a little too much emphasis on the reliance the Nazi's had on I.B.M.However, as some of the past reviews have indicated, this topic has pulled some intense strings. I read this book immediately after rereading THE classic book on World War two espionage \\"A Man Called Intrepid\\". Much of this latter book documents how the the British and Canadians were trying to covertly and overtly stop American companies from dealing with the Nazis from 1939-41.Both books demonstrate the lack of national affiliation or interest in peace & humanity held by the largest corporations in America.Crown's book is good to remind us of what a large corporation will do to make money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful Indictment of IBM","review":"Edwin Black has constructed a powerful indictment of IBM's dealings with Hitler, an arrangement that clearly intensified the killing rate.

Too bad there wasn't more info like that that actually looked at IBMs role in winning the war to counterbalance this decidedly one-sided account. Every step that IBM made during the war years is portrayed as evil and just doesn't ring true to me. If you're going to give IBM this sort of treatment, you're going to have to go after hundreds if not thousands of other companies who backed the Hitler regime. After I finished reading this book I wasn't convinced that IBM was all that different than any other corporation that did business with Germany at that time and am still scratching my head trying to figure out why they were singled out.

As the book shows, IBM certainly made it much easier for the Nazis to locate and identify Jews, it would not have been impossible without IBM.Having said all this - it was an interesting read and although overly wordy is certainly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Anyone criticizing this book probably hasn't read it and is interested in blindly defending IBM. It is ridiculous to think that IBM's CEO, Thomas Watson, didn't know how the IBM machines, and the tremendoes amount of punch cards, were being used. This was a man who received the second greatest honor bestowed by the Reich in the form of a medal. To say that IBM didn't know what was happening is worse than saying that nobody in Germany knew what was happening. IBM was not stupid....they knew. Only now, it is imperative to continue denying.

And after you use the bottom cleaning function, it immediately dumps more ink, filling it up again! This is deliberate, malicious built-in sabotage, forcing you to buy a new machine.

Beside the fact that it cannot do wireless printing, it was decent for what it did do. But, when my wife began to need to print out Powerpoint slides for her class notes, the demon within showed itself. If you want to print four slides to a page, you had better hit print right after you set it to do so. If not, if you make changes to a different setting, then you are likely to get one slide per page. Or, if you are trying to print in black and white, you better make sure you find both places that you have to specify grayscale or you will be wasting more color ink than you intended. Most frustrating, however, is that when you know for a fact that you told the printer to print only odd pages and, lo and behold, it is printing every single page--on the backs of the even pages that you just printed!! This printer is not recomended. Go with the comparable HP multifunction and spare yourself the exorcisms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Airport compatable","review":"I recently ordered this printer and had a nightmare experience trying to get it to print wirelessly on my Mac using an Airport Express and an Airport Extreme base station (I use both in my network). After struggling for 4 hours I discovered via a discussion forum that this printer will not work wirelessly on an Airport network...no mention made by Canon anywhere about that!!! There are other drivers out there written to try to compensate for this lack on the provided and downloaded Canon drivers but they don't do the job.

The sheet fed scanning feature is a big plus over my previous all in one. The only things I don't like about this printer are the poorly lit screen, and the lack of an audible tone following faxing. The confirmation that you have faxed successfully disappears quickly from the screen, and there is no audible signal to let you know that you have succeded. If your fax fails, a page prints, so I guess it does inform you, but I find myself squinting at the window when faxing to confirm transmission, a bit of an annoyance. Otherwise, it is all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a very very dissatisfied consumer!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1","review":"I am a very dissastified customer.

That means either you need to use twice the paper or blow through a lot of very expensive ink for simple documents or faxes. So if you run out of one of the color cartridges you can no longer print b&w; docs - period. It's a serious shortcoming of the printer.I would seriously investigate other printers before buying this one again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good printer","review":"I've had the printer for over a year now and have been quite satisfied.

I than read reviews and discovered this Canon All in One printer and gave it a try for a little more money. What a great choice. This machine is superior. It prints almost in laser quality. It has a quiet mode that makes the printing noise almost disappear. It includes duplex printing mode which lets you print on both sides of a sheet, to save the forest. It is a independent fax machine, copy machine. The document feeder and two separate paper trays, one cassette and one upright feeder are very handy. I love the 4 different ink cartridges so you can replace only the ink it runs out of and not like with HP the whole triple cartridge. I have not tried all the functions yet but I am using the printer with my Mac and setup was a fly without any trouble.

I do like the on-screen scanning directions. Faxing is very easy. My only complaints are primarily with the main paper tray.

Then, when you try all the troubleshooting techniques, Canon basically acknowledges their design flaws. Seriously, I've never been so upset with a product before. Unless all 5 of your ink cartridges are full, it WILL NOT PRINT, SCAN, FAX, or COPY. If you are low on ink, tough luck.

I use it mainly for fast printing and scanning, both of which it does very well for my purposes. Very satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon's Smartchip Ink Tanks Are Expensive","review":"Canon is very clever. They have now put smartchips in their ink tanks so you can't refill them or replace them with generic ink tanks. The chip knows that it was on an empty tank and won't let you transfer it to a full generic tank either. The printer won't print, thinks it's out of ink and won't budge. Generic ink is about $7 to top off all colors. Canon smarchip tanks about $70.00 for a full set. I figure that's about 30 cents a page to print. I will never buy another Canon. If I sold you a brand new Lexus for only $20,000 but it would only run on fuel you had to buy from me at $30.00 per gallon, would that be fair? There must be a special place in hell for those clever, greedy little buggers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of design flaw","review":"Don't run out of ink - be sure you have extra ink cartridges on hand. When the check ink alarm light is on, all functions shut down. Obviously, you can't print, but you cannot scan or fax either. Canon tech support explained that all ink cartridges must contain ink for the fax and scanner to work. I wish I had known this before I bought it - this is a major inconvenience. I considered returning it to Amazon, but the shipping charges (the original, no longer \\"free\\" shipping + the return shipping = $54) aren't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon 530- lived up to my expectations","review":"I was torn between the HP 5610 and this model. After some research, I eventually trusted my gut feel and went with the canon. Two deciding factors were that Canon had 2 years onsite warrenty and the ink cartridges were cheaper than the HP's. Although it was bulkier, I felt it has a better product design in an ergonomic way and would be durable. The setup and installation went extremely smoothly. The instructions were clear. I haven't yet setup the fax or tested it. So far, I have been very impressed with the printing and copying. It was an easy plug and play with my canon and casio camera through the USB cable. Excellent product which I highly recommend.Only problem: The instructions aren't too clear on 2-up, duplex printing.

The worst part of this printer's design is that it uses COLOR ink to print black. This results in the small color tanks constantly running out of ink. Once this happens, the printer will refuse to print, even if you are printing black text.Combine this with the practice of inserting a chip into the cartridges to prevent you from refilling them, and you have a recipe for money going up in a puff of smoke.I bought this printer because I thought the individual ink tanks would be more economical, and instead it's turned into a money guzzler.In the performance area, it has a tendency to smudge and streak.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one year","review":"The head lamp broke after one year and apparently that is the average life of these things.

The scanner gets \\"stuck\\" after about 2/3 of the page and the unit must be turned off and turned back on to resume printing. The result is a copy (or scan) that is muddled and blurry on one side.The really terrible thing about the \\"new\\" unit is the noise it makes when the cartridges return to the original position after printing. It sound like the buzzing of a child's wind-up toy, only 100 times louder, and lasts 15 seconds.

I didn't like either option so luckily Amazon did an exchange.Like some other people said, printer is slow to get started and it's loud. Scan quality is not very good so I just won't be doing any of that. Print quality seems good. I wanted an all-in-one so this will serve that purpose now that I have the fax options figured out.

It did not appear to hinder its ability to work - its just extremely loud and goes on for 15 - 45 seconds at a time.After about 3 years it started putting black streaks on the back-side of every document.

It cannot be set to turn on at some later time. Unlike the older 3 push pad style, which could be set to go on at up to 23 hours from time of inital setting,this one can only be set for the current time. Want to water at 4:00 AM every 3 days, then set your clock for 4:00 AM tommorow morning so that you can program unit.Gilmour really let the consumer down on this one.BTW--Almost all of the reviews here refer to the older 9100 model with touch pads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"After going through a couple of similar units from my local hardware store in just over a year, I decided to buy this guy based on the positive reviews.

I checked them to see that they were working properly and found that none of them were working. I put in new batteries and found that none of the timers worked. They lasted less than a year and a half. I called the manufacturer and they said the warrenty was only good for a year. In the trash they went."},{"rating":"1","title":"price has gone up","review":"I have owned four of these. Only one of them currently works. I have been using these timers (very successfully until recently) to water large vegetable pots and another to water a LARGE string of shrubs. I am experiencing the same problem reported by almost everyone else who is reporting problems - the units won't shut off and they flood my pots. I bought the first more than two years ago. I was going to order another one since this model had lasted longer than any other irrigation timer that I have purchased. Much to my surprise, the price has gone up considerably since I last bought one (september 2008 was $32.00). Given that I have gotten more than two years of service out of only one of these timers, I will just water by hand for now. Can't anyone build a decent, durable, affordable timer these days?"},{"rating":"1","title":"automatic timer never worked","review":"Automatic selections never worked on water timer.

They function for a few months then leak into their electronics or battery compartment making them non-functional. I have tried several different brands of settable timers, we have about ten (10) set up to water our various flower beds, and have found only the Vigoro and Ace Hardware (round green settable ones)ones worth their cost. Almost all of them either leak or stop functioning after one year or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought this locally, returned it not worked.

When I returned the second one, the return desk person pointed to another one sitting in a cart returned earlier in the day. I opted not to try a third time.I believe the folks who like them. They got working ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Worked, Returned it both","review":"I bought this product at WalMart for far less (it may have been a different model number, but otherwise looks exactly the same). I tried the instructions which said to insert the batteries in the back. I used the type of battery they said and I tried hooking it up even after resetting it the way the manual said, but ultimately, neither of them did anything. I listened for any sign that it would do something and set the dials to the shortest run time and starting cycle I could and waited and reset the two that I bought again. Never worked. I returned it to WalMart. I never had a chance to try it for a more than a season like some have mentioned, but Gilmore had a bad taste in my mouth especially if you include the really difficult maintenance of the thing having to unscrew the mounting in the back and to have to ground the battery contacts to reset it. I was not happy at all with this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"One of the worst purchases I've made. Bought 2, 1 never even turned on, returned it. Neither the other nor the replacement worked properly. I have a lot of experience with garden water timers and did everything correctly. Poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well...until 3 weeks after warranty expired!","review":"I am joining the great company of reviewers who bought this item only to have it fail about 3 weeks after the warranty expired. Like everyone else, mine would not shut off. Just to make sure it was not the batteries, I removed them and tested them with a voltmeter - both about 1.52 volts (ie plenty of charge left). I hope I did not throw away the old timer it replaced which while a little less nice ran for at least 4 years before I took it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Solution","review":"This timer is a great solution for those of us that do not have an automatic sprinkler system. It's easy to install and simple to use. I am using it to water flower beds using a soaker hose. Just hook it up, set the duration (5 mins to 2 hrs), set the repeat interval (6 hours to once a week), press the start button and you're done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"timer increments of 15 minutes","review":"This might be a useful timer for lawns & in-ground gardening, where an increment of 15 or 30 minutes watering is desired. I needed it to water plants (bonsai) in pots where water pours out of drainage holes after a continuous 10 minutes using a sprinkler head that I find reliable. If this timer could be set for a shorter watering period, other reviewers recommend it. I chose an Orbit timer, instead. The Orbit timer can be set in watering increments of 2 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 30 minutes or more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for our make shift sprinkler system","review":"We were renting a place without a sprinkler system. We didn't have the time to go out everyday to water the grass so we set up a make shift sprinkler system with this. Worked great until it stopped working. Contacted the manufacturer and they promptly sent me a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks internally","review":"this timer leaked almost immediately on its first use. It worked sporadically. I left it outside for the winter (water turned off inside the house and hose drained) and by spring it wouldn't work at all. Water had leaked into the the timer compartment. Maybe not designed for that kind of use, but I'd certainly try another brand before I bought one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have tried several of these-not good","review":"Over a three year period I have tried several of these but none lasted over three months. Moisture condenses inside and the circuit board fries. I have been careful to keep them covered, out of the rain & off the ground but result is the same.There is an obvious design flaw in isolating the circuit board. I thought it was the seal where the batteries go but it's more than that one place. The problem seems to be inside where the ball valve erodes the gasket separating it from the electronics.For the short period of time it works great but not worth the price for such a short lived and poorly designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good tomer","review":"I have 4 of these bought 3 months ago. Have had to return one unit after 4 days, now 3 more are not working. setting is difficult and battery replacement requires taking the unit off and using a screw drive to reset and replace. No low battery light. No user friendly, not reliable, not durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUutdoor, but not water proof?","review":"My second Gilmour timer, the previous more expensive item \\"electronic timer\\" version cracked right down the plastic piece that is supposed to do all the turning.So I went for the cheaper version this time, with the nice simple dials. Got a good two months out of it (maybe 30 uses?) before the batteries died. Simple fix, went to replace them, and had a torrent of water come out when I removed the battery seal. (seal is an overstatement it seems). And this is during summer!Removed the rust, and tried to dry it out, but impossible to get inside the case. Then noticed more water leaking from bottom, suggesting there are a few more drips in there than desired.Need to try some other brand. In16 months of home ownership, have gone through 2 Gilmour watertimers and two Gilmour hose sprinklers. Seems their durability is rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable, don't buy this model, save your water.","review":"used it one season and towards the end of last summer i noticed the shut off valve was allowing water to continously pass thru. Ouch, how much water did i waste last year? Its a new season and i forgot all about that valve. I set it up and was testing the program and realized after the valve closed water was still getting by. I had to post this so others don't make the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two attempts, two failures","review":"Bought the model pictured (with two rotary knobs) at a local box store, but it only worked for a few days. They replaced it and it worked for three months - until the batteries died. With new batteries the valve would not stay open. It merely cycled open, paused momentarily, then closed. I'll take it back again and see if they will honor the one year warranty. Granted, it did work reliably for three months, but I DO NOT RECOMMEND this product. The settings for watering frequency and duration are somewhat limited and a bit confusing. The controls feel cheap and the sound the unit makes while opening/closing is like a cheap toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gilmour 9100 stops working in less than a year","review":"A year ago, I bought two Gilmour 9100 water timers to run some soaker hoses in the gardens. They are easy to use BUT they aren't coming on automatically after about 10 months of use. The manual start works fine. The timer cuts off after the correct number of minutes. However, the timer WILL NOT START automatically. That rather defeats the purpose of having a timer. My garden turned very dry here in Texas through May and June and I am replacing plants I shouldn't have to. And yes, I did try changing the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have given it a zero","review":"i bought this timer about 6 months ago as a replacement for a better programmable one. after researching some, wanting to buy locally, and getting something not so expensive, i settled on this one. after reading reviews of several other gilmour timers, i concluded that many are affected by the elements (go figure). so i put a plastic bag over this one so it wouldn't be rained on (my last one broke because it was rained on and water got inside the supposedly sealed battery/electric compartment. well, this one broke too. i would not recommend gilmour timers. other products of theirs i have used have been fine, but not the timers. hopefully, i can write them and they will send me a refund, because i certainly don't want a replacement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered three of the 9100's the first week of June, 2008. I was surprised that one of the units had completely stopped working by the second week of July and then a week later a second unit failed. Replacing the batteries did not help with either of the failed units so I will be returning all three units for a refund. The refund will only be a partial refund since it has been over 30 days since I made the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for ONE summer and that's it.","review":"I bought the first one and loved it, so I bought the second one for the back yeard. They worked well for the entire summer and fall... so the winter came, and before freezing, I remove them and stored in an appropriated place. This year, I changed the batteries and installed them again... the first one does not turn off... if keeps on forever... and the second one, turns on... and after 5 seconds it turns off despite my configuration. Well... I will have to turn the water manually now, because I am not willing to sepend $80.00 for a machine that only works one season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Ignore the product photo.

Don't Buy This!!","review":"I love this design, but when I received mine it didn't work. I called Gilmour and they said this model was discontinued because the electronics don't work. It was too late to get a refund from Amazon, so they graciously offered to refund my money. Gilmour pulled the product out of stores, but I guess they're still for sale online in some places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk, in a community of junk","review":"I bought a 9100 last year to water some new grass at my campground. I set it up the 1st week, and left for the week. Next weekend, dry lawn. This timer worked by turning a ball valve 1/4 turn to go from off to on to off. Well, it just started to turn continuously until the batteries died. New batteries showed the fault. Out of luck.This year, with no choices at Lowe's, I got another. It worked for 3 months this time, and then just stopped working. Out of luck again.Looking on-line at Amazon, I am amazed at how many timers there are out there, and what a pile of crap they all make, based on reviews.I found that the only consistently well reviewed timer was the Claber series, so I have ordered that.

I have used Gilmour products for many years and have been generally satisfied. After I installed a drip system in some new raised beds I was just naturally drawn to the Gilmour products.The timer worked as it should for two days before it stopped. I was confused so I thought maybe the batteries I installed were bad. I opened the battery cover and the insides were full of water. The cover was tight and there is no other place I could have screwed up. Lo and behold as I looked at it, it slowly filled with water again. Obviously a seal was not holding...Time to shop for another timer...."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good","review":"I have only used the product for a month, but to date I am very pleased.

I have used other timers with liquid crystal readouts from Gilmour and others and find that the displays generally die or partially die after about one year.

I spent about an hour trying different things to make it work and I was totally disappointed. I wasted my time. I understand that things could go wrong with products. I got a taste of what the company thinks about their product when I called the Gilmour customer service the next day. The customer rep suggested that I buy another model of their product which is more reliable. Reading between the lines 'We do not trust our products'. They should not be in this business if they do not trust their own products.I am disappointed that Amazon carries such products! Amazon agreed to credit me for the product.

Songs such as \\"Mystery\\"; \\"Heartmagic\\"; and especially \\"Sa'Brooke\\" lovingly sung by Stephannie in the celtic tongue. \\"DonaCreiTun\\" is magical, \\"Ehsellyei\\"is rich with longing, and finally 'Veil of Elphame\\" weaves a tantalizing elfin quality into this fresh and delightful album guaranteed to delight those of us who adore the notion of faerie folk whether real or imagined.

Do not let the \\"retro\\" style deceive you. I know many seem to turn away because this series is based on an old manga series, but don't let that get to you. You'll be missing out. Dismiss the nay-sayers and watch it for yourself.If you are expecting explosions and action packed adventures every five seconds then this might not be the series for you. There is a lot of focus on the two main characters, Jomy and Keith, and their growth over time. It's about MU and their relationship with the rest of humanity and the computer system that seeks to destroy the Mu. This relationship is perfectly reflected in both Jomy (the Mu leader Soldier) and Keith (the perfect human that is supposed to lead humanity).

(just kidding - it actually worked for 2 months - and then stopped)very satisfied with the video quality for my recording, just as the product review says.audio quality of recording - poor. too much static noise.Audio quality overallHorrible. I always felt my ear wasnt THAT trained to be fazed by some noise. I know better now. After using my CD player, I cant hear the same song on this system!!!Advice to potential buyers:Please check the system to see if you are ok with the reduction in quality. otherwise go in for a piece with less features (if need be) but do not compromise on the audio quality!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the obon songs!","review":"If you are looking for a recording of all the traditional songs from Obon festivals, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Receommended","review":"I've been a small business owner since early 2002, and like many others in my industry I've felt starved of genuine, honest advice on running a professional PR campaign.

I'd have to say no. The Bells Of San Filipo simply defies description. It begins with a hapless prospector who stumbles upon an ancient cache of silver and then... the book takes turns and twists the reader cannot even guess at. Shakespearean scope, myths, criminals conspiring, gang wars... in a book of 200+ pages. Picking up a Brand western is always something special but, every now and then, he tosses a tale at you that just makes you read in awe of his imagination. If you like the unconventional, Brand is for you. The Bells of San Filipo is something very, very different. And very, very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The song, 'Been There'!!!!! AAAAAGGGHHHHHH!!!!","review":"I really hate the song, 'Been There'. I have horrendous memories of sitting on the schoolbus while our bus driver played this song at full blast, and even after many years of not having ridden on that godforsaken bus, that terrible song has never quite left my mind. It is absolutely the worst song I ever heard in my entire life and whoever likes it should get their head checked. Seriously! I'd listen to NSYNC before I would ever listen to this horrible song, and I despise boybands! I hope that song's no longer on the air, because it really, really, really sucks. And, unfortunately, the fact that it can get stuck in your head just might drive you insane.Avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SIMPLE CRITIQUE OF CLINT BLACK'S SONGS","review":"For the most part, all of his songs on this second greatest hits compilation are terrific and fun to listen to, with the exception of \\"When I Said I Do\\", a duet which he cut with his wife, Lisa Hartman-Black, a cheesy, fourth-rate actress who couldn't carry a tune in a bucket. Her talent for singing clearly isn't there and her voice is shrill and annoying, so I skip this track every time I play this disc at home or in my truck.

It is more than what I expected. I can get through the first level, but after that, I can't get much further. I have tried everything to get past the second level, but it is quite frustrating. I hope that Nintendo releases a players guide for this game soon because that would really help out alot. I got through the first Banjo-Kazooie on N64 with help from a players guide, but you need one for this game. Unless Nintendo releases a players guide, I will not be able to figure this game out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well im not sure about this one...","review":"Because they were suppose to make Banjo-Three-ie forgamecube but they have not made it yet.I will have to think about buying this one even though it wasnt the origanal 3rd release i will check it out"},{"rating":"2","title":"You really need a players guide","review":"I really enjoy this game.

There's races you compete in,time trials and the works,just like in the other two for the 64.

However, this is a nice addition to the series. A few people have stated that a players guide is needed, I don't agree. First of all, I don't use them ever for any game. Second of all, If you can read you will have little trouble with this game. If you can't read, a players guide will do you no good anyway. People ages 8 and up will find that a little searching and puzzle solving is all it takes. Stop taking the fun out of your gameplay with player guides. Okay, some are also saying that this is a 3-D game, it isn't. It's more of a view from above type game. Yes, Banjo moves in 3-D, but the environments do not. Bottomline.. if you are a fan of the series you may enjoy this addition. Also it looks pretty good on a larger screen, this is if you are playing through the Gameboy Player as I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Valenti's guide to the keyboard Partitas of J.S. Bach is an entirely subjective account of his personal interpretive whims. Written in a scripted, question and answer format (with dissapointing results) each movement of each Partita is alloted about three to five questions which, frustrating for the serious performer, tend to focus on historical asides rather than specifcs of articulation, dynamics, slurring, etc. In addition to this, these questions are often far more vague and juvenile than one would expect of an experienced musician ready to learn these monumental works. Occasionally the author will compare different editions of the Partitas and point out some important thoughts on ornamentation, but one would do better to spend the forty dollars on several good recordings of the works, which will likely be far more illuminating and enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"Maestro Valenti displays the accumulated wisdom of a lifetime of study of numerous scholarly sources as well as a personal achievement of being one of the world's greatest harpsichordists of his era. He was the first professor of harpsichord at Juilliard, and chosen to play at The Prades Festival by Casals. He recorded almost all of Domenico Scarlatti for Westminster and revived interest in Antonio Soler for whom he displayed an unique talent. In this book he gives specifics for the interpretation of intricate nuances of the partitas in a question and answer form drawing on questions by former students.His enormous intellect, extensive scholarship, and irrepressible sense of humor will delight the reader as he guides the most sophisticated player to achieve perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pianomania, my life","review":"Pianomania one of the best movies I have seen.

Before the end of the first chapter I wanted to take the salesMAP test myself to see how I would perform. It turns out that the test is not in the book but online and NOT part of the purchase price of the book. To give the test to prospective hires would require prepaying for the tests in lots. I quickly skimmed the remaining chapters and soon discovered that reading the rest of the book would only make me feel incapable of making a hiring decision without using salesMAP.

He may be a specialist on the subject, but he offers no supportive data for his empirical evidence. I found his take on circumcision to be particularly problematic. He makes a brief argument for circumcision but offers no information on the studies he draws his conclusions from. Oh, and he also says that one should circumcise their boy so that he doesn't look different, thus implying that there is something offensive of the site of an uncircumcised penis.I wouldn't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD for a nice evening / dinner ambiance","review":"I love it.

That same friend recommended three books by Jake Bernstein, How The Futures Markets Work, Strategies For The Electronic Futures Trader, and The Complete Day Trader II. I started my education with How The Futures Markets Work. This book gives an outstanding overall picture of the futures markets. Everything from the trading floor to the basics of technical analysis to the psychology of investing is covered in this one book. This is the introductory textbook for the amateur futures trader. If you're wondering where to begin, I highly recommend this book to be you're starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too shallow to be of any real use","review":"The problem with this book is that it adresses too many points, providing little or no detail on each of them. All the book does is merely tell you there is something like Fundamental Analysis, Technical Analysis, etc., but it is too shallow to really learn something useful about all these fields.Personally, I ordered this book because I wanted to learn more about the inner workings and the behind-the-scenes aspect of the futures markets.

Only complaint is the cumbersome battery case and cheap feeling plastic construction. However, none of this mattered when it just stopped working 4 months after purchase. Gave absolutely no signs before hand, just working one day, completely dead the next. There are other reviewers here that shared my same fate, so if you want to gamble with these, go ahead, but know that the risk is a pair of dead headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Novelty for games, not music.","review":"I thought these were really cool when I first got them. The vibrating bass is really cool at first. Then you realize that the overall sound quality is very poor. When the vibration is turned off, there is absolutely no low end at all. Its all highs and mids. The battery life is very poor as well. I bought these for $30 and I still think I got ripped off. The vibration does not compare to real bass. There is only one \\"feeling\\" you get out of this that makes every bass line from every song seem the same. Real bass has different frequencies. They are alright for playing games or watching movies but definitely not for music.Bottom line they are cool at first, then you realize how much of a novelty they are. If you are looking for good sound, look somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Style, Mediocre Sound","review":"These headphones and others made by the Skullcandy brand have a good sense of style, but my problem with these headphones was the sound quality. The built in \\"subwoofer\\" is a pretty fun feature, and it sounds pretty decent. The bad part is that the sound as a whole isn't very good, It seems like there is a lot of high to mid-high sound, and TONs of very low-end sound with the subwoofer on, but little or no true bass sound, which is very dissapointing. I could barely even hear the bassist on most rock songs I listened to, with or without the subwoofer on.Another major complaint I have is that the subwoofer in the right earpiece started to make rattling noises after I had the headphones for about two weeks and I had to send them to the manufacturer.Overall a decent headphone if you're not picky about sound quality, and you just want something that looks pretty cool. If you want something that delivers more in the sound department, get a pair of Sennheisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK for home use","review":"I use it on my computer since I live in an apartment and can't play loud music at night.

The bass part worked fine, but the signal from the tv couldn't power the headset enough to hear the dialogue or music clearly, so I had to buy an in-line amplifier. The in-line amp only played one loud, deafening volume, so I had to buy a third item, an in-line volume control. I finally have what I need now, but, all told, at quite an expense, and what a mess of wires!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones","review":"These headphones sound really amazing for the price.

I seriously spent a half hour disassembling and reassembling them because I assumed they must have been assembled wrong.With the subwoofer off they have virtually no bass and sound worse than the headphones you'd be given for free on an airplane. With the subwoofer on, they buzz horribly and muffle anything that isn't bass. The battery pack has a wheel to adjust the subwoofer volume, but its a joke and seems only to work at min or max.I have no idea where the good reviews are coming from. This is seriously the worst set of headphones I've ever owned. Save your money towards a good pair of SONY studio monitors or something that isn't just a marketing gimmick aimed at teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par","review":"I bought these thinking they would be sweet but they really are not that great of quality.

It had some really great fight scenes; the acting was good; the special effects were surprisingly well done as well.

The cover almost looks like the original, only a cheaply printed xerox copy with faded colors. The movie is also in Fullscreen, cover art visibly patched non-factory style onto the disc (DVD:R). The movie is heavily pixilated, hard to watch. The image is so blurry, it's almost like watching an old VHS tape.I am outraged. Don't want to bother with the return. The cost was $5:97 total, so not worth the hassle. Buyer beware!!Quick update:I forwarded my review to \\"bargainmovies\\" the same day and they graciously offered a refund to settle this situation.They claimed that they had no idea it was a bootleg.

Not to say that they still aren't good. All the songs on this CD will probably be playing on the radio for a long time to come.

This seemingly insignificant point has always been a pet peeve of mine, but nothing to complain about here. The waistline is pleasing and slimming, and I do like the way that the wrist opening can be tightened to cut out the wind and chill. This anorak feels lightweight, however it really keeps out cold Mr. Winter. Another good feature is the placket that underlies the zipper -- another good way to stay warmer.All in all, this is a great bargain, a quality anorak, and a \\"good friend\\" in the wintertime.

It did help that but didn't eliminate it (has more to do with the users than the dish!). It looks nice but the lid is poorly made. It is misshapen so doesn't fit very well at best, and when rotated around the other way fits quite poorly. This isn't a big deal, it does work, but should be better made for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Preposterous!","review":"The point of purchasing a 'covered' butter dish is to 'cover' the butter - UTILITY! The extremely flimsy lid merely sits, precariously, on top of the pot; and only if turned in 1 direction. I was not expecting an airtight seal, but, the lid does not even lie edge-to-edge. There is plenty of room for the contaminating fridge air to funnel in - the butter turns in color & taste, poste haste! The design is so inherently flawed that one must 'hold' the lid in place when moving the pot, even slightly, else the lid will just slide/fly right off.I mentioned the flimsiness of the lid. Please understand, if the edge so much as taps the counter (or, anything not soft), BAM it will break like shale. The same goes for the top edges of the pot. Again, the flawed design: the edges are tapered to near paper thinness.If looking for utility, avoid the headache here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover does not fit correctly","review":"I wish that I had read the reviews instead of just relying on the average rating. As another person mentioned, there is a design flaw and the cover does not have a snug spot to rest in the base. So the cover slips and slides, frequently falling off of the butter dish. I also am concerned that this non-snug fit does little to protect the butter inside. Since it was so cheap, the shipping would probably cost half of the return amount, so I will probably just chalk this up to a lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful and Attractive","review":"I like this butter dish quite a lot. We have Mikasa's Italian Countryside dinnerwareMikasa Italian Countryside 45-Piece Dinnerware Set, Service for 8and while it is not an exact match (I'm glad it's not,) this butter dish looks nice with our dishes. I may get the Sophie Conran large salad bowl as well. The function of the butter dish is what initially attracted me. We keep our butter out on the counter top, which caused the covers on traditional butter dishes to get messy as we cover the soft butter. This dish keeps the butter in the deep receptacle, which can hold two sticks, and covers with the flat lid. The lid is NOT a tight fit and would slide off if tilted. It looks very nice out on my counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and unique","review":"I like this butter dish - it's attractive and unique. A couple of things to note -- it doesn't \\"seal\\" tight - it's porcelain so it can't. But butter doesn't need to be sealed tight. Also, it's hard to tell from the photo but it's extra wide -- you could put two sticks of butter side by side in this dish. There just aren't great butter dish options out there -- they're all plastic and ugly. We use a lot of butter in our house, so it sits on the counter all the time.

Also, the weeks didn't conform with the months. For example, my baby had just turned 7 months and was 30 wks. old. The book refered to 30 weeks as 8 months old and scared me into thinking my baby should be crawling at that age. Luckily I have other books that confirmed that at 7 months, most babies aren't crawling yet (though a few might be.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's gotta go back to the store","review":"I bought this book because, for the most part, I am enjoying \\"Your Pregnancy Week by Week\\".

This makes no sense - this is the sort of information that should be presented at the beginning of the book - in a section on what to do/buy before baby's arrival (not when baby is 10 weeks old). And in week 12 chapter, the book gives advice about preparing your pet for baby's arrival - \\"during your pregnancy\\" and \\"before bringing baby home from the hospital\\". It seems as if the editor (who seems to know nothing about raising an infant) cut and pasted sections of each chapter in a completely random and non-sensical order.

I dutiful read each week, but constantly felt alarmed and concerned about my childs development (and I'm normally a laid back person). My pediatrician told me that my child was fine and had no signs of delay, and to throw away the book. I did, but this was only after months of reading over and over again that my baby was \\"behind\\" and not doing what they were supposed to at each week. This is just not encouraging or comforting for a new mom. I wish I never had read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"My son is 14 weeks old, and I decided today that I'm done with this book. My complaints are the same as the other one-starrers: I realize that all babies are different, and some milestones will be reached early or late, but my son is consistently behind every week. This makes me worry unnecessarily and causes stress I don't need.Most chapters also contain filler that I can't use at all. For example, in-depth discussions of child care pop up in \\"Week 4\\" but I live in California and I'm not returning to work until my son is 16 weeks. Information on immunizations doesn't show up until \\"Week 9\\". Um, we'd already been through 2 rounds of shots by then, thanks.I can see myself paging back and forth, trying to find information, and the index for this book is no great shakes.I don't like it. It seems to be written for a very different baby than mine. If you look it over, I bet you'll feel the same way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not use as a reference","review":"I threw this book in the trash today. Every baby is different and this book really pushes the boundaries of where a child should be developmentally. Walking (or cruising as they call it) at 9 months? I don't think so. Not for my baby, and I am fine with that. If I relied on this book as a guideline for where my son should be I would be a stress case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible execution","review":"I thought this book sounded like a fun one, and I picked it up without reading too carefully. I figured it would be developmentally focussed and wouldn't contain too much opinion or misinformation on other matters.Boy, was I wrong.I almost didn't make it past the first chapter. As other reviewers have mentioned, the book contains serious misinformation about the care of uncircumcised boys -- retraction of the prepuce is painful, unncecessary, and can be dangerous.The opinion laden discussion of feeding and diapering (in a developmental book? Oh please!) was couched in \\"informational\\" terms, but was extremely biased in favour of disposable diapers and artificial baby milk.Having persevered, there is some interesting information here, but rather than pass this book along, I will be throwing it away.The misinformation far outweighs the good stuff -- all of which is available elsewhere.To pediatric writers: this concept is still wide open for development! Please?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid - Riddled with Errors","review":"Nice idea in theory, and does contain a fair amount of useful info, but the errors, often significant, outweigh everything else I'm afraid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't normally burn books but I will make n exception for this one.","review":"I am too busy to go way in detail but, this book has the absolute worst breastfeeding advice I have read. It doesn't even give the AAP's full statement on breastfeeding. Blah, this book really sucked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for tired first time mom's","review":"I loved the book because the chapters were short and too the point. I returned to reviewed the books several times. When you are tired reading in short increments helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could only give it a ZERO","review":"Only 38 pages into this book, I've had to put it down in sheer awe of how utterly inaccurate this book is.From the questions it suggests you ask a prospective pediatrician to the AAP's \\"neutral\\" view on circumcision, this book is obviously written in a very biased undertone.Thankfully, I got this from the library. All I have to do is return it and try and forget the bad, bad information it provided.Keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Read","review":"This book is a good tool for just a simple guideline on development but it's not very up to date on some of the more \\"controversal\\" issues. If you plan to breastfeed or co-sleep, this book doesn't favour either. It also seems to favour commercial baby food and other products over making your own. It also doesn't discuss alternative ways to immunize children that might be less harmful for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date","review":"While there are parts of this book I enjoyed, there were many more frustrating aspects to it. The milestones seem to be consistently REALLY early. In a group of 20 babies, frequently only 1 or 2 have hit any of the milestones in the given time frame. In addition all of the feeding information is contrary to what my pediatrician has given (when and how to start solids, when to wean -- 4 months?). What to Expect was much more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate information and Not Encouraging of Breastfeeding","review":"This book should come out and say their real agenda in the \\"Letter\\" at the beginning of the book. They are Ferberizing, anti-attachment parenting, non-supportive breastfeeding authors that gives lots of inaccurate information.Similar to other reviews, I was shocked about the information regarding non-circumcision care (definitely, do not pull down the foreskin!), cloth diapering (I don't cloth diaper, but I do know the problems with disposables), and lack of support for breastfeeding. It seems every other month they give tips on how to wean (nonsupporting of the U.S. government's Healthy People 2010 report). In the burping section, it says not to burp between the shoulder blades, but when I asked four medical professionals they didn't understand why the book would say that. Why give parents more things to worry about when it is not true!? There are so many inaccurate passages in here, I don't have the time to waste on such crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only I could give it zero","review":"I read this book with my first child back in 2004. I don't think I really looked at it again once she arrived. When we had our second child 4 months ago, I pulled it out. Much to my dismay there is so much wrong info that I just never saw until I had BTDT. The mention of weaning from breast milk to formula at 4 months boggles the mind, especially since the AAP say breast feed until at least one year and the WHO says two. The AAP also do not start solids before 6 months. THe milestones are totally off and the weeks months don't match.As a second time mom, I say don't waste you time with this - Get the Sears book instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect and HARMFUL!","review":"Shocking how a book like that makes it on the market. Some of the information (like care of the uncircumsized baby) is so wrong, it is harmful to your baby's health to follow it.Don't buy this book. The info is out-dated and incorrect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy \\"The Baby Book\\" (Sears) instead!","review":"Really quick...Do yourself a favor & leave this book on the shelf!

These people are Doctors?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, why does Amazon not allow zero stars?","review":"Other reviewers have summed this book up very well, but I had to add my two cents. Yes, bad, outdated advice and absolutely ludicrous organization. As a book lover I will do something I never thought I would do - I WILL throw away this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some serious editing","review":"I agree with several of the previous posts--this book contains SOME good information, but most of it is erroneous and poorly written. The weeks and months don't match up, and dozens of \\"developmental milestones\\" are downright wrong. I have training in developmental psychology and I worry that parents are going to take this book as gospel truth. In actuality, most of their developmental milestones are very advanced for what real babies are supposed to be doing.Use this book with caution!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it even for free","review":"We received this book for free from neighbors whose baby is a few years older than ours. In short, I agree with the other one-star reviewers. This book is not worth it even for free. Probably the worst aspect of the book (though the poor organization is bad enough) is that it's riddled with factual errors. As others have pointed out, some of the factual errors are so bad they're not only dumb, but dangerous to your child.This book should not only not be purchased by anyone, it should be taken off the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around book","review":"I thought this book was a very nice book to have to use as a reference & also just for fun. It states clearly in the book that your baby may be doing things sooner or later than the weeks that it talks about it in the book. However, it is still nice to have a bit of a reference. Especially for first time parents.I've really enjoyed the book personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for those with COMMON SENSE","review":"This is a wonderful book. It tells week by week, what the AVERAGE baby will be doing. It can be used as a wonderful guide to know how to assist your baby in growth, or it can be used as a guide to drive yourself insane because your baby is not doing a certain thing by a specific week. For example: Babies get their first tooth at the average age of 7 months. Since some babies are born with teeth, that means some must not get them until they are a year old. If you are the type of person who can see the book as a guide, it is a great one. If you are paranoid or a hypochondriac. DON'T BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Price","review":"I purchased this book for our daughter who is about to give birth to our first grandchild.

I have used this book for many years as a great reference guide. I honesly really love this book because the authors discuss everything (I'm sure there are things left out but I doubt there is much).

The book has been wonderful when it comes to preparing me with what my daughter will be doing and for the most part, the book is right on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great first book!","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

Stick with the first one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the WORST book full of WRONG and TERRIBLE advice!!!","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed the Pregnancy week by week book. If I wasn't a mother who did research on my baby's development and just read this book, both myself and my baby would be in trouble. This book recommends weaning from breastmilk at 16 weeks (The AAP recommends 1 year), feeding your baby juice(Only if you want to encourage bad habits and cavities), allowing your baby to CIO (which has been proven by developmental psychiatrists to be BAD for babies!) feeding your baby fruit first and not veggies - this book is terrible. I don't see where an OB even has the right to write a book on baby development! These authors should be ashamed of themselves for even publishing this rubbish! Get The Baby Book by Sears instead. This was a BIG waste of [amt]. I would have rather thrown it out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there.","review":"If you're using this book as your only reference on baby care, you'd find yourself relatively uninformed on several important topics. For example: Breastfeeding is covered in a very cursory way. No pictures, no descriptions of techniques, only a half-hearted endorsement. The rest of the section sounds like it was written by baby formula manufacturers. In general, it was not a very well written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"contains incorrect info that could be harmful","review":"First off, the main author of this book is a gynecologist, not a pediatrician. Secondly, some of the information in this book is completely against what the American Academy of Pediatrics says. The worst issue I found was in regards to caring for an uncircumcised newborn. This book says in Week 1 to pull back the foreskin and clean under it at every diaper change. DO NOT DO THIS! The foreskin is still fused to the head for several years. Pulling it back before it naturally retracts can cause extreme pain, damage, and possibly lead to infection and problems down the road. The American Academy of Pediatrics even states to NEVER forcefully retract the foreskin. This book also states that you can microwave bottles, which every bottle manufacturer and formula company warns can be dangerous. I don't trust any information in this book and an horrified by the misinformation. I would NOT recommend this to a friend, or even to an enemy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest book for a new Mom!","review":"This book was instrumental for my husband and myself as new parents!

This is his attempt to jump onto the Celtic bandwagon and it fails miserably. Dirty Linen magazine tore this album to shreds. It barely registers as Celtic. There's no fire here, no spirit. It's like the Disney version of what Celtic music should be. David should stick to his etherial compositions and leave the Celtic music to those people who make a living at playing celtic music.

First of all, the archery minigame makes the game very fun. The battles are a bit repetitive and the siege minigames are a bit hard, but overall with the excellent graphics, great voiceovers and overall coolness of the genre, this game is worth every penny. The swordfights and jousts are very interesting as well. The story is quite entertaining and can be ended several ways, adding to the overall variety of this game. There are several lords that you have to face, with varying strategies and personalities. However, one final note, if you're going to get this game (I highly recommend it), get the xbox version, not the PC version. The PC version crashes a lot and is harder to play. This version almost never messed up on my xbox and is easier because of the controller being easier to access than the keyboard and mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh this game is awsome!!!","review":"This game is tight if you die during castle raids you will get held captive and you can bribe the guard or attempt a escape I love doing ambush's this game is great you should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"get this game","review":"you should get this game i just can't stop saying that get this game get this game get this game! i had to write this on here now im going to play this game o heres a strategy pay the ransom for king richerd or whatever his name is and you get 100 knights make a good defense and then go on the offensive get this game"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Gold Mine!!!","review":"It's so hard to find good gospel reggae but Hensley King has done it with this wonderful album which is full of variety.

We bought two, and regretted it immediately. Granted, this is a lot more elegant in aesthetic, and never accidentally flops over on itself as the old model did. But it just doesn't work reliably. The beeping is unreliable--sometimes loud as expected, and sometimes a faint buzz that sounds like a blown speaker. The selector slider gets stuck and is hard to move, and then doesn't click reliably into place at the points you are trying to select. So we are ditching this model.

And, none of these players are ever far from the foundation of the blues, although that's not to say B.B. King would have any idea what's going on. You can deconstruct this album if you like, or you can play it in the background - believe me, it will work either way. Fans of post-rock should definitely check this out, but anyone who plays the guitar might also want to take a listen to the sonic variety made possible by four committed, intelligent electric guitar experimentalists.

I have about half dozen bluetooth headset but none works better than 640. It is utra light and easy to fit into my ear without the ear clip which is the biggest advantage of 640. There are two reason I did not give it a five star:1. No neck cord to wear around the neck Without it I can see myself lose this tiny headset in no time.

So small it just sticks to your ear, with no wires to deal with! this was my first Bluetooth headset so I can't compare it to others, but it seems that when they make a headset this small, the mic is so far from your mouth that it has to be very sensitive to pick up your voice-- that means it picks up all the other noise as well! It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed. It has a little analog static and noise that is annoying. My advice, don't buy a phone like the RAZR V3 planning to use a bluetooth headset until you have talked TO someone calling you from one! Side note, I had to buy an extended (2x thickness of the OEM battery) so that I could use a bluetooth device for more than an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Hands Free","review":"Excellent hands free.

Once I got the 640, I had difficulty getting the pocket charger and the AC charger to connect. After I got them to work, I did not see the problem again.Pairing with my Audiovox PPC-6600 was a breeze. However, there was static when the phone was on my belt and the headset was in my ear on the same side as the phone.The gel earpiece is wonderfully comfortable and the 640 is very lightweight. The earpiece audio quality is great and the volume was very good.However, everyone I talked to commented that I either had a cold or was on an echoey speaker phone. No one thought the audio quality was good.Plantronics tech support confirmed that this audio quality is inherent in the design. The pocket charger is really great. It gives me a place to put the headset when not in use and it charges the headset between usage...very nice.I really wish Plantronics would have put more effort into improving the audio quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't complain","review":"So far, it's worked out well.

The designer of this feature should have used some sort of soft grip that fills the gap between the headset and the charging sleeve.

This one is subtle, no flashy colors, or extreme blinking lights. The buttons are placed well, and you can easily raise or lower the volume on the call.Things that I would like to see different is the locking mechanism for the in ear plugs. The tube that's supposed to lock the plug into place is made of plastic that wears down very easily with normal wear and tear. I've had to replace 3 plugs already because of this.

I had some problems at first with getting it set up because the instructions weren't very clear but I took it to the Cingular store in town and the guy did it in like 10 seconds so I guess that if you know what you are doing it would have been easy to connect to your phone.

I even returned the first one I got from Amazon and asked the vendor to send me another one. The did but the new one had the same problem.

And if that doesn't work then all the features in the world don't matter.I was very disappointed in this model and I wouldn't recommend it. Wait until the next model and they might have the bugs worked out. However I will still stick with plantronics.

I found that my Nokia charger didn't work with it, in fact I tried three from different Nokia models. The ear piece was comfortable to wear but slipped down my face because of the poor design of the \\"gel\\" connection to the device. I also experienced poor battery life. In other words 48 hours stand-by and one and half hours of talk time. Sound quality was excellent but there were a few crackles. It comes with a holder it snaps into but it doesn't stay in place and is always falling out. I'm sure you'd loose it easily.All in all it's a shame they couldn't get the design robust enough for everyday use. I suspect the battery life is because the model is faulty.I bought it to replace the Jabra BT200 I gave to my wife but I've now returned it and will be replacing it with another Jabra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design","review":"Overall this unit has a very cheap and flimsy feel. Voice quality was OK both in and out. However, the charging case does not hold the unit securely, causing the unit to quit charging.

The owners manual is printed so small that I had to use a magnifying glass to read it. In summary, just a very poor design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again","review":"The headset is very light and comfortable, with good sound quality. But it's flimsy, the ear piece comes loose easily, and the on/off button sticks. The charger is awful, there's a case full of parts and pieces that are hard to assemble and take apart again.

I'm currently pairing it with a Motorola RAZR v3c and it sounds tremendous. If you have big ears, like I do, it's a great fit. It is also a good alternative if you wear glasses or sunglasses often. Audio is superb. I read some of the reviews which here for this product but after using it myself I see that this reviews stem from users who either have old handsets or are just plain old. If you can't pair a BT headset you shouldn't be using a cell phone or the internet. Also, the ear gel does not come off easily unless you turn it to the neutral position in which case it is supposed to release. If you're looking for a well designed, light-weight headset with good sound this will do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deteriorating Quality","review":"I bought a 640 about three months ago.

The connection between the ear peace and the headset began to loosing and no longer hold its position in your ear.I called and requested a replacement and Plantronics was very quick to overnight me a new one.I've now had the new on for about a months and signs of deteriorating quality have begun. I just called plantronics and they are sending me a Voyager 510. Quite a bit bigger than the 640 but maybe I can talk for more than three hours. If I have any issues with the 510 I think my Plantronic days are over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic so far.","review":"I tried the Moto 850 first but it was uncomfortable and dropped calls even when the phone was 2 feet from the headset.For a little more the Plantronics offers better sound, more comfortable fit and includes adapters so you'll only need your phone's charger or the (included) AAA pocket charger.The fit is secure and comfortable with or without the included ear loop.Setup was easy and, despite some reviews, I found the instruction manual very clear and comprehensive.Also, to address another reviewer's lament, there is a hole to hang the headset around your neck (the lanyard is not included). If you look between the function button and the earpiece there is a lanyard hole that runs through the body of the headset.Pros: light, comfortable, good sound quality, includes many extras in a very nice, useful case.cons: I'm still looking. Price maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Charging unit","review":"The headset works good, but the charging unit is worse then poor. When you plug it in you think everything is going to be ok, but as soon as you walk away the charging light goes off. It doesn't matter how much you wiggle the connection or try taping it, the light eventually goes off and not because it is charged fully. This is the same for the car charger, which is just as awkward looking as the wall charger. I wouldn't purchase a plantronics again, until they change their charging plug design. It is more annoying then it is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy","review":"The product doesnt seem to be as powerful as it was suggested.

I am guessing Plantronics have improved the design because the one I got for Christmas sits securing in the charger -- it actually clicks in place. It doesn't fall out, isn't loose, and charges reliably. So it looks like they have addressed that criticism.I haven't had many opportunities to use this headset yet, but I can say it is very lightweight and comfortable to wear. I cannot figure out how to insert it securely in my ear (I've tried all three earbuds), so I have opted to use the stabilizer loop, which I find is comfortable and no hassle to use. I had no trouble pairing this to my Katana phone. Sound is great. I haven't tried it in a noisy environment though. Also, the adapters don't help me since it doesn't have one that works with my phone, but I knew that before asking to get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problems","review":"This is my first bluetooth headset and I am very satisfied with it. Plantronics packed it full of good features and accessories. The metal case comes in very handy when travelling. The fact that you can use your cell phone charger with one of the included adapters to charge the headset means one less power adapter to take along while travelling. The in-ear design makes hearing the person on the other line very easy. You can barely feel the device while wearing it. Reception has been good.

A waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Hope","review":"To begin with, this so called West Point Band is obviously not connected with the United States Military Academy. The cornets play in a British like sing-song style (I would suspect it is a foreign band) and the snare drummer beats out eighth notes in machine=gun style. There is no dynamic contrast. But again, beware of the band's name and don't mistake it for the USMA, because it is far from it, and I think it is most misleading, Not Recomended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toyota wheel cover set.","review":"The wheel covers arrived quickly and intact.

But frankly I didn't think the story of George and Laura Bush's marriage would --or could -- be as much fun to read as his books on Princess Diana, the Clintons and John F. Kennedy, Jr. I was wrong. This up-close \\"portrait of a marriage\\" brings their relationship and personalities into much clearer focus. I still don't like George Bush's politics, but I was fascinated by this behind-the-scenes glimpse into what brought him and Laura together and why their marriage works. It kept me turning pages from start to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Contribution","review":"The real story behind this book is in the back. There are a lot of source notes and what the author has done is based almost entirely on those--not first-hand accounts. This makes the book very suspect and challenging why the book should be bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"Nothing really new to read in this latest book. He never interviewed the Bushes, so how he came up with all of this \\"info\\" is questionable. Bottom line: It's easy to stay in a marriage where two people have nothing in common when the husband has a bottomless \\"old money\\" trust fund to live on. Cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"Author Christopher Anderson's book to promote the Bush's loving marriage seems more like a superficial attempt to hide his own contempt for the President and Mrs. Bush. Endless snide remarks and cutting inuendos by the author coupled with a parade of supposed skeletons in the Bush closet give the reader a roller-coaster of a ride more downhill than up. The old adage \\"Believe nothing that you read and only half what you see\\" should be warning enough to those who still buy this book. There is deception in the title. Perhaps like you, I was expcecting a clear and uplifting read on our beloved President and First Lady. Unlike you, I bought this book. The bottom line: I can't recommend this to anyone though I gave it one star for the opening chapter (the day of September 11th) and for the photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I loved this book. It was like a \\"Biography\\" episode including details on families, childhoods. I see one person wrote \\"come on George you can do better than this\\" uh...hello..he didn't write the book! another saying \\"pure fiction\\". Not sure how listing moving here and moving there and various jobs and turmoil is fiction, but there's a hate filled liberal for you. I thought this was a nice sweet book about real people and it's nice to be reminded they still exist, politics aside.It made me want to read more about Bush Sr. and Barbara, which is how I wondered into this area..I thought I may as well post."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"THIS IS A WONDERFUL LENS.VERY GOOD FOR LOW LIGHT WORK.IT PRODUCES CLEAR IMAGES.VERY LIGHT.A GREAT 'STREET' LENS.YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"24mm turns into 35mm in a D90 or D7000, and at f2.8, it's not that different from f3.6 zoom lense included with factory combos, hence, it's useless. if it was f1.8 or even f2 I'd say go for it.

Unfortunately the 24 2.8 was not up to par with Nikon's newer AFS primes that I own (35 1.8, 50 1.8) in terms of sharpness or speed of autofocus. I had it less than two weeks then returned it. The only way I was ever pleased with the lens was when I was right on top of the subject (which accounts for about 5% of my shooting). Instead I purchased the Nikon 24-120 f/4 and have been very pleased. The 24-120 shot at 24mm is much sharper wide open than the 24 2.8 wide open so if you can live without the 2.8, look at other options like the 24-120. The beauty of owning the 24-120 is that I still have a fairly wide angle when needed, and a great all-around lens when just out shooting for the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like my film years 35mm.","review":"I always liked wide lenses, and this approximates my old 35mm lens.

But less than a month after using them, I'm back here shopping for a better quality pair of earbuds. I used these while basically sitting still at my desk in work.

I do this quite frequently where I'll purchase a compilation CD, and I've never really gone wrong with it. This one; however, was just not my cup of tea. I really liked \\"Evil Force In My Pants\\" by Louie Fontaine just because of the odd music, and there were a couple other songs that weren't too bad, but they didn't catch me enough to get any more into the artist's work aside from what I have on this CD.

One of the best tv-shows ever and I mean not just among horror films. Every story is unique and brilliant.

I guess every gorehound on our planet has already ordered the first season, pre-ordered the second and anxiously awaits the third one. Even if you've never heard of \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" (which is dubious) and you don't like horror movies very much, just buy it no matter what - I guarantee you'll get lots of fun and pleasure watching this.The only negative aspect about the first season - it's so short..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak set, and the epsiodes werent even great","review":"I purchased this dvd because everyone was ranting and raving how great it was. I enjoy horror shows and movies, ive seen some epsiodes before and enjoyed them (Even though I belive the were edited for tv). Well, it wasnt all that great. For one thing, 6 epsiodes all on one disc and the second disc has to two skimpy speical features. Why not put seasons one and two together, or maybe all 3 in one set? Is the company so hard up for cash, that they are going screw people out of money buying all seven seasons and all of them be presented like this? I think they need to re-think there marketing idea, and put some seaons in the same package because im not shelling out more then twenty dollars for only 6 epsiodes. Im sure the other seasons have more epsiodes, but none of them have been to memorable. Highly disappointed with this purchase, and I dont know if i'll buy the rest of the series due to this lackluster product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dvd","review":"awesome fast shipping to australia. will buy other seasons from this seller as very happy with quality and prices also.thanks so much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the purchase!","review":"Tales from the Crypt is the ultimate guilty pleasure!

Besides being filled with the author/illustrator's charming observations, it is a veritable treasure trove of garden lore, with many quotes from authors old and new and advice from classic, old treatises on gardening and horticulture. Also many enchanting, anonymous garden sayings and quaint herbal folk remedies. The history of fruits and vegetables as a part of our culture.

I didn't have my reading glasses at the time I purchased this book. When I sat down to read it, with my glasses on, I couldn't make out most of it. The type is extremely small, the font color is somewhat washed out, and the calligraphy - although beautiful, adds to the diffuculty of reading this. I had to get a magnifying glass out to read some of it. It's a shame such a beautiful book was published with such small type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiny Print","review":"This book is beautiful but almost UNREADABLE because of the tiny print.

This is PSEUDO-SCIENCE. I think most people would find it appalling that someone would make psychological conclusions about a mate based upon their handwriting. How would you feel about getting dumped simply because your handwriting supposedly indicated something about you? What's even more shameful is that this stuff is actually sometimes used by employers as a basis for hiring employers. Why that's not against the law yet, I have no idea. \\"Graphology\\" has never proved to be scientifically valid. It relies upon suggestion, ambiguity, and more than a little gullibility. I can't imagine that someone I'm dating might use this as a basis for seeing me or not. Then again, if someone I was dating DID use this stuff to make that decision, I wouldn't want to be with her ANYWAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding Mr. Write","review":"This book is quite unlike your typically self-help books.

Also this is an easy read for those of us with little to no time for leisure reading. You can choose the 'hour' of your choice for traits you find the most important in a relationship.As far as validity of the science of graphology, I'm totally not bought on it yet.

My personal favorites are Set It Off(an instant favorite that will command repeated listens), Still(a tight rock-type track), Don't Give Up and Read It In Your Eyes. Those fans of Dawn's work with EnVogue and Lucy Pearl will pleased with this album because it is a combination of the two styles of music.

That give's you a good starting point but is no guide. 'Space' are label mate's and will be used as their nearest comparison but this album makes Space look like a one track novelty band (sorry lads!)'No Illicit Dancing' is a 17 track journey. At times pastrol and psychadellic, at times almost balleric dance floor, but definately modern and beaty. It's a diverse mixing pot of sounds and styles and impossible to catogarise. One second it's kitsch baby sampled trip-rock, the next it's a lazy strummed melody.

I have combination skin and mild/moderate acne (I'm 35). This soap is fantastic! If you think about the price in terms of replacing a bottle of cleanser, it really isn't too bad. A little goes a long way. Now the primary reason I bought it was for my daughter's eczema, and though it didn't cure her, it may have improved her condition and definitely hasn't had the negative effect that most soaps do. Save yourself the effort and money - order a couple bars right off the bat. Plus, it takes care of those little bumps some kids get on their cheeks in cold, dry weather! You won't be disappointed. Do be careful on storing your Adovia though - don't leave it in the shower to melt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect balancing moisture in skin","review":"I bought the soap, because the reviews praised it as a miracle soap for all skin types.

So for this time I purchased this soap from cleopatraschoice website.Back to soap. I love it. It has very light sent. One bar lasted for about 4 weeks and I use it also for my body. It also helps to clear your skin on your back as well. Also I noticed that it lightens your skin. If you have any little pigmentation some how it makes it less noticeable.

Also there are many mistakes that the proof-reader should have corrected. Very little of the story ties together, as another reviewer mentions the attempts at humor just don't work. The complete bungling done by these supposed professional police earned them the resentment. I finished plowing through it as I was on an airplane and had run out of other things to read. Reading mindless trash on an airplane is OK, but this doesn't even make that grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money or your time!","review":"I wonder where in the world an editor was. I often find that well-known authors suffer from an apparent lack of strong editing. They need someone to knock them across the head and tell them just because they sell lots of books doesn't mean they don't need to rewrite and revise! There was only one character in this book that I felt had any depth at all and he was pretty one-dimensional. I really have enjoyed the Scarpetta series, so I was looking forward to an enjoyable read. But the thinking animals,whiny characters, and horrible language in this book were too much to handle. I didn't even finish it because I didn't care about the characters or the plot.

I made the mistake of forcing myself to finish that one, and I'm not going to do it again. WHAT WAS SHE THINKING when she wrote these? I don't require that she only write about Kay Scarpetta et al, even though I love those books; but this book is SO offensive, and its characters are SO ignorant--I couldn't care less about any of them. Not only that, I don't want to even pollute my mind with this drivel. The one star is only because they won't accept this review without a star. PLEASE, PATRICIA-- don't ever do this again!

She tries to write dialog like Elmore Leonard, and she takes every opportunity to show off her knowledge of minutiae regarding automobile mechanics and other things.Like the one that's in the book, this dog does not hunt.Her characters are all stereotypes; there is not one that is the least bit interesting or complex. The dialog is garbage. The story line is not believable; it is, however, predictable. The suspense is not suspenseful.I do believe that Patricia is a very smart, very capable woman. No doubt about that. I also believe she *could* be a good writer. She just needs to stop trying so hard to show off how smart and capable she is while imitating other writers.In short, I think she needs to find herself and come to peace with what she finds. Then maybe she'll write a good novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"This pudding has soured.","review":"We all know the old cliche about the proof being in the pudding.In her effort to provide us with a new pudding to sample Cornwell has indeed soured. This novel is obviously well written, but it falls flat on its face. First of all, I can't say I appreciate the decided and deliberately intended Jefferson Davis bashing. This is uncalled for. The obvious denegrading of Southern Culture is also uncalled for.On top of all this Cornwell insists upon writing in a style which obviously emulates Joseph Wambaugh. Mind you, she does a superb job of it without infringing upon his territory. But she should have stuck to her own turf.The only really credible character in the entire volume is Andy Brazil -- a character Cornwell manages to screw up inspite of herself. This book is a good read given the fact it gives the police a black eye and the City of Richmond, Virginia and unwarranted bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After several tries, I could not finish this book. I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's previous books and expected some continuation of her captivating Scarpetta series.

Each time I picked up the book I dreaded it, but I finish every book I start, good or bad, and this book was bad. I will have second thoughts about picking up another Cornwell book.

I have approximately 30 pages to go and would give up now but I'm curious to see how she's going to end this debacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards","review":"Patricia Cornwell is not up to her usual standards in Southern Cross. Her characters are shallow, so the reader doesn't get to know them. Unfortunately the reader also has no desire to know the characters or even like them. The plot and story line are too contrived and don't pull you in. I trudged through this book believing it would get better. The end has no suspense, it's something that a high school Freshman would contrive for a short story assignment. (I know I teach high school.) As for the pet angle, leave it to Lillian Jackson Braun who does a much better job. You'll be better off to stick to reading books in the Kay Scarpetta series. They are witty, with interesting characters you like knowing, and the suspense will keep you up reading all night."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed many of Patricia Cornwell's books.

Can't really identify with any of the characters - which seem to be stereotypes of their kind - woman police officer, Southern bigoted red neck, etc. Don't really care about any of the characters except perhaps the young artist who graffitis the statue, but he is more of a stereotype than a real person too. What a let down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"uncharacteristic, slow-starting comic opera","review":"I almost didn't make it past the pair of pets who narrate their own thoughts (in English, yet). Patricia Cornwell had not given us prior clues she is prone to such silliness. I also found the characters drawn so compellingly in \\"Hornet's Nest\\" -- Hammer, Brazil and West -- almost as silly this time around, as they seem mostly to lack self-confidence, scheme to belittle each other and rely more on serendipity than organized deduction to solve seemingly petty \\"crimes\\" until seriousness finally appears in the second half of the book. It's the second half -- quick-paced, at least, and filled with actual police work -- that saves this story from disaster. Either Cornwell has a new sub-standard editor or is resting on her laurels. Every previous attempt has been better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"HER WORST WORK EVER!!","review":"This is the second time I gave this, one of my favorite authors, the benefit of the doubt hoping she would come out of whatever slump she is in.

At times I become annoyed and bored with the listing of product names and chains. Its as if PC is trying to fill up space and has simply run out of things to write about.

I wish I had never spent the money on it. (thank god I didn't pay full price for it) It took me over a week to plod through it. The characters are completely un-believable and moronic and the writing is insulting to one's intelligence. The plot is dull and boring. It's as though she had a deadline she had to meet and she put no thought into this book and absolutely no depth in any of the characgters. Also, hated the parts where the character's pets had their own perspectives, very stupid. Stay with what works Ms. Cornwell, do not fix what isn't broken. The Kay Scarpetta books are much much more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I loved Hornet's Nest and bought Southern Cross as soon as it came out.

I do not know what happened to Patricia, but I suggest she get back on track to save her career and reputation.

Please, bring them back - I really miss them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done, a real step down","review":"After reading all of her previous works, I believe that this one was slapped together to meet a deadline. It lacks the characterization and thoughtful plot development Cornwall usually presents. Do yourself a favor - wait for the next Scarpetta novel and avoid this one entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak storyline, bad prose, confusing list of characters","review":"The story has no real point. It seems to go nowhere fast and gives us no real reasons to want to finish. Sorry .. but she can and has done much better in the past. Lets hope for a return to the intense, spine tickling novels of the past and that this was just a one-timer."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing read","review":"I must confess - I have not completely read this book - I've struggled through 18 chapters and am only doing so out of loyalty to an author that I have followed since the begining of her career. This book can scarcely hold reader interest for more than 1 page at a time. The character names are annoying; I'm still waiting for something more interesting than neighborhood vandalism and petty theft; Let's make this short and sweet - I hate this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD!!!!!!!","review":"People listen to me.... PLEASE !!!! This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Cornwell has written a book that lack everything that the english language demands. Do not, I repeat DO NOT buy this book. You will do better sending the money that you would spend on this book to your favorite charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it at all","review":"Have always enjoyed Particia Cromwells books until this one. Too many charaters, rather confusing. No real suspense to it. Characters are rather blaw except maybe Weed. Romance with Bazil and Virgina is nothing you can relate to. Story is to wordy and jumps around to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"One of the few books I've read that I almost didn't finish. I read it all, but found no improvement by the end. Scheming animals??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, and disappointing--probably her worst yet","review":"I agree with most of the other reviews, it's hard to believe this was written by PC, whose Scarpetta novel's have all been entertaining--I eagerly got this one from the library hoping it was more of kay, and found the same disappointing characters that were in Hornet's nest---get back to forensic pathology please---I could not finish this one, to dry and dull"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"I can't think of a single good thing to say about this book. It was awful! I can't believe Cornwell wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stunk.","review":"Stink, stank, stunk. I am glad I got the book for a penny from a bookclub or else I would be asking for my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT EVER HAPPENED???","review":"This book is not even close to the quality that Ms. Cornwell usually writes in. What in the world happened? The stories were all disjointed and hard to follow. Most of all, I just couldn't get to know the characters too well. In her Scarpetta books, Ms Cornwell really lets you get to know her characters well and admire them. But I couldn't get to like Hammer at all. To me the writing just kept on jumping from one thing to the other that there wasn't enough time to get to know her. I also think that the way West and Brazil were presented was superficial as well.My recommendation- AVOID THIS BOOK! This is Ms. Cornwell's worst book yet.Hopefully her next one will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Very Poorly Written Book!!!!","review":"I am an avid fan of hers, I am sorely disappointed and hope she reads these reviews and gets her act together, I had to at some points in the book, look at the cover and tell myself it was really Patricia Cornwells name on the front! It was a HUGE disappointment!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by an Impostor?","review":"When Cornwell wrote Hornet's Nest many wondered if it was the first thing she ever wrote, dusted off when she became known. With Southern Cross she proves that she's pumping out this garbage fresh, and you have to ask how the author of the Scarpetta series could write so badly. The main characters carried over from Hornet's Nest have been turned into Keystone Kops. Too much of the book is spent on a character named Bubba who does nothing worth all that attention. His life sucks, his job sucks, his friends suck, his hobbies suck, his ride sucks, and he fills the pages, which REALLY sucks. The humor falls flat unless you think the guy in the lampshade is a riot. Cornwell only shines when writing about the juvenile sociopath but he's pretty much lost in this crowd of circus players."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed.","review":"The Kay Scarpetta series is one of my all time favorites. I have read about half of this book and I don't believe I will finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story with a lot of clever humor.","review":"Maybe Cornwell is trying to tell us that she has broken out of the dark mood that has dominated her last few books. I sometimes felt as though I was reading Carl Hiassen or Elmore Leonard, and laughed out loud a number of times as I read along. Yes, the story is a bit cobbled together and some of the characters border on the outrageous, but it was a very entertaining read that shows a humorous side of Cornwell's talent. I think that the author had a good time writing this book, and I enjoyed it very much. PDC, humor becomes you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money best spent elsewhere, a big DISAPOINTMENT","review":"This had to be the worst book that she has written. I'm a big fan of Dr.Kay, I read hornets nest and was satisfied, but this was a loosely put toghther book to say the least. It left you wondering who wrote this sorry excuse of a book, it did nothing for me. Hate to say this but you cheated your fans with one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I had the money back.","review":"Like some of the other reviewers, I am halfway through the book but I will not finish it. I have only forced myself to read this far because I asked my husband to buy it for me for Valentine's day, and I feel badly that he wasted his money."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wish i could've given this book 0 stars...","review":"while i usually love P.C.'s books, i absolutely hated this one. it dragged, it read painfully, i'm amazed that i finished it. i tried to sell it at a used book store, but the clerk refused to buy it, he said he'd heard it was so bad. please, pat, give us more Kay, Pete, and Lucy. Give us a lot more Lucy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I spend the money","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews before I bought this book. This is the second time Patricia Cornwell has dissappointed me, the first being The Hornet's Nest. I felt this book was HARD to follow and VERY corny. Please Patricia, stick to Kay Scarpetta and Pete Marino. Forget about Hammer, West and Brazil!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to P .C. ?","review":"I am in the middle of this book and I don't think I will even waste my time to finish.

You think even the typesetter would have disassociated himself with this blatent mass market rip off. Please....dogs and cats giving the play by play of their masters' actions?

She could have chopped this book to pieces with her scapel and band saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back too!","review":"Dreadful - I forced myself to finish it and am still unsure what it was about. The story line was so poor I continued waiting for another plot to develop - unfortunately it didn't.

If you'd rather not be bothered with the facts, if you've been looking forward to the next volume in Cornwell's Super-intelligent Pet series, read this book. If you can't stand flat characters and blatant technical mistakes, better stay in the real world and avoid the Richmond, VA of _Southern Cross_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this book on clearence for $1. I still think I overpaid. Having read a couple of Cornwell's books, I was shocked to find no gruesome murder or even a good mystery. The book borders on almost sterotyping and a failed attempt in integrating history into the story. One wonders if Cornwell only wrote the book as a way to honor her contract. Borrow this book...if you really want to read it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Cornwell read","review":"This one misses the mark for me. Try another like the Body Farm to enjoy this talented writer. From Potter's Field was also a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"southern silly","review":"This is a poor book. Cornwell has no understanding of Policemen, the south or COMSTAT as used in New York City. The effort at comic relief is silly and not funny in the least. Patty Passman and Lelia Ehrhart are perfect examples. This book is just a shameless ploy to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Cross Slow Read","review":"I was very dissappointed in this novel, I found it difficult to finish reading the book. Character development was almost non-existant. One of the worst books I have ever read by Patricia Cornewll."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book needs a medical examiner!!!!","review":"Although my shelves are lined with Cornwell's book, Southern Cross will immediately find its way to the used book store. How many characters need a point of view? And apparently, Cornwell believes the dogs and cats in this book need one too -- maybe because her human characters have nothing interesting to say. I fully understand the need for an author to \\"break out\\" periodically and follow a new avenue -- but this \\"avenue\\" is full of pot holes, leaving this reader to wonder who really wrote this book and why it was published. Books like this can make a reader distrust a favorite writer's future work, so, come on Patricia -- write another of your great suspenses to help me forget I spent $25 for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the suspense...?","review":"This book is a fall from the standard we expect from this author. Where is the suspense and who thought up this wacky computer scheme? What is next...does West and company make it a threesome?"},{"rating":"1","title":"what was she thinking","review":"Sorry Patricia, this was the third strike. I will give any author two bad books, but not three.This was so bad I didn't even finish it. I will not be reading Cornwell again. To bad, I thought her first four books were SOOO good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, shallow, lacked usual finesse and style","review":"After having read every Cornwell book except one, I feel this was the most shallow and flimsy book she has written. I only finished the book because I never leave a book not finished. I was disappointed in the Brazil-West aspect, and in their previous story, they were much more viable and likable. The character development was thin, if almost nonexistent. This book left me wondering if I will read anymore of Cornwell's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it had been better....bit of a disappointment","review":"I am a huge fan of Patricia Cromwell, and understand her wanted to expand other than Kay Scarpetta/Lucy novels, although I like others can't wait until the next novel comes out about them. This book was not up to Ms. Cromwell's standards, and hard to stay focused on. But, I will still remain a loyal fan and continue to read her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrable bad bad book","review":"YUK. Will never read another by this author.

I think the author needs to go back to Scarpetta and her friends, a much more believable and interesting group of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good portrayal","review":"I love this new series by Cornwell. I think it is a nice change from the Kay Scarpetta series which was getting to be too much of the same thing. The thing I liked best about Southern Cross was Cornwell's depiction of a young man who becomes involved with Smoke and his gang. I work with delinquent youth, many of whom are involved in gangs. As I read Southern Cross, I realized how difficult it is for kids to break away from a gang once they become involved. Even if you don't like this new series, it's worth the read just to see the types of pressures today's youth are facing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"Cornwell has so many characters running amok in this book that she is unable to fully develop any of them. Halfway through the book I still had no idea what the plot was. With Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series, I had trouble putting the books down without peeking at the next chapter - with this book, I had to force myself to finish it. A definite disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it - - but those names! \\"Butner Fluck\\"?!?! No way","review":"I love this author! I found the characters in Hornet's Nest so much fun that I immediately had to read Southern Cross. But she's really crossed a line with those weird names she uses. \\"Judge Bovine\\" was bad enough in H.N. but \\"Butner Fluck\\" in this one? And hey - we already had a \\"Bubba\\" in H.N., so why another? And what's with the Boston Terrier dogs in both books? Nevertheless, I am crossing my fingers that Cornwell writes another book in this series, because I am enthralled. Dr. Scarpetta can wait; I like Andy Brazil."},{"rating":"1","title":"She Couldn't Have Written Thiss Mess","review":"I have always admired Patricia Cornwell's voice....until this book. It is by far the worst I have ever read. Just when you are getting into one plot, the scene changes and another plot unfolds. You get dizzy from all the moving back and fourth. The Lilia Ehrhart character was not believable....no one of her status could murder the English lanuage like that. I found her unnerving. I hope Patricia Cornwell goes back to writing in the first person about protaganist, Kay Sparpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Cross","review":"Boring, undeveloped characters and uninspired, hackneyed writing are the hallmarks of this book. This was a far cry from, POSTMORTEM. The most interesting, imaginative and readable moments were those involved with the thoughts of pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This was Patricia Cornwell's worst book. I could not even finish it. The plot was poor and fails to hold a reader's interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Cross","review":"This book is a waste of time. It serves only to glorify Cornwell's self-importance. She has a superiority complex and regales the reader with her never ending descriptions and lists of diverse subjects that range from guns to tools to food. It's offensive and completely lacks any kind of believability. Pick up something else to read, leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever read","review":"I bought this book in a secondhand shop in Deventer (Netherlands) thinking it a book by Patricia Cornwall (rather than Cornwell)- what a silly mistake!The characters are not developed, and parts of their stories are hardly relevant. The plot is totally unbelievable: A kid hacks into a web-site and changes the screen saver on a police computers in people's homes ?!?!? Computers in homes that are turned on remotely !?!? Some weird URL created by someone who knows nothing about computers!?!? And the reference at the start of the book (also in the book title) to the strong families in the south never reappears. I'm not a woman, but would a woman really leave hints of another lover to bring to jealousy a previous lover and current colleague? And a cat who makes sure he sees these clues? 1/5 stars - because I was not allowed to enter 0/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Cornwell, but","review":"I love Patricia Cornwell and particularly the Scarpetta books, but this was unreadable for me. I sat down one night and read 80 pages and just quit.

I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell and out of respect I kept reading. I shouldn't have. The story was lame and the characters were shallow and confusing. Even the names of some characters Like Brazil, West, Butner, and Chief Hammer showed no thought. I even noticed alot of product names blatenly used as if Patricia sold ad space in her book.There was no real plot, it was hard to figure who was the main character. I felt the ending was rushed like Patricia herself couldn't stand writing such a waste of time story.I have never been this mad about an Author showing no effort, just a deadline to meet.Learn from Stephen King about writing dribble to please a publisher.I am glad it wasn't a Scarpetta novel though, she was getting boring, but this showed no imagination and no thought. It actually made me mad.I probably won't read her again even a Scarpetta novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"If this is an example of where the author intends to take her readers, then I think I will get off the train here. I have read all of Ms Cornwell's books to date and have rarely been disappointed. This one, even though the main characters are interesting enough, just has no oomph! I read and read and waited for the story to start, and read some more until I realized I was at the end of the book and still waiting. I will certainly read the next Patricia Cornwell book. I know it has to be better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Cross","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I love reading Patricia Cornwell and look forward to her next book.

Southern Cross, however, is just plain stupid. It came across as a cartoon -- you've seen them, the ones where the animals are smarter than their humans. The nicknames wore thin early on. Does everyone in Richmond have an idiotic nickname? I bet not. As someone a few reviews back said, \\"It's not bad.\\" No, it's not; it's wretched. What happened to the idea of developing good plots? Some character worth latching onto? Has Patricia Cornwell been abducted by aliens?"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WAS VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I WAS WONDERING, IS THIS REALLY PATRICIA CORNWELL, THE SAME AUTHOR THAT WROTE PAST GOOD BOOKS??

I enjoyed Cornwell's earlier books, and even found Hornet's Nest to be ok, but not great. This one was awful. The characters were stupid and without any depth, and the plot almost non-existent to the point that I put it down half-way through, having gotten tired of hoping it would get interesting. I saw Cornwell on the Today show laugh off the critics who didn't like this book, but having bought it myself, think it's about time she started listening to what people think of her books, since the earlier ones were so enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"this was the worst book i have ever read by cornwell. i never really understood the plot and really regretted spending the money on the book. i wouldn't recommend it even to the biggest cornwell fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment!","review":"There was nothing \\"right\\" about this book.

I've read several of Ms Cornwell's previous books. Each time, I say \\"No more\\" and each time I succumb to my adult daughter's enthusiasm and read another one. Well, this is the worst of the lot.

I found very little mystery or anything that really had to do with Police work. Count me out on Cornwell in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Down Hill All the Way","review":"This was a terrible disappointment. I expected much more from Cornwell. I like the Scarpetta novels, but a change is OK. Hornets Nest was different, was OK but not great. Writing in third party and using local language and misspelling are all right; however, this one had nothing to offer. The characters weren't developed, the plots (plural) seemed to go nowhere. It just wasn't interesting. The book sold on her name, not on value.

(I suspect/hope that she didn't actually write it!).The plots partially revolves around a computer virus and EVERYTHING that's written about the virus is complete JUNK - it makes me wonder if she did any research for this book, or just made it all up on the spot. And it also makes me worried that the topics that I don't know so much about are also very badly researched!

NEVER AGAIN! I will choose carefully next time.In reading all the reviews I was surprised that no one else noticed a major mistake in this story (aside from it ever being written). The cat, \\"Niles\\", was referred to as an Abyissinian, having crossed, blue eyes. No Abyissinian has crossed, blue eyes. I think Ms. Cornwell was referring to a Siamese cat. I wonder how many dog lovers would have commented had she described the Boston Terrier as having long, droopy ears and a black and brown spotted coat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why am I continuing to read this book?","review":"I have gotten to page 113 and have no interest in how this disappointing book ends.

I read an average of 6-8 books a week, mostly hardback fiction and when I give up and close a book 1/3 of the way through, it has to be bad. she made an issue of changing her style to get away from the medical/coroner subject but she failed miserably.

I was especially frustrated at her introducing still more characters at page 300!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother, you will be so disappointed!!","review":"I have ready every book Patricia Cornwell has written, and there were some better than others. This book, however, is by far the most muddled, pointless, boring piece of garbage I have ever struggled to complete. She introduces characters that have nothing to do with the central plot, leaves some matters hanging, and generally writes as though she were a month past deadline.

Can anyone recommend another good female suspense writer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Wasn't THAT Bad!","review":"I love the Kay Scarpetta novels, but it was fun seeing PC do something else for a change.

I wouldn't buy it again if I knew what I was getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am very sorry that I bought this book for a long plane trip from Sydney to Singapore. This book is inane. There is more character development done for the pets than the main characters - and the pet angle is ridiculous.

The pet perspectives were annoying, as was the childish relationship between West and Brazil. And the plot was weak, too. I'd say to save your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing for a Patricia Cornwell fan","review":"Looks like this one was just rushed out the door - without much thought and without a lot of editing. Quite the opposite of Ms. Cornwell's previous work. . . after several starts and forcing myself to continue reading (after all, I did go for the hardcover edition!) I finally gave up at page 110; and I have no interest in how it turns out. Next time I'll read the reviews first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all like any other book of hers I have read","review":"This was a fairly entertaining book..I found it to be more on the line of a comedy than a mystery. It did not have the depth Cromwell's books usually have. The characters were not very well developed and the story lacked continuity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably lame \\"satire\\".","review":"Couldn't finish this book. Not only Cornwell's worst book, but probably one of the most poorly written books ever released by a major publisher. What was she thinking?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolute waste of money!! I was very diappointed.","review":"This has got to be one of the worst books that I have ever read. It was disjointed and boring! Just when I thought Cornwell was going to \\"rescue\\" me with an interesting story line she would bounce off into another direction. I thought that Hornet's Nest was bad, but Southern Cross was abysmal. Believe me, I will not buy another Cornwell book just based on her name, some one will have to convince me that it is worth the time and/or the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment.","review":"I found this book and story line to be very disappointing. After reading the Kay Scarpetta stories, perhaps I expected something similar from this book. Not only were the character names \\"off the wall\\" and ridiculous but the characters themselves seemed to be thrown together in co-existence for lack of better writing material or insight. Too much detail was wasted on mechanical and weapon specifications and to such extent, were unnecessary and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is dreadful","review":"Warning! This is a terrible disappointment of a book. I like Cornwell's work, but frankly found this book irritating in the extreme. Boring plot, boring characters, boring writing. And so twee - who cares what a character's cat thinks? Struggled half way and gave up - a first for me with this author. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best.","review":"I felt she was writing this kind of tongue in cheek. I had the feeling the foul language she used was there just because she COULD use it. In some few instances it was necessary to develope a character, but most of the time it was needless. It definitely was a book I read because of the author (I truly enjoyed most of her Kay Scarpetta novels.) I certainly would never recommend it because of the plot. I hope she returns to the ME office."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell the truth, Patty, did you really write this?","review":"As I read Southern Cross, I found myself rechecking the book jacket to see if I was actually reading a Rita Mae Brown mystery. Dogs fixing computer glitches and cats using the telephone's speed dial are exactly what I would expect from Rita Mae but not from Patricia Cornwell.As I read doggedly on to the end, I realized that Patty is determined to show us her sense of humor. And show us she does with wit as subtle as a Mack truck and just as funny.All authors evolve---some not for the better."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I have ever read.","review":"Patricia should stick with the Scarpetta series. This book is awful!! I am from the South and consider this book to be an insult to all Southerners. The book has no apparent plot and most of the time makes very little sense to the reader. I did not finish it due to lack of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad state of affairs","review":"I read some of the over 100 reviews on this book. My conclusion was that enough was written to steer people away from this book. I then determined that it would make me feel better to agree that Southern Cross has little merit - it is stupid. I am one of those readers dying to have Scarpetta back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF TIME TO READ","review":"This book read as if written by a child. Probably a child could have done a better job. A very poor excuse for a book. Cornwall can do much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"We want Kay Scarpetta back!","review":"Unlike the characters in the Scarpetta series, these people just don't connect to anyone. The only one who comes near to connecting is the traveling police chief. However, having been married to a law enforcement officer for over 20 years, I know that even this senario is messed up! Either she's the absolute worst chief in the world, or she's just got wonderlust and that's not believeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor effort on the author's part","review":"Hammer,West and Brazil were weak characters in Hornet's Nest and they hit a low not believed possible in this one. Winters Table,Southern Cross - be careful Ms. Cornwell ,three strikes and you will be out with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo! Hiss!","review":"Totally disappointing! I rarely do not finish a book I start, but this one was torture! I simply couldn't finish it. I wish Ms. Cornwell would get back to the style of some of her earlier publications such as Post Mortem, etc. I was so excited to see a new book by her and so let down with the finished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"As a died in the wool Caldwell fan, I coundn't believe this book. It just was not Caldwell. Her stab at humor fell totally flat. Hornet's Nest was enjoyable, but I am having problems wading through Southern Cross. Please bring back more of the strong stories a la Kay Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic just about sums it up","review":"I bought this book with excitement. I read Hornet's Nest and liked it. I wasn't expecting another Scarpetta story. This book was AWFUL. I found many instances where plot lines took a turn that couldn't be explained and then just went....nowhere. They were dropped completely! I have read every single book by Cromwell, but this was trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't force myself to read another page!","review":"Since Cornwell is one of my favorite authors,I kept making myself read \\"just one more page\\", to be absolutley certain that I actually HATED the book! After page 200, I gave it up. Now I know...I HATED IT---boring, boring, boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. It was difficult to finish.","review":"The only thing I enjoyed about this book is Richmond, VA is our home town and identifying with the landmarks was the only thing that got me through this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read in years.","review":"If you are into bodily functions and scruffy looking people, this book is for you. I read the entire book and felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is even worsse than \\"Hornet's Nest\\"!.","review":"Patricia, How could you???. Bring back Kay Scarpetta and resurrect Wesley!! I struggled through \\"Hornet's Nest\\", thinking it had to get better, now \\"Southern Cross\\" is even worse, which seems impossible!!. Save your money and boycott this horrific book! and the boring, wimpy characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WOULDN'T DARE READ THE BOOK AFTER READING THE 238 REVIEWS","review":"NEVER BEFORE HAVE I READ SUCH HORRIBLE REVIEWS OF ANY BOOK. LIKE THE MAJORITY OF THESE READERS, I TOO LIKE CORNWELL'S BOOKS & HAVE READ MOST OF THEM, BUT JUDGING BY THESE REVIEWS OF THIS LATEST BOOK AM SCARED TO DEATH TO EVER BUY ANOTHER BOOK BY CORNWELL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not at the same level as Kay Scarpetta novels","review":"Patricia Cornwell's Southern Cross does not include her famous character, Kay Scarpetta, who did not even make a cameo appearance to do an autopsy. Also absent along with Ms. Scarpetta are all of Ms. Cornwell's creative juices and excellent character and plot development. This novel is a real sleeper because all it will do is put you to sleep earlier than you had hoped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the reading.","review":"Patricia had better stick to what made her so popular. This book was a waste of time in writing and reading. I have all of Patricia's books on the shelf except this one, and it will never go there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not There","review":"I think the biggest reason I was so disapointed was I was so looking forward to her next book. I was so dispointed what usually takes 4 days took 2 weeks. It just rambled on, I always seemed to know what was going to happen next and the killer didn't even die in the end. I wish these publishers didn't make a decent author write a damn book every 3 months. When they do this is what happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"All fleshed out and nowhere to go...","review":"I'm a huge Cornwell fan, but this one does not hack it. Richmond is my hometown and I enjoy some of the references as to what street the character is on and what they see as they are passing, but enough is enough, does anyone really cares about so much detail. Her forte is definitely fleshing out charaters and making them live and she does that here but its like she spent 99.9% of the book fleshing out these (some of them great) characters but then the climax is a fizzle. Definitely not my favorite, though I hope she does bring these characters back. I especially liked the woman radio operator who went berserk and attacked the guy who gave her a parking ticket. My kind of gal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her usual standard - Pat - Stick with what you know...","review":"I didn't want to believe the reviews so I got an audio version of this book. I am sorry I did - With someone reading it too me - it only highlighted how disjointed the story line really was. Plus-somehow the attempt to use 'colorful' language seemed forced and almost offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great cure for insomnia","review":"I literally have nothing positive to say about this book. The characters were grossly underdeveloped, the storyline was plodding and slow, and the ending was utterly predictable. It will take a rave review for me to ever spend money on Ms. Cornwell's work again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Yet","review":"I love Cornwell's books. I've read every one of them. This book was terrible. The worst she's written. I don't know what she was thinking. I couldn't believe all the dialogue from the cat and dog. And a cat helping Brazil know West was faking him out? Puhleesse!Don't buy this book. If you must read it, buy mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only junk food when you needed meat & potatoes","review":"I was also disappointed in this novel. I do realize that authors must try different directions once in a while to remain fresh and explore their limits, but Southern Cross was filled with forgetable characters, a forgetable and fragmented plot, and a forgetable ending. I did find it humerous at times, but the whole book didn't quite make it into satire territory.As much as you don't want to, Ms. Cornwell, please return to Kay Scarpetta. We miss her and the excellent writing you did for her."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissappointing","review":"I am an avid reader of all of PAtricia Cornwells books. I especially loved Hornets Nest.That is why I cannot understand this book at all. The characters are simply unbelievable and uninteresting.The prose at times is very bad and indeed sometimes the sentences really dont make much sense.The spelling is bad thr out the book or maybe they were all misprints.Please bring back Scarpetta fast !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cannot believe she would put her name to this book.","review":"Somelse must have ghost written this bood for Cornwell. Or else she must not have been feeling well at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A laughable mystery","review":"Well, I should have known better than to try another book in this series. But, as a Patricia Cornwell fan, I thought we could only go up from \\"Hornet's Nest.\\" Wrong. Cornwell's main three characters -- Hammer, West and Brazil -- are portrayed too narrowly for us to ever care about any of them. In fact, readers will hear more insights from the pets in the story than from the detectives in charge. (By the way, there are several pages of insipid conversations from pet cats and a dog. Gimme a break!)I realize there was supposed to be some humor in this story, but it all falls flat. From now on I'll know to stick with Cornwell's series with Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment from start to insufficient conclusion","review":"I am a huge Cornwell fan, and own all of her books - including Hornet's Nest. This outing is a true disappointment. The characters are ill defined, and completely unsympathetic. You simply don't care about them, their lives or their careers. The characters are sophomoric and immature. They bumble through the plot, and save the day by seat of the pants luck, not through skill or acumen. The plot revolves around divergent themes, that are never satisfactorily wrapped up. The book ends, leaving to many ends unexplained and completely without tie-in. Definately, not up to Cornwall standards. Don't waste your money on the hardback edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a book of nonsense and a complete disappointment.","review":"I was extremely disappointed by this book. I love the Kay Scarpetta stories and the author's attempt at satire leaves much to be disired. I had to force myself to finish it. The characters and storyline had no suspense or sense. Even as satire, it failed. Dont't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time on Southern Cross","review":"I read the first 50 pages of Southern Cross hoping that it would grab my interest. Needless to say I have since returned it to the library unfinished. Hornets Nest was a very poor book but I read it till the finish wondering why I went to the trouble. Moving the cast of Hornets Nest on to a sequel was poor judgement. They are weak and the plot in the book is just as weak.Stick to your original series in which the characters have matured along with the plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patricia Cornwell at her Worst!","review":"As a Richmond native, I was appalled at Patricia Cornwell's attempt at levity. The book is not funny. It portrays Richmonders as stupid and slow witted. Her writing style is horrible. One sentence had 118 words with no commas. I had to read that one several times to make any sense of it. I truly did not want to read about all the gas stations, restaurants, car washes, rundown building, etc. located in Richmond. I wanted a good storyline. If I was a guessing person, I'd guess Patricia Cornwell did not write this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but lacks the suspense of her previous books.","review":"I couldn not believe I was reading a book by Patricia Cornwell! This book did not contain the mystery and suspense I enjoyed in her previous books. While the book was entertaining it was more light fiction than her usual murder mysteries. The author did depict the Richmond area quite accurately and she may hear about her \\"Yankee viewpoint\\" regarding her description of an old southern community. This viewpoint was what I enjoyed most about the book as I live 60 miles from Richmond and was not born in the south! I admit I found her descriptions to be very truthful and similiar to how I've perceived this area. The \\"confederate cross\\" is unfortunately still alive,well and very visible in this state."},{"rating":"1","title":"not usual patricia cornwell,what a disappointment","review":"wanted to be the first to read this book and very disappointed. was written more tongue in cheek-not a serious mystery. i feel too much fun was made of richmond and the people who live there. i do not live there but would resent this story. ms cornwell should go back to her other style of writing, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORCED MY WAY THROUGH 50 PAGES...","review":"I'VE READ THEM ALL WITH GREAT ENJOYMENT, BUT THIS ONE JUST WOULDN'T FLY. SCARPETTA CHARACTERS HAVE SUBSTANCE. THIS BOOK'S CHARACTERS GAVE YOU NOTHING TO BUILD ON. ABSOLUTELY LACKS INTEREST. A VERY LAME EFFORT FOR CORNWELL THAT WILL SADLY ADD TO HER WEALTH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Kay Scarpetta!","review":"I am a long time fan of Cornwell, but I didn't like Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross is just as bad. Characters are un-memorable, I don't care about them, and plot just drags on and on. Cornwell should go back to Kay Scarpetta. She does much better with a character who has been well developed and whom readers care about. Give it up, Patricia! Your deviant books don't make it! Someone gave me the book as a gift; I would never have bought it. I too question whether Cornwell's fame is having a negative effect on her quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!! CHARCTERS YOU DO NOT CARE ABOUT.","review":"THIS IS TO SAY THE LEAST THE WORST BOOK PATRICIA CORNWELL HAS WRITTEN. THE CHARACTERS ARE NOT INTERESTING NOR IS TH PLOT. THE WORDING IS HORRIBLE. FOR ABOUT 250 PAGES I THOUGHT MY BOOK HAD TYPEGRAPHICAL ERRORS UNTIL I FIGURED OUT ONE OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS COULD NOT TALK RIGHT. I HOPE THE LAST 50 PAGES IS MORE INTERESTING THAN YHE FIRST 300.

Under most circumstances, I read a Cornwell novel in one evening -- but not this time. However, it was a completely different type of novel and had it been written by any author other than Cornwell, I probably would not have bought it. From now on, I'll just wait for the next Scarpetta novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While I am an avid dog lover, I couln't get into the talking/thinking pets. I found this book difficult to finish. Couldn't get into the characters, the plot (if there was one)was difficult for me to follow.If you are expecting anything like the Scarpetta series, don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and unfocused","review":"I've read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, and I've watched the overall quality slide as her characters have aged and Ms. Cornwell's own interest has strayed. Southern Cross represents a new direction for her, with experiments in humor and character development that are distinct departures from the Kay Scarpetta series. Unfortuntately, the humor is forced and the characterizations are uneven. Ms. Cornwell's strength remains her intensive research-- I always learn something from each of her books. Otherwise, Southern Cross is immature and derivative of southern-style drama-humorists like Carl Hiaasen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nomination for Worst Book Ever Written","review":"I have read quite a few of Cornwell's books and really enjoyed them. This however is a very different story. In all honesty, I believe this is the worst book, bar none, that I have ever read. On a humorous note, my wife bought this for me as I recovered from surgery and I swear if I could have climbed out of bed and got rid of the darn thing I never would have finished it ! After a while it just kind of blended in with my pain from stitches and general nausea but I finally did plod through to the end. Brutal. Brutal. Brutal. My advice: Just say no. If you want a GREAT forensic book look for Kathy Reichs ...far better plot and character development than even the best of P.C."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had hoped for...","review":"I really enjoy Patricia Cornwell's other books, but was disappointed in this one. It was not, as suggested above, that I was unwilling to accept a new cast of characters; as a matter of fact, I enjoyed the characterizations of Hammer, West, Brazil, and a few of the other characters. Cornwell is a past master at letting you know the people she draws. What I admire about Cornwell's writing is the realism: the gritty details she presents and the sympathy with which she portrays her often unsympathetic characters. I found the plot of Southern Cross to be fragmented and scattered. Many of the characters seemed like ridiculous caricatures. I found it hard to \\"buy in.\\" I assume that the presentation was intended to be sort of tongue-in-cheek, and I tried to read it in that light, but it really was not as enjoyable an experience as I have become accustomed to with Patricia Cornwell."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I've read several of Patricia Cornwell's books and customarily enjoy them. Southern Cross, however, was a different story. As a police officer for the past 12 years, I can say that, from a police perspective, this book was childish, stereotypic, and, in general, poorly informed. No police chief in any major city actually works cases. Save your money for a well-researched book."},{"rating":"1","title":"She just doesn't cut the mustard...","review":"I think it's fine when a writer tries something different. I think it's especially great when that writer discovers new avenues for personal creativity and reader involvement. But there's a problem with \\"Southern Cross\\". It is a juvenile and poorly written attempt. It's boring, and after the first few pages, it's repetitive and heavy-handed. Carl Hiaasen does it masterfully well, Patricia Cornwell has a long way to go before she gets a grip on humor and satire."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"This book was an incredible disappointment. I am a faithful Patricia Cornwell reader and had high expectations for this follow-up to Hornet's Nest. Normally I cannot put her books down because they are so engrossing; however, I had a hard time finishing this one. I tired quickly of West and Brazil's \\"love-hate-hate to admit it\\" relationship. And while I'm certainly no stranger to crude language, Cornwell broke a personal record in using the infamous \\"F-word\\" throughout the gang members' dialogue. She (and other writers) should note that vulgarity loses its effectiveness and ability to shock when used to extremes; it only disgusts. I hope Cornwell will soon return to writing the kind of book that made her one of my favorites. Long live Scarpetta!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bargain At Any Price","review":"I have enjoyed several of Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta novels, but found this story hard to finish. The story is implausible in just about every respect from beginning to end. The Richmond Police Chief, her deputy and their young assistant are brought in from Charlotte on a short-term (one-year????) federal grant to clean up the Richmond department. No way is that going to happen. They all freak out when a kid hacks in to the Richmond cops computer system - don't they have an IT department? Somehow, this invasion cripples police computers all over the world! The story reels to an absurd conclusion when the police and interested bystanders play 'dog pile on the rabbit' to stop the bad guy, but somehow the chief herself has to come to the rescue.A bad book ay any price."},{"rating":"1","title":"We Already Know Whodunit","review":"As a big fan of Patricia Cornwell I was really bummed out by this book. It reflected her usually obsessive attention to detail about some of the oddest things. I found myself reading lists of stuff that became downright boring (how cigarettes are made?). When I got to the end there was no surprise or twist -- the bad guy was the bad guy and did what bad guys do. Ho Hum. I won't spoil it for anyone else by saying what happens to the bad guy. The characters are likeable enough -- I liked them in Hornet's Nest even better. And what was that completely insane thing about the police dispatcher? I think maybe some of this story was written in a state of delerium... I am so glad that I got the book in a second hand bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not vintage Cornwell at all!","review":"I was surprised to say the least at this book. I love Patricia Cornwell books and have read almost all of them, but I was not impressed by this one. Hammer, West, and Brazil, who were introduced in Hornet's Nest, lost their likability in this book. Also, where did she get these names -- like Butner Fluck? The names, like the characters, were stereotypical and kind of ridiculous. I am hoping that this was meant to be a farce of some sort. I will not stop reading Cornwell, but this is a black mark on an otherwise spotless record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far superior to the Kay Scarpetta series!","review":"Though I found the couple of Kay Scarpetta books I've read passable, I can't help wondering why Patricia Cornwell has been wasting her time turning out grisly detailed descriptions of autopsies, when she can write with such humor, compassion, and understanding of human frailty. I look forward to getting my hands on \\"Hornet's Nest\\" and any future books in the vein of these two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cornwell ever...","review":"This was not only the worst Patricia Cornwell book I ever read, it was the worst book I ever read, PERIOD! It was so bad it took me about nine months and three tries to get through. Don't buy the excuse that this was meant to be satire and definitely don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's with the talking pets?","review":"I was expecting a thriller. Instead I ended up reading what appeared to be a cross between an adolescent type romance, talking pets with greater intellect than their owners, and a few murders thrown in for good measure. It's almost as if Cornwell couldn't be bothered to make the effort. Need I say how greatly disappointed I was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"I have been a fan of Patricia's writing for many years. This one was a big miss. It appeared as if it was thrown together at the last minute. I like the characters Hammer, West and Brazil but I didn't see the point in some of the others. Butner Fluck and Smudge? What did they have to do with anything? If these two were her effort to describe people in the South; I hope she was kidding. The dispatcher getting arrested was out of nowhere. The cast of characters never came together. I wouldn't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I, like the other reviewers, loved Cornwell's books, but this was awful. I found the internet story line to be out in fantasy land. Basically - boring. At the end I was so shocked and disappointed that \\"that was it\\" (I had held out to the end hoping it would get better). Hopefully better luck next time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I have loved all of her other books. This one was very disappointing. I only keep reading because we have to pay so much for a book. It seemed like no one proof read it before it went into print?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Return To Kay Scarpetta!","review":"I ended up skipping 5 to 10 pages at a time just to see if the story was improving! The first 3/4 of the book were boring, weak and scattered. The characters were 1 dimensional (ok...Bubba was 2 dimensional) and the plot disolved with too many unnecessary sidetracks. What ever happened to introducing THE CRIME in the beginning and bringing us all along for the ride to SOLVING IT! I am a major Cornwell Fan, but this was a total waste of my precious reading time! Please return to the Coroner and all of the wonderful details of a well planned Murder Mystery!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a bomb","review":"This is one of the most poorly written on which I have ever wasted money. The characters are poorly developed, as is the ludicrously complicated plot. The title gives nothing to the story line and the three \\"super cops\\" as so ubiquitous and unbelievable as to be absurd. The author portrays animals as smarter than humans and interspaces a rambling story with seemingly obligatory blasphamy and a few sexual passages which offer nothing to the story. Frankly, if this is an example of Cornwell's work, I'll not buy another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"After enjoying many of this author's previous books, I was terribly disappointed to read this one. There were far too many characters, some of whom were introduced late in the story. The main characters were unsympathetic because they were not fully developed. Where was a smart, courageous, plucky woman like Kay Scarpetta? The minor characters were dark and uninteresting. Unfortunately, there was little plot to speak of. The numerous fragments of the book did not, as one would hope, come together by the end. It is difficult to comprehend what this otherwise wonderful author was thinking when she wrote Southern Cross. I had come to expect far better quality in Cornwell's writing, character, and plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"TIES WITH HANNIBAL FOR THE WORST BOOK EVER!!","review":"I admit it - I did not finish this book, finding it pure, unadulterated crap. Whatever is Patricia Cornwall trying to prove? Her Scarpetta novels are wonderful - some better than others - but still good reads. This book was garbage - uninteresting, whining characters and a convoluted plot that was going nowhere. My copy was donated anonymously to the Middletown Library, which is more than I can say for Hannibal which was donated to the local garbage dump. I will continue to buy and read Cornwall's Scarpetta novels - I enjoyed Black Notice - but she can count me out when it comes to her other literary ventures. I should have learned my lesson when people told me that Hornet's Nest (a book I didn't read)stunk - but I figured I'd give the author a chance with her other non-Scarpetta novel.I should have saved my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've ever read","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. If I didn't already read 5 of her books, I would never pick up another if this is all I read. The characters are pathetic. The story is unbelievable and doesn't pull together. She includes the thoughts of pets and has them doing things like dialing the phone number of the ex-boyfriend its owner is pining for. Give me a break! Try another one of her titles but steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insulting!","review":"Does Ms. Cornwell actually live in the south? Southern traditions,our race relations, our industry, personal and group intelligence, our education system, and our religion are all on Cornwell's hit list. Does she intentionally insult southerners or is it her poor attempt at humor which leads her to attack the south? Not only is the book poorly written, I took offense to her broad generalizations and incorrect assumptions concerning southern culture. Don't bother reading this book unless you would like to partake in a little \\"South-bashing\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"I have purchased all of Patricia Cornwell's books and this one is trash. If you remove the gutter words it would only be about three pages long."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY DISAPPOINTING","review":"Such a disappointment. Not even in the same ballpark as the Scarpetta novels. It is quite evident that the Scarpetta series is something that Patricia Cornwell knows inside and out. However, this was not the case in Southern Cross. It was hokey and read clumsily (if that is a word) for about the first two thirds of the book. It is glaringly apparent that gangs are not Patricia's strong point and really should be left alone. I imagine she may get tired of Kay Scarpetta at times, but it is TRULY what she is a master of. I wait breathlessly for each new installment and am crushed when I run out of pages. Then I run to the bookstore to see if they have any idea when the next installment is going to be released. The thrill of the wait is never anticlimactic. Patricia - stick with what you know. It comes from your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant diversion","review":"Contrary to most of the reviews here, I liked this book. I thought it was a welcome relief from old Kay S., who (in my opinion) has grown awfully stale. I thought Hornet's Nest was one of the worst books I'd ever read, but Southern Cross seemed more tightly woven and definitely more amusing. I too actually wondered if Cornwell wrote this book, but only because there was a modicum of humor in it, something I've never seen in previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total failure on every level","review":"As with Hornet's Nest, I bought this book without thinking to check whether or not it was a Scarpetta novel. Fool me twice, shame on me! The book fails on every possible level. It is not a good mystery, it is not a good police procedural, it is filled with woefully lame humor and, again as with Hornet's Nest, the anthropomorphism of various dogs and cats left me filled with despair at having once again counted, mistakenly, on the professional level of writing I had grown to expect from Cornwell's intelligent Scarpetta novels. These two non-Scarpetta books seem to be written by a different writer -- one who is less skillful on every level from plotline to character development. I will never again automatically buy one of this previously well-liked author's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book at all never finished it.","review":"I am a big fan of Patricia Cornwell but I was very disappointed in this book it was a waste of time and money and I never finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nobody's Weed","review":"This book has no discernible plot, no character to identify with other than a juvenile, can't be all bad deliquent called Weed; no villian to hate worth hating, no cohesion in the telling of the story; and no reason to read it other than the name of the author. It seems that Cornwell must have needed money or just wanted to publish a bad book and see how many fools would buy it. I promise you that if this was a first novel it would have never seen the light of day as written. There is a book somewhere in this story but it needs to be rewritten a couple of times over by somebody who CARES. It is clear that Cornwell does not. Poor Weed, he could have been a flower if he had been properly tended to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgruntled!","review":"I too, could not finish this book and put it on the shelf after struggling through to chapter five. Having read all previous books by Patricia Cornwell, this along with \\"Hornet's Nest\\" were my biggest disappointments thus far, (by the way, the characters in Hornet's Nest were the same used for this novel). After waiting this long for the book, I regret having bought this hard cover. I am still a devoted and avid Cornwell reader but, I will delay my \\"buy impulses\\" when the next novel surfaces. I think I speak for a majority of her readers when I say, \\"Bring back Kay Scarpetta!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time - I could have had a root canal!!","review":"I seriously question if Patricia Cornwell actually wrote this book. This is as bad as anything I have ever read. The plotting was poor - who ever heard of two ladies, one assistant chief who hangs around with a clerk and the boss who doesn't do anything putting in a year to clean up a department because of reasons that were never quite clear. I really think there were several story lines here that Ms Cornwell never got going and I don't believe she actually finished writing her book, she just merely stopped. If Ms. Cornwell continues writing like this, I fear her reader base will decline. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE STAR","review":"THIS BOOK SUCKED!!!!!!!!!!!

It puts Richmond down and offends the people who have supported her all these years. A rank amateur could write a better book. This is far below her writing capabilities. I was very disappointed. She should stick to the Scarpetta story line. If you have a good thing going, why change?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't deserve a star.","review":"This book should have been called \\"How to write a book in 8 hours\\". There is no way Patricia Cornwell could have given this poorly written, ridiculously-named characters, no plot, boring (need I go on) more than 8 hours of thought. The best thing about this book is that it is only 280 pages. The most action it has is reading the \\"F---\\" word at least three times per page, which I had enough of by the second chapter. I am very pleased that I received the book for free through my book club, otherwise I might have to write to her demanding my money back. She had better come up with better books in the future or she will lose fans. I will certainly think twice before I purchase another one of her books. Actually I will wait until my local library has it in so that I will not waste my money. Unfortunately, it will probably cost me my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL","review":"Worst book I ever read.

This is the WEIRDEST book I have read in a long time. Long stretches of painfully boring descriptions of pointless events and juvenile pranks ... lowbrow slapstick humor, suddenly interspersed with incredibly twisted moments of meanness. Bowels that keep emptying, in fear, or death, or bathroom humor. If not for the violence and language, I'd pass the book on to my 8-year old. He would probably think the book is hysterical, but I sure don't. I can't believe this writer is one of the most highly paid authors today. That's as revolting to me as all her defecation scenes. The whole book was an excuse for Cornwell's gee-it-was-funny-after-that-bottle-of-wine humor. The quality of writing is ruining Scarpetta for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I have ever read!","review":"I have read all of Patricia Cornwell's books and have thoroughly enjoyed them.

Not worth the price or time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second chance given, disappointed again.","review":"Cornwell's normal tight, descriptive narrative again breaks down in her attempt to address a need to break the mold, try something new, or whatever this book and Hornet's Nest are about. No doubt that the talent is there--just too much of a departure from Scarpetta for this reader. Where are these characters going?? I can't seem to muster the necessary empathy to CARE what happens to them so it's hard to wade through the muck and mess of Richmond and the South to complete this journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Southern Cross","review":"It was a letdown to read Southern Cross after having enjoyed so many of this author's offerings with the Scarpetta protagonist. The characters were two-dimensional, and the story poorly crafted. It is actually very difficult to believe that the same person that wrote the Scarpetta novels was the one who authored this unfulfilling book. I guess I'll have to check Ms. Cornwell's reviews instead of buying her books on the strength of her past work.Bottom line - don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Miss Cornwell","review":"I have not missed reading many of Cornwell's books, but by changing something that was already working she screwed up with Southern Cross. She needs to stick with her original script for writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nil Points","review":"I have read and enjoyed many of Cornwells novels (including Hornets Nest) but this was utter utter rubbish. It is unfunny in the extreme. Any atempt at humour is obviously just that - an attempt. It just doesn't work - the plot is weak, unbelievable and completely uninteresting, the pet's opinions are nothing more than plain stupid. West and Brazil's relationship appeared to be run on the level of 10 year olds rather than with the maturity I would presume they should have. Subjects are only touched on, nothing is really finished or tied up (for example Hammer's unresolved grief) PLEASE save your cash. This just isn't worth the actual effort of trying to plough it. Not one star at all - minus ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a complete waste of time","review":"I love all of Patricia Cornwell's Scarpetta books, they are fast-paced and intriguing. The style of this book is the opposite, a lot of jerking back and forth between subplots that sort of come together in the end. I took this book on a trip and was going to give it to my mom when I was done reading it, but I wasn't sure if she'd like it or even if I liked it. I also couldn't really say what it was about, but it suggests things like racism, police brutality, high school violence, without ever coming to a real point. I like the characters Hammer, West, and Brazil, but I felt like any development of them was confusing and conflicted a bit with my impressions of them from Hornet's Nest. I think PC's strong points as a writer are her ability to make you want to turn the page and finish the book in one sitting, but this book made me want to put it down and walk out of the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Cornwell Novel Yet!!","review":"This book is the absolute worst Cornwell novel that she has written. This is pure trash with no redeeming plot or character development. I hope that Patricia Cornwell will go back to her Kate Scarpetta novels and get off of this kick of late with Southern Cross and Hornet's Nest."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was wonderfully entertaining!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I have read several of Ms. Cornwell's previous novels, and found them a bit too technical. But, as I am a Civil War history enthusiast and very familiar with places in Richmond, I thought that I'd give this one a try. I had it finished in 24 hours! The connections between the characters were great and I found that some of the characters were quite amusing. As I have been to Hollywood Cemetery on more than one occasion, I thought that Ms. Cornwell's description of it and one's ability to get lost there was perfect. I was very pleased with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cannot believe such a talented writer wrote such rubbish","review":"Kay Scarpetta is character with great depth. You are inspired to share her life and love, her successes and sorrows. This book lacks anything resembling depth. The characters are all one dimensional and the attempted humour sadly misses the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Cornwell's typical book and I am a fan.","review":"Very choppy and not a consistent smooth plot formation. Not typical of Cornwell and the Scarpetta books. She needs to stay away from the cop stories and stick to forensics and Scarpetta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, don't bother","review":"Ms. Cornwall, what were you thinking? I read to page 130, hoping this book would get better. I think it only got worse. I'm very glad I borrowed the book. I really enjoy her Scarpetta books, (although a couple of them were pretty sad). I felt like I walked into the middle of something and was totally lost. Nothing seemed to fit, no direction. Did someone else write this book and use Patricia Cornwell's name? I give her one star for correctly spelling her name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst effort","review":"I believe that Patricia needs to stop the story line with Hammer, West, and Brazil. I read Hornet's Nest and thought it was okay, so I gave this one a chance and I wished I had not. The use of Niles again and then adding Popeye the dog was so far fetched that I wanted to ask Mrs. Cornwell what was she was thinking. The Kay Scarpetta series is Patricia's best efforts. DO NOT waste your time on this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"My husband and I are big fans of Patricia Cornwell. We have read all the Scarpetta series and absoltely love them. This book was a total disappointment. After my husband read it, he told me it wasn't any good, but I read it anyway. I kept waiting for a real plot and for it to get better. It was a total disappointment and a waste of good money! I will not buy another one in this series! Is this really the same writer that wrote all the Scarpetta books?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Every cliche possible in one book. Awful ! Whither Cornwel?","review":"I will not put a book down unread and that is the only reason I have read this book to completion. Miss Cornwell utilizes every possible anti-Southern, anti-tobacco, anti-Richmond, etc, etc It will be a longtime, if ever, before I line Miss Cornwell's pockets with another purchase. I have read every word she has published but this is the end. Mike Yorke"},{"rating":"1","title":"Her worst book ever.","review":"I love Ms. Cornwall's Kay Scarpetta and although Hornet's Nest wasn'a favorite of mine, I was willing to give this new one the benefit of the doubt. It's really awful. The characters are all unsympathetic and unlikable, even the one's we're supposed to like and I finally put it down halfway through. It was a waste of money. I'll wait for the next Scarpetta book but not read this series again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgar, common characters result in dismal book.","review":"Cornwell's former books were entertaining, witty and unoffensive. This book, about predejudice, bizarre, brutal characters and a beleaguered southern city is nothing new, though it borders on boring vulgarity. I am very disappointed in this book and regret even more that I purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please bring Kay Scarpetta back!!!!","review":"The book is so so. It pales in comparison to her other books. Bring back Kay Scarpetta and her crew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort.","review":"This book was pure drivel. The juxtaposition of the story with the anthropomorphic traits of the pets was more than anyone should have to endure. That Ms. Cromwell would have us believe that animals have the ability to think at levels well beyond the human characters in the book shows that she has lost touch with reality. I wish I hadn't wasted my time reading the half of the book I was able to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"For some reason, many detective/police procedural authors at some point get an irresistable urge to be funny (Reginald King's new series), far out (Ruth Rendall's non-Wexford books) or satirical as in the case of Cornwell's Southern Cross. Somehow, I managed to finish it, probably because of Andy Brazil. As a woman, I find it hard to identify with either Hammond or West, and the whole business of their pets wants to be madcap but is just silly and also distracting. Also who wants to read about characters who cant handle a computer and who can't imagine that a southerner could go hunt racoons and not be concerns with racial attacks. Ick. What a contrast to Scarpetta who (even if Cornwell is an any event not the best of writers) was still a compelling and credible character. From now on before buying a Cornwell book I will check to see which to which group it belongs. Unless, she takes a hint from the overwhelming majority of these reviews and drops this bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better luck next time!","review":"Sorry but this book wasn't even close to Ms. Cornwell's previous worse, (I have never read a bad one until this one) so what's up? I live in Harrisonburg, VA and can't believe that everyone in Richmond is that stupid, doesn't anyone there have an average IQ? And also (I know I am alone here) why is there so much profanity in this book, it was repulsive. I grew up around the US Navy in Norfolk, VA for 35 years and never heard this language all day and all night long . . . give it a rest. Of course if the people in Richmond are as ignorant as they are portrayed then their vocabulary is probably like this. And one good note the language mangler was good, she done good working on her, in my opinion the only bright spot, but still not worth reading. Better luck next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely horrible book!","review":"I have to admit, I never even got to page 70. The language was filthy. I can't believe no one else who reviewed this book mentioned how ridiculous the names of the characters were. Give me a break with Butner Fluck! What kind of a name is that?! Was this book trying to be a comedy? Anyway, besides the fact that I could not read ten words without some sort of expletive involved and the odd choice of names, this book made no sense whatsoever. Sorry, I just hated it. I have to say I have never before not finished a book, I like tying up loose ends, there just wasn't anything here to tie up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A time wasting excercise!","review":"This is my first (and last ) Patricia Cornwell read. A trio of policemen and women try to clean up a Southern town populated by psycopaths and rednecks.The characters are completely overdrawn to the point of caricatures.It could possibly be turned into an amusing B-grade movie at best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible","review":"Proponents quickly shout \\"parody\\" on this one, but even that frosting won't cover this bitter cake. I haven't read any Cornwell prior to this, and this experience isn't going to make it any easier. Sophomoric character development (and naming) and insight into what animals are thinking is bad enough, but where was the editing on this mess? \\"Chain horse\\" should have been \\"chain hoist\\". \\"Tie rod\\" becomes \\"tire rod\\". NYPD's signature CompStat becomes COMSTAT here. And even inventions of an infertile mind like \\"fuel rods\\" get twisted into \\"dual rods\\" in a later chapter. This is a painful read and unfortunately for me, replaces one that was even worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"This was a truly awful read! I have read several Scarpetta books, and hoped this would make a good mystery. No such luck. I would sum up the book as: bizarre, boring, disjointed, coincidental. None of the three or four separate stories going on the book was interesting. One of them had a sympathetic character (Weed) but that was not enough to carry the novel. There was no suspense or thrills in this book. I felt like I was plodding through it the whole way.I also found the inclusion of \\"animals with thoughts\\" to be very irritating. The \\"rap\\" that appears at the end of one chapter was truly awful. I think Cornwell should stay away from writing rap music in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Murder on the Rise","review":"Cornwell weaves her story of corruption that escalates to murder. Hammer is brought in to clean up the police department. Hammer finds that they do not like her stirring-up trouble. All of this is played out in front of the public.

The book comes together very good in the end"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best.","review":"As with the other reviews listed here, I have to agree that this is not Cornwell's best. I enjoy most of her Kay Scarpetta books much more. There was some humor in the book, and Weed's character was amusing and believeable. If you have other books you want to read, put them on top of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cornwall has some fun doing something different","review":"It's clear that fans of Patricia Cornwall's boilerplate Scarpetta mysteries are not comfortable with *Southern Cross*, which represents a very different sort of book. Cornwall has written a tongue-in-cheek farce that builds it appeal on the basis of its satirical excesses and goofy characters more than on the intricacy or plausability of its plot. Personally, I think it works overall, and I enjoyed the ride through its 380 pages of silliness. Whereas die-hard Scarpetta devotees apparently turn up their noses at *Southern Cross*, those who enjoy the mystery-with-humor subgenre exemplified by the works of Carl Hiaasen should consider giving this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Cross","review":"I found this P. Cornwell book to be refreshingly different than her psychological killers with excessive descriptions of the victim and the subsequent autopsy.

Thanks for your good words readers.....bet I'll check here next time.Jack from Key West"},{"rating":"2","title":"The new leader in satire!","review":"I loved it! Patricia Cornwell's departure from her straight thrillers has been a wonderful experience. Her satire is somewhere between Kurt Vonnegut, Jr and the tv show \\"Picket Fences\\". As a social worker, who works with kids like Smoke and like Weed, I find her information surprisingly accurate, in all details. Because of the incredible accuracy with which she portrays the issues of youth and violence, I would almost be tempted to call this a \\"message book\\". \\"Southern Cross\\" is a very worthwhile read, but stay away from it if you have no sense of humor and are unwilling to get one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A MAJOR Disappoinment","review":"I could not believe that Patricia Cornwell could write a book this badly. A novice writer would not have a chance to have such a work published (and justifiably so). There was not one redeeming quality to this novel. Even Niles-the STAR, as far as I was concerned of Hornet's Nest-was relegated to a cartoon role. I am not sure if there could have been any more loose ends at the end. I hope that PC is not becoming bored with her work, or worse, taking her fans for granted. I'd rather she'd subscribe to the \\"absence makes the heart grow fonder\\" theory of pumping out books rather than \\"familiarity breeds contempt.\\" I will be wary of her next non-Kay book; on the other hand, if there is one, it has got to be better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not even finish it","review":"This was so bad, neither my husband nor I could finish this.

I hope she goes back to writing Kay Scarpetta stories, because this one does nothing for me. Half the time, I figured I was missing something with the story.Hardly any kind of investigation of any semblance. Come on now, painting a statue with poster paint ohh I am so scared.Anyway,don't waste your time or money. Thank God I got this out of the library. I am stopping trying to read this at page 253.

The satire was half-baked, the humor was low-brow and contrived. The plot was weak, with too much time spent setting up events and jokes that just weren't worth it. The three regulars were insipid and bumbling. One character was ridiculed to death over a ludicrous, made-up accent that got very old very fast, and then annoying. The 'bad guy' was by far the most intriguing aspect of the book. Vile and menacing throughout the book he collapses in an ending that is classic Cornwell ie, rushed and unsatisfying. The 'victim' was a kid so unrealistically drawn as to be saccharin. Had Cornwell just done a dark, hard-hitting look at juvenile crime, letting her strong dialogue provide the humor naturally, Southern Cross would have been an exciting and compelling read. There was probably more detail on coon hunting than juvenile crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"horribly disappointed","review":"As one of Ms. Cornwell's biggest fans - I try to find the best parts of each book to re-read over and over again. In this one I found nothing. the only redeeming character was Weed - and his painting of the statue was pretty cool. The main characters from Hornet's Nest went no where. I can see the rest of the series being about this trio of characters going to different big southern cities - Atlanta, Baton Rogue, Nashville.. It is going to take a lot to get me to pick up the next book.

As I recall, Hornet's Nest received many bad reviews and I could not figure out why: loved the story and loved the 3 characters. HOWEVER, this book was just plain bad. Hoping to get a great continuation on Hammer, West, and Brazil, the characters were shells of their former selves. Too many incredibly unreasable things going on and far too many characters scrunched into a very lame ending. Worse yet, these folks are high level police personnel in Richmond, VA (why couldn't they stay in Charlotte anyway?) and there was no run-in with Scarpetta or Moreno? Lord knows I couldn't do it any better myself, but still, Cornwell could have. I do hope the big three appear again, however, I definitely hope it is better than this.

Ready for a little kitsche? Ready for a little high camp?

After having seen some of the worst of Richmond life myself (I once worked for VCU), I can only say that she really succeeds in bringing comic relief to a depressing situation. Her sense of exageration is a mite week, but she emparts the slightly-off flavor of the oh-so-Southern eccentric. My only regret is that she missed some of my favorite stereotypes.

I will never again buy a hardcover by Cornwell.Just because an author has made his/her name publishers and authors often seem to think they can get away with anything and make money out of the established name.

The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society used to give copies away to patients so check there before you pay $74+ for a used video.

I have donated multiple copies of the video and book to Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago for use with their young cancer patients and their families. The story is especially good for siblings of children with cancer, since it shows how they sometimes feel that they are being ignored, and their sister or brother is getting all of the attention. It also teaches a child how to defend a classmate against bullying, when the girl with cancer is made fun of for having lost her hair. My only reservation would be not to give this video to a child who has extremely advanced cancer, since of course the story has a happy ending, and it might cause the child to wonder why they don't seem to be recovering. Overall: well done, Charles Schulz!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sad special about childhood cancer","review":"This is the saddest of the peanuts specials and you'll need the kleenex for this one. the story follows linus's friend janice who gets sent home from school due to her being very sick and then she goes to the hospital. when charlie brown and linus visit her in the hospital, linus learns that janice has leukemia and she explains the tests she underwent and the treatments she'll undergo to treat her cancer. while charlie brown and linus are walking home from the hospital, linus turns to charlie brown asks him the title and then walks off while the song \\"farther along\\" plays in the background and i'm not ashamed to admit, the kleenex box was almost empty when i saw that part. anyhoo, i won't spoil the rest of this tearjerker, but as i've said before, mr. schulz really knew how to tug at your heartstrings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hudson sprayer","review":"Possibly the worst item I have ever owned.

From there he's off and running. He gives us successors to those roots: Ziegfield - vaudeville, Cohan - G&S with an American twist and gives us sparkling details and cogent WHYS. He gives SHOWBOAT, OKLAHOMA!, WEST SIDE STORY and COMPANY their due as landmark, game-changing pieces, without fawning excessively over them, and credits The Princess Theatre Musicals (VERY GOOD EDDIE etc.) as a cauldron of experimentation, PAL JOEY, and URINETOWN as tinkerers that improved the form.

I suspect that Morsi thought this showed his devotion, but to me, it revealed his weakness. Then, the heroine becomes convinced that the hero is secretly gay. I know that Morsi thought this combination would be light and funny, but with two such tentative, hesitant characters, \\"Matters of the Heart\\" was doomed.

I play it when I want quiet, soothing music in the background while I read or do other activities. I also listen to it in the car as it does not make me speed!Approximately half the tracks are traditional Christmas carols arranged for solo piano by Jim Brickman.

I can remember hearing this EP in the Eighties and enjoying the vinyl version. With five good songs and one great song (Happy Boy), the EP stands the test of time well. The Bolshoi mixes a Goth background (like Bauhaus) with the pop sensibilities of classic Love and Rockets. Giants is improved by the inclusion of additional tracks (hence the BIGGER title). Any fan of Love and Rockets, Peter Murphy, Tones on Tail, Hurricane, or old Cure (Disintigration, 7 seconds, Pornography)should enjoy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is the Bolshoi I Love","review":"I bought Sob Story on 7\\" vinyl, largely on the strength of the artwork, and I absolutely loved its churning, Gang-of-Fourish bassline and edgy sound. The Giants EP was, therefore a no-brainer and established The Bolshoi as a favourite act. To get the single and EP on one CD is handy, even though it has been very hard to find in the past. These songs definitely have \\"goth\\" leanings but always retain a certain pop sensibility that took over their later albums, which are nowhere near as good as this.If you are familiar with Friends or Lindy's Party, their two full-length albums, you may or may not like this stuff as much. It is a lot more rocky but retains front-man Trevor Tanner's characteristic sense of humour. In fact, I'd suggest Tanner's more recent solo albums, specifically Eaten by the Sea, are more like this material than the two Bolshoi albums are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality....very Spacious","review":"I purchased this toybox for my daughter's things to be stored in our livingroom.

But the pump has been poor quality from the beginning. First, after a lot playing around with it, I finally found a piece of plastic debris from the fabrication process inside the pump causing it to work intermittently. Notwithstanding that, the pump seals are very poor quality and do not seal well, leaving me again with no pressure. I am a a real do-it-yourselfer and fix all kinds of stuff. But this pump is such low quality that I am not going to bother getting replacement seals, which would be a trivial repair task.

I though at first I didn't close the cap properly, or that maybe I caused spillage as I had to lean forward supporting the backpack's weight on my back to pull the cumbersome straps into place, but it's just poor design causing the leakage. The pump stopped working the first use, I took it apart, reassembled, and it stopped again halfway through being emptied.

Unlike most sportswriters and ice-age baseball men, the authors understood why on-base-percentage and slugging percentage are keys while batting average means little. The authors examine the statistics of several key players, and show us what to look for. I mention flaws because their linear weights system of measuring players is rather flawed - Roy Smalley Jr. was NOT one of the top 100 players of all time.

The second, Darling of my heart, is a lament and parting song for those emigrating to America. The third, The herring boats, is a lament for those lost at sea. ... the traditional religious pieces which include Media Vita, the Keening of the Three Marys, Seven Sorrows of Mary and a piece of Dies Ires, are all excellent. The lament for the repression / exile of Catholic \\"Return, return my dear\\" reminds us of some of the causes of the current problems in Northern Ireland.Mary McLaughlin exhibits wonderful control and expressiveness in all the material.

He has made the lessons of economics both entertaining and educational. Yet while enjoyable in its entirety, the most useful part of the book was the final 15 pages, which summarized O'Rourke economic beliefs.

This is not a text book nor does it claim to be.It's an interesting look at how macro-economic principles have been used both well and poorly in nations around the world. Good capitalism, bad capitalism, good socialism, bad socialism, etc. It highlights the idea that hard work and freedom are essential to making money but they must be governed by laws to succeed.I would recommend this book for someone with a general interest in economic principles that's looking for a light funny read rather than a textbook.

If I lose this copy, I would buy it again.This is O'Rourke's essay on economics, in it he analyzes why some societies work economically and why some do not, regardless of geography or access to natural resources. It has often been said that to be funny you first have to be smart. Here O'Rourke demonstrates that he knows more than a little about free market economics.

The funniest being in Cuba...or was it Sweden... wherever P.J. goes or ends up, you'll be laffing till it hurts. Another O'Rourke masterpiece, written with sheer brilliance. Like I said in another review, he's the funniest man living because any man funnier must surely be dead. Susie Melkus"},{"rating":"1","title":"A massive disappointment","review":"I was greatly disappointed by this book. If Mr. O'Rourke wants to argue the superiority of the free market, he should at least define it in some meaningful way. His argument that the NYSE is a free market because it cannot be affected by government ignores the obvious effect of things like interest rate policies. This book is not carefully thought out and far below Mr. O'Rourke's usual standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalism is not economics","review":"This is NOT an introduction to economics; it is an introduction to capitalist ideology. They are not the same! It is mildly amusing in parts, but if you don't share the author's belief in the benelevolence of the free market you may find it irritatingly dogmatic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shockingly immoral","review":"P.J. O'Rourke apparently doesn't care about those poor baby seals up in Canada, and he also seems to be shockingly oblivious to the need to think and say things that are morally right. He's very bad for this reason. Other people, like that fine man Chomsky, or his learned collegue Professor Harris at the Common Courage and Higher Morals Press can show us the way to truth and justice, while writers like P.J. lead us only to the moral quagmire, formerly known as classical liberalism. If I say something is bad, what right under God or Collective Values does O'Rourke have to indulge himself??? Besides, \\"Steal This Book...\\" is MUCH funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to Get Rich: Write a Book that Says Nothing but Makes People Laugh","review":"P.J. O'Rourke manages to dizzy his audience with a tautological series of stories, comparsions, and self-defacement and then nauseatingly spews empty paragraphs. Don't know what a tautology is? Read this book, you'll figure it out.An author either takes pride in his ignorance or banks on his authority. O'Rourke attempts to do both, the former almost always shining through the latter. Coming away, you'll feel like you learned something. Of course you did! It just took him 10 angles, 5 anecdotes, and 8 less-than-appropriate similes to convey a Macro 101 principle. If you want a good laugh, read this book. If you want someone who knows what they're talking about, keep looking"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweden's Not So Bad","review":"I was really surprised how O'Rourke came away from Sweden without ripping their social democratic welfare state to shreds. He seems to have learned a bit about how a humane version of capitalism could work. For that reason alone the book should be required reading for all rah-rah American free marketeers. Much of the rest of the book is immediately forgettable. I was very disappointed with the chapter on Wall Street, a very lazy reporting job, and not at all witty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still looking for the funny parts.","review":"This book is devoid of humor or insight.

They is excellent artworks all done in pencil (black, white and greys) but printed on poor paper that makes the black run distorting the pictures.The book tries to give a sample of a few recipes from too many countries and winds up not doing justice to any. She covers Israel, Persia, Turkey, The Fertile Crescent, Armenai, and North of the Sahara in only 136 pages.Some of the ingredients are way too exotic or unusual for a standard American pantry such as tongue and pineapple pate, Moroccan brains, etc. These do not even sound appetizing. There were a few interesting dishes for soup and lamb.The information on the different countries is interesting but there is not enough of any one country.I suggest you discover a Middle Eastern country you are interested in and buy a cookbook specializing on that country alone.I will tear out a few pages in this book and throw the rest away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Dummies or those who need to learn about verbs","review":"This book will not teach you about verbs and conjugations. It assumes that you already know and undersstand how grammar works and just jumbs into review. The writer does not know how to explain the subject and just assumes that someone else has done the hard work of teaching you the subject matter. I knew that I had wasted my money when reading the Introduction the author states that she assumes that you already have a background in Spanish, and have learned all of the verb tenses, then she goes on to recommend Spanish for Dummies if you are a rank beginner. Spanish for Dummies is also a worthless teaching guide, save your money and avoid the whole Spanish for Dummies series.

If I am finding errors in the intro/review section, how can I trust what is being taught once I get to the more advanced material?

I finished it only to see how ludicrous it could get.I guess 4 guys going on a combat patrol/rescue mission without facepaint, without any M-67s between them but armed with sleeping pads should have been a clue. The scene of all 4 of them asleep in a row, without posting a guard, was also extremely realistic.As far as I know, escape and evasion methods usually don't include repeated and loud yelling of \\"MOVE MOVE MOVE MOVE MOVE\\" to be sure to let your enemy know exactly where you are.Apparently the producers of this turd didn't want to spend the dough for a military advisor....save yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time !","review":"I gave this movie a chance because Zane was in it, what a mistake.

This is the first book that I've read from this author and after finishing it I wanted to run out and buy the rest of \\"Lord Nightingale's\\" books. I found Serendepity and Nicky to be delightful characters. Lord Nightingale's antics were hilarious,they had me laughing right along with the charcters. I think its a well written Regency, entertaining and relaxing. The characters were realistic to me and it had a nice unconfusing plot. But I was left wondering....... Knollsmarmer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars? Forget it...","review":"I must have missed something in this book that people would give it 5 stars. I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who did not like the book. I found the story and characters inspid. The bird, Lord Nightingale, detracted from what might have been a good story. I just don't know. This book was quite inferior compared to Ms. Lansdowne's previous works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Wow - what a range of opinions on this book. In a way, it must be rewarding to Judith Lansdowne that so many are interested in her work. I am a big fan of her books. I enjoy the fun, light qualities her regencies have. However, the failure of this book is really no surprise. It should have been edited better. It went on way too long. Also, I too found Serendipity too, well, yes, dippy, even for a Lansdowne book. Romances are read as escape book. This was an overly writen book with too many people, a bit of a silly story involving a bird, and two lead characters, Nicky and Serendipity, who were not really very romantic. Trust me, Ms. Lansdowne, handsome leading men do not have to be rapists! A bit of masculinity never hurts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lord Nightingale's Delight is a DELIGHT!","review":"Judith A. Lansdowne's latest book, Lord Nightingale's Delight, is another fantastic journey of wonderful characters, delightful imagery and sumptuous language. As usual, Ms. Lansdowne does not dwell in the trite and ordinary, but once again offers the reader a delightful ride riddled with humor, warmth and spirit. Revealing too much of the story in a short review would be a crime. Like so many of Ms. Lansdowne's other books, it must be experienced! Lord Nightingale's Delight is best read tucked into bed, curled up with a delicious cup of hot tea. Thanks, Ms. Lansdowne, for another great book! I recommend it wholeheartedly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A witty and charming book","review":"I just recently finished this book, and I must say it's a breath of fresh air. I am a large fan of the Regency novels that involve rakes, but I do have to say there are far too many of them. It's refreshing to have a lead male that *isn't* out to bed every female possible, or avoid marriage, or anything of that nature. This book has a sensitive, caring, kind male lead, and I think that's one part that makes it so enchanting. I enjoyed the bits with the animals, and I thought the plot was nicely done and creative, but the real winner in my book was Nicky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Island CD, Masterful","review":"If I had to spend a year on a desert island, I would be sure to place Patrick Cassidy's Famine Remembrance into my backpack. This music is breathtakingly beautiful. One can almost sense the anguish of the Irish people as they witnessed their loved ones dying helplessly. The score captures the suffering of this dear people and their land. Of course, one can compose works of lament that leave one lying in the gutter, defeated. No so, this recording. The two majestic Funeral Marches (introducing and ending the work) capture the dignity of what the Irish people have suffered. In other words, death does not have its final say. The De Profundis is every bit as magnificent as the best in Renaissance works or Baroque requiems. This is a very highly recommended work of genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Original Recording","review":"I don't know anything about root-kits but it sounded to me like just a bad minor label recording at the dawn of the Hi-Fi 12 inch LP era. Then I heard The Night Has A Thousand Eyes on the radio - same distortion. I think they played it as a warning. With so much Horace Silver on the market, why dampen one's spirit with this one. 6 PIECES OF SILVER is the Blue Note recording with Byrd and Mobley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edgar Cayce Fans Rejoice","review":"This is a wonderful, complete compilation of Cayce's readings. It is very well organized by category and navigation is very easy using search terms. The only reason I am not giving it a 5-star is due to the fact that I could not find a way to review the readings in a chronilogical order, only by category or key words. I would have liked to compare the early readings to his later work to see how the way the information progressed in presentation while in trance. Fans of Cayce's work will enjoy this very much and I think it is a VERY reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy.","review":"I don't own a copy of the CD, but recently I became a member of the ARE, and on the website it allows members to have access of the all the readings of Edgar Cayce without having to install any software.

There's a little 70's R&B vibe blended with a big modern day hip-hop sound entirely her own. This song is as good as her material with Destiny's Child. Mastering hit singles in one act is hard enough. Beyonce has mastered it in a second act, and that is phenomenal. She proves that she is very talented, therefore deserving the #1 spot on the singles charts. Jay-Z's rap feature is also great.

I was recording it and SO excited about the next episode. They even previewed a future episode, showing a scene with Kevin yelling that there was a fire in the compound. But that 4th episode never aired. There was no explanation. Was it canceled? Was it only meant to be 3 episodes? This would have worked so well as a long-running series (better than most of the junk on that channel - even Expedition Wild with the dude and his bear is a complete bore compared to this), and I know Kevin could have used the royalty checks. Throughout the show he'd occasionally mention how it was a struggle to finance the care of all these animals, and the maintenance and protection of the land, and I was always happy that now he had a TV show that would give him some much needed income. Apparently not.Regardless, this is just stunning to watch, and so beautiful.

This book, unfortunately, is nothing but a list of dates and occurances. As many times as Texas was married, I never learned of her husbands or her relationships with them. There is scant mention on her friendships and the dynamics of her relationships with the many famous and influential people she knew. In other words, there's no insight into what made Texas tick. Indeed, I came away not knowing Guinan at all. I ended up reading about 3/4 of the book (with great difficulty due to intense boredom) and at last skipping to the end. It was a frustrating waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Split what?","review":"What's worse than opening the hood of your classic car and seeing a bunch of non-bundled wires snaking around the engine compartment?

I love that it looks right at home and it keeps the wiring safe from heat. Will be buying more in all the various sizes. Be sure to not go too small in diameter for whatever wire(s) you'll be shoving in there because it's not split down the side. You'll need to push the wires through first.

It tries to explain a lot of concepts, but does not use practical examples. This is in total contrast to the book I mentioned, which keeps the information interesting and readers can relate to it easily.2. The case studies sections seem to be done hastily and there is no practical knowledge which you can get from them. They seem to be simple applications of web services.

De Man was reaching out to a more general audience than in the works published later in his life and posthumously by his many admirers and students.

The relationship between Thea and Andre is always riveting as they work out a life together.

Other bands like Slipknot, Fear Factory, Korn, and Slayer have already made the difference in metal and bands like Soil, Static-X, and Drowning Pool are uncreative and unrealistic. Their first song to hit MTV is \\"Bodies\\". Definitly annoying (For those are preparing to loose weight and feel like doing jumping-jacks, then this song is for you).

Williams's impressive whisper-to-a-scream delivery in \\"Tear Away\\" and the unbridled energy of \\"Told You So\\" are also striking. The Texas quartet's post rap-rock heaviness is aggro yet melodic, not to mention believable, credible and intelligent.

In between you'll find \\"All Over Me,\\" \\"I Am,\\" \\"Tear Away,\\" and of course the classic \\"Bodies.\\" This song alone has received quite a bit of attention. I don't know if it's due to it fantastic rhythm it possesses or because of the controversial lyrics?? Either way, this album is a great one to add to your collection.

That song Bodies is the worst song I've ever heard. Well at least they can count to 4 in the song. Well look for my new album of me singing in the shower cause MTV is going to make it buzzworthy and all the studid kids will go out and buy it and tell me how deep the lyrical content on it is. \\"And when you dropped the soap that was so intense, you're music is so meaningful\\".

Though I must say I did not truly enjoy this band, it is always sad when one passes. Drowning Pool were a small fraction of my first heavy metal concert of my 13 years on this earth- Ozzfest 2002 in Atlanta, Georgia. The excitement I felt that day will never be equaled. I enjoyed each and every band that day to absolute max; even bands I truly disliked had something over me...just the unity and energy of that place overwhelmed me. DP even played a decent cover of Metallica's 'Creeping Death.'

I got hooked on Bodies after seeing it on MTV all the time(bout time MTV plays some REAL music, not NSUCK), then last Friday when I saw it in Barnes & Noble for 9.99, I decided to check it out. What a find! Best songs are Sinner, Bodies, Take Away, Mute, & All Over Me. Tired of boy bands & want some good hardcore?

I think there's even a part where the guy says, \\"one, two, one, two, three, let's go\\", or if he doesn't, you'd expect him to. File this under the overflowing \\"Korn Krap\\" category.

This cd is terrible. If you're an MTV you'll love it, just like MTV...does, anything that has any kind of \\"edge\\" in any way combined with generic sounds and lyrics they will eat up. Don't let other reviews fool you, this band has no dark side and is simply posing as something they're not. Death metal, no, metal, no, not even hard rock.

The whole cd is beyond dumb, not that I bought it. I listened to my friend's copy for about seven minutes before I couldn't take the torture anymore. He gave it to me b/c he hated it. Well I hated it too, so I gave it back to him and it is now laying somewhere in the woods by his house, hopefully with deer turds and flies all over it, after it \\"accidently\\" fell out of his bedroom window.

What do you make of that. A singer so bad that each bands kicks him out.... Anyway. The guitar are all similar and the singer just repeats himself. \\"let the bodies hit the floor\\" \\"one, am i going insane, two am i going insane\\" He repeats that till he gets to five. The singer constantly sounds like he's out of breath and man, don't even get me started about the drummer. Alot of people will argue, that the guitarists(or bassists I'm not sure) dreds are amazing. But no. If you want to see real dreds get some pics of Kevin Jardine, the Slaves ON dope guitarist.

Hailing from Texas, their 11 track disc brings together all of the fundamentals a good metal album in 2001 needs; anger-ridden vocals (\\"Sermon\\"), heavily effected guitars (\\"Pity\\") and earth shaking rhythms (\\"Tear Away\\"). It also contains that undeniable black cloud of doom aura throughout the entire disc, from which much of their lyrical content is derived (\\"Follow\\"). Drowning Pool tap the vein of the teenage angst machine without Fred Durst brashness or Aaron Lewis emotion, but instead through a good old fashioned metal anthem (\\"Bodies\\") that's sure to rule the circle pits this summer concert season, which may be the deciding factor that puts Drowning Pool on the top of the constantly shuffled metal card deck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wind-Up Scores Again With Drowning Pool","review":"First it was Creed and now Drowning Pool. Wind-Up Records has struck gold again with this new hot band from Texas. The debut album on Wind-Up, \\"Sinner\\" has all the makings of a legendary rock album. Already, the single \\"Bodies\\" is being played regularly on MTV as well as gaining exposure on WWF commercials. Surprisingly enough, the first song on the CD, \\"Sinner\\", is probably the better song. The band also scores heavy points with \\"Tear Away\\", the third track on the CD. This band has shown they can fit right into the Ozzfest lineup. Talented, with great stage presence, it won't be long for Drowning Pool to start hitting the top of the charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"Heavy but not noisy, Drowning pool are definetely one of the better bands out there.

(*sigh*) i guess this is where metal is headed. its all poppish, like Linkin Park and Adema, etc... im a big fan of bands like Metallica, Tool, Alice Cooper, etc... bands that defined metal. not that every band has to make a landmark for themselves right away but these guys just dont have it. screaming does not account for lack of guitar experiece. sorry guys, but get some guitar (and voice) lessons or get a new band."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is cheesy WWE music. lol","review":"Omg My farts sound better than this.

But (in my opinion) not a single song aside from Bodies had nearly its level of energy. They're all slower. Most have great introductions, but then the chorus and main 'riff' just doesn't stir your pulse at all.Unless you absolutely have to own 'Bodies', I would skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna-Be Metal Band","review":"Move over Korn?

This band is nothing compared to the nu-metal bands that burst onto the scene a few years ago such as Korn. They aren't really heavy enough to be considered a heavy metal band like System of a Down or Soulfly, and their songs aren't melodic enough to be as good as the songs of Puddle of Mudd, Nickelback, or Fuel. Every song on this CD is just a cheap imitation. \\"Bodies\\" is very catchy and may be good the first 3 times you hear it, but it does get very annoying. The lyrical content to the song is horrible. Someone said that that \\"Bodies\\" sounds like some sort of exercise anthem, and they are right. And yes, all the other songs are just as bad, but not worth mentioning. I am just glad it was not me that made the mistake of buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP Dave","review":"This is the only \\"real\\" Drowning Pool CD. The new Drowning Pool \\"Desensititzed\\" has a totally different sound...singerwise that is.Sinner is one of the best Nu Metal CDs ever and will be in the Nu Metal Hall of Flame. The songs are driving hard rock with melodic music and intelligent, well thought out, sing-along-to lyrics.Dave Williams had a gift that is unfortunately uncommon. He sings from the heart.

The riffs are very simple and repetitive, and the lyrics are about the dumbest I've ever heard, and I've heard thousand of bands!!! I was familiar with the \\"Bodies\\" single and hated that, and thought maybe there would be better songs to be found on the album, but they are all boring and repetitive just like that song, play a few simple riffs and repeat about ten lines in each song is the theme of the album.

I have to say though, of the few CD's that I now own, this has got to be one of the best. It doubles as good background music and can also be very listening intensive. What I especially dig about BT is his original tracks. I'm not too much into the whole dancing/clubing scene, so I don't get all that excited about remix after remix. However, the ones on this CD are done tastefully, with the inclusion of a few originals by Transeau himself. My favorite remix has got to be \\"Shame\\" done by WayOutWest. For the first day or two that I had this CD I could not go by this track. It's sick.

He's been rehashing that style on MISL for the past 3 years, and is quite stuck in the past...the 1 redeeming factor of this cd is that it documents a time when BT was being creative.

The party attacks and the group attacks are the sweetest thing in this game and are very easy to perform, and when you K.O. your opponent with one of those attacks you'll feel very good! This game is a little hard to master and the default settings are a little too high, but it can be adjusted. Tons of extras, hidden characters, great effects, great music... and a very low price!

Once this happened I couldn't figure out how to reestablish her respect to the fence.

One of the first questions is \\"Could it have taken a lightning strike?\\" How would I know. The wire is in the ground outside. I guess it could have. Try to prove there was no lightning near by. I realize now it was not engineered to survive any near-by strikes so they will not cover the transmitter.When I asked if there was any options, he tried to sell me a $250 dollar system. No offer to fix it or replace it. Price for just the transmitter $60 + S/H. I am now looking for a different brand system for not much more.

You can also rent a 4 inch trencher that lays the cable for you, too. Rental places will know what you need, so just tell them what you are doing.I gave it a 4 cause there is no way to adjust the zap that the dog receives, and I felt so horrible watching the Lhasa apso fly up in the air as he hit the edge, but I know we both would feel worse if he flew out the door, (accidents happen) and got ran over and killed or maimed.

If you have a long haired dog like I do, you have to buy the longer probes extra every time you replace the collar.

The glossary and index are really helpful so you can quickly look up a particular particle, force, etc. I would have liked to have seen more (simplified) diagrams of the particle collisions that lead to confirmation of various particles.Spoiler Alert of sorts!!!!This book was written before the confirmation/discovery of the Higgs Boson at the Large Hadron Collider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I've read several popular physics books, and I think this one was the worst. I hoped the followup \\"Supersymmetry\\" would be better. I think I made it through the first chapter before putting it down for good.

I've tried two cake recipes, one being the chocolate hazelnut cream cake, on page 81. I bake cakes often and this one is incomplete. You end up with something that resembles cement. The egg whites should have been added in, but I wanted to do the recipe as written. I did add butter to be able to somewhat spread the mixture into the pans. I would not have bought this one for myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I bought this book because the cover made my mouth water. I ordered it for a really good price and anxiously awaited it's arrival. Well, when it came I was extremley dissapointed.

But the majority of the cakes in this book I would not even try. The cover is still beautiful though."},{"rating":"2","title":"best of the best sites.com","review":"This is exactly what I would expect of a book with this title. It's about time. Normally I would search in magazines,trade publications and newspapers for recommended web sites. This tended to be hit and miss. The BoTB Sites guide is concise, to the point and handy. I look up what I want the first time, rather than having to wade through countless search engine results (of which the majority are not pertinent to my search). I'd recommend it to anyone who doesn't have all day to play on the web."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inu-Yasha is Amazing","review":"This dvd contains the episodes 49 Kohaku's Lost Memory, 50 That Unforgettable Face, and 51 Inu-Yasha's Soul, Devoured. I like this dvd so much because through the three episodes it can be seen how much Sango truely and deeply cares and loves her brother Kohaku by the fact that she goes to great lengths to protect him from Naraku. This dvd is also great for giving for insight into many of the main characters of Inu-Yasha. For example Naraku's greatest power is using the feelings of others is shown, Miroku's bravery is shown, and lastly farther facts about how Inu-Yasha is conected with his sword, Tetsusaiga is revealed. The only down side to this dvd is that Sango's problems side tack slightly from the central plot of the developement of Inu-Yasha's character and his relationship with Kagome. But I would recomand this dvd for sure because it is a part for what makes Inu-Yasha so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shattered Memories","review":"This DVD ROCKS! Sango and the others come upon her little brother Kohaku. He seems normal but has lost all of his memories.Sango thinks he has escaped Naraku's spell and is forced to make the hardest decision of her life in the first 2 episodes.In the 3rd episode Miroku and Inuyasha get themselves trapped in a poison cocoon.Inuyasha breaks free and slotters the demon and the all the bandits. Can Inuyasha keep control of the demon within? Unexspectedly Sesshoumaru shows up. What will he do? Will he kill Inuyasha?

There is magic and fanatasy, there is just enough romance for the teenage heart and there is mystery and suspense. Mahy has a gift with prose and the descriptions are wonderful and the stroy truly comes to life. I have always wished for a follow up... to know where the stroy goes from here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great read","review":"I remember, when I was a teen, loving Margaret Mahy's books. This one and The Tricksters were my favorites. I could still go back to them today and love them. Mahy's a phenomenal writer. She really draws you into the characters' lives and makes you want to be them or help them as much as you can. In this book, The Changeover, a young girl must battle an evil sorcerer-type man who is sucking the soul of her young brother. The scariest thing about this book is how real it felt. It takes place in New Zealand or Australia (I forget, it's been a while), so the customs and local signposts are different, but the feel of fear for a sibling; or when one knows s/he's done something against one's parent's wishes... It's universal. It's a really great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesante, anque no es facil de leer","review":"En este libro, Mendoza demuestra que es un buen narrador.

Rather than being a traditional tribute, it's more electronicly oriented than the other tributes out there which keep it to the traditional \\"real\\" instruments played. Drum machines and samples aside, the singers are terrible. They sound like lounge singers or somthing you'ld hear in an elevator. I'd give this a minus rating if I could. I've loved Deep Purple's music for over 15 years now, and it's because of my love of that band that I tend to be a bit harsher on other peoples versions of these great classic songs.

While \\"The Book\\" is set up to appear to follow that thread, the questions are stilted, the parameters are (mostly) asinine, and so the conclusions - although the research is fabulously thorough - are fatuous and irrelevant. It has taken me weeks to slog my way through this book, because every time I pick it up the presumptions tick me off.The 2 stars are for the research.

The manual focus ring operates smooth as silk, unlike some other Nikon lenses. My copy backfocuses ever so slightly on test charts, but in the real world focuses flawlessly. Quality built in Japan.

The f/1.8 (the 50mm) and f/2.0 (the 35mm) just barely squeek by as usable for available light street photography at night, unless you go to an ISO over 400 (which on my D80 is at the limit of usable at night in terms of noise)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fast prime lens for Nikon cameras","review":"This is a D lens, made for non-digital cameras, but it works fine on digital ones too. Only, when you use it on a digital model it's not really a wide angle lens, but more like a standard length lens, the equivalent of 50mm on a film SLR. It's a fast lens and has good crisp clarity. Another great feature of the lens is its minimum focus distance, about 11 inches. I've made some very good shots using small apertures to produce very clear focus on the subject in the foreground, and blur the background. The lens is light, and automatic focuses very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"best yet","review":"this album is edgy at times and soothing at times and always emotive. all in all, i would say it is my favorite shipping news albums and definitely hosts some of the best songs i have heard recorded by any artist in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clumsy","review":"This is a very clumsy controller. Although it comes at a very appetizing price, the quality reflects that low price.

Hawksby (would anyone call him Bixworth?) is obsessed far too long with his divine mistress...I wonder if he would have given her up at all if she hadn't pre-empted him...and there doesn't seem to be a lot of romantic feeling coming from Maggie, either.

The opening tune seems to drag on and on, and really is quite annoying. The only song that I thoroughly enjoy from listen to listen is the EP's closer, \\"Piano Song.\\" And even that song is not all that amazing.

GREAT concept, and FANTASTIC workout. A true interval trainer's dream!HOWEVER, if you are not very coordinated or you aren't naturally inclined to learn workout \\"routines\\" then you may want to look elsewhere for a good workout. This video moves fast, so if can't learn steps quickly then you may just get frustrated that you bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respectable sweat","review":"This DVD is fun, a pretty decent workout (advanced beginner - intermediate) and a good time (40 mins) for days when you don't have an hour or so to spare. I really liked the trainer, though you need to know something of form yourself as she doesn't say much about it, and the workout is over before you know it. I didn't find it confusing, but then I work out to DVDs every day - I just enjoyed myself. I have to say, I have NO IDEA what the weights parts are doing there: they are far, far too short to do anything really except give more variety to the moves - which I guess is okay. I liked the 10 minute bonus DVD feature of a Baron Baptiste yoga workout too; of course, I know it's really an advert but it provides a nice stretch for after this workout. I'm English, and don't like the over-peppiness of some American programmes - this verges on the annoying but doesn't get there as Petra is really likeable. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not interval training! Beginners Only!","review":"I am truly disappointed with it. It definitely did not feel like an interval training . Ok maybe she had 3 one min intervals but that's a joke. You don't call a workout interval training if that's all you offer. She should have called it a light or beginners' cardio so people know what they are getting.And why were the weights there? She would have needed them if there were high intensity intervals that needed recovery time. And she's very fast with the moves. If I did not have good coordination I would probably have given up after 10 min.I have Prevention's Walk your way Slim. This one is similar to Kobler's but it's so more advanced and it really gets your heart going and it's longer.I don't think I'll be doing P.Kobler's Intervals Training again. She might have great step workouts but that definitely wasn't a good product. I just did not feel as if I've worked out well once I was done with it.She should have not called it interval training."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry Petra, but I didn't like it...","review":"I like Petra Kolber - she's down to earth, is a great cuer- I still have several her DVDs on my wish list and will purchase them. But... I think this video is horrible.I couldn't get the cardio moves down, couldn't learn them quickly enough to have an effective workout. Okay, it's me and more coordinated folks would be fine with that. But also I found the music was awful, the set was awful (dark, dull) and even Petra looked awful, kind of scary because of her washed out makeup. She looks much younger in her recent DVDs! And I wanted her to stop yelling at me in the video because I was already feeling pretty lousy being a klutz. Not fun at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"I shut the DVD off after less than 5 min and tossed it in the thrift shop pile. The coordinated steps were impossible to follow.

This shooter is absolutely amazing. The bullets will absolutely fill the screen and the \\"Mosquito\\" technique is a perfect idea.The shooter market is slowly dying and this game won't single handidly bring it back to life, however, that doesn't mean that any gamer should be without a gem like this in their collection.The game is insanely hard, but not frustrating, it manages to balance extreme difficulity and willingness to try again perfectly.The graphics are rather old fashioned, harking back to the older days of shooters. The bosses fill the screen and bullets fly everywhere.I felt that the sound was also quite good.

It's really wonderful, with great and inventive play mechanics and a \\"shop\\" mode that honestly doubles your enjoyment of the game. It also posesses the one feature that matters most - PROPER PACING. This game doesn't start off impossible and get harder like most shooters (which is WHY the shooter is dying in the first place), rather it slowly builds and gives you a chance to get to know the various enemies and formulate strategies on the fly.

It's watered down texture and fuzzy Michael Stipe wannabe singer made me want to throw the CD in the trash immediately. Instead, I'm going to try and return it. the music itself sounds like cheap karaoke at a sports bar.Cover bands are cool....but only when you're half drunk at a bar in Key West or on spring break somewhere.

The tribute bands preserved the original songs sound, while adding their own flavor.BUT, this \\"tribute\\" album for R.E.M. is complete garbgage!!! The band played the original R.E.M. music, with out any originality and they sound like a highschool garage band, while the singers tries way too hard to sound like Mike Stipes.

The musicians try to emulate R.E.M.'s sound but fall WAY short of the mark. You'll end up hearing the songs you've grown to love being slaughtered and shamed right in front of your ears.

I have stacks of such books that have not helped me at all. It seems to me that there in a conspiracy to try to keep people from learning what all the great guitar players know. Even the private instructors keep you taking lessons for years without really teaching you anything of value. When I learned to play wind instruments the lessons were concise and they followed a definate pattern to help you achieve a high level of ability. All the guitar books I've seen so far start somewhere in the middle and go nowhere.

I must admit though that guitar playing could be easier if you have an experienced player teach you some tricks to help you understand some of the more difficult concepts such as the hammer ons, slides, pulls, and power chords. If you feel comfortable with learning guitar on your own this is a good book to start with. I also recommend getting Hal Leonard's Ultimate guitar book.

I don't think that Joyce could have been replaced like meantion earlier. I enjoy Cindy alot too. She is my second favorite blond next to Terri. Her timing with John was great aswell. The extras on this set were weak, I do agree. Hopefully we can get better extras next season. And get ride of the \\"BEST OF\\" IMO that is just a waste of space.

I do not plan to purchase the season 5 DVD when it's released in stores. I'm looking forward to the season 6 boxset when Barnes was introduced to the cast. The show greatly improved once she became part of the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop the Jenilee bashing!","review":"Ok, stop the Jenilee bashing! Yes, we were all disappointed when Suzanne left, but that's no reason to take it out on Jenilee. Jenilee Harrison actually got better as the season progressed. She was particularly funning in 'Janet's Secret', 'Father of the Bride' and 'Double Trouble'. I was disappointed when she eventually left the show. Besides, this season has some of the funniest episodes, even though some people refuse to admit it. And yes, Jenilee does deserve to be on this cover. So buy season 5 asap and watch Cindy 'knock Jack off his feet with a door'!I'm also interested in watching those tag scenes with Suzanne, which seemed to have been edited out for syndication.This is also a season where Joyce and Don do some of their best work on the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"The good old days!","review":"I love Three's Company...I was born in the late 70s, so I don't remember the first run of most of the episodes.

Personally, I'm not a huge Chrissy Snow fan, so I like season 5 because Chrissy's last scenes are about halfway through the season, and then Cindy comes in. I know she gets a bad rap (and Terri kind of does, too), but I much prefer these later seasons of Three's Company. I wish TV shows now were this entertaining, instead of all the reality crap. I love popping these discs in for an afternoon of mindless entertainment and nostalgia!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye to Suzanne.","review":"Three's Company - Season Five is the season we said farewell to Chrissy Snow.

I am no longer buying Thrustmaster products. I would recomend a Microsoft Sidewinder or a wheel made by Logitech called MOMO. Also the pedals feel sloppy and they slide all over a carpet, which makes it very uncomfortable and hard to control... The NASCAR Pro Digital 2 is a horrible buy. I thought that NASCAR would put their name on a GOOD product, not this...thing. This might sound harsh, but I am a real race fan, and I know what a good wheel should be like, and it is not like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrustmaster Nascar Pro Digital 2","review":"I bout this wheel because i owned 2 other thrustmaster wheels. My first one 8 years old and still being used. I bout this one because i wanted digital. I ask thrustmaster why my wheel isn't callibraited and they said they would send me parts for free. I restarted windows and it worked great and thrustmaster sent me parts. So now i got extras. ... THRUSTMASTER is [inexpensive] and way under rated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is the only wheel i have ever used and it is terrible. The right shifter paddle and the gas pedal broke, so i returned it. A week after i got the new one, the paddle broke again. All i have to say is this is a terrible wheel, go with Logitech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thrustmater Nascar Pro Digital 2 Steering Wheel","review":"Very disappointed in this steering wheel. I have owned 2 other Thrustmaster wheels and they were reasonable quality for the money. This wheel seemed cheaper than previous Thrusmasters-and that was proven when it broke after a few weeks of occasional use. The left paddle shifter stopped working without warning. This will probably be my last Thrustmaster wheel. Now we will see how good Amazon's return program works."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUST A HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE","review":"I borught this wheel from a retailer that said it was being dicontinued. So I guess I shouldn't have expected much, but the set-up for the actual wheel was great but the software was the problem it kept crashing my system when I removed the software the game and system would run fine but when you added the software back on to the system it would cause Nascar 4 to run super slow and the dreaded BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH would appear. So it wasn't quite the bargin I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it!","review":"I am not a full-time gamer, but if it takes hours to try to get a wheel to work...I don't want it. What's the deal with this wheel?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worse than the original.","review":"I bought a Thrustmaster Nascar Pro Digital sometime in 1999. I really enjoyed the feel of the wheel, and pedals. After some computer trouble, I tried to re-install this wheel, but the software was faulty somehow. I finally gave up and bought this one (Pro Digital 2). This wheel did not work either. I eventually determined that the problem was with the computer, and ended up re-imaging the hard drive. After this, both wheels worked perfectly. The grip on the steering wheel was better on the orginal, but I like the new paddle shifter design. The overall product seems to be built more solidly, and I have had no trouble with either of these wheels thusfar. One minor detail: the clamps for tabletop mounting are not secured very well, and will occasionally fall apart (although it's an easy repair). Great product overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this wheel!","review":"Got this as a low-cost wheel for a second computer. I really liked the old thrustmaster \\"nascar pro\\" wheel I had, it had an excellent feel and worked well. This didn't live up. While there are a lot of new features (lots of buttons, paddle shifters) there a number of problems introduced. The whole construction feels very cheap and doesn't give you a good (static) feedback from the wheel or the brake pedal. The pedal unit is very light and tends to slide around the floor while you are driving. The software is horrible. The pedals actually only operate on one axis for throttle and brakes unless you are running their systray taskbar utility to change the settings on a per-application basis. It is really inelegant and hard to figure out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good. Even Has a Shifter. Too Bad the Brake Pedal Broke...","review":"I used to have this when I was 10-14 years old. It was really realistic and exciting, especially with the gear shifter, which most steering wheels don't have and I guess hooking up a joystick and putting it to the right side of the steering wheel will work, which I might do with the steering wheel I just ordered. Only thing was, I was grounded from the PC for a year and a month, October 2004-November 2005, and when I tried it in November 2005 the brake pedal didn't work. About 2 years before that, the left paddle quit on me while I was playing NASCAR 2000. A few days after I raced with my maimed wheel and pedals in November 2005, I couldn't find it. My Mom told me she threw it away cause it was broken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for occasional joyride, unacceptable for hardcore race","review":"I have now owned my fourth wheel from Thrustmaster. They truly are the best bang for the buck. My dissapointment lies in the products reliablity. I'm on my fourth because the the other three preceeding it have expired. The potentiometers which control pedal function don't last long and the company's tech support and customer care are very inadequate. If you want a great toy for gaming, this is it. If you like to race, upgrade to a higher quality product or buy a couple extras for spares. You will need them."},{"rating":"1","title":"local no-wave wannabes turned industry lapdogs","review":"this sucks slightly less than their older stuff but it also seems like a bizarre sellout move. this band used to be defined by their raw garageyness and they completely sucked at music, now they suck slightly less due to the production but sound like another brick in the interpol/bloc party wall. the best example i can give is if nirvana started sounding like creed. it sucks either way but these guys sound like they became puppets. a lot more professional, a little less interesting, equally uncatchy and insubstancial tunes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seeing cool reality through a crappy mirror ...","review":"This book is about two reconnaisance pilots who get shot down, then have to come to terms with their rustic desert surroundings -- and themselves.I consider myself well-read and open to a variety of genres. This book is the internal reflections of the two pilots. While you occasionally will read about the activities of the pilots, mostly you get a stream-of-thought that mixes their individual histories, fantasies, and a little reality.The best analogy would be buying a great DVD, but then instead of being able to watch it, you learn about what technically happens inside the DVD player as the cool DVD is playing. Sure, sometimes you might catch a glimpse of a cool activity. But most of the rest is unintelligible and meaningless.Another example -- one PARAGRAPH lasts 8 pages. Eight pages of run-on sentences in one paragraph.This is probably the worst book I've ever read. I don't blame the author -- I just can't believe a publisher would pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WR gloves","review":"Gloves were okay.

He talks about the ecology of streams, the setting, types of fish and the challenges facing rivers today. He also, in a series of Sketches, explores river lore.

An excellent book for those who love rivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Critique of Neocolonial Senegal","review":"Ousmane Sembene, pivotal figure in West African cinema, draws a scathing and ironic portrait of bureaucracy and everyday life in post-independence Dakar, Senegal. He weaves a story of international labor migration (a street sweeper from Senegal in Paris), gender relations in polygyny, the relations between urban and rural relatives, brothers and sisters, and ordinary people with a bloated and corrupt cogernment bureaucracy -- all surrounding the innocent attempt by the street sweeper to send his mother (via his urban uncle in Dakar) a remittance in the form of a money order.

For the price, this is a good value and most kids will enjoy it, including the multiplay, but eventually grow tired of it and resell it for something else. My son (9) liked it quite a bit, so give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customize like crazy. Repetitive yet addictive.","review":"This is not an RPG. Still, the effect of improving customization (better guns, better chassis, etc.) gives the same satisfaction as leveling up a role playing character. The variety of customization is excellent.The battles are quick and addictive. Try to stop at just one... However the battlefields are too repetitive and many of the same style battles happen over and over and over.This is realtime, not turn based. So there is a clenching tension about each battle that makes it exciting.I have a new game I want to play. I've had it for two weeks now. But I can't stop playing this game... Maybe just one more battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for any Ds collection","review":"I bought this game from a store, and I just wanted to say that it is awsome. You are a kid that just moved to a new town, and you join a Custom Robo team Numero Uno to face the Grapple Gang, another rival in school team. From the start of the, you start out with Ray Mk II, a very well balanced robo. Somewhere after that point, you are able to start getting new parts and robos. The story could've probably been better, but it doesn't detract from the overall gameplay. THe graphics for the overhead \\"Rpgish\\" mode could've been slightly better, but im not going to argue, because the robos in 3D look great. The game is kinda short(for me anyways), but after you beat the robo cup, you can collect all of the other parts, and even unlock and buy Illegal parts. Also, this game has wifi, so you can fight an opponent many miles away from you online."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Captain Saturday is a GREAT read!

The weapons you can get are awsome and so is the equipment you can buy. You can really get hooked on this game ! There are a few down sides to this game though 1. Most of the equipment you can buy at the outfitter is useless. 2. You can only move in a big 360 degree circle. 3. The guides say the same things over and over again. 4. And the biggest promblem is even if you sight in your gun perfectly and you aim right at the kill zone of an animal it will say you missed completely or just knicked the animal. But if you like hunting like me , the thrill of taking down a trophy animal on this game is worth it. Overall, a good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST HUNTING GAME EVER MADE","review":"THIS GAME HAS TO BE THE WORST HUNTING GAME EVER MADE.

I ordered this so I could relive those moments, the fun factor is still there, but the delivery and smoothness of games has evolved so much that it was far too noticeable to really immerse myself in this game like I did back in the day. Fun game, just don't expect to be wowed like when you were a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlezone II is the best game ever","review":"This is a very fun game.

When I tried them out, one of the three did not light properly. I received a replacement, and all seemed well.At the event, I could not get two of the burners to work, and had to scramble to find at least one portable burner from a friend. During the event, the flames would shoot out of the unit, and at one point I burned my hand. Then the flame would get very low and did not keep the heat at a uniform temperature. I ended up returing a total of four of these units.I strongly recommend you spend more money and get a more reliable product. This is a cheap stove that will not go the distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor purchase","review":"We could never get this to light (directions say not to light it manually) and got absolutely no help from the distributor that Amazon referred us to. We went round in circles for far too much time to finally be told that it was made in China and they didn't have any information on it. They also clearly didn't care. We'll definitely stay away from anything like that. The stove seems like a good one, but not being able to light it wipes that out. It was quite a while before we needed to use it, so probably too late to return it by the time we tracked down any response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peels off after 15 minutes...","review":"We bought this border because of the other great reviews and liked the idea of sticking it up and being able to take it down later. We put the border up easy enough, but 15 minutes later, we walked into a jumbled mess on the floor. And to top it off, it sticks to itself better than it sticks to the wall. So when we attempted to peel it apart, it would rip.If you want to waste your money to try it out feel free, but I would suggest using an additional glue like wallpaper adhesive or something to keep it from peeling off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cars Border","review":"This border was even better than I expected! I decided to paint my son's room grey and this border brought out the blue hues in the paint and it looks awesome. It is very eyecatching, but not to busy.

He is going to love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zombies + Typing = FUN!","review":"There's nothing like zombies coming at you to motivate your typing speed!!!Most of the reviews say it in here, but this game is a LOT of fun. Though it doesn't track your typing speed (WPM), it does test and tell you strengths and weaknesses, including accuracy, reaction time, and decision making. However, not only did it help me increase my typing accuracy, it most definitely increased my typing speed.I was pretty fast to begin with, but typing faster is always a plus. I timed myself prior to playing the game and clocked in at an average of 63 WPM. A week later (playing the game about 1 hour per day), I timed in at 74 WPM. Nice improvement! However, I needed a massage to work out the knots in my neck from stressing out about the incoming monsters! ;)I highly recommend this for anyone looking to improve their typing skills across the board.That's my two pence...Arial ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew zombies were educational?","review":"This is a great game especially for those of us who are video game challenged. I've never been great at video games, but I can type with the best. So when a friend introduced me to (read in your scary zombie voice) The Typing of the Dead I was blown away. Sure its not the most challenging game in the world and it could use a few more levels, but its great fun. As far as actually teaching you to type, well... that's debatable. See you don't have to hit the space bar or capitalize anything. But overall I love this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"the game that never should've been","review":"What a boring game that is if you know how to type alredy the whole monsters will get you if you dont type fast enough theme is lame i personally much liked the game better when it was a shooting game."},{"rating":"2","title":"sharp fast lens","review":"Sharp fast lens....took a little getting used to but it produces sharp images at all apertures and focal lengths.....once in awhile I think it looks a little soft around the edges at 2.8 and 24mm.......but I can't be sure yet.....but I know at 3.5 and 4.0 everything is tack sharp..."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE","review":"NICE LENS;I DONT HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH IT;IT TAKES A WHILE TO GET USED TO INTERNAL FOCUS IN MACRO MODE ALSO, BUT IT DOES THE JOB FINE;I NEVER GO WRONG WITH NIKON(SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW) KEEP YOUR CANONS, IM A NIKONIAN FOR LIFE,LOL....PS-AMAZONS PRICE WAS 200- LESS THAN I COULD GET WITH A RITZ DISCOUNT!!!

Does not deserve your attention.","review":"Extremely generic, bases all the detail description referring to the HOWTO and the MAN pages. Do not worth neither one third of its price. By far better the Naba Barkakati book \\"Red Hat Linux Secrets\\" that, on the contrary, guides you into the details without loosing the overall concept. A last remark: don't write to the autors of Linux Unleashed, they will simply ignore your mail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall, it is a good book.","review":"To sum it up, 3rd edition is a good book. Although I prefer O'Reilly over SAMS, this book provides information on quite a few programs. Some of the subjects are bash, pdksh, tcsh, FTP,groff, vi, emacs, TeX, LaTeX, XFree86, SLIP/PPP, Wabi, and StarOffice.Some chapters go into depth while others tend to talk about the subject in a general manner. For example, they might have described the kernel in more detail. However, as I mentioned earlier, it describes many programs in detail.Since this book is 1,114 pages, many of your questions about Linux will be answered. But, not all of the topics Tim Parker covers you will use, so I classify the book as a reference. The 'user level' is Intermediate to Advanced, so I would not recommend Linux Unleashed to a complete beginner. Overall, it is a good (but not great) book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you know Linux DON'T BUY IT, otherwise DON'T BUY IT!","review":"Poor book, really superficial and by far below the usual quality standards of the \\"Unleashed\\" serie. Almost completely useless if you want to do something more difficult than listing the directory content, the book makes a temptative to be a \\"Bible\\" of Linux but succedes only to be a BIG INDEX. Strangely a considerable part of the book is dedicated to the games that come with Linux! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY WITH IT!!! When an argument becomes more specific, the autor writes: look at the man pages, or look at the HOWTO, or \\"because of the relative scarcity of INN and its suitability to larger networks only, we'll concentrate on nntpd\\"!!! So why don't you look at those info straight now and save your money? P.S.

Then it starts talking about WABI and WINE.. if i wanted to run windows applications I'd be running windows not linux!, briefly touches on the origins of the internet blah blah, but it doesn't tell you how to setup your connection whats with that?

Even though he was viciously discrimated against centuries ago, Martin De Porres flourished as an apostle of charity and as the Patron Saint of social justice. St. Martin De Porres stated that all people are sacred children of God and all animals are sacred creatures of God. He loved and embraced the poor, the sick, prisoners, and even the rich and the greedy in addition to the entire animal kingdom. Martin De Porres was opposed to all forms of violence and he refused to eat flesh-foods and he condemned cruelty to animals. The only negative about this Book is the fact that modern Christian Religions do not embrace the reverence for all life theology that Martin De Porres admirably espoused with the utmost benevolence. If his ideology resonated the earth would be a veritable Garden Of Eden !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"For me this album represents all that can go wrong with latin jazz. It sounds like slightly glorified elevator music or theme songs for a cruise ship. West coast latin jazz is often cheesy in a way that the east coast variety isn't. We are miles and miles away from Cuba here. Why would gifted musicians do this to us?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great techniques","review":"This book is an excellent resource to help counselors and teachers talk to clients and students in ways that help them solve their problems. It provides specific examples of the types of questions to ask when people are \\"stuck\\". If you want additional resources to go along with this book, Choice Theory, Reality Therapy, or Counseling with Choice Theory by Dr. William Glasser are perfect companions to extend your understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glasser again","review":"Yes I bought all of Glasser's books so I could learn about his theories and their results. I think Reality Therapy is a good thing ... especially when working with minimal issues in brief therapy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Gift Idea!","review":"My son (5 mos old then)loved this toy last Christmas! He took the gingerbread man everywhere he went until he lost it. Then he took a liking to the lollipop and he chewed on it all the time. He got excited whenever he saw it. When he was older he liked to put the \\"candy\\" in and take it out. Each piece makes a different sound. They are like soft rattles only cuter! I would highly recommend this for a (young) baby gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST LAPTOP LIGHT","review":"i have three reasons for my thinking. they are simple and quick so here it goes: it falls of my laptop very easily, it is not very attractive at all and it is bulky and in the way.hope this review helps"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time!","review":"25 years on, and at last the fans have a video document of the mighty Nomeansno in action... almost two hours long, and covering every album they've recorded outside of \\"Mama,\\" this concert is exactly what NMN fans have been waiting for... high energy, amazing sound, incredible performance...and if that wasn't enough, you've also got a full Hanson Bros. performance on here as well... a bit more ragged onstage than NMN, but still a very high energy performance of a bunch of their \\"puck rock\\" anthems...My only complaint is that this DVD was recorded in 2002... I would have LOVED some footage from pre-91 with Andy Kerr on guitar... outside of that, though, this is easily the best concert DVD that I have purchased since, well, ever..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game is CRAP!","review":"This game is total crap. Think twice before you buy this. It is one of the worse games ever made. Trust me. The game is barely playable. The AI in the game is horrible. Your team mates are not helpful at all. Most of the time your team gets stuck to the wall. I bought this game and please learn from my mistakes. It doesn't even deserve the 1 star, but I can't submit it with out one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is horrible","review":"I actually never got it but i thought about getting it. The first time i ever saw this abdomination was at one of my friends houses, he got it from his parents. He had to instal it a total of 3 times, so he had three copies of it. The first time we started the game half of the people on all the times went strait in to a corner of the battelfield, and most of the gun fire came from the guys facing the corner so you could see the paintballs coming from either the top of their head or thier back. If you dont belive me you can probably find a demo of this game to download."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the EXTREME ...","review":"I would advise that any gamer out there should avoid this at all costs. This is probably the worst computer game ever made. Graphics are pixelated junk, AI... well, there isn't any I'm afraid, sound- there is none whatsoever, and there is absoultely no redemming qualites from this. My sister enjoys the music though. Anyway, forget this abomination exists and spare yourself from sleep-inducing boredom and wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy again.","review":"This game was kinda fun, but there were too many glitches. The worst part is is that it is TOO EASY. I buy all my players the cheapest guns and I can still win the entire season mode buy myself, the other players don't do anything and move too slowly so I am always by myself. In two different fields, every player from the other team comes out of the same passasge. It is like shooting fish in a barrel. I wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Game...GREAT MUSIC!","review":"I don't care what anyone says. The Music in this game is amazing. Vivaldi's Spring with 4 electric guitars?!?!? How could you not like this??? If any of you know anything about music then you would know that this is good. Now the game is terrible. No doubt about that. Guns suck, Artificial Retardation. Maps worst ever. Very easy. BUT the music makes it all worth it. When I find out who arranged this I can die happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the Price is right...","review":"Graphics are horrible, sound makes me want to remove my sound card, music is like Euro-Tecno-Pop on meth, and the AI is laughable. I never bought this game, but have played it many times at friends' houses just to laugh at the computer players runing into walls and such. People who are thinking, \\"It's DOS, what the heck did you expect?\\" have no idea what they are dealing with. The only reason I can give this an overall rating of 2 stars is because the price of $0.29 makes is worthwhile to buy just for those fun air pillows that come in the packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate this game!!!!!!! You should to.","review":"This is the world's worst game the music is terrible , the AI is the worst in any game game you have played or, for that matter, any game you will play in the future. The only good thing about this stupid game is that it crashed so much I could barely play it. So take my advice and stay away from this game like it was a rancid cow utter. If I could I would give this game zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is so OLD, BORING, and SLOW!!!","review":"This game is awfull! I would not reccomend this for anyone! It's too much violence for little kids and too boring for teens, and no adult would play this game. Compare to great games like \\"Medal of Honor\\" and Call of Duty this is a piece of junk.1. Graphics- Terrible.2. Sound- Below Stereo(bad)3. Gameplay- hard to control!This game has LOW system requirements and about 6 years old!I would put 0 stars if I could to rate this no good, rotten piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme PaitBrawl","review":"Terrible did not work at all. Major glitch, that would not install with the auto-install. Once I got it installed it was trying to run out of Ms-Dos. I would save my money and by PaintBrawl 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and Very Depressing","review":"The author is very detailed on how the world's banks (IMF, World Bank) etc. extend the hand of help with conditions. Essentially, these organizations sole purpose colonization without the invasion; instead it is done with a stroke of a pen.As I was reading, I found myself getting very angry and very depressed at the same time. Time and time again, humanity is made to suffer at the hands of a privileged few who think they have the right and are entitled to the world's resources because they consider themselves to be \\"Special (above the rest of the rest of humanity).\\"The book was written in 2003 but has been updated with some recent events. The IMF and World Bank's Modus Operandi (takeover of the country's governement; forcing austerity, decimating the labor force: result poverty) is being played out in Greece at this very moment in history. Fortunately, the Greek people seem to be rebelling against this and I hope they hold out and win!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, bad copyediting","review":"The book contents were broad in scope and occasionally proselytizing. Occasionally got hung up on odd typos and grammatical mistakes that slipped through - maybe I got a proof?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant book by Chossudovsky!","review":"Chossudovsky is a brilliant economist and a burning torch for the truth that people are unable to see, hear, or accept due to the propaganda schemas that are embedded in their minds (like a microchip programming) by the global media cartel and the political demagogues.Chossudovski analyzes the past and the present in relation to debt, globalization, and international financing. He dispels the myth of the good samaritan (like the IMF, the World bank, and the Federal Reserve, etc) that destroys economies of other countries, and impoverish them under the guise of capitalism (actually corporate socialism) and freedom, in order to own them. He clearly elucidates the dollarization process and its role in the New World Order. This book makes a powerful reading that sheds the light on a vanishing truth. I would highly recommend this volume to anyone who is interested in world finance as well as their future, and the future of their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prophetic","review":"As we watch the economic melt down [or is it a take down?] of the US and first world countries at this period in time, it has a familiar M.O. that Michel Chossudovsky describes. Wealth is not local but global. The banks are given more and the real wealth producing industries are being reduced or eliminated. Vulture capitalism offers little for sustaining a middle class or entrepreneurial class in any country. Mostly the economic decisions are insane except if you want a permanent underclass and overclass.The writing is dense and almost too much to absorb not because of the density but the meanness of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"19th Album","review":"You could say many things about a band making it to nineteen albums. Perhaps 19 almost done with the teens, 19 a year gone by being familiar with adulthood? But this is a good one. Maybe theyre growing older, well they are, but maturing the while. Buy this, cover art is great. This band isnt going anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Youth Progressing","review":"Another album, experimental as always, but at the same time it is listenable.....The melodies are obscure, consisting of harmonics, and sound manipulation with the effects.deep bass ..the drums are used in complex time signatures, making it stand out and has a new approach making it different than the other albums......chaotic noize and complex melodies... the sound goes on........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another strong entry by Sonic Youth...","review":"Another strong entry by Sonic Youth. So many great guitar excursions very reminiscent of Georgia guitar legend Glenn Phillips with the song \\"Stones\\" being the best example. My favorite track is the opening one, \\"Pattern Recognition\\" followed by the Neil Youngish \\"Unmade Bed\\". Another great track is \\"Mariah Carey & The Arthur Doyle Hand Cream\\" which sounds just like Romeo Void circa 1983."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace prevails","review":"Thumbing through the reviews here is interesting, as we see comparisons between Sonic Nurse and Goo, Dirty, Daydream Nation, Evol, Murray Street, NYC Ghosts & Flowers, the early work from the 1980's ... pretty much the band's entire oeuvre. And I agree, it bears favorable comparison with all of the above and more.Whether this is SY's \\"best album ever\\" is another matter, and ultimately a trivial one. This record should attract more listeners and inspire interest in their previous work, and surely that's praise enough.What stands out is how the band has truly collaborated here in a way they have not always done. It's hard to hear the lines between the \\"Kim songs,\\" the \\"Thurston songs,\\" the \\"Lee songs.\\" This is more blended, more -- dare I say the word -- mature effort.Yes, it's a little bit languid in parts, but how long can we reasonably expect the band to keep rocking out like they're 20?This is a great album for SY fans, and a good starting point for newcomers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still relevant","review":"The Sonic not-so-Youth are still relevant. \\"Mature\\" isn't the right word, as they hit the ground running eons ago; \\"refined\\" is more accurate here. With the exception of \\"Kim Gordon and the Arthur Doyle Hand Cream,\\" this album is even and mid-tempo, with the usual SY signatures: alternate tunings, controlled feedback, the occasional tribal tattoo. Some of the earlier cuts, particularly the gorgeous \\"Unmade Bed,\\" bear a curious resemblance to Neil Young (or is it Neil Young that sounds like Sonic Youth?) Kim Gordon's mewling on the aforementioned clunker would have been more appropriate on earlier albums. But Sonic Youth aren't about teenage riots anymore. Here they're just being themselves, and that's a good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sonic Youth is at it again...","review":"Just like their previous album Murray Street, Sonic Youth has toned down the screeching cacaphony of their earlier albums and focused on making more melodic music, while still including the howling guitars where needed. This new album is excellent. Many SY fans from the \\"old\\" days say that they don't like this new melodic side to SY and are used to all the chaos and disorders on the older albums. I find this album more appealing than those..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This disc MIGHT NOT PLAY in your CD player","review":"This disc is a corrupted, or copy-protected, disc and does not play in many CD players. Meaning: it doesn't meet the (Red Book) standards of a CD. Don't buy it and don't support Universal, who uses hard-working, paying consumers to test what copy-protection method works and what doesn't.I also heard this album is rather formulatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry--tarnishing the legacy","review":"everyone, it seems, agrees that Daydream Nation is the pinnacle of what Sonic Youth can do--that was more than 15 years ago. Murray Street, NYC Ghosts and Flowers, Experimental Jet Set--these are the nadirs: absolutely worthless exercises ispastiche/collage guitarscapes/ \\"Poetry\\"...there are 2 good songsthat remind one of the early Youth (if you don't know EVOL or Sister--get them!): \\"peace attack\\" and \\"new Hampshire\\" the rest of this, after 3 listens, is, i think, cack!!! avoid. a waste of money. i was ripped off! come to think of it, i am pretty peeved! happy i bought some good records this week: BLACK WATCH, \\"the innercity garden EP,\\" and BLOC PARTY (well, it's ok)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANT MY MONEY BACK","review":"SONIC NURSE LIKE THE LAST TWO PREVIOUS ALBUMS SUCK.

I love pop corn but don't eat it that much because my husband hates my breath while I am eating it at the movies, so I take Grandpa Po's Originals instead and he keeps hogging the bag! I know soy beans are healthy for you and this is the only way I enjoy to eat them. I love these!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!!","review":"Everyone should be aware that this album is just an import version of Accepted Eclectic with the exact same track listing. It doesn't even have any remixes. It's still a great album, but don't get this one, its just more expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Rapper You've Never Heard","review":"Rap has been riding the themes of sex, alcohol, and marijuanna a bit hard lately and Aceyalone provides a ready antidote for what's ailing the intellectual hip-hop fan. Steering clear of proclaiming his bank balance or choice of beverage, this master lyricist pieces together one of the finest hip hop albums of the past 5 years. From Golden Mic to I Never Knew, Aceyalone covers the spectrum of life, speaking on everything from the growth and maturation process to the role music has played in his life. Innovative beats from master DJ Fat Jack lay the groundwork for Acey to spit some of the wittiest rap lyrics in years. Aceyalone is not hung up on his background, his peeps, his jewlery, or his women. He's hung up on making great great rap music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Book","review":"A book of human language, the first solo Acey album was flawless lyrically, but the production left much do be desired. This time around though the lyrics have remained outstanding with insightful witty rhymes, and the production has drastically improved. If you like the Fellowship you'll love this. This album is the best thing going today and should be a candidate for best of hip-hop 2001."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],W={key:0},P={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,s,r){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(a(),i("span",P,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,N)):b("",!0)])}const B=d(D,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-6ccd6309"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/6.md","filePath":"glossary/6.md"}'),M={name:"glossary/6.md"},G=Object.assign(M,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(B)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
