The book is divided alphabetically, and each introductory letter takes one page; this is followed by a completely blank page. Following this, the New Rules are largely accompanied by small B+W photos for illustrative purposes taking up much of the space. Each New Rule also has two title lines in larger print. My most generous estimate is that the book contains perhaps 80 pages of actual content, much of which is available for free on the website of his TV show. Sure, he's a funny guy, but he's putting the screws to the consumer big-time here. How about this for a New Rule: no books of critical satire allowed whose content could fit comfortably in the TV Guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Rules: Satire With a Bite of Insightful Humor","review":"I love Bill Maher and watch his show every week of the season.

The New Rules vary in their degrees of humor and acidity but almost all are astute, painfully honest and thought provoking (while still making us laugh).

How appropriate.Have to admit, I only lasted about 15-20 pages, but I could see where it was going.Bill Maher is not funny, has never been funny, but seems to attract an audience that is envious that he can continue to insult his way into relevance; maybe they wish they could to.I think he sees how popular and rich Jon Stewart is and Bill probably has a little-man man-crush on him. It's unusual that a person with such little talent could have made it this far; what next, the presidency?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something For Everyone","review":"I was going to title this review \\"Some Funny Observations\\" but quickly realized that was not accurate. This had tons of funny observations. Nobody is spared, not the Republicans, not the Democrats and certianly not Paris Hilton and other members of the \\"rich and famous.\\" Bill Maher's real strength and appeal comes from the fact that he will point out the absurd wherever it exists. There is no hypocrisy here. Unlike pundits on the right and left, who tend to have a very narrow scope, Maher spares nobody. Yes, he does tend to go after the right more than the left, but hey, the right is running everything. There is nothing more inane than reading a book where someone like Sean Hannity slams the left, that is a lot like kicking someone that is down and completely out. My only knock on this book? It is kind of short, I read it in one night. However, many of the observations are so funny, that I will go back to them again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh or Cry","review":"In times like these, with an administration like we have, one must either laugh or cry. Bill Maher made me laugh with this little book. He makes fun of all the sacred cows, certain to offend almost everyone at some point, through his silly and stereotypical gags. But that's humor, isn't it? I do agree with some of the previous reviewers that there is too much white space on the pages, making the price seem high, but one can always borrow a copy or check it out of the library. It is a quick read and it provided me with a couple hours of chuckles. It is a good diversion from the 6:00 news."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felipe in Baja","review":"I read this book and can see why it is now only $3.00. It was way over priced at $14.00. As a matter of fact it is way overpriced at $3.00. Maher isn't a comedian. He is an overpaid, over hyped Hater. Just my opinion.If anyone knows of something funny he has said or done, please let me know. He looks funny but that's the end of his entertainment value. Maybe he should just sell photos of himself looking funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego te absolvo","review":"Let me start with a disclamer. I love Bill for his brilliance and unique sense of humor.But the CD's I attempted to listen are quite painful. Monotonous litany of New Rules that are impossible to listen for more than 10 minutes at a time. Great example of how not to present comedy material.Bill now I am convinced you are a catholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I like Bill Maher, I always have. This book, though... it's terrible. It has barely 5 pages worth of content and the \\"comedy\\" is extremely lazy. If Bill wants to be the next Jay Leno, this is certainly a step in that direction. Need a quick punchline? Throw in Michael Jackson. Use \\"gay\\" as an insult and use it often. Throw in a Paris Hilton joke. It's been done and done and done to death. I expected more from Bill Maher. Bill, what happened to you? Negative 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"He took the words out of my mouth.","review":"I've always liked what Bill had to say on TV and needed a light read so I got New Rules. Now I'm one who agrees with 90% of what he has to say so this was easy for me to like. A few of the rules are already dated at 5 years old, and George W. Bush is mentioned 200 times, but those are the only faults. Whether Bill was talking Religion, Politics or sex, I laughed a lot. A few of those were full-body laughs, just short of dry-heaving. The book is 1/3 photos, and I bet I read the whole thing in two hours. He has a cd of this also. In this country we can't all think alike, but if a few more people thought like Bill it would definitely be a good thing. I mean who couldn't go for some weed and a bj right now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A glance back","review":"New Rules offers a brief review of some of the quips from Real Time. If you're a regular viewer and Maher fan, you've pretty much heard it all before. I didn't mind, since I'd picked it up at a generous discount, and can listen to it with friends who aren't familiar with Maher's bits. Of course his delivery is spot-on, and most of the jokes have a general appeal beyond current events. It's smart and funny and gets my 4 stars; but, as Maher himself pointed out in a New Rules segment, this collection is nothing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short, Funny Takes on America","review":"This is a collection of the \\"New Rules\\" segments from HBO's Late Night with Bill Maher -- which is both the best and worst part of the book. The best, because Maher's New Rules are short and wickedly funny observations on American life by one of the nation's best satirists. The worst, because if you're a fan of Maher and a regular viewer of his HBO show like me, you've heard most of them before. And did I mention that they were short? The book is a very quick read - so quick it left me wanting more. Bottom line: Buy it, read it, lend it to your friends - it'll make the rounds and be back on your shelf in about a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL (see page 93)","review":"I picked this up in the bookstore and was laughing so hard I had to buy it before security had me removed.

Easily 1/3 of the book were blank pages, pages with 1-4 lines of text, or empty pages except for his New Rules title. Even the pages that did contain rules were 1/2 full. This was, at best, an 80 page pamphlet spread out over 240 pages. Honestly, I feel that Maher mailed this one in.

That is the reason TV allows him shows only during the late night period, and his shows are mainly promoted on college campuses and through the the usual groups he panders to.If you want to know what Maher thinks, watch him for free on TV, and save yourself the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money on this one.

They don't need to be experts, they don't need to do extensive research on the subject, because they are supposed to be funny, maybe within a phrase or a paragraph.The problem with Maher's book is that it is a boring, not funny at all book. He obviously doesn't discuss nor explain at length any subject. He just rambles and rants.If I wanted to listen to nonsense rants, I would listen for free to the drunk at my local bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"This book isn't funny, but it's piercing and intelligent. There are scores of well placed blows (most below the belt) to common hypocrisy and senselessness. But. Using a picture depicting a young woman's pain and horror (a picture which also allegorizes the senseless destruction wrought on the Vietnamese people by the US air force) as a gag doesn't work. Why is it tasteless and offensive? Because it uses someone's real suffering for a cheap gag about Lara Flynn Boyle's figure. Bill Maher should be supported - he makes observations the rest of us harbor secretly. But until he learns that using real pain for a gag without any depth makes him a worthless hack, don't give him your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave This One In the Bathroom","review":"I don't like Bill Maher. I find him rude, boorish, and generally obnoxious. In this respect, his personality has carried over to this book fairly well. This book is an extended series of Maher's \\"polite musings,\\" which must be code for bad jokes and general misogyny. Cracks about rape and prostitution are always classy, and, what can I say, Maher is a classy guy....Yeah right.The book is occasionally amusing, in the way a spoiled brat can occasionally inspire a contemptuous chuckle. The sections are all extremely short (the longest is around two pages, and most are much shorter), and the book is padded with cheap B&W; pictures. Leave it in the bathroom when you need something to occupy your mind and you want to amuse yourself at someone else's expense. In this case, at Maher's expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hate from a Hateful Little Man","review":"A very thin (lots of empty space and other filler) book of \\"progressive\\" hate speech masquerading under the theme of humor.

Absolutely.A great book if you are a \\"progressive\\" hater. Otherwise worthless dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little humility goes a long, long way.","review":"I've watched Bill on HBO and have enjoyed both his series and his standup specials. Also, I agree with much of what he says about our present day situation in Iraq and with our incompetent and recalcitrant presidency. This book however, fails for one notable reason.Bill Mahrer is smart, engaging and funny. The biggest problem I have with his work is his smugness and patronizing condescension which tends to cloud most of the work he's done. It's fine to approach a discussion with the knowledge that one is in the right, but coming in with the right, respectful attitude will go beyond merely winning the argument. It will win you the respect of both sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Maher is always worth listening too but this is not his best work","review":"This collection of observations is pretty hit and miss. Many of the jokes are obviously excerpts from stand-up rountines and don't have the impact when read on a page rather than being delivered on-stage. There are some really funny comments but many others just bomb. Another disappointment is that there is simply not that much material here and what there is is scattershot - the whole enterprise would have benefited from a cohesive theme. Bill Maher's iconoclastic perspective is great but this is simply not his best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"This book is just a collection of about 200 paragraphs, most of them short, each covering a different idea, topic or area of comment. More than just a handful were trivial; a lot were of no real interest, and only a handful were really worth reading. Only a few tickled my funny-bone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curmudgeon in Training ...","review":"George Carlin is still my favorite comedian of all time, but he's getting up in age. However, I'm not worried because Bill Maher seems ready to step up and become America's pre-eminent social critic. Taken from his segment, \\"New Rules\\" on his HBO show Real Time With Bill Maher, this book is chock full of his hilarious putdowns of idiotic aspects of American society. Those of you who loved his \\"Get Over Yourself Award\\" on politically incorrect will love this book in which Maher skewers what he sees as the stupidest aspects of American life from Cirque de Soleil to lazy and stupid members of the media to President Bush (who is probably the number one target in the book). I was struck by how much Maher's approach resembles the great Carlin. They both love dissecting the language, they both hate double talk and stupidity and they are both very, very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Rules: Polite Musings of a Timid Observer","review":"Hilarious, no matter what your political persuasion the audio is terrific comedy.

Very funny stuff here and some good \\"rules\\". If you have seen the show, get it anyway just to share with friends.Basically, New Rules is a compilation of the best of the New Rules from his show on HBO. It's a quick easy read and will have you laughing. Bill comments on just about everything, even politics (who'd a thought!). Most of the rules are a paragraph in length. A good bedside book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-out-loud hilarious","review":"The above reviewers have it right. This books is absolutely hysterical. From jabs at the hyprocisy of the neocons (\\"to conversative women out there who oppose stem cell reserach...put your cervix where your mouth is\\") to bridging the gap between the Red and Blue states (\\"Spice rack, meet gun rack. Drinks bottled water, meet drinks from the garden hose.\\") to celebrities' take on the war on Iraq (\\"Britney Spears says we must support the president no matter what. Someone needs to die for that.\\") this in vintage Maher. On point, insighful, and above all, hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"ENDLESS CHUCKLES !!!","review":"Another excellent output by BILL MAHR!!!

That's something that happens to other people's kids. ... The joke here, of course, is on white America, which always feels superior to blacks and often shows it with their feet, moving out of more problematic urban areas. ...\\"Bill Maher's attacks against white people show he does know a lot about racism because he has that mindset. Read between the lines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Bill Maher, Hated the Book","review":"Love Bill Maher in person and some of his written material. However, I have to say I didn't like this book. It took me a couple of hours to wade through it.....short and not so sweet. Too much about Homosexuality and Sex. While I dont have a problem with either topic, I was looking for Bill's popular political bites and there is plenty of material out there for that topic. To my mind he missed the boat on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best format for this type of humor","review":"Bill Maher is a funny, pretty well-informed guy with mainly libertarian views on politics; his blunt style can offend at times (especially all the *extremely* bitter parts about women, marriage and relationships--it sounds like he's still angry over rejection of some kind?), but is usually laugh-out-loud hilarious. That said, I didn't really like the format of New Rules. It seemed like too many rapid fire jokes at once; there's a reason the segment on the show \\"Real Time with Bill Maher\\" isn't the *entire* show--it just feels like too much after awhile. So, while there are some truly funny moments in this book, after awhile the hyper-sarcastic, whiny tone begins to wear thin. If you want to read a book by Maher, check out When You Ride Alone, You Ride with Bin Laden--it's still a collection of brief observations, but they're more fleshed out and less pedantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Bill - For What It's Worth","review":"I don't agree with Bill's positions on some issues, and he comes off too smug and self-assured on television, but he's honest and speaks his mind, and you can't ask for more than that. Of course, I'm a liberal, and that means I refuse to take my own side in an issue. But whether you agree with Maher or not, this book will get you thinking, and will surely amuse you."},{"rating":"1","title":"adolescent stylings at best","review":"Bill Maher personifies the reason why I, a life-long democrat and a teacher, am moving away from the current \\"Democratic\\" party and leaning more toward independent. I am sure he has wonderful ideas but couching them in a constant barrage of foul language and hate-filled rantings makes me realize that the party has left me, I haven't left the party. JFK would, today, be considered a right-wing wacko using the Maher standards. I was so excited to get this book, hoping to hear (I had the CD) wit and humor with far thinking ideas. Instead it was the same nonsense spouted by the likes of Michael Moore and Cynthia McKinney. Sad really. I disagree with most of what Ann Coulter says, but at least she's intelligently funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bill Maher, Polite?

You asked a question Bill in your new Irreligious movie that no one answered. You asked \\"Why doesn't God destroy Satan, what is God waiting on? This answer is: He is waiting on you to repent and come to know Him, so you won't land in HELL!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Wake Me When You're Done Billy","review":"If I could have rated this book lower, I would have. I find it amusing that Mr. Maher considers himself an expert on geopolitics when his own educational background is, to say the least, sketchy. Against my better judgement, I read the book. All I can say is that If I had undergone a pre-frontal lobotomy or had suffered serious brain damage at some time, I might have more appreciation for Mr. Maher and this poor excuse for a book. If you're going to buy it, at least get the hardback because it can always function as a doorstop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly, Yes; Funny, No","review":"I went into this book with both eyes open -- i.e., fully aware of Bill Maher's free-floating anger and, in particular, of his foam-at-the-mouth loathing of the Catholic Church (his ugliest trait). Despite this preparation, however, I was completely taken aback by the virulence of the rage and hatred that wafts from every page. There's a stench about this book; it stinks of full-blown pathology, and there's nothing remotely funny about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"no power cord included","review":"price is fine but they did not include the main power cord.i week later they try to sell me a power cord for $3.00.very LAME!I hate when sellers show you photos of what you are looking for and then sell otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs Work","review":"This book of SHEET MUSIC from Alanis' first album, Jagged Little Pill, offers stirring renditions of the fabulous songs included on her CD. Or, they would be stirring if they weren't all so bad.While classic soft-rock songs like \\"Perfect,\\" \\"Forgiven,\\" \\"Mary Jane\\" and \\"You Learn\\" are relatively good, the harder songs like You Oughta Know, Not the Doctor and even Ironic aren't very good copies of Alanis's songs.Sadly, this is the only sheet music to Jagged Little Pill, so even while lacking in some places, I suppose it's better than trying to figure the songs out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"They take you to heaven, they take you to hell","review":"Why, the hell, Robert Fripp bands, called King Crimson, can not bring us one perfect piece of art? Why 90% of the objective listeners use to pick up their favorites from every disc, while skipping the strange-noisy rest of it? Why can't they put the remote control away, when Crimson is played? Anyway, Crimson is very special band (or may i say \\"bands\\"?) and \\"Cirkus\\" is a fine collection of their live concerts by the yrs 1970-1998.

Ranucci and Rollins introduce the cube, with chapters on putting hem together, taking them apart, games you can play with them, and that sort of thing, but it's written more in the style of a research paper than a book aimed at math laymen; this is likely to throw some people off.

The roof is only 3 years old. So it's not a coinkydink.opt for exterior wall or pole installation if you get a DISH.Video didn't upload :( I dunno why I can't send my videos from my smart phone to my email.

The most obvious being the triple LNB component. Its plastic housing showed discoloration like you would expect from something having been sun-bleached. None of this would be really bothersome if everything worked. The dish was not able to pick up the 110 or 129 satellites. With the disappoinment of receiving a used and defective setup, I would have liked a full refund but that was not an option. I could only request a replacement LNB by returning the defective one at my own expense. I did not have the time to immediately test the replacement LNB upon receiving it so it has now been several months past. The dish with the replacement LNB now does not pick up any of the three satellites. With two days of attempted installation (a total of 10 hours), a signal could never be gained. Will make more attempts as time allows but I don't have much confidence in obtaining a successful outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Back Cover:","review":"David Childs has provided simply the most comprehensive work available in English on the GDR today.

I can honestly say I have never been more let down and disappointed in a movie before in my entire life. It's a perfect example of how NOT to make a movie, and my respect for the actors in the movie just took a huge hit.

The \\"movie\\" is so low budget that it looks like they filmed it on a camcorder and the video at times was almost undiscernable on my fifty inch plasma with upconversion bluray player.

It's a series of shorts, supposedly thematically related, and yet, not. Several of them, particularly the Josh Hartnett one, are indecipherable.

This is surprisingly good and sentimental...or maybe it is just mediocre, but in comparison to the drivel you've been forced to watch up to that point, it seems amazing. The idea of failing at suicide because your car won't start is actually a decent way to start the story.They probably should have started with that, and then let the rest of the movie crash and burn. As it is, probably only 3 people have actually watched that story, since watching the entire movie up until that point is an exercise in self-hate.If, despite all the warnings you've been given here, you still think \\"oh, how bad can it be??\\" and decide to pick up the movie, once you realize you can't take anymore, fast forward to the last story and watch that.

There were no immediate \\"hits\\" there - like on the previous albums.On the other hand, like on all Indigo Girls albums, there are no poor songs. Many of these songs may not be among their very best, but they grow on you when you get to know them. So eventually it became a winner for meMy first favourites were \\"Least Complicated\\", \\"Reunion\\" and \\"Power of Two\\". But also \\"Dead Man\`s Hill\\" and \\"Fare Thee Well\\" are very strong tracks.Most of the album is rather quiet, but on a couple of Amy\`s songs they get real hard rocking; especially \\"Touch Me Fall\\" and \\"This Train Revised\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, solid album","review":"Probably the best album that this group has put out.

A bit folky at times, reminiscent of classical music at others, interspersed with ballady undertones: an eclectic but highly effective mix!

I was wrong...although I didn't think that I would, I liked this album even more!For someone who has never listened to the Indigo Girls, this would be a great CD to begin your collection...the songs are beautifully written, and the harmonizing of Amy and Emily's voices is amazing. Two of the best tracks on this album are 'Least Complicated' and 'Power of Two', but those are just my favorites.Although Amy and Emily have different song-writing styles, they blend together and accentuate each other beautifully....anyone, no matter what their musical preference, will certainly be able to find an Indigo Girls song on this CD that they enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Most Listened to CD","review":"Swamp Ophelia never returns to its jewel box.

I also hoped to be amused, since the book's advance praise suggested the book made good points while being humorous. I was so disappointed. The book is an easy read, but becomes boring quickly. The writing is rather drab, and the potential of this subject is lost. The writer seems to have little insight into her behavior and has little to share and teach others.

The type of obsessive-compulsive disorder she possesses is so pulverizing, it will make you think twice about some of your own little quirks and foibles. She exhibits great courage and little self-consciousness about her disease. This level of OCD can be unusually difficult to treat, so they tell me, and the fact that Colas is still with us, hasn't mutilated herself beyond recognition, can still laugh, understands how far she can go (and has gone)...well, it's nothing short of amazing. The writing style leaves a little to be desired, but the book's short length is about all anyone could stand to read about OCD. My hat is off to the author. I also promise I will NEVER check to see if the glass rim has a chip on it ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humorous look at a serious disease.","review":"Coles, in her book \\"Just Checking,\\" chooses to make light of a very serious illness--obsessive compulsive disorder. The strange thing is that it works. By wisecracking about the rather odd things she did over the years, and the way that her husband enabled her by going along with her strange behavior, she places the reader inside her head. While entertaining us, Coles also shows us how logical this behavior seemed to her at the time. I was both horrified and amused, as contradictory as this seems. Coles has done a wonderful job of showing us how OCD takes over the lives of its unfortunate victims until they go for the help that they need. Fortunately, the author went for help, but unfortunately, she paid a steep price for waiting so long. This book is touching, informative and entertaining. Coles is a talented and brutally honest writer. She is to be commended for telling it like it is; it must have been difficult for her to bare her soul like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item is dangerous and should be recalled","review":"I have had this Crock-Pot for about 2 years.

It get too hot on the outside of the unit (yes, it would burn a child) and the counter top under the unit gets too hot. Every couple of hours I will move the unit around a little so it doesn't stay in the same spot on the counter, just don't want to take a chance. Within 6 to 8 months of purchase, the handles started to slowly chip away. I know I should have returned it right then, but I really couldn't believe it.

Don't get me wrong, the unit looks very nice, and if High meant high temperature and Low meant low temperature, this unit would be a perfect fit in many kitchens. However, low means 212 degrees on this unit, which will scald your soups and burn your slow cooked roast recipe. Warm is the only usable 'slow cook' setting on the entire unit, and even that is over 180 degrees (and is the setting that doesn't have a timer on it).

Sure, Neil's solo albums were great and the Finn Brother's album was a nice little treat (if a bit slow), but I never thought I'd see another \\"Crowded House\\" album. If I did live to see the day, I reasoned, it would be another in a long line of bands getting back together that had nothing to say and no reason to be back together. I've never been so happy to be so wrong.There is a somber tone that seems to hang over the album, but as long as Neil can still write an amazing pop tune like \\"She Called Up\\", I don't care.The last third of the album falters a bit for me, but even saying that, \\"Time on Earth\\" is an album well worth checking out. If you need convincing, just listen to \\"She Called Up\\" and I DEFY you to get that song out of your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crowded House returns...","review":"It's been very interesting watching (hearing) Neil Finn's progression as a songwriter. He's always had what we've called a dark side and that's been refelctive in each CH and solo albums. For me he is the most human songwriter I have ever heard.I must admit, after a few listens, that in whole this album makes me feel a bit sad and somber. There are some great songs on here, though! \\"Don't Stop Now\\" and \\"Pour Le Monde\\" are my immediate favorites.As a whole I find this one closer to Neil's 1st solo CD \\"Try Whistling This\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crowded House have plenty of time on earth.","review":"Great album from start to finish. Lyrics are still strong and thought-provoking. Instrumentation is huge. My favorites are \\"Say That Again,\\" \\"A Sigh,\\" \\"Nobody Wants To,\\" and \\"Walked Her Way Down.\\" Right now I'm giving this four, but maybe after a couple of months of digesting the album, the album could go five stars. \\"Even a Child\\" wasn't one of my favorites off the bat, but now it's not bad.

In short, this is a classic - right up there with Woodface.Dont ask me how this guy can have so much talent - just check out the beautiful sounds on this excellent CD.Lyrically Neil Finn is on the top of his game too, prepared to go where others fear to tread in the opening song \\" nobody wants to\\" where he meditates on his mate Hester's tragic death, and the things nobody wants to talk about."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent CD","review":"I have been a Crowded House fan since the Finn Brother days and Split Enz, thanks to my Admin Assistant who turned me on to them many years ago.Notwithstanding my age (apparently I am too old for this type of music as I grew up with the Beatles, Stones, the Who, the Kinks, the Moody Blues et.al.)I took to them immediately.Neil Finn as we all know writes some very catchy music and this album is no exception.While I thought Wood Face would be hard to top and perhaps it is, this is an excellent CD I felt compelled, after dinner this evening, to write a short note about.It is a tad different than some of their other work, as has been pointed out, and I didn't really get hooked on it until about the third listen.If you enjoy lyrical, catchy music, excellent production, and for my money the best musicianship I have heard from these chaps from down under, then buy it.I recommend this CD to anyone of any age. It is well worth the few dollars it costs. More than worth it actually."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Welcome Return","review":"A welcome if expectedly melancholy return by one of the greatest bands ever. The ghost of the late Paul Hester hangs over this entire album, and even the poppiest number (\\"She Called Up\\") finds leader Neil Finn preoccupied with a profound sense of loss, declaring, \\"She Called Up and gave me the news/It made me so sad, there was nothing I could do.\\" The lovely \\"English Trees\\" is the most direct tribute Finn makes to the fallen drummer on TIME ON EARTH, and it, along with \\"Pour le Monde\\" rank with the best of his work.Ironically, \\"Don't Stop Now,\\" the lead single, is one of the more formulaic tracks on the album, a trait it shares with the strikingly-similar \\"Say That Again.\\" However, any dissatisfaction with these are outweighed by the ambient pop sensibilities found in \\"A Sigh,\\" \\"People Are Like Suns,\\" and the bittersweet \\"You Are the One to Make Me Cry.\\"All in all, a beautiful album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A better world?","review":"I read this because a young member of my book group is interested in such topics (para-normal, alternative history, etc.) Can't say I was impressed.

Even worse than Phil's performance though is the production. It makes me think they threw this thing together in a week just so they would have something to support on their reunion tour. None of the re-recorded old tracks are improvements, with the possible exception \\"Ballad of Jayne\\".

L.A. Guns Greatest hits is re-recorded versions of prior hits, as well as a few forgettable b-side outtakes. Although tracks like No Mercy and Sex Action retain that live feel to them, the disc is completely undermined by a lackluster effort from singer Philip Lewis.

The remakes of classics such as Sex Action and One More Reason are beyond terrible. Phil Lewis should go find another profession, as singing is obviously no longer enjoyable to him. Never have I heard such boring, lack-luster vocals. Whoever assisted in the Intra-Venus mix of Sex Action clearly has no feel for a dance beat, and has created a cacophony that is frankly ear-splitting and the person should never be allowed near a drum machine again.

The night vision feature allows you to make out shapes from very close range, but not much else. Even on the \\"decent\\" camera, the color is poor. Prior to this purchase, I was looking at some demo systems at Sam's club, and the image quality with these cameras is much, much worse than even the entry-level, bargain cameras that were being demonstrated.

They are reusable, you can edit out commercials or anything else, then copy the disc information onto a regular DVD-R. Then you can erase the DVD RAM and start again. They are great for recording shows that you want to keep forever, or just to record and watch shows that you like (if you don't have a Cable DVR). The discs cannot be finalized, so they only play on a recorder or player that has the DVD RAM insignia. They will not play anywhere else. I have Panasonic DVD Recorders, and a portable Panasonic Player, so I can record shows, and watch them on the portable player, whenever I am traveling. It is a shame that Panasonic stopped making DVD-Recorders with a built in hard-drive, because it did the same thing as the DVD RAM discs, but you could record many hours of video on the hard drive.

The hard part is the mastering of the speed of many of these songs, which takes several years of serious practice and study.

At the same time, you can use them to develop skills in speed and grace by repeated practice.I strongly suggest getting the issue of this book that has the CD of the songs, played by Ben Bolt, included. It will help you realize how you should sound playing them after several years of practice.

It performs very well, the toast is pretty evenly browned, and once it is warmed up it toasts at an adequate pace. Each side, which toasts a pair of slices, has an alarm that sounds when the toast is done, and we find this is a very useful feature. It allows us to be working on other things while we are waiting for toast. The only fault we have found thus far has been the plastic handles on the levers to raise and lower the toast. Both have broken and have fallen off. This does not affect the operation of the toaster, but does make the toaster look cheap and damaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I Was A Slice Of Bread...","review":"...I'd want to end my days inside this toaster!

Toaster is a manageable size on the counter, but if you like to put your toaster away, it is a bit on the heavy side. Love the fact that the toast stays warm within the unit & love the ringer telling me when toasting is complete since I'm usually elsewhere in the house.

Their tracks are bareable here, but I became physically ill when I heard some of these other tracks. No, I am not out of touch with modern rock. I am 22 and was raised on Greenday and Rancid.

In one embarassing scene, two of the kids (boy and girl) started dancing together after Galileo Smith said that Pluto and Charon were in a dance. Nothing was said about gravity or mass or any other useful physics concept, they just started doing a pop dance and it went on and on with no further explanation. Seriously, this is one dumb video.

The chapter on technique and equipment is only very brief and superficial, Friel merely points out that you should get some swimming lessons to learn to swim faster, and maybe buy fancier equipment to cycle faster. The psychological side is also quite thin, and there just isn\`t anykind of personal touch in the book. I really don\`t feel like opening it again.

He loves this one too, but we had to take it away because he chewed it up a bit (normal for all the toys) and inside was a long flat plastic insert along the base of the toy. I haven't seen this in any of the other kyjen toys. I assume it's there to hold the shape of the bird house. I know many of the toys have plastic squeekers that the dog shouldn't be chewing on, but this plastic seems worse to me and feels completely unsafe... It's very hard but can be chewed apart (like rawhide) leaving your dog with hard chunks of plastic stuck in his throat.

It lasted well through the year. We got him hide-a-bird this Christmas as we were sure he'd love it. He did, but within munutes he had fuzz from the bird's bodies in his mouth. The squirrels seem more stirdy and, except for the tails, the fibers are much shorter and not easy to pull on, so they are much safer. It was very frustrating to have to take our boy's toy away from him... he is still looking for it but I have to think about his safety. Even with us supervising the play time, as the manufacturer suggests on the box, I can't do anything to stop him from ingesting all the brightly covered fabric (i'm sure colored with unsafe chemicals).

But after having it for not even a month, she got to the inside and began tearing out the bottom (cardboard I think) and I saw her eating little pieces. I had to throw it away. I can usually sew up things she chews a hole in, but I couldn't fix this one. So, if your dog is a big chewer, this won't last too long and almost $15 is way too much to pay for a short-term toy.

I have to say it is very good for my living room. It fires down onto a hardwood floor, so it has a nice spread throughout the living room. I believe it is more powerful than the satellite speakers it came with, so I have to turn down the bass and up the treble to get the sound effect I want.I might just get a pair of RM8's for front highs, to add to the 5 RM7's.Only negative is that it hums when everything else is off. But if anything else is on, you will not notice the hum, so not really that big a deal and not enough to take a whole star away (I'd say really 4-1/2 stars, round up to 5).It hides well and looks good if you want anyone to see it.

Unfortunately after about two weeks in the middle of a song it started to whistle and hum and then it just droned like a broken fog horn. I shut the whole system down, let it rest, turned the system back on and, nothing. Again, returning it could not have been simpler; the UPS driver affixed a pre-printed label to the box and picked it up from my house.

He is also a outstanding teacher as well as a pianist. This CD shows a brilliant piano technique of old Russian Piano School, which Professor Merzhanov represents. Even if it is an old mono recording, we can hear all colors of pianist's possibilities.

Furbank was apparently the perfect biographer for E.M.F. - he handles his life with an appropriate balance of inquisitiveness and discretion just as the writer lived his life. This attitude maybe now seem close to timidity which it is not, it is us who have been spoiled by the last quarter of a century.This book is a perfect addition to any E.M.F.'s scholar and fan library but it may be a perfect introduction for someone for whom the name does not ring a bell yet. This is simply a great biography of a great men of letters - and the two greats add to make a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for dogs in their \\"teenager\\" years","review":"Our 10 month old Labradoodle had other toys and was a good dog. Then he started shredding a few things and not minding after we'd been at work all day. Our vet suggested puzzle style toys to see if he was bored and needed a mental challenge. We bought a few but this one is BY FAR his favorite. He loves his Bee's. There are a few tiny holes but he plays with this non stop. After 3 weeks this is still his go to toy. Resist the urge to help your pup early on. It may take him a few days to get the bee's out but your pet will get it. All in all this is a well made toy that made a big difference in our high energy dogs behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dog loves this toy","review":"I was a little skeptical about purchasing this toy but a patron at one of our favorite pet stores raved about it. I left the store without purchasing one, but a few days later, I ended up purchasing one on Amazon.com.For $10, this is a great buy. The Hide-A-Bee is a plush, hollow toy, in which you can stuff 3 plush bees. The bees seem to be pretty durable (i.e. can withstand sharp puppy teeth!), are pretty cute, and even better, they squeak. My dog loves squeaky toys. In addition to the bees, there's a little bit more room for other goodies, so you can stuff in some edible treats for your dog's enjoyment. Anything that has yummy treats will capture my dog's attention, as she is very food-motivated.It took her a few minutes to get the hang of the toy, but once she did, she really enjoyed it I highly recommend this toy - it's rare for me to find a toy that can occupy a good 30 minutes of my dog's attention, but this toy did."},{"rating":"1","title":"2-stars only because my dog loved it","review":"I have a dachshund mix and when I first bought this it loved this.

Hours of entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My dog LOVES this toy!!!","review":"This is the best toy!! My dog loves it. The bees are very squeaky, which she loves. I put them in the bee hive and give them a squeak, then my dog goes crazy and plays! It keeps her busy. When she gets the bees out, she will play with them, and she will also run around with the empty hive in her mouth. This is a great toy. I have a beagle (medium size dog) and this toy is a perfect size for her. The bees and the hive are durable too. I would definitely recommend this toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for smart dogs","review":"We bought these for Santa for our dogs this Christmas. We have one particular dog who always invents his own games (read: drives us crazy) by hiding things under the couch, under the computer desk, etc. He has not done that since he's had the Kygen Hide-A-Bee toy. The thing of it is, if you have smarter dogs they will pick up on it right away. One of our other dogs who doesn't much play with toys, immediately got how fun it was to come up to it and \\"steal\\" the bees out of it. PS they also like playing with the bees by themselves.I definitely recommend these toys to keep your dogs curious mind active, and occupied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting toy","review":"I bought this thinking, yeah right- my dog will not get this concept.

I have a Pit Bull so she destroy's everything, ripping out the stuffing. So far the bees are still buzzing, when I come home from work it is the first thing she grabs, she loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Concept","review":"This has been a great toy to tap into Selby's \\"prey drive.\\" He loves sticking his whole face in the hive and rooting around for treats. Unfortunately he's not as into pulling the bees out as other reviewers have mentioned. He usually tries to bypass them while going for whatever I've hidden inside - a ball, or a treat. One other disappointment caused me to rate only a 4. While the toy is overall very well constructed, one of the seams on the bees is already splitting, and will eventually need to be repaired to keep the stuffing from coming out. Selby isn't into destroying toys, so for a dog who does like to tear things apart, this may not be a good choice. He does like to chew on the \\"hair\\" on top of the bee's head, and so far hasn't been able to tear it out - impressive. The hive itself is very well constructed - I don't think it will ever wear out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Six bees torn apart within four hours!","review":"We purchased the hive and three bee toys six months ago for our two miniature poodles. They love the toy and the bees lasted almost six months before I reordered two sets (of three each) of replacement bees. The first set of replacement bees lasted less than four hours. Our two poodles managed to rip each of the bees apart, removed the stuffing, and began munching on the plastic squeakers. The second set of replacement bees didn't last any longer. I would be very cautious about providing these bees to any dog unless the retailer can assure that ours was a bad lot or that they have replaced their supplier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely flimsy","review":"My dogs (20 and 40 lbs) loved this toy right when it first came out of the box. However, by the end of the night, the bees were coming apart at the seams. This happened even though I did not allow them to tug at them or sit and try to de-stuff them. By the end of the week, the hive was also coming apart in multiple places. Again, I even took this toy away when I wasn't around to watch them. Of course, all toys, plush or rubber, eventually get destroyed. Sadly, this one didn't last more than a few days."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dog toy","review":"my dog loves it, keeps taking the bees out of the hive then you place them back in.

We got the hide-a-squirrel first, and she loved that, but the large hole on the top made it way too easy. This only has the three smaller holes that the squeekers go into, which makes it more difficult for her. She eventually destroyed all but one of the squirrels(which she seems to have decided is her friend/baby) so I bought two of the beehives. She loves them and since the bees have more parts that are not associated with the stuffing(wings) they seem to last longer than the squirrels.

I purchased two of them and within a couple of hours they had them shredded and had stuffing/squeakers all over the house. Both Rosie and Tinkerbell can be rough with toys but this is the first time I've ever witnessed them chewing a toy apart so quickly. After I cleaned up the mess Tinkebell found one of the squeakers she had hidden somewhere in the house and almost choked to death. I had to wedge my fingers in her mouth and perform a doggie heimlich to get it out....very scarey but thankfully she's okay now.I would NOT recommend this toy if you have strong chewers in your home and it was a big waste of money. I'll stick with the large rubber kongs for them from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pit Fail","review":"My pit bull was having a blast with this toy, but as soon as I left the room for a minute I came back to bits of fabric and stuffing all over.

He had the squirrels in a stump toy by the same maker and it had proven itself to be a favorite toy and also well made. However, all good things must come to an end, and the dog managed to tear open the stump and remove the stuffing until it was nothing but bark. (ha ha, bark, dog...) Anyway, all the squirrels were still intact. I should mention the opposite was the case for my friend's dog. He managed to massacre the little things right away. Well, on to the bumble bees...he loved it...and I thought they were so cute. As with the squirrel toy, my dog likes the hive more than the bees. He takes them out, and hen walks around with the hive on his snout wanting to play tug. All in all, I'd recommend this line of toys--the right mix of softness and durability. A great value when I think of all the expensive toys that have fallen apart after a day or two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"10lb dog ripped it up in a week.","review":"The idea of this toy is great. Our 10lb Cavachon (Bichon/King Cavalier Spaniel) loved playing with it and getting the little bees out. Unfortunately in less than a 1/2 hr of opening the package one of the bees was ripped open. The next day the 2nd bee was torn apart and finally, within a week the 3rd bee had a wing ripped off of it. Our dog isn't even that rough with toys!

My dog is a relatively small dog (under 30 pounds) and my daughter's is a beagle. In both cases, this cheaply made toy was ripped to shreds in under 10 minutes. The bees (or squirrels ) were unable to stand up to even the minimal tugging and chewing that this toy is (one would assume) designed to inspire. Pieces came off and the stuffing was all over the floor and I was throwing this piece of junk away as quickly as I could clean up the mess. DO NOT BUY this.

While her dog appeared to have enjoyed the toy she didn't use it the same way my dog did. My dog more of like to play fetch with it, and would dig the bees out of the hive. My sister's dog liked to rip the bees apart until she found the squeaker... and killed the squeaker.It IS a really cute toy. It IS well made, and it IS a good toy for toys who like to play fetch. I would not recommend it for dogs that like to rip apart toys. There is a lot of stuffing to clean up... and the squeaker.My dog on the other hand like to carry the bees with her where ever she went.

So for a check on bag, i dont think its worth the small size."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap and small","review":"This was too small for our needs but we probably would have kept it if it hadn't been junk. The retractable handle would not lock into place so it kept going in and out while you tried to wheel it. The wheels were cheap and didn't turn well either. If they made it better it would be a good little bag. Too bad. Going to buy a real brand name bag now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for our cruise!","review":"I'm an airline pilot so I have expensive and very durable suitcases, but I didn't have a garment bag and needed one for an upcoming cruise to pack my dresses in.

My bag broke 3 weeks after I purchammsed. Buy a better product, save your money.Many others to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT carry-on friendly...","review":"I ordered this hoping for a bag on the smaller side. It's not small, it's quite large. The dimensions are not compatible with most airline carry-on requirements. It also seemed a bit heavy to me. I did return this item for the reasons I mentioned, and found a smaller, lighter bag - though not a garment bag. Another thing about this bag: the clothes will hang upside down (i.e. the top of the garment/hanger will be in the bottom of the bag, so your things might slide down). I was planning to take a skirt suit in this bag, and honestly, my clothes are tiny, and most likely would have slipped down to the bottom in a wrinkled heap. Not a great look for an interview!Check the dimensions of the luggage you intend to order very carefully...Not the greatest item I've ever seen. A disappointment overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Amsterdam Rolling Garment Bag","review":"This is an excellent product.

It was a good price at $47, but I'm going to return it and invest my money in something of better quality. That little piece was the whole reason for buying a garment bag for suits, and without it, the luggage is useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rolling Garment Bag","review":"I was disappointed when I first saw it, craftmanship was lacking and I questioned weather or not it would stand up to the airlines abuse. The hanging mechanism is very cheap and we had to tie it to keep it closed while traveling.The good news about it is: when we arrived at our destination the clothes were not wrinkled at all. So for that reason I would give it a 5 stars but quality of product no."},{"rating":"2","title":"ON CUKOR GREAT, BY GEORGE!","review":"In a career that spanned four decades, George Cukor directed such influential and immortal films as Dinner At Eight, Camille, The Philadelphia Story, Gaslight, Adam's Rib, Born Yesterday, The Women, A Star is Born (the Garland-Mason version) and My Fair Lady. This revealing documentary, narrated by Jean Simmons, relies on actual Cukor interviews---as well as interviews with his pals and peers, including Claire Bloom, Angela Lansbury, Jack Lennon, Shelley Winters, Mia Farrow and Peter Bogdanovich---and dozens of film clips to present a well-rounded, quite wonderful, portrait at the man who reinvented Hollywood.

Their problem is that they only copy bands like Helloween, Gamma Ray, IRon Maiden and ohter \\"Melodic metal\\" bands. SInger Andre Matos has the same problems he had in his other Brazilian band, called VIPER: he has incredible vocal reach, but uses it in a boring manner, so in the middle of the album you're already wanting to kill the singer! Anyway, this is the best CD by Angra. But an indication of the band's limitations is the fact that the best song of the album is a cover version of Kate Bush's \\"Wutering Heights\\" (it got amazing!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money","review":"I think this must be the worst band in the planet. Yes ,Japan really loves them, but let's face it: Japan likes anything that is told them to like. Andre's voice is very, very weak and has no personality at all. The music is pure cliché.

The quick release allows for easy removal when needed. It's easily adjustable for both phones and holds them firmly. But I'm taking off a star because it can't be operated in landscape mode. I had emailed Arkon support asking them about landscape support and they told me that it supported landscape operation. Well, they're technically correct in that you can pivot the mount to a landscape orientation but since it's not load bearing so the display droops immediately, becoming unusable.So if you just need a good AC vent mount that operates only in portrait mode, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I was scammed on this one, it was cheap so I bought a used one that said still in box. Someone did a wrap job on it. It didn't work so I called Vonage and they tracked the serial number back to the original owner that wss a small business and used it a lot and had numerous trouble calls on it. Vonage sent me the new model for free and everything works again. My advice, don't buy any electronic products you suspect have been used, there is a reason someone is selling them. This little scam cost me a lot of time and effort and lost us a lot of calls."},{"rating":"1","title":"New or used","review":"Purchased this new product to replace original Vonage device.

I bought the DVD but ran into all sorts of problems when I tried to copy it to my home's media center. Apparently Comedy Central thought it would be a good idea to cripple the disc with some sort of copy protection that ends up making it unplayable on many systems (including software DVD players such as VLC). But worse, it makes it very difficult to transfer it to your computer or media center (even though you have the legal right to do so). Their copy protection makes it difficult for us consumers to use the product if they buy the DVD legally, but this show is easy to find on torrent sites because the pirates apparently had no problem circumventing the protection. So ironically that's the best place to find a usable version of this media, not by buying the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WEAK","review":"I bought this to complete my collection, I could have done without this one.

THe first one is really neat, you can see Madonna as Dita with her really hot leather Mask but you never see her naked. It's a very good work realized by the Great Fabien Baron. The X-Rated vsion is a bit nastier. There you can see Madonna naked. In fact, this video contains footages of the Making of the Sex Book. It's a vey rare video because it's been released only once on a french TV channel. The Making of Sex Book, is really X-Rated that's true, but it contains very nice footages, you can see Madonna naked on the sidewalk hitch-hiking, you can see her running naked on Miami roads.As it's a rare video, it's got an important artistic value. The montage of this video is really perfect as much in the R than in the X-Rated versin. If you're crazy about Madonna or if you just like video clips, or like madonna, yo must have a copy of this video.

Like, this game is lame, man!","review":"Being a fan of Scooby-Doo since birth, I must say that Mystery Mayhem is probably the worst game based on SD, and in general, one of the WORST games I've ever played in my life! The graphics are horrible even for a PlayStation 2 game released in 2004, Scooby & Shaggy get easily scared, and you have to start the ENTIRE level back from where you left off, especially when you've gotten most of the ghosts or have almost finished off the boss in the level. You can only jump onto locations that are marked, which sucks. In Night of One Hundred Frights, you can jump anywhere you want to. The controls are weak, you have to keep pressing the same buttons over and over and over again, Shaggy is just worthless, and Scooby seems to be the only useful character, because he can crawl through hard to reach places. Why do we even need Shaggy?! Again, he's just completely worthless! Honestly, I liked Night of 100 frights and Cyber chase a lot better. 2/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Pleased","review":"I purchased this game for my 6 year old grandson.He is a huge Scooby-Doo fan.He loves this game.I would recommend this game to any Scooby-Doo fan out there.We are really pleased with this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad","review":"Night of 100 Frights was really cool -- my 5 year old and I (over 40) had the best time playing over and over and over.

Trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice New Spin on things","review":"I love the penciling in this comic since I'm a big fan of the artist's work. The idea that Leia, as the more mature and levelheaded of the twins, would achieve much more and walk a steadier path to becoming a jedi is quite plausible. Of all the \\"Infinities\\" books, I rank the \\"Empire\\" as my favorite and would recommend it as a good read to all the fans of the original trilogy. However, I would sincerely discourage all who consider purchasing the other two books as they do not satisfy the average reader on ANY level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad art & cliches hamper this what if","review":"This tale of What If? in the Star Wars universe is pretty cliched and the art is so basic and cartoony that the overall story is really setback.

Their latest single is definitely no acception to that rule. Dani California, the first single from the chilis' latest record Stadium Arcadium is a great song that is just driven, upbeat, and worth every bit of what the group has brought as their best within the past several years of following the success of tracks like Californication, Can't Stop, and By The Way. I absolutely like this song a lot, because it is just great to listen to.

The 1913 edition uses a set of names known as \\"American Code\\" that botanists haven't used since the 1950's; the services of a professional taxonomist is practically required to update the changes, and few people will know what you're talking about if you use an \\"American Code\\" name for a plant.

One such series was Columbo, which definitely was unique in concept and went beyond very well done to excellent.

I think it's supposed to be a horror, but the story's so old and the plot in this movie is so predictible it's not scary. I don't think it was supposed to be a comedy, but I found humor in how fake it looked when Blacula transformed into a bat. I have to admit, they could have made a great whack-ass comedy type parody out of this, but they tried to take it seriously and got...this.

I stopped reading after chapter five. Also he kept plugging his earlier book Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You to Know About. Many times he wrote the following: \\"If you have not read this book [his first book] I strongly suggest that you read it cover to cover.\\"If he could take his anti-pharmaceutical message and cut out the self-promotion and constant repetition, then it might have been a decent read. As it is, I have to give it 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mostly Nonsensical Book","review":"I picked this up at a thrift store for ten cents--by page 58 or so, I knew my money was wasted.

You can block multiple windows of times during the day and select the day(s) you want. It's sooooo simple. You set up how much time a day OR a week each user is allowed to watch TV (or what ever you plug into it). If you want to add time onto a user for that day, 3-5 button strokes later it is done, easy! There is no more fighting about them watching too much TV OR what to watch since that time is THEIR time. They do more constructive things like reading books, playing outside, or Yuh-gi-oh cards. I love it! I had my reservations at first because I was worried it would be too difficult for my husband to use, since he's not very technologically advanced.

A great product from a great company. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob helps regain our family!","review":"Since installing Bob on our TV, my kids have learned to respecttheir allotted TV/video time.

He made Bob look like it was working, but he was taking the plug out of the back whenever he wanted to.My kid has no great talent when it comes to taking things apart.

I threw the thing away."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is nice not to have to be the TV Cop...","review":"We have used EyeTimer in the past, but it wouldn't work with our new DLP Projection TV. I really like the flexibility of the Eyetimer to be able to specify one time bank for all devices in the house, and different time allowances for different days of the week... but this does the job of keeping the kids off the TV/Video games efficiently enough. We just don't give them any default time, and they have us add it whenever they have done the appropriate activity or chores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Problem Solver","review":"We ordered Bob to help control TV watching time for our son. What a great product! Now we are not the bad guys yelling to turn off the TV. Bob is very easy to use, and we had it up and running in about 5 minutes. Programming is very intuitive and the directions for use are pretty clear. (You do have to log out of the device to turn it off, not just turn off the TV.) The device blends in with the other electronics on our entertainment center, so there's no embarrassment factor when his friends come over. It has done a great job of limiting time and is flexible--it is easy to add extra time when watching a favorite film and to change programming. I love Bob!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob is worth is weight in gold","review":"Bob was a great investment for our family. I no longer have to hide remotes or argue over TV time. Once the time runs out, it is gone. The blocks are also a great feature. If he wants to watch TV, he trys the code. If it doesn't work, he moves on to something else. If you have trouble getting your child out the door in the morning, you can setup a block to turn the TV off at whatever time you choose.He figured out pretty quickly that he needs to conserve his time and choose wisely. The setup was a breeze. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is starting to battle their child over the television."},{"rating":"1","title":"TV Bob keeps shutting off!","review":"My husband purchased this device about 3 years ago to reduce the amount of time my daughter watched tv while we were at work. She's not sneaky like the other teenagers I read in other reviews and as far as I can tell she never spent time trying to trick the machine. The problem we have is when we're trying to watch a movie (like right now!) or play a video game and the damn machine keeps beeping and shutting off. I have had to get up 5 times in the last 10 minutes to reenter MY code so that TV Bob doesn't shut off the tv. My husband said that he thinks that the new, lower energy tv that we bought doesn't draw enough power and TV Bob thinks that it needs to shut down.

However, I found the instructions to be a bit lacking, especially the information about how to use it on a device with a hard drive (in particular, an X-Box).

Also ignore the the description, any divice with a hard drive will be damaged by a sudden lose of power. Modern game consoles and computers will be damaged if not shut off properly. This broke my sons Xbox 360 and when I tried to contact the manufacturers about they did not return my calls or emails.

Armed with a penetrating eye for framing, and a willingnessto really watch what's happening on the actors' faces between the linesin almost a Bergmanesque way, there is a real intimacy in the film, aswell as a haunting sense of loss.

A fine job of portraying Dietrich from many angles, fleshing her out (though the author is irritatingly fond of the word \\"plump\\")... Spoto seems to approach his subject with celestial reverence, as though trying to conceal his own crush behind historical voyeurism (the discussion of debauched 1920s Berlin is particularly gratifying). Sometimes he speculates too much on possible motivations instead of simply offering facts, but he also makes good use of others' reminiscences of Dietrich to back up some of his insightful conjectures.

Some of the punk tracks are Lucky as Mars, Abeyance and Dakota. The radio single Sweet Steps ties with Turnabout for best song on the cd (both have really catchy choruses.)

Furthermore, the description is brief, superficial and not very informative. The author sacrifices detailed description for the sheer size and geographical coverage of the book. I would not recommend this book to anyone interested in a particular region or some the more charming inns. Obviously, one author cannot cover the whole country and have thorough knowledge of the inns in a particular region. The book is superficial, lacks detail even though it covers the whole country.

Watched disc #1 of 3 and will be bringing it back to the store today. The audio is dull, lifeless, bass heavy and not in sync with the video. Also, the player rejected the disc at Episode 6. Tried various sound fields and none worked well. Even tried to sync the audio with the video and neither the player (Denon A1UDCI), nor the receiver (Denon AVR-4810CI) could accomplish the task. Tried it on our other audio video system using a Denon 5910CI player and the audio was just as bad.Fair warning--buy this disc and it might have to be returned, but the video part is fun to watch. Too bad about the rest....."},{"rating":"1","title":"PreOrder Big Bang Theory","review":"The fouth season of the Big Bang Theory video quality is not good at all. I am very disappointed in it.

The picture is blurry and you cant see the great reactions on the characters faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG BANG 4","review":"I think that Big Bang is one of the funniest shows on TV. The only problem I have with it is that sometimes the sexual inuendo is way to strong. On the plus side it is one of the few shows that started out hilariously in the very first episode and has kept it at the same hilarious level all the way through season 4. To many shows seem to run out of steam after the first or second season and then they just get stupid, even though they run on and on and on. Great job writers and cast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is unable to be viewed on our DVD player","review":"I purchased seasons 1 through 5....there was only one vendor at the time with season 4.

Penny was doing a great job, so why has her role been so drastically cut in Season 4? Mr. Lorre ('Mister' as a sign of respect because I am a huge fan), look at your Mike and Molly: It has many characters, but they all seem to blend better that BBT....Toooooo many girlfriends? In fact, Amy is getting too much of a chunk of the show. Loved seasons 1-2-3..... now the thrill is gone. I won't be purchasing Season 4.... not funny enough to re-watch. Hope to see an improved Season 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"still developing","review":"all the characters are evolving in different directions to keep the dynamics interesting. After a dull introduction of the character, Amy too has evolved rather slowly to establish her raison d'etre in the show. The relationship of Sheldon and Amy has developed thanks to Amy's evolution, not Sheldon's. If anything, Sheldon is more pigeon-holed into his miniscule peculiarity, making his character less-lovable and predictable. I so wish to see Beverly, Leonard's mother, again. She has been my favorite character. Raj has some room to expand. Perhaps we will see it happen in season 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Priya Has To Go.

She's a great actress but there just is not any chemistry there, scenes with her are just too serious. Penny worked. Her character worked. She brought a balance to their nerdiness.Also, I enjoy Amy in the show, I think she brings a nice touch and I keep waiting for them to hook her and Sheldon up on a real date... as is my family and circle of friends.Also, I miss the quirkiness of the first season.

I got tired of the author waxing prolific about how wonderful and hardworking her husband was (\\"OK... fine. I get it already. He was wonderful, a saint, blah blah blah\\" I thought to myself many times). The author also repeated herself several times throughout the book and I think parts of it could have been edited better to avoid this.At this point I have no desire to read more books about fistual patients and fistula hospitals.

This, the main theme of the book, comes across very well.The book contains a number of errors regarding Thai language, culture, history and geogrpahy, and some things are just pure conjecture bred with rumour.

The game is now unplayable.The horizontal stand may look cheezy but it does a good job of keeping the PS2 on its shelf.

If you don't feel like paying for a stand because you put it on a sturdy table or the floor and don't mind it looking rather dull, then don't purchase any kind of stand.

They are also still doing so with élan, spirit de corps and good old fashioned jarhead toughness.The aliens are quite different than your normal science fiction fare. They are amphibians and instead of using fancy ray guns, they use acid.

I really don't know how in flames fans praise this album, it really has nothing compared to the other albums. Don't get me wrong, it's still decent, but not great. The real moment of brilliance on this CD is on song 5 (zombie, inc) from about 2:10 in to 3:18. That's some good stuff! but the rest is so-so.

Production is very clear, and the songs are varied and distinct. Fun to listen to, and very high-energy. It may not satisfy death metal purists (not evil-sounding) but forget categories, this is good stuff . I imagine it could be popular if the band got more exposure.

To put it short, it's a book about the making of the epistemic (in the sense given by Foucault) of Athenian democracy.It's not about the class(slave-owning) foundations of Greek democracy, but how it was made to work by Athenian free citzens. A very speculative, immaginative analysis that ponders, above all, on the viability of a radical democracy.

The subplots are good and one in particular (I won't spoil things) is very well developed and creates its own suspense.Josie Bates is one of the most likeable characters I have read and the author makes you sympathetic to her predicaments.As a lawyer, I can say that the court scenes are vivid and realistic, which isn't always the case in this genre.

First, the subplot is much more interesting than the main plot. Further, the main character, Patricia Conley, is the least interesting and most unsympathetic (and pathetic) character in the story. In fact, this character is annoying. Throughout the book, she refers to her fiancee by both his first and last name. Who does that? In addition, the character makes sweeping statements that are unfounded and untrue. For example, Patricia Conley analogizes what she states to be black folks' universal disavowal of slavery with the guilt felt by rape victims! Ugh! Needless to say, the book was painful to read; but I stuck with it, only to be further disappointed with the book's final plot twist.

I would only suggest this book to an insomniac; maybe it would help them get some sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book was not what I expected. The heroine seemed very contrived. This book left a lot to be desired.While the story was interesting, the characters were not. The main character hardly appeared capable of functioning in the real (or unreal) world. I found it unbeleivable that she could solve a mystery much less figure that something was wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"i did not like this book","review":"Having spent my money on this book I forced myself to complete reading it. The heroine is an unlikeable person. The author fails to show why such a damaged woman could attract two such great men. The pace is too slow. The white characters are charicatures. The plot is a mess and the message is delivered in a heavy handed fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SPINE-TINGLING THRILLER","review":"What a unique story line! You start off with a sister being jilted at the altar when suddenly you are immersed into such a thrilling story line that you can't wait to turn the pages. The story line takes you through an array of subjects including love, African folklore, scientific discoveries, and greed...catapulting the main character, Patricia Conley, through a spine-tingling thriller. You will find yourself on an emotional rollercoaster as the story unfolds. Once you think you have reached the climax and the villain has been apprehended, you are plummeted back into the plot until the mystery is solved. This book is truly a winner. I give it two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational thriller.","review":"What a woman's gotta do, proved to be a thought provoking educational thriller. Eliminate one part and there is still plenty of action. A very enjoyable book and it is a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Unrealistic","review":"I am a mystery fan, and this book did have a lot of surprises, but the author has a very vivid imagination. I know this is fiction, but everything about Patricia speaking to the grandfather was too \\"out there\\" for me. She mixed reality with fiction so much that I didn't know what was real - like is there really a Dogon tribe with the beliefs she talked about?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did This Book Get Published?","review":"Eve Coleman had this Woman going in too many directions. So much until you start to think that everything is taking place in year 3500, on some unknown planet. Outrageous! Two stars for the sistah's vivid imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Engaging, but Lacking","review":"While this book kept my attention, and was engaging, I was surprised by the lack of consistency in one respect and very disappointed overall. The lack of consistency surfaced often in Ira Bernstein. For example, on page 316, Ira could not decide on whether it was the white race, or the vhite race. Whether it was William, or Villiam. I was disappointed because of the extent to which vulgarity was used. I look forward to the day when black authors,especially female black authors, will choose to refrain from using vulgarity and rely on their true God-given abilities to 'tell' a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Woman's Gotta Do is definitely a novel of suspense.","review":"I really enjoyed reading about a smart, strong, loced, African-American heroine who was able to stop a horrible conspiracy from taking place. From beginning to end What A Woman's Gotta Do kept me so involved in the story that I was reluctant to close the book to go to work. I am very much a fan of mystery novels and this is definitely one of the best. I hope to meet Patricia Conley, the heroine, again in a future novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Wait","review":"This complicated, well thought out mystery started out with a bang, but as soon as the main character started her long, dangerous journey to find out what happened to her boyfriend, it was downhill all the way. Though I admire Ms. Coleman's sense of humor and the knowledge she displays on the subjects she introduced, I found there to be too many twists and turns in the plot, thereby taking away from the enjoyment. Most of the book I found to be just plain BORING. The subject matter was one of interest, it just took much too long to get to the climax. The old adage \\"I Love a Mystery\\" just didn't apply here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Woman's Gottta Do","review":"It is not often that I can not complete a book. This was one of those rare times. The main character is not likeable. Her actions are totaly unrealistic. There are just too many elememts for any one to be fully developed. It is clear that the writer had not removered herself from the children's novel mindset when she wrote this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book!","review":"Contrary to the negative reviews I could not put this book down. I loved the suspense and how you had to wait until the last minute to find out the true villians in this story. I also loved Patricia Conley's strength. She was a very strong willed person who set an example for all women to aspire to. Lastly the lesson of culture and another view of a higher being and spirituality was truly refreshing. I applaud Ms. Coleman for delving into history and expanding our minds to encompass another way of view mankind. I look forward to her next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.... LOVED IT","review":"I loved this book. I totally disagree with the reviews that say this book is boring and unrealistic, etc. etc. This book is action and mystery and plot after plot and twist and turns that kept me going. It compelled me to reseach the Dogon and consider going back into martial arts. You have to be open minded and you really have to detach yourself from what we call reality and see the story for what it is worth. While on the surface it may seem unreal - you never know what is truly going on in the world, underground, or in places that you may not think of - THAT is what this book brings to the forefront.. THE VERY thing you least expect. AND even if you do not believe it could happen - this book is well worth the journey it takes you on. Excellent Author... she really did her homework on this one... more more more... ENCORE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"I read Whats A Woman's Gotta Do and I had wonderful time!

Having read some preliminary glowing reviews on Ms. Coleman's first venture into adult mystery writing, I could hardly wait to start reading my copy of this great book. And the early reviews are not an overstatement. This was definitely one of those books that you did not want to put down - and just when you think you know how it is going to end you find out how wrong you are. Ms. Coleman does an outstanding job of blending African lore with modern day events and the storyline - and bless her for listing sources of more information on the literature she wets your appetite and mind to what to know more about. And the source of the book title is great - I have enjoyed quoting it to my girlfriends. Thank you, Ms. Coleman and I look forward to more great reads from you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine 7th, buy it for Lemminkäinen","review":"First a word about Saraste and Sibelius on other labels. The box set of the 1-7 is out of print, but worth looking up used.Saraste recorded those for Finlandia records and the individual tracks made it to other labels. The 7th is sold with the 3rd and 6th.This disc with the 7th is form his RCA recordings in Helsinki in 1989. Similar to Berglund recordings of that period. The recording is fine.But if you are a Saraste fan, you want to get this Lemminkäinen suite. There is no other recording. The suite runs some 50 minutes, the symphony about 20.Several other conductors have the Lemminkäinen suite. This is quite good. And the Swan of Tuonela is 2nd where it should be.

Since I viewed some pictures in PBS website of Hubble's photos I was excited at what I thought would be of the same fine quality. Boy was I wrong.

Unless you have a high resolution wide screen big television, it will NOT work very well on either a computer screen, or TV screen. I was disappointed. I contaced the company, and they said that the quality and resolution was \\"as best as it could be\\", and is best viewed on a big screen TV, which I do not have.

Strangly, it was much cheaper than what shows here. Now that I am done with the project, I was very happy with the kit. I used it for intense sheathing & framing. The compressor is more powerful and more quite than the porter-cable pancake one I also have, the nailer is awsome and well built. As I went up to 3.25\\" nails the nailer had trouble pushing them all the way when the head was not firmly against the piece, but shorter nails were no issue.It's a good kit, especialy for the price ($350).1 year Update: Do not buy this unit. First, the pressure regulator broke. I took it out and went around it, and then I started having electrical problems - the unit would not kick in and re-fill unless I played with the switch.

Don't expect classical fireworks, just simple relaxing melodies played beautifully with great sensitivity. The more modern items are, to me at any rate, not so pleasing as Florante's interpretation of the older melodies and traditional music, very little of which is known outside of the Philippines. With his consumate musicianship and most attractive demeanour Florante makes a fine ambassador for the music of his homeland, and deserves to be known much better outside the Philippines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased","review":"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a toner cartridge since I didn't print that often.

Asylum Street Spankers are very talented musicians that can't easily be pigeonholed into one musical genre.

This is the type of music that is most popular at drunken parties, but it's great to listen to anytime (except in front of your grandmother, your priest, or the DEA.)

It is true that the new generation systems will be coming out soon, but there will still be games being made for the playstation 2 (the next Final Fantasy is slated for a spring '06 release on the PS2).So just do a little bit of research before listening to these other reviews, it's a great system as long as you enjoy the games that are made for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a lemon","review":"I bought the new play station 11 Dec 05, 2005 and placed it along side of my game cube that I had had since Dec 2004.I played games on both systems off and on during the year actually using the game cube more than the playstation 11.

Imagine using the machine for one year then paying 65.00 to have it fixed after only one year of off and on use. I take it that Sony expects you to use their machine at a cost of $65.00 a year.

After exchanging them, thinking the disks were bad, I was about to have the lens on the system professionally cleaned, when I though I would hop on the sony playstation website and see what customer service reccomends. I found there a list of 44 games that are not reading/working properly on the new redesigned systems- Several of which were made by Sony themselves!! On top of that, I have also experienced problems with the console not recognizing the blue-back disks. Although there are some games that work without problems, and the system is smaller, I see no benefit to purchasing this console.

You can buy an Xbox for this price. Even though the Xbox is larger, it has a more powerful processor and comes with a harddrive so you don't need to shell out even more money for memory cards such as playstations require. True playstation has a larger number of games, but xbox has many high quality games coming out in the next few months. Such as Fable, Halo 2, MechAssault 2: Lone wolf ect.Pros.1. Small size and portable2. Large game selection from PS1 and PS2 titlesCons.1. Priced as much as an Xbox (When this hits $100 dollars next year I will be first in line to buy it.)2.

Sure its graphics aren't nearly as good as Xbox, or have a hard drive like the Xbox, but it has way more games, and allot of them are really fun. Instead of optimizing the HDD, Sony has cut it out. It made the system quiter, but reduced the size of the fan-which equalls more disk errors and game freezes and it happens faster than ever. This system is completely pointless and insufficient compared to the original PS2. I love Playstation, but I cant give this system praise like all the other PS2 fans out there because it was made by Sony. Here is how it is-Xbox is a much better system, PS2 has many more fun games to play. Put the two together and it would be impressive at least. I suggest anyone looking to buy the new PStwo to spend the extra $40 and get the original, or an Xbox.

Playstation 2","review":"First of all, Playstation 2 has the best graphics I have ever seen! If you say no, you have seen Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater. Those are the best graphics. Second of all, Playstation 2 is thin so you can save lots of space by putting it next to your TV or DVD/VCR. The Xbox is this huge box that takes up a whole shelf. And it doesn't matter that you can put music on in the Xbox. Some people don't want music while they play! I will always be on the side of the Playstation 2.

I have both, and I picked up the small unit because I heard it was quieter. It is, and to the point where I would actually consider using it to watch DVDs. The old models were audible in quiet scenes to the point of annoyance. The DVD playback picture quality is better too. The unit does have it's downsides though. The flip top makes vertical usage impractical, and the power and eject buttons are more difficult to operate in the dark. Through 80 hours of playing GTA: San Andreas I didn't have any overheating or game lockup problems that are rumored but never confirmed.

Then I went to the Device Manager (it was listed as a non-working scanner under \\"Other devices\\") and said \\"reinstall driver\\" and it now works perfectly.I doubt there is a problem with the driver itself, only with the driver being properly installed under SP2.

The system requirements list Windows XP, however the driver and paperport software do not run under Windows XP Service Pack 2.

Visioneer makes no mention of this in their product information and you really have to dig through their knowledge base to find out the scanner will not work with your system, once you've already bought it and the software fails to install.

The higher speed scan was at the expense of quality and I had to bump DPI settings way up to 400 to get legible scans. As the machine aged, the scans got fainter, so I had to change to gray scale to be able to read printed docs and invoices after scanning. Then the color gave up and produced only garish reds in the scan.

There is one problem with these, BUT only if you make discs for others. If you make DVD's for your own use ON your own Panasonic DVR,as that is the only machine they will work on, and these are cheap and great. I saw these for sale, and bought a box, and they work just fine. I am glad they had these for such a reasonable price, or I would have bought a new recorder, which I have found out I don't need. Problem solved.

I had never seen sheets with 500 thread count at such a bargain price before. Even though I have a Cal King bed, the regular King size set fits pretty good (that was all they had available). The sheets felt very smooth compared to other sheets when new. After washing, they didn't have quite the same silky smoothness, but they are 100% cotton and I expect they will just get softer the more I wash them. As with most 100% cotton sheets, they can wrinkle in the dryer.

Very strong and classic styles combined harshly. With some thoughtful arranging, I think they could've smoothly blended them together.I love flamenco music--especially sung by strong women's voices, and I grew up with latin music, and it's all a nice idea, but they must've been so in love with this \\"high concept,\\" it just bashes you over the head without tempering it with a light little kiss.

I had this recording years ago in the 60's when I worked with the London Symphony and Phyllis Curtin. I loved it then and I love it more now. It is a work on level with Pelleas et Melisande. It bridges the abyss between the sacred and profane in our lives. Sonically, it is fabulous with wonderful solo voices and and atmospheric chorus, and most especially the narration of Charles Munch himself! He adds so much presence and reality to the entire performance. This work is not very well known like Pelleas or Apres-midi d'une faune, but it is totally worth our attention and recordings like this will preserve its entry into the reperetoire. Also recommended is reading THE SACRED AND THE PROFANE by Mircea Eliade, in order to enter into an intellectual understanding of the sound world that Debussy has created."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for the hardcore fans","review":"I tend to buy these string tribute albums and get disappointed, but this one is really good.

It has replaced \\"Wuthering Heights\\" as my all-time favorite book (an amazing feat as W.H had been my favorite since high school).This novel has all the passion, love, drama and betrayal of the best fiction books, yet it was based on an actual diary. I couldn't put the book down, yet I didn't want it to end. I found myself going back in time 200 years to the home of my ancestors, feeling the joy, heartache and terror they lived through.

I'm sure the story could have been handled better, but comparing this book to \\"Gone With the Wind\\" is sinful. The characters were flat, and the author just seemed to plunck down the bits and pieces of the real history, at will.If you like romance novels, this is the book for you. But calling it historical fiction is a bit of a stretch. I'm sorry I wasted several days finishing this, only to be disappointed even further when it was obvious that a sequel was in the offing. And, I won't be wasting my time on that either since the characters in this novel were boring and one dimensional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, Terrible Writing","review":"This book very much wanted to be Gone With the Wind, I think.It helped to know the story was based on the actual diary a Polish countess -- especially when reading the quoted passages from her cousin's diary, as I never would have believed them otherwise. So lurid!The story itself is very exciting and tense, but the writing simply isn't up to the story. It is a shame. i think it could have been a great historical novel/romance/thriller in the hands of the right author.

The story is about a couple who are traveling on the road and get attacked by some zombies. They are rescued and taken to a place which is deemed safe. What they soon start finding out is the \\"safe place\\" they were taken to is a cult led by a supposed religious man, Jeffrey. I don't want to give too much away so I will stop there. But, what I will say is there is over the top gore especially for super low budget they had. The acting is so-so but what else do you expect from a low budget zombie movie. Also, there is good surprising twist on how the zombies are/were created. I have seen all the other zombie movies, and although this is no Dawn of the Dead or Let Sleeping Corpses Lie, it definitely belongs in any diehard zombie collection. I highly recommend it. NOTE: The DVD comes with a comic book inside but I suggest to watch the movie first, then read the comic book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"GORY MAYHEM","review":"This movie is great.

I know the people who worked on this movie had little to no capital to make this movie, and the fact that they had some nice gore and so many people on the project is commendable.However, a coherent story and good dialogue costs nothing and that is what this movie lacks. Gory, shoestring budget B movies do not have to seem like they were written by a deranged person. Look at what George Romero did with \\"Night of the Lving Dead\\". Almost no budget, and he prodced a classic. It's films like this that give these low budget movies a bad name and made zombie movies a laughing stock.

I loved Shatter-dead and the Meat Market films, but the production values on this heap are terrible.The movie cares more about the members of a cult who spend fifteen minutes of the movie singing along to a band while the preacher 'jams out' and the rest of the movie jabbering about how it sucks not to have sex. Meanwhile, zombies are wandering outside the perimeter of their camp. Why isn't the rest of the world being eaten? Why are the dead back to life? The viewer never finds out, and I disengaged.The computer effects on this are embarrassing and unnecessary. It looks like an arcade game from the 80's.I was very let-down after watching this. It looks promising, the reviewers on the VHS are good, but I'm telling you...this movie sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"guitar","review":"I thought it would be more usable as a \\"real\\" guitar.

It's got nice sound from a perfectly balanced, 1/2 size guitar. We added a strap button to the bottom so little one can walk around and rock out. She's already learning a couple of notes, soon onto chords. I did buy better strings to put on it, though I haven't changed them yet. The metal wrapped vinyl strings did seem a little rusty in certain spots, as mentioned by other reviewers, but they play and hold a tune...sort of. I expect the tuning to stabilize on this instrument. The tuning pegs and mechanism seems pretty tight, so I'm confident that it's really just about stretchy strings breaking in. It looks great, sounds full. I'm absolutely thrilled with the price and quality of this guitar. Depending on how you treat it, It's not a toy. It's a tiny starter guitar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I originally had a different guitar picked out for my 3 year and 5 year old grandsons.

This makes the guitar less than useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice in cosmetics, bad in mechanics and sound quality","review":"At first look, I loved it. But once get on tuning and playing, I realized this is not a playable instrument. I was going to give this to my 11 yr daughter, but no way. I could not make any chord sound right. Tuning after tuning, it doesn't stay tuned for more than 10 seconds. Even playing with one string from E,F,G,H,I going up by frets ... didn't make a right note sound. Low E sting makes just dead beat sound. Badly designed and manufactured instrument... I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridge broke away from body.","review":"I chose this 1/4 size guitar for my 5 year old Grandaughter for Christmas. While patiently tuning this guitar over several hours using a chromatic tuner for proper pitch the bridge broke away from the body. I've been playing,stringing and tuning guitars for over forty years. I was quite surprised and disapointed when the bridge suddenly broke away from the body. This was on Christmas eve. Perhaps a design flaw on this particular instrument, not enough glue, bad batch of glue? She had been asking Santa for a guitar of her own and wondered why Santa forgot it. I'm currently unemployed so otherwise I would have bought a more expensive model. She's still asking for it. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter for kids","review":"Good little guitar for kids starting out. The only downside I found is there was no strap hook, when the pictures clearly show one at the base. No problem tho, I'll just add one.To those giving bad reviews for tuning problems: You clearly know very little about guitars. That is just the nature of nylon strings. They stretch a lot and require a longer break in time compared to steel stings. Keep in mind, this is a $50 starter guitar. Don't expect Martin/Seagull quality at this price point. Once your kid reaches a skill level that they notice the flaws in this price range, it will then be time to buy a nice instrument that they can respect and care for for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk!!!!!\`","review":"Ive been plaing guitar for over 20 years and against my better judgment I bought this for my child based soley on the reviews. I was stationed overseas and couldnt get to a store to test one out. When I got home for Christmas, I went to tune it the entire bridge snapped off in front of my eagerly awaiting child..... needless to say we were both disappointed. Spend the extra money and get a better guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Beginners","review":"Excellent beginners guitar for the price. I purchased this for an 18 month old family member who is obsessed with guitars. He likes to drag it around, pluck the strings, and use it as a toddler would. The guitar is made of wood with 3 metal strings and 3 nylon strings. It has held up perfectly fine for over a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price.","review":"Yes this guitar has issues of staying in tune. What do you expect with a cheap guitar? My 3 year old loves to play around with it, and as long as I tune it every time, I don't mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best FIFTEEN album","review":"I'll just say this....if you are new to \\"Fifteen\\" and want to check out one of their C.D's don't buy this one. The best one by far is \\"Swains First Bike Ride\\". Aside from a few random good songs the other albums aren't that great. I've known this band personally since inception and even during the Crimpshrine days and if you want their(jeff's)best music in my humble opinion then buy the \\"Swain\\" album."},{"rating":"2","title":"quality album","review":"The album is a lengthy and solid Fifteen tour de force/farewell/whatever. Roughly half the songs are in some way related to Jeff's private life, as he highlights the personal as political and, as always, imperviously speaks his mind. Everyone seems to debate Jeff's personality and motivations to such an extent that the musicianship is often overlooked. In addition to Jeff's guitar playing, the bass and drum work on this album are incredibly tight, edgy, and more developed than other Fifteen albums. Overall, this is an excellent political/punk album that has loose ties to Crimpshrine's gutterpunk sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD but fifteen is getting to be just HIPPY MUSIC.","review":"I like fifteen, there good. but this album just mostly talks about jeff's family and stuff. as time goes by the albums begin to be more liberal. They also make fun of punkers in this album, but through all that i've said being an ANTI-FLAG punk rocker its still a good album from there hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS SUCKS","review":"I used to love this band in the early 90's, (Swain's, Choice, etc.). What happened? This is one of those cd's that makes you embarrassed when you listen to it. They used to make original music. This is silly. It seems Jeff Ott's first concern is his lyrics and then he builds a song around them--and it doesn't work. This is worse than Lucky which also sucked. I can believe I paid (...) bucks to listen to this negative creep rant about needles and child abuse for another album. No thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"We ordered this to make warning stickers in a Mechanical Room (Hot Surfaces, Rotating Parts, etc). The ink doesn't smear even if you put water on it and TRY to smear it. You can insert clip art images which is pretty cool (I inserted some industry standard warning images). It was quite a bit cheaper then what other major office chains are selling it. Also, it shipped from Amazon LLC, not Pex like two other reviewers had said, and it was the correct product-- Yellow Film with Black Ink. Whatever the problem was with shipping the wrong product in the past, Amazon/Brother has corrected it. Very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Legal Secretary","review":"The label rolls are excellent.

An excellent, well written dabble on the history of boxing accompanies the photos as well. nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware of depth and installation","review":"I took this back to the store after spending $21 on shipping that they would not refund, which I am not happy about ( I bought from sharper image directly). If your cabinets are standard depth (12\\") this product will stick out about a 1/2\\". What they don't tell you is that when you connect the tv antenna to the back it sticks out an inch. Also, they include a template to help you drill the holes in the right place BUT the hole on the template don't match the hole in the unit!Seems like all around poor planning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little TV system for the price","review":"I'm not sure what people expect from a modestly priced kitchen TV system, but this particular model has served me well.The picture quality and sound quality are excellent. Considering the handling it gets, it is quite sturdy. The remote and the panel buttons are ingeniously designed so that even with wet hands one can adjust channels and volume. Setting the time, programming radio stations and the like are intuitive in design, easy to do without directions.I advise anyone to use care with measurements, as if you have a very tight space, you may struggle with installation. I had no problems myself, but you need enough room not only for the unit, but for the cables in the back. Once you've mounted this thing under the cabinet, it may be difficult to plug new things into the back, if it's mounted close against the wall. Think about exactly what you intend to plug into the back and do so before screwing this into the cabinet mounts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torture!","review":"In their horrific greed the sleezy hollywood producers remade an awesome, funny, charming movie into a totally tasteless, mindless, unbearable farce! It's rarely that I can't sit through the whole movie but this one was the case!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An inescapably bad movie","review":"My other review was not posted, so I'll sum up. The actors were uninspired, though they occasionally seemed to be having fun, at least. The script had a few good moments that were mostly ruined by the direction and acting, and a lot of bad moments. The climax was boring and confusing. The whole thing lacked the beauty of the cartoons, the gentle charm of the TV show, the style of the previous movies, and the zest, wit, and good spirit of any of them.Like its own version of Lurch, this movie is a Frankenstein monster, part this, part that; it borrows from and alters things from the TV show and previous movies. But while Lurch, according to the script, \\"has the *heart* of an Addams,\\" the movie does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKED!","review":"If this silly thing would have let me give 0 or -ve stars, I would have. The whole movie was terrible slap stick comedy, and it didn't have any of the finess of the previous two movies. Gomez (Tim Curry) didn't even go wild over Morticia's french! (Daryl Hannah.) In fact, Morticia never spoke french. The only two good people in this were Morticia and Lurch. Pugsley didn't even look like pugsley. \\"Were not afraid (to hug), were contegous.\\" -Addams Family Values"},{"rating":"1","title":"A true waste of money.","review":"This movie is have been best done left unmade. While Tim Curry and Darryl Hannah are two of my favorite actors, they don't come near being the quintissential Addamses that the late Raul Julia and Anjelica Huston played. The writing is insipid and the plot is even more ubelievable and moronic than the original Addam's Family movies which, at least, had the saving grace of being just plain fun. Without Christina Ricci and the original move Lurch, it's just another movie to try to milk the success of the originals. If there were a way to give it no stars, I would. It was a direct-to-video release, and it's easy to see why, it would have been a total flop had it been released to the theaters. I was extremely disappointed and would have returned the movie for refund had I had that option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and simple ....STUPID!!!","review":"1.It didn't start where Addams Family Values left off. 2.The ONLY original characters were Lurch and Thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Tell Me You're Kidding!","review":"As a long time fan of the Addams Family, both the television version and the two movies with Raoul Julia, I had hoped this one would be good. Sorry to say, it most definitely was NOT!! This had to be the most pathetic version I have ever had the displeasure to see, and I'm sorry I wasted money on it. About the only saving grace it had (yes, it did have one!) was Ray Walston as the family patriarch. Other than that, it was a bigger bomb than the one the U.S. set off at Bikini Atoll. I am not in the habit of giving bad reviews, but this time around I was given no choice. This one stank worse than a convention of skunks! In short, please, don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Boring, Not a Waste of Time","review":"This movie was not boring but not a waste of time. I can't rate it above 2 stars, that being the standard for mediocrity. It even picked up the ball dropped by the 80s version, but this is not the classic Addams family from TV. Tim Curry as Gomez gives it that made for TV horror feel, but Darryl Hanna as Morticica doesn't get that sultry but elegant, still sexy look for an older woman. For wanting Addams right here right now, it's not boring and is devoid of foul language. A mediocre movie from a Hollywood name that seen troubles since the classic 50s TV show. TV shows in other deacades played up the montrous elements of the characters, as on the 80s version; I guess this is the closest thing you'll get for Addams Family right here right now- that's not being disturbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"I thought I'd seen the worst movie EVER when I suffered through NASTY RABBIT. Ha! At least I made it all the way through that hideous disaster! ADDAMS FAMILY REUNION is a total embarassment! I could only stomach about 15-20 minutes of this wretchedness before shutting it down! Tim Curry as Gomez? Darryl Hannah as Morticia?? C'mon! These two have certainly seen better days, but hey, no one could possibly save this toilet-boat! Raoul Julia and John Astin must be spinning in their graves like cyclones over this! I only hope it never sees the light of DVD! Please, if you want to recreate the effect of this movie on the brain, do it the cheap way. Just punch yourself in the temples while slamming your face with a door!

Gomez and Martisha didn\`t look anything like themselfs. Even Fester and Thing didn\`t even act or look like themselfs.

I read the instructions, which said to start off by removing the rings and letting your dog play with them first. I was glad I did, because I could see right away that the main seam on the blue bone was coming unstitched --- even before my dog played with it! Then I took a good look at the rings and half of them were coming apart at the seams too. Another disappointing dog toy. Note to dog toy makers: I will gladly pay more for toys that work! How can you stay in business when your products are so poorly made? I have a puppy, not some power-chewer, and I'm getting to the point where I don't know what kind of toys to buy for him.

One of which was the large intellibone puzzle. The website never claimed that this toy was chew resistant and I should have known better but my dog likes puzzles so I thought this would be a great toy for her. I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix with razor sharp teeth at the peak of her puppy chewing stage. I quickly realized that she was going to destroy this toy within a day so I took it away from her after a half an hour of play time. On a positive note, she loved this toy until I took it away from her. She didn't quite get the concept of pulling the rings off of the bone within the half an hour she played with it but she had fun playing anyway. Unfortunately she got a hold of the puzzle after I took it away from her and chewed it up completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"squeakers","review":"my dogs' only intent is to find the squeaker inside. needless to say this toy didnt last very long because of that. they never actually took the time to remove the rings from the bone. i removed one or two for them to see they came off but once removed, they only seemed interested in finding the squeaker inside. so the plush bone and the rings were destroyed within a week. the dogs loved the toy!! but they love the squeakers more. the small was the perfect size for both my yorkie-poo and min pin. the rottweiler liked playing with it too. i would probably buy another one because they liked it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts.....","review":"Here are three more episodes from the 90s Goosebumps series based on the books by R.L.

But what annoys me about this is that each volume only contains about an hour's worth of material (presumably so Time-Life can send you one volume at a time and charge you an arm and a leg without you realizing it). The other problem with the disc, decidedly more dumb, is the inability to pause the disc in order to take a short break. That was not an oversight, that was a deliberate disabling of a disc feature and for what reason, I have no idea. But in order to make the disc stop, you have to press \\"stop.\\" When you restart, you start over from the beginning. I would NEVER pay money for this.

I was extremely disappointed that it was excerpts only. I tried in vain to send it back to the seller for a refund; however, the seller was difficult to deal with. Seller took a very long time to respond to my multiple emails, and when seller did respond, the requirements to return the DVD were that it was to be in NEW condition, NEVER opened, and factory sealed. AND, Seller planned to charge a 15% restocking fee as well. Needless to say, I will never purchase another item from this seller.

The only problem I have with this toy is that the squirrels come out of the holes much too easily.

The dog's grandparents and his father were encouraging him to \\"get the squirrels! get the squirrels!\\" They're definitely chipmunks. I've never seen a striped squirrel.

But even when that game was over, she loves bringing me the squirrels for some fetch or even just to hold them in her mouth and squeak.The only downside to this toy is that I havent been able to find the squirrel replacements in a size large.

He seems more interested in the tree trunk. I was hoping the holes in the tree would be a little bigger for him to fit his head in there, but for safey reason, I guess it's better that he can't fit his whole head in there. What if it got stuck while I was at work? He has been trying to rip the tree trunk apart but hasn't been able to do that yet. He loves to carry the tree trunk and thrash it around.

The concept is great, but the object just didn't hold up for the recommended play. Just by playing at our feet for a few minutes at a time, she popped a hole in the bottom, ripped the thread holding the felt leaves and seams holding the tree trunk together, and yanked out loose stuffing. She also easily ripped off the weakly adhered fur on the animal tails. We use and love interactive toys, but even for a supervised toy, it didn't stay intact for even a few days.

She had been eating the stuffing! Lo and behold, when we took this toy away the hacking has almost completely gone away. She is ITTY BITTY and not an aggressive chewer, but with any puppy, if they can eat the stuffing and it's exposed they will do it. For the price, I am extremely disappointed!

BE CAREFUL PURCHASING THIS TOY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stuffing out in an hour","review":"Our puppy loves puzzles and plush toys, so we thought this would be perfect for her.

There goes that toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"dog loved it but destroyed it in 10 minutes","review":"my yorkipoo loved the toy, but it is not dog proof. he ripped the material very easily and started eating the inside. not sewn well.

This would be better for a smaller less destructive breed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puppy ripped open all the squirrels","review":"My 3 month old portuguese water dog, loved the squirrels but also loved to play tug of war. So she ripped open all the squirrels fairly quickly and I had to throw them away because there is this green stuffing and plastic squek toy part. She does still have the larger part which is intact. Not good for tug of war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"This toy was a great find for my three little dogs (chihuahuas).

Plenty sturdy for my dog (who is not a big chewer.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the ratings!","review":"I don't know if the quality of the product has diminished over the years, but I wouldn't suggest anyone waste their money on such a poor quality item. I was so excited to receive my package. However, the squirrels barely squeaked. I kept on trying to squeeze them, but all I heard was the puff of air. Wow, what a let down! I knew the price was too good to be true. Sometimes it's true; you get what you pay for. I plan to still let my pet play with the toy. It's not like he knows the toy is suppose to squeak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kyjen Hide-A-Squirrel Pet Toy","review":"My 2 puppies love playing with this toy. The only drawback was the whiskers that were on the squirrels faces. I had to cut them off because they were made out of a heavy string or wire that possibly could of caused a scratch in the dogs eyes or they could possibly chew off. I have a pug which I have to be careful of because of his eyes somewhat protude out. I do recommend buying this toy but trim the whiskers off of the squirrels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I unpacked this item and tossed it to my pup (1yr old Shepard mix) to play with. I watched as he removed each 'squirrel' played with it for about 10min till the squeaker went out. Then it took him another 5min to rip the toy apart. All told it took him about 1hr to destroy all three 'squirrels' and then about another hr to have the 'nest' torn apart also.Not a very good return on price vs entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING dog toy!!!","review":"I saw the positive reviews for this product, and ordered it for our James, thinking it would be just another toy.

The other great thing is that the trunk can be stuffed with other toys and treats.

Great toy and looking forward to building a collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly fun","review":"Great toy! It was an incredibly fun to to play with, my dog loved it and it was really great to watch. However, it did not hold up very well against an aggressive player and the tree trunk was quickly in pieces. The squirrels fared a little better and one has managed to avoid total destruction for over a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for Brownie","review":"Brownie loves this toy, he actually enjoys the log more than the squirrels which is kinda funny. He has bitten a hole into one of the squirrels in a week, but there's 3 of them so it's okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Scottie loves it!","review":"My 2 year old Scottish Terrier loves the large squirrel toy. In fact he won't let me stow it in his pet basket - he drags it out again when I put it away. He chews on the squirrels and mostly cuddles with the \\"tree stump\\". One word of caution: he managed to get the squeaker out of one of the squirrels within a few minutes after I gave it to him. The remaining two still have the squeakers inside after about 1 month of being mauled, but they no longer squeak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last Long.....","review":"I got the large toy even though I have a minature poodle cause I figured this would be made tougher since it was suppose to be for larger dogs. The first day he started playing with this he loved it. And we had tons of fun playing. By the end the night the fun was done however. He had two squirrels ripped apart on top which appeared to be a seam area. He doesn't have much interest in it now with just one squirrel left. If this was meant for larger dogs they really should of made the stitching much stronger."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fun","review":"I was a little worried because my dog can sometimes be a bit \\"slow\\" when it comes to learning new things, but it didn't take her very long at all to figure out how to get the squirrels out.

He played with it for hours after getting it. The toys lasted about 2 weeks before my dog started ripping out the stuffing from the squirrels. I wish the squirrels were made a little better to last longer as my dog really enjoyed playing with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy","review":"This toy is really cute and my dog loves squeaky toys.

Not a great buy for large dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog loves the toy, but's it is a piece of crap.","review":"Multiple attempts to get assistance or even a response from the manufacturer (phone, email, letter) have been useless. I have a 3 pound Yorkie who totally destroyed the squirrels within the first two hours of playing with it. The dog loved the toy and I bought the large model (for my tiny dog) thinking it would help the durability. If my 3 pound Yorkie can destroy these squirrels that fast, I'd hate to see how long they last with a bigger dog. Great toy for engaging and stimulating the dog. The quality of the materials is horrible. The response from the company is nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not challenging- just buy any small stuffed toy","review":"I tried this with my toller and it took him about 15seconds to remove all squirrels from the tree. Sure he loves the small squirrels and just carrying around the big trunk but he could have the same excitement from any small squeaky toys. I was hoping that it would take him a bit longer to get the squirrels out but alas it takes me longer to stuff them in."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame toy","review":"This toy is not very good at all. The squirrels are too small and easily fit through the holes in the stump. My dog just bites any part of the squirrel, shakes her head once, and the squirrel comes out. After the first one is out, the others come out even easier. In about a minute, it is over. She still likes playing with the individual toys, but it could be much better. Get the Kyjen Platypus, the eggs in the belly don't come out easily at all. Most importantly my dog looooves the Platypus and will play for a good 30 minutes with it, and only maybe 5-10 with the stump."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd review submitted, still have not received the iten that I ordered","review":"This is the second time that I have submitted a review without any results.

The squirrel/chipmunk's whiskers stuck in his throat and the squeakers were history. Very entertaining toy for five minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product for 1 month max!","review":"We have a Chihuahua and she loved playing with this toy. The only problem is that after about 3 weeks she already ripped off the ears on almost all of the squirrels and slightly ripped open the base (which has some hard cardboard).It's a cute and entertaining toy, but it's very important that you watch your pet while they play. That's supposed to be the rule with toys... but let's just say that you've been warned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Squirrel stump","review":"It took my dog a couple of days to like this toy. At first she wanted nothing to do with it but now it is her favorite. She discovered that if she shakes the stump, the squirrels fly out, so no more digging around inside. She loves to grab the stump and shake it (being part terrier, it is very vigorous shaking indeed). The squirrels are all missing their faces now, but still well loved and squeaked when found. We are quite amazed at how much our dog loves this toy and my husband keeps telling me what a good choice I made. The nieces and nephews were hoping the dog wouldn't like it and I'd give it to them instead... The kids thought it was the greatest thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect toy","review":"From the first moment I took this toy out of its box my Pomchi had loved it! She plays with it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"My German Shepherd loves this toy!","review":"I have a 3-year-old, 90-lb. German Shepherd, and he absolutely LOVES this toy! He usually rips every plush toy to shreds, but he somehow hasn't destroyed this toy. Although he figures out how to remove each squirrel from the tree within minutes, he spends hours squeaking each little squirrel, flinging the squirrels around the room, and chasing the squirrels. Then he brings the empty tree to me and puts it in my lap so I'll put the squirrels back inside of it. He tires himself out playing with this toy -- I'll find him passed out in his bed with little plush squirrels strewn all over the bed, and he lays his head on the tree. I'm going to get the Hide-A-Bee next."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"My puppy (Rhodesian Ridgeback) was able to pull all the squirrels out within a few minutes. Furthermore, within 5 hours of playing, she had the stuffing torn out of 2 of the 3 squirrels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for large dogs","review":"The Hide-A-Squirrel is a cute item. The biggest problem with this product is the squirrels are too small for a large dog. They are about the size of my fist. My 65 pound 6 month old puppy is too large to play with the squirrels; which is too bad given he really loves squeaker toys. They fit entirely in his mouth and I fear he may choke on them. I expected them to be larger given I ordered the ginormous size, and I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super fun","review":"Keeps my dogs entertained. Super fun.

She said her little yorkie was loving this toy. Based on previous reviews, I could not resist and am just as happy as everyone said I would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Dogs LOVE it!","review":"There are very few toys that keep my dogs entertained. Usually they like the packaging more. But this is a stimulating toy. Watch carefully when they play however because my big dog does like to tear the paws off the squirrels, so it's better not to leave them alone with it unless you put the squirrels up and just let them play with the tree. (For some reason it's almost as fun for them.) The thing that is nice about it is that one of the dogs like the squirrels alone, another likes pulling the squirrels out of the tree stump, and the third likes the stump by itself. The tree stump is very durable, but the squirrels could be ingested by dogs who like to eat their toys that are stuffed and squeak. I'm hoping someday that they will make one out of the Tuffy Toy kevlar fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but quickly destroyed","review":"While a cute set and fun to play with our 10lb chihuhua/daschund mix, re-inserting the little critters for him to retrieve again, leaving him to play with this alone for 15 minutes ended up with stuffing spread around and the tree trunk left shredded open... This is not for any chewers without supervision."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for medium or bigger dogs","review":"So two of the squirrels lasted for (drum roll please)................ 5 minutes tops. Wow I was frustrated. I thought the squirrels were stuck inside the tree and when the dog went to grab them they retreated inside. Instead, the squirrels come out and can be completely chewed. One squirrel got lost under the couch so it lasted for awhile. The tree itself was more fun for the dog as it was bigger. The tree lasted for 3 weeks before the stuffing started flying out. Boooo this toy! I would have given this product 1 star if the tree did not last for 3 weeks. The dog actually got some entertainment out of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"plush","review":"It is a cute toy and my dog loves it.....maybe too much.. the plush tree trunk part that you put the squirrel/chipmunks in was destroyed in a matter of minutes by my 7 month old Westie.

Just take out the little squirrels, squeak them a bit and put them back in the tree trunk. Roxie can't wait to dig them out. Seems sturdy enough. I bought the replacement pack, three little squirrels, but after 5 days of play the little squirrels that came with the toy are just fine. Roxie's not too rough on her toys, though. If you have a dog that tears toys apart you might want to be sure to get the replacements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun interactive toy for smart dogs","review":"We bought these for Santa for our dogs this Christmas. We have one particular dog who always invents his own games (read: drives us crazy) by hiding things under the couch, under the computer desk, etc. He has not done that since he's had these toys. The thing of it is, if you have smarter dogs they will pick up on it right away. One of our other dogs who doesn't much play with toys, immediately got how fun it was to come up to it and \\"steal\\" the squirrels out of it. PS they also like playing with the babies by themselves, too.I definitely recommend these toys to keep your dogs curious mind active, and occupied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My 2 year old black lab LOVES this toy. It was a Christmas present and she flipped out. She was tossing it in the air and actually jumped over the coffee table to get it. She knew what to do with it immediately. She loves to take things apart, so this is perfect. She shreds stuffed animals to get to the squeakers, but the squirrels are still all in one one piece. She has pulled some of the fabric leaves off the stump, but it still functions well. She also managed to kill the squeakers in 2 out of the 3 squirrels in less than 10 minutes though, so that's why I only give this toy a 4. 1 still works and they have not been completely destroyed yet though, so that's great for her! She still likes digging around in the stump to find them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Morkie\\" Dog Loves It!","review":"I cannot tell you just how much time my Ella spends playing with this toy......She has also figured out how to put the squirrels back into the tree.....I also purchased the \\"Ginormous\\" type....I can stuff anything flexible into the tree stump and she will play with delight for the longest time....It is also good for my interactive play with her....I highly recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"I learned a lesson as my dog is newly adopted - no more fabric toys of any kind. 3 year old lab mix tore this thing apart in less than 5 minutes.

Literally just a few bites and the stitching was split open and stuffing was flying. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"My dog simply doesn't care for this toy.

It lasted about 4 months before one of the squeakers finally went and some of the stuffing started to come out, but that's with constant play between multiple dogs.

This toy has lasted a lot longer than other squeaker/plush toys we usually get. The only thing he has actually removed from the toy is the cloth tag (so if you've got a dog who usually takes these things apart, you might want to remove the tag before giving it to him). Otherwise, our dog happily pulls the little squirrels out over and over again.

It's a great toy and anyone who wants to have a happy dog should get this toy. I am buying my second one, and that is why I rated this 4 stars and not 5. It broke.

The dogs (a 7 year old Blue Healer mix, and a 9 year old pit mix) figured out how to get the squirrels out within about 2 minutes, but were still enjoying themselves chewing on the squeaky little squirrels. It was a bit too easy for them though, and if I were to buy another one (which I'm not, since the quality is crap) I'd probably get one of the toys with a single hole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice product, didn't last more than a few weeks.","review":"First off I thought the product was very nice, and both of my dogs loved to play with it when I first opened it up. Unfortunately due to the squirrels having a squeaker in them most large dog would tear them open to get to the squeaker. I pulled them all out and it got more use than I expected. The dog enjoyed it a lot and just because it eventually got turned into random pieces cloth, that's not to take away from the product at all. I still have at least one of the squirrels that kept well. Overall a good product, but if you have a dog that is determined to get to the squeakers then it may not last as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog Loves it.","review":"I bought the smaller one thinking my dog is small he needs the small one...

The squirrels are quite small and contain a squeaker. He swallowed the squirrel whole before we could get it out of his mouth. When we looked at the size of the other squirrels it was clear that it was not going to pass through his intestines. We took him to an emergency animal clinic and they induced vomiting with Apomorphhine. This did not work due to the size of the squirrel which would not allow it to pass back up through the gastro-esophageal sphincter and through the esophagus. He ended up having to have an operation (gastrotomy) to remove it. This product should be immediately taken off the market the squirrels will be able to be swallowed by all but very small breeds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful dog toy!","review":"My dachshund loves his toys but usually has them torn apart in no time.

It's worth it since my dog adores the toy so much. Also, people complain that the replacement squirrels don't come in small but it really doesn't matter. You can easily fit two large replacement squirrels (they are really not that large) into the small Hide A Squirrel. and they are actually much better quality than the small ones.Warning: do not purchase this item if you like a tranquil environment and are easily irritated by a feverish, adrenalized creature in your midst.

The Chipmunks lasted for weeks then My dogs friend came over and took out the insides of two of the Chipmunks in ten minutes. So I can't say they are durable but if you have a dog that's not to hard on her toys this is the one for you. I stuff the hollow remains of the Chipmunks into the tree trunk, along with other little toys and she goes at it with gusto. Shaking, throwing and digging them out. It only last maybe ten minutes but them she'll play with each individual toy for a while. I will buy another when needed. My little dog and I are very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hide-and-seek fun!","review":"As far as this type of toy is concerned I think this one is the best. The plush toys are high quality, there are plenty of holes to dig through, and my dog loves the toy. It's not her favorite, but she loves to shake out the squirrels a few times each day. I think it's a good toy to help dogs with their confidence as they have so many squirrels to bully and they have to stick their head inside to get to them. Also, because the toys are inside, they have to rely on their noses and intellect with this toy more than many other toys. As Cesar Milan would say, the nose is the number one sense for dogs. Any training/toys that gets them to use their nose is letting dogs learn to be dogs.

The squeakers on these squirrels are superb.Our baby is 25 lbs and we probably could have ordered a jumbo size.

We stuff extra toys in it to make the fit tighter, since my pit/lab mix's delicate extraction method is to shake it with a couple of G-forces until the chipmunks / tigers / whatever else we've stuffed in, fly out.

On closer inspection it was obvious that the stitching hasn't been done properly. Two of the squirrels have holes and need to be sewn up before my puppy can play with it.I bought the Jumbo size in the hope that my dog would get plenty of playtime with the toy and its very disappointing that the quality is so poor.

Were this a long tree trunk with numerous critters well hidden inside such that it required extensive digging and twisting and turning inside out to locate them, my dogs would enjoy it. Instead, it offer no challenge. Place a stuffed animal sticking out of a teacup and that's a comparable level of challenge.

I have an American Bulldog/Chow mix with razor sharp teeth at the peak of her puppy chewing stage. I quickly realized that she was going to destroy this toy within a day so I took it away from her after a half an hour of play time. On a positive note, she loved this toy until I took it away from her. She really enjoyed pulling the little squirrels out of the tree trunk. I ended up leaving the toy with my mom, a squirrel lover, for her cats. Surprisingly, her cats love this toy just as much as my dog did so it worked out just fine.

They get one, take it, squeak it, put it in their pile and come back for another. Then when they are all gone, we have to go pick them up, and it's a race to who gets to the pile first, human or dogs. Then we play tug to get them back. It goes on for hours. Love it. And when I put it up, they sit there looking at it, as if to say, \\"Why did you put it so far away? We want it. Please!!!\\" But eventually they get distracted by something else.

It only took them about 5 minutes to figure out how the toy works,they love carrying the little squirrels around.

They did both enjoy it. Unfortunately the pug puppy is a chewer and in less than a week all 3 'squirrels' had multiple open seams. Squirrel 1 had open seams the day after it arrived. Squirrel 2 had the same problem 3 days after it arrived. The final squirrel lasted a week. The description said \\"Durable enough to withstand tough play\\". Nope. I've had puppies that were much harder on toys than this pug too. Part of the problem seems to be a quality control issue as no other toy we've had has had seams open like this.The 'log' part is great for putting other toys in though - and they enjoy chasing the empty 'log' around. Its pretty funny to see a puppy carrying this thing around when its half her size.So - if I were rating the FUN, it would be 5 stars. For a few days. Durability? 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"great fun until somebody swallows a tail","review":"Our Goldendoodles (8 months and 5 months) absolutely loved this toy. The squirrels are ideal for self play, easy to sling around in the air, toss, juggle, throw, fetch, hide; and they loved digging the squirrels out of tree trunk as well -- this kept them occupied and never bored. Problem: the squirrels are not durable... within one day of getting our 5-month-old (a chewer, but not an extreme chewer -- he doesn't even have all his adult teeth yet!), he easily ripped off the tail of one of the squirrels and swallowed it whole... now we are very worried that he is going to have to have surgery to remove it from his digestive system. Hopefully it will pass through (gross). We are never letting them play with these squirrels again because they aren't safe. Maybe we should have purchased the larger one or maybe Kyjen should make the squirrels more durable to cater to larger breeds with stronger mouths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Durable At All!","review":"I bought this based on the reviewers who claim their dogs cannot destroy this toy. My yellow lab took about 2 minutes to rip the holes in the tree wide enough for the squirrels to fall right out. It's obvious just looking at the material that it is not built to take much abuse as it's the same cheap cloth and stitching found on the majority of dog toys out there. This might be good for a dog who does not usually tear up toys, but for a typical dog like mine this toy is worthless - a complete waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Play time","review":"Hide a Squirrel is a fun interactive toy, however, interactive is the key word.

To death.Unfortunately, that only took 5 minutes. He does still play with the squirrels if I throw them, but he's just as happy with a tennis ball. I wouldn't recommend this for any dog that likes to chew or pull on his or her toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that durable","review":"The \\"tree\\" has a plastic disk in the bottom, between 2 layers of fabric. My westie became obsessed with chewing the plastic and eventually chewed right through the fabric and would have eaten pieces of the plastic had I not taken it away. I ended up ripping out the inner layer of fabric and the trunk has been ok since. The squirrels are not that durable. One's squeaker was silenced while my dog was trying to get it out of the tree. Two of the squirrels are starting to come apart already and will need some mending. All that being said, it's pretty cute to watch her with the tiny squirrels. So, provided you don't mind making a few modifications if needed and making minor repairs to the squirrels this is a pretty good toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our puppy loves this toy...and the quality is great","review":"Our puppy is into squeaky toys and chewing. It took a couple of hours for her to fully understand this toy, but once she learned how to use it, she loves it. She can devour many items...particularly plastic toys...but this one is well made and has stood up to hours of play. I strongly recommend this toy, and feel that it is a great value. Also, it looks good, as compared to many toys that make a room look junked up. A great find, and replacement squirrels can be purchased. I also bought the similar.product with bees, and plan to open that one soon. Compared to many toy products, this one is a great value.

They do enjoy the little squeaky critters though! My male solved the problem by just grabbing the whole thing in his mouth to keep it away from the other dog. If you have a dog with a fat nose rather than a long tapered one, it will be more difficult for them. They will not be able to reach inside and grab the toys.

I have had a half dozen Seiko divers and they have all been exceptionally reliable & durable. Accuracy is on par with a mechanical/automatic watch in this price point. +/- 15 seconds per day is pretty normal. If you want/need better accuracy, I would advise you to buy this watch (or a similar Seiko diver) in the quartz version.The yellow dial is very sharp! Really gives it a pop of color and looks great with the black rubber strap.The hardlex crystal will scratch (although less easily than mineral crystal and a LOT less easily than acrylic).....if it had a Sapphire crystal, I would have given it 5 stars. But then again, the price would probably be $50-100 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seiko Diver takes a dive after 1year","review":"This is a nice looking, well working watch for the price....but....after a year of service both the bezel and the screw down crown went south.

There are a couple of stand-out characters, one of them being 'the man with the flies'. I also felt as if this movie was trying to preach the acceptance of the homosexual lifestyle. I don't like movies that try to 'preach' anything! And frankly, I think Kevin Spacey was too good for this role. There weren't enough 'meaty' scenes to merit casting an actor of his calibur in the role. I was left with an empty, incomplete feeling when this movie was over.

Though John Cusack is charming in \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\" and \\"High Fidelity,\\" he exudes no personality here and even looks pasty and exhausted. Kevin Spacey's Jim Williams is under- developed and creates neither sympathy nor loathing. The atmosphere of Savannah and the vodoo element are also wasted.

The drag queen, who brought the book to life and gave us some relief from the overall darkness of the book, is almost non-existent. The issues 'she' seriously brought forth in the book about racism and homophobia are never brought to the screen. Some of the quirky characters who also gave the book distinction are omitted too so what we have is a story about southern decadence, charm and most of all a southern city--Savannah, Georgia--that was a character of itself--cut to the quick and edited to the point of boredom.

While adapting this novel for the big screen was not an easy task, I still expected a much more engaging plot. Cusak, as always, did a better than fair job, adding some quirky humor in surprising places, but Spacey seemed to sleep walk his way through. I was truly relieved when the movie was finally over. In a nutshell, the confusing plot dragged on painfully, and I would not recommend this film to anyone.

The \\"forces\\" involved in this story are portrayed in a completely believable manner. The casting is great! Savannah is a city chock-full of tradition and the movie benefits from making extensive use of the politics and complicated religious mixture of southern life.

Make sure you have a good microphone to use with it. The Cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for.

We used to record directly to CD, however, we now run from the board, thru the Lexicon Alpha and into our computer (1st gen i7 PC laptop, running Win7). Setup was simple and using Audacity software with this unit, it works like a dream! Now we record only program segments and I can go back and add intro, promos, music, and outro later using Audacity.

The gain is super low, and when raised high this squeaky sound comes out of the monitors, which I wouldn't have minded if it hadn't come up in the recordings. I attempted to plug in an electric guitar, and it came up in that recording as well. The sound prevents it from sounding like a clean, crisp, professional recording.

Granted, I don't record through this unit (I use Pro Tools in my studio), but I can tell you this: for a mere $[...] bucks this unit has that famous pristine Lexicon sound quality that used to cost us at least a couple grand in 1980s bucks.Great sound.

If you have an old XP machine lying around that you don't plan on upgrading, then the Lexicon line of recording studio hardware has a lot of bang for the buck. Just don't purchase their products with the thought of upgrading...I'm now trying to find a similar product that supports 64-bit Windows 7.I gave this product 2-Stars because it still works great under old OS's, but I cannot give it any more Stars due to Lexicon's attitude towards 64-bit OS's, and they lackidasical approach to Windows 7 compatibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"You really get what you pay for. Or less than you pay for. We've owned this for less than a year, and have had problems since the beginning. The most persistent is that it simply won't turn on. To activate, you simply connect the USB cable and hope the light turns on. If not, you unplug it and try again. But like we did, you will do this many, many times and sometimes it just won't come on. So you give up and try again the next day and hope it works. For musicians on a schedule, this has proved to be an incredible troublesome and unreliable piece of equipment. You're better off spending the extra money on one that will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor mic compatability","review":"I bought this to replace an m audio fast track that had developed an annoying intermittent shriek through headphones. On installation I found that this unit didn't offer compatibility with Skype and had poor preamplification of my Shure SM 48 via the XLR input. My onboard sound software Adobe Audition did not register the mic output at all, even though the driver options were set correctly, and the supplied Cubase registered very low mic volume, even though the mic input was turned to maximum. My choice was to return the unit or purchase a mic preamp, which I was loathe to do.....Seeing the m audio had good enough recording volume and was compatible with Skype I have decided to by another unit from from m audio and return this unit to Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Unit!","review":"I bought this to replace a Behringer UCA202.

Not only is it interference-free, it has a much warmer, intimate sound.It's USB powered, installs automatically in about a minute under Win7 with no issues. I did go to the Lexicon website and get their driver, though, just to be on the safe side.REAPER had new entries for the device in the audio settings panel (ASIO! :-) ).

Worse, when I finally did so (with the battery's plastic cover plate bulging ominously) it caused the screen to power off. As other reviewers have noted, this appears to be a very poor physical design although the battery per se seems to work well enough. The solution however is easy - contrary to the paper directions that come with the battery, insert the battery such that the paper label on the battery is facing INWARDS (facing the innards of the machine). The photo on the battery directions shows that the paper label should be facing outwards toward the installer - this is INCORRECT!

This battery may be bargain priced, and shown on Amazon as bundled with the 7XL, but you will be in for a surprise. Other reviews complain about how poorly the battery fits in the back, but say nothing about the connector, so they must have had the Photoshare 7 rather than the 7XL.

The Photoshare was a gift for my wife to show off pictures of our twin grandsons and the battery doesn't last long enough for her to show her friends at church before going dead.

I was hoping to make my morning easier with this, but it was such a disappointment. I tried different time/cooking methods, but none came out like a real omelet. First, I whipped 3 eggs and added some oil and cooked it for 3 min, and it came out like it was baked. And then I tried cooking on two sides to add cheese in the middle. I cooked it for 1 min, and added cheese and cooked 1 more min, and again it came out so crappy. It was boiled over and falling apart. All other trials didn't give me an omelet that looked appetizing. So, I don't think I'll be using this anymore. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"arrived cracked","review":"This is made of cheap plastic. When it arrived I placed it in my cubbard. When I toke it out a month later (past the return date) I noticed that it was cracked. I am pretty sure it arrived that way and I didn't notice. In addition, the hinges don't line up right and are out of alignment, so it would not have worked well anyway. Oh well, you get what you pay for and this was pretty cheap.

I love it.The only thing that I dont like is the second step when you have to close the maker. You first microwave it open, then take it out, add the veggies, then close it. How do you prevent the eggs on the opposite side from spilling all over the place? Maybe I put too much egg yolk. Anyway, I love this product and may use it tonight for a dinner omlette."},{"rating":"1","title":"microwaveable omelet maker","review":"Pretty flimsy...certainly not worth the money ...and by the time you read the instructions to get the perfect omelet, you'll want to fry it instead...I had to put mine in about 3 times to get it done...I kept to remind myself not to buy things like online...if I had seen it and felt it, I never would've bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, basically","review":"Egg whites kind of stick to this thing, but not bad. They are easily rubbed away with the rough side of a sponge if you get to it quickly. Way better than trying to scrub a pan that you used PAM on.It does what it says it does. In a minute and a half you'll have a delicious omelet with about 1/5th of the work usually involved. For the price, this thing is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"funky fun","review":"A terrific collection of soul favorites of the 60's and 70's, my baby and I have lots of fun carpet dancing to this CD.

We were looking for an all around quiet microwave. One that ran quiet and opened and closed quiet. (Any time we operated the old microwave when the baby slept, she would hear it and and wake up screaming thinking it was time for a bottle.) This one is working out great. Love the function keys that allow you to turn the button volume off. Only thing I do not like about the microwave is the spring sound the door makes when it opens and closes. (My last microwave had the handle on the door which allowed you to close it more quietly.) As far as cooking goes, it also works great. I absolutely love the sensor reheat button.

Unfortunately, after living with this for two months, I wish i hadn't bought it.The designers did a horrible job on the glass tray. It is exceptionally difficult to line-up the floating support ring and the tiny center notches (it's a two-step process). You might say: \\"So what, how often do you have to do that\\". Well, not only every time you clean it, but the engineering is so bad that the glass tray slips off with ease. After you go through this manhandling 8-10 times a week, you'll say : \\"I wish I had bought a different microwave\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never could open the door","review":"I really looked forward to getting this microwave, I have used Panaonic both at home, and in a research lab, all to good use and they are good products.This one however arrived, and I could not even once from the very start, get the door open. The latch was totally disconnected from anything. Ran a few seconds just to .. well at least SEE inside, and noticed the electrical right panel was loose, a hazard.Amazon very good about taking back, or easy so far this side of pickup tomorrow.This is a shame, as I do know that Panasonic can make a very good MW's. But, this design in particular is so precarious, that I did not opt for a replacement but a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious WIFI interference","review":"Functionally, the product seems fine. The user-interface is easy to use and the reliability, so far, has been good. Cooking is a bit slower, but more even, than my previous GE microwave oven.But WIFI interference is a major issue with this oven. Our WIFI network is unusable on the lower floor of the house when the oven is on. In this day and age, with so many dependencies on WIFI, I don't understand why manufacturers can't shield their appliances appropriately. Our old GE microwave did not have a problem with WIFI, so I never envisioned this could be so problematic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died at just under 2 years.","review":"This just stopped working today after just under two years of moderate use. I've never had a microwave that died. They always just got passed along as we moved or our needs changed. It worked very well while we had it, but it certainly should last longer than two years. I would consider it another one, but most buggy things die within 30 days. This lasted long enough to prove it wasn't a bug, but likely just not built for the long haul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad--So Sad:((","review":"After reading the reviews of this microwave and many others, I decided to purchase this one. Less than 30 days later, and after very light use, it started making a loud, buzzing sound accompanied by the smell of burnt wiring. The buzzing continued after I stopped the microwave.

Just last week while driving home our son was getting fussy (because I was listening to talk radio) so I popped in the CD and he was quiet the rest of the way home - this alone would motivate me to buy another one.The songs are fun, after playing it non-stop most everytime were in the car, I'm still not tired of it. I enjoy listening/hearing the different dialects of the children and the songs are fun and entertaining.I envision, as our son gets older, we'll sing these songs together in the car and that will make the CD even more enjoyable for both of us. But right now, anything that keeps him happy and entertained in the car gets an A+ in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!!

Half of the book is the script of \\"Roadracers\\" and the other half is pure Rodriguez tale-telling of the sometimes harrowing experience of making \\"Roadracers\\". I loved it.

Following it in an origianl composition by Loussier [Nympeas].There are great piano and bass riffs. The music soothes and stimulates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtracks for the mind","review":"Swans are an intimidating prospect for any listener; a constant evolution of confrontational, brooding, enigmatic intensity. This live album is a great introduction for the newcomer, and essential document for the completist. It contains a fine version of their greatest ever song, 'Helpless Child', and definitive versions of many others from the final two studio albums. More importantly, it better outlines their 15 year progression from gutter brutality to sublime magnificence than any other record in their back catalogue. The transformation of 'I Crawled' from the 'Young God' EP provides the most obvious example. A near perfect representation of one of the definitive underground bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"One More Nail in the Coffin","review":"I'm trying to forgive Michael Gira and Jarboe for dragging the death of their \\"main\\" band out like the demise of the monster in a cheesy horror film, and it's getting pretty difficult. It isn't that I don't appreciate the incredibly diverse body of work that they left behind, and the live shows that I have attended were near-religious experiences, it's just that those experience haven't tended to translate all that well in recordings. Jaboe isn't all that scary when she isn't hanging out over the front of the stage screaming like a more muscular Diamanda Galas, and Gira's leadership of the the whole churning mess comes out sounding more like a Walkman recording of a Pigface show. This pair has always been a trifle arrogant in the sheer volume that they have thrown at their fans, and this is a prime example."},{"rating":"1","title":"....And Buttrock Returns!","review":"Well with a lineup featuring; Kim, Alex, and Jesper you would automatically think RIGHT ON!! Well FORGET IT!! I dont know what they were thinking or listening to when they were influenced to do a glam rock album, but I have no other word than Disgusted to describe this band. Its not just this album either, its all Sinergy albums. Kim sounds like she's got King Diamond or new S.O.D. in her head. Laiho's guitar work is ok but by far not as impressive as Bodom's. Strombald's choice to do drumming on the album?? I mean come on whats up with that? All in all I would have to say I've taken more impressive dumps than this band.

It's not original, and it's very weak imitation. The female singer does a very poor Billie imitation that no one familiar with her work could tolerate. This CD imitates great musicians like Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong; SNZ are mediocre musicians at best. Compare it to the real thing - the original is more fun to dance to and sing along with, and the talent is amazing.... That said, it's not too painful to put in the CD player when you're not paying close attention. And SNZ deserve credit for repopularizing music outside the mainstream and may perform an invaluable service by introducing a new generation to this type of music, even if in a diluted form - if you know and love jazz and swing, you'll be sorely disappointed; if you haven't been exposed, this can serve as an introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth hearing once, but not worth buying...","review":"I rented this CD from the library and thought it was not bad.

From the opening swinger \\"Got My Own Thing Now\\" to the end track \\"The Interlocutor\\", the Zippers deliver! While the more popular groups out there are sampling and re-doing older songs, it's nice to see the Squirrel Nut Zippers playing all their original stuff. They also don't layer on different instruments at a time. What you're hearing on the album is what you're likely to hear if you go to see them in concert, with each member playing at the same time. My favorite tracks would have to be the opening track \\"Got My Own Thing Now\\", \\"Put a Lid on it\\", \\"Prince Nez\\", \\"Meant to Be\\", and \\"Blue Angel\\".

Squirrel Nut Zippers does not sound like Cherry Poppin' Daddies. The only similarity is that they both play retro music. This isn't either good nor bad, just different. Cherry Poppin' Daddies play retro-30's Big Band while Squirrel Nut Zippers play retro-20's Dixieland/Flapper music. Both are good.Squirrel Nut Zippers certainly seem to have a lot of fun on this CD and I had a lot of fun listening. I especially like the baritone sax, the banjo, and the baritone ukelele (not instruments you hear a lot in today's popular music.) The female lead singer, Katharine Whalen, has a voice that sounds right out of a Betty Boop cartoon - unique and oh so cool. I'd love to hear her sing some more torch songs.

None of the other students in my Calc I and Calc II courses got anything from it either, as far as I can tell. I had to scramble and seek information from other calc books in order to understand what differentiation and integration was all about. The text in no way prepares one for the exercises. There's no connection between the text and the exercises. In the exercises there appear some inane, open-ended questions that seem to be trying to make some unfathomable point. This is not a book anyone can learn from. I would strongly advise any student who must use this book as their course textbook to CHANGE COLLEGES. There are many great calculus books out there, on all levels. For those who prefer a 'calculus reform' approach, I would recommend Calculus Lite, by Frank Morgan. For the more traditional approach, I got a lot out of Anton's classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good foundation for beginning calculus students.","review":"This book does not provide a good foundation for beginning calculus students.

Alison Rose is the most vapid foolish sycophant little rich girl imaginable. There is not one funny or witty remark in this book. I don't know what she means by being insane. Perhaps she does have schizophrenia. That might be a reason for her super dull behavior. She zeros in on men who have some sort of fame: Burt Lancaster's son, a mnor film celebrity, several New Yorker writers and then debases herself and flatters them endlessly until they submit to her company but some how she cannot even tell us why they are interesting to others. She copies down the most banal things they say. I see on the book jacket that now she occasionally writes for Vogue. She is not employed by the New Yorker and was briefly a receptionist there. Her 94 year old mother should have written the book. Alison's father was correct about her from the start. But instead of a psycho, she's a sycophant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, Alison, snap out of it !","review":"I choose this book because I saw that Alison Rose has been a contributor to the \\"New Yorker\\" magazine, and thought this might be a stimulating, inspirational book for other aspiring writers. Instead, it is the sad story of someone with apparently many capabilities and talents who has spent her life hanging on to others (mostly men) for her identity. There are no photographs of Rose (except for, presumably, the one on the dust cover) or anyone else who has been in her life, which is frustrating. Instead, she spends quite a bit of time telling us how incredibly attractive (and talented) she is by quoting what others have said about her. It is also rather appalling that a woman who is now 60 years old continues to refer to herself as a \\"girl\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice picture, great player","review":"After two years of using an Apex DVD, watching a movie on this baby is great.

The remote is comfortable to hold and has faintly backlit buttons in the middle, which makes it easy to find in the dark. The \\"menu\\" button, unfortunately, is in the middle of a bunch of buttons on the top half of the remote, so it's difficult to find. Also the up/down/left/right buttons are on the bottom of the remote but are rather small.Quirks: pressing fast-forward on the remote will only ffwd for about 10-15 seconds before freezing. You have to press \\"play\\" and then \\"ffwd\\" again to make it continue.Also, it doesn't remember where you were on the disc when you power down the player. And it has an auto-off power saving function, so if you pause the movie and leave the room for 20 minutes and then return, it's turned itself off and you've lost your place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Experienced Short Life","review":"I purchased the Toshiba DVD SD-3900 player and within 20 hours of play, the sound started fading then the picture went blank.

Unfortunately there are only four books right now, but we can only hope that she is as prolific as she is gifted. Her characters are so well drawn out you can actually remember them. Her secondary characters are also rich and vibrant. Her dialogue is wonderful and her prose is unique and highly-charged emotionally whether she is describing a thought or a sensuous love scene.

The first part of the book is plausible, but the conflict was a big letdown. I hate it when writers create women characters who are unreasonable and unwilling to listen to any explanation. The \\"Heroine\\"'s reaction was completely overblown in my opinion because her background didn't support it!

There were long drawn out passages of narrative summaries that describing everything and anything in painful detail, and page after page of text without any dialogue or interaction between the characters to give it snap. There was an over abundance of internal dialogue that had the characters talking more to themselves than to each other, and a lot of secondary characters that were hard to keep track of (probably because I was skipping so much).All in all (in my opinion) not a very satisfying read."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Cartoons Were Special","review":"Watching these old toon's really takes me back!

These cartoons are a rare mix of good story telling + good artwork that is just gone today. The stuff that they come out with now is just garbage and poorly produced retreads that is just sad. My only gripe is there are no captions or subtitles on any of the shout! factory dvds, G.I. Joe & Tranformers at least. Being almost deaf I really need them to follow the stories. Even without the captions, they are worth the money just to get caught up in them one more time.

This text only skims the surface of every topic, as if to give a brief overview. Also, it talks about certain topics early on, but does not go further into the topic until several chapters later in the book. So several chapters later, you are jumping back and forth trying to reference the illustrations from long ago with the topic being discussed currently. Though several references were made concerning an Appendix, a thorough search of the book failed to produce one. So all of the topics that say \\"go to Appendix B for further discussion\\", are not covered very much at all. I only opened this book a few times, if at all, during my entire semester.

The PS3 is my DVD/Blu Ray player and I wanted to use it with the Harmony 880 remote but was unable to do so because the PS3 has no IR port. But the Blu Wave comes with a USB IR dongle that can receive commands from the Harmony. I taught the Harmony the proper commands from the Blu Wave and can now control the PS3 with the same remote that controls all the other devices in my entertainment center.And if you care about aesthetics, the IR attachment is barely noticeable against the black PS3. It won't distract you at all.As many others have recommended, you cannot control the PS3's power or eject discs with this remote.

It gives you a PS button as well as additional buttons such as audio/subtitle and eject; all buttons that the Nyko remote does not have. Also with the Sony one, you do not need any usb dongle plugged into the front of the PS3 (which looks sorta of weird)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Basic","review":"This remote is a cheap alternate if you are looking to program a Logitech Harmony or other universal remote.

As other reviewers have noted, the only limitation is you cannot turn the PS3 on and off and must use the buttons on the machine. Given that you use it to control DVD playback, though, chances are you have to insert and eject the disc anyhow so it's not a big deal.Works great with my Harmony 880 remote.

The only downside to it is that the Blu Wave Remote does not turn on the PS3; there is no power on button. Unfortunatley you would still have to use the regular PS3 Bluray remote to turn on the system. Because the power on feature is not on the Blu Wave Remote, there is no way to program that into a Harmony either.

And the results: quick and easy installation with complete control of all of the functions the PS3 Bluetooth remote has! I highly recommend this product to anyone that is looking to use IR to control their PS3 BluRay player.The NYKO USB IR stays in the PS3. So like any other IR the USB must be in sight of the remote control. So if you are putting your PS3 in an entertainment cabinet with other devices you may want to put the PS3 on the top shelf or on one that is in clear sight of where you will be when controlling the PS3.

But who cares? You still have to get up to insert a disc right? And to turn it off, you can turn off the ps3 via XrossMediaBar menu.Overall, the dongle has a quick response time.

The only lacking feature is an on button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Only reason I bought this Blu Wave Remote was so that I can use the USB IR dongle with my Harmony One universal remote. It works but not 100%. If I want to move left or right with my universal remote it moves in 2 steps! Not sure what's the cause of this but I may have to tweak the time settings.The remote, as you can see, is very small with small buttons. This can be a problem for some people with large fingers or hands. I did wish it had some sort of back lighting feature for the remote.This remote kit is great for the price but there's no guarantee that it'll work 100% well with your universal remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful item","review":"Purchased this product primarily for the IR receiver to use with universal remote. Given that Sony was arrogant enough to use a completely incompatible system for receiving signals, this item makes a nice work-around for people who actually want to use the PS3 in their home theater. Doesn't hurt that it is so affordable either.I paired this with the Logitech Harmony One remote. The Blu-Wave is already in the Logitech database, so programming the remote to work with the IR receiver was a cinch. Works like a charm.Only complaint (aside from having to buy this in the first place) is that you cant use it for power on/off, but this is a Sony problem, not a problem with the remote.I would recommend this product as an option for anyone wanting to control their PS3 with a universal remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue wave remote","review":"An excellent item for IR control of your PS3.

I was particularily looking for informal, soft, cheap white 'kerchiefs. These fit the bill. A little stiff coming out of the package, but after washing, became soft and gentle on my delicate nose. I like that they are quite thin, light and small - I tuck them into my pocket for hiking, keep some in my purse and my car. Apparently, I blow my nose a lot!

That changes after 1 washing - after 2 they weren't any better, worse in some cases.I do not recommend these. Go to Kohls or any place that sells Dockers brand, they are 10x better. Thicker cotton, tighter weave, bigger size. $12 for 9 pure cotton white, $12 for 6 blue plaid (3 royal blue, 3 gray-blue). The plaid ones are a little bigger. Kohls price is Retail - mine were on sale, 30% less.Don't waste your money on these. Mine are going to Good Will or rag bag.

Micranots do a little of both. The result is a very solid hip hop album. The beats and the rhymes are both on point and neither really outshines the other. Micranots are perhaps the perfect example of a group that is greater as a whole than it is broken down into its components. Ultimately this is not a classic release, but a worthy one.

Buy it elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe no one has reviewed this book.","review":"I'm a big Twain fan but I'll keep it simple.This book, a collection really, is short and sweet. If you have any interest in: sociology (particularly American), religion (particularly American), cultural commentary (particularly American), trying to explain the human condition (not particularly American) or comedy, this is a very good selection. And it will take you only a matter of hours to dip into some of Twain's funniest--and prickly--thoughts.I mean it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullied Heathen","review":"This is a fantastic book. I never thought I'd like Twain. It shed light on the concepts and ideas of Twain, which are ideas we are not meant to learn about in American Schools. Our schools still milk the whole black white shock value issue (from Mark's early works)where as Mark Twain truly turns out to be quite a deep thinker and social satirist as a mature writer as well. He is quite in tune with research and wit upon the subject of the human race and the history of religion.

I took a step of faith and ordered this CD. I'm not disappointed one bit. I'll enjoy it for a long time to come. Oh, yeah, one thing, when the first track starts off, don't think your CD player is having a problem. The synthesized opening strains are for real.

Odd Thomas is completely unbelievable (we all suspend belief a little bit, but I can't do it THIS much...) and the way the narration goes on and on and on and on is absolutely astounding to me. Any entry level writing course advises to keep it short and simple. Descriptions don't have to be long and wordy to get the point across.

Where the heck is his editor??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and long-winded Odd Thomas","review":"The story supposed to be quite engaging, but interesting scenes are not continuously linked from one to another. They are often cooled down by Odd Thomas's memory feedback of something boring, and it is hard to pick up the pace and interest to continue.E.g. in Odd's discussion with a sister, he saw a hooded man without a face, but he lost the faceless man in just a few seconds. The next moment, he spent a great deal of explaining why he needed to eat something - before he was face to face with the Russian in the kitchen.Well, nothing wrong with that, but he was just so long-winded.It is so boring because of all these long-winded explanation/thoughts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Odd","review":"I read this book before the first two and it kept me rivited to my seat through out the whole book.

As always with this author, it draws the reader in quickly and holds the reader in a tight grip. Yet unlike so many Koontz novels, it does so without gruesome or excessive violence. Most of the time, the violence is just around the corner, terrifying but out of sight. This makes it easy to read but still gripping, with many a comic relief passage thrown in. Well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dan Koontz' Brother Odd","review":"I have read all of Dean Koontz' novels and sorry to say \\"Brother Odd\\" was, by far, the worst. Although my goal is to read every one of his, it was a struggle getting through this one.

Sorry Dean, but you really didn't do well on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother UGH","review":"I would give \\" ODD THOMAS\\" 4 stars: solid characterization, solid fast paced plot. FOREVER ODD had fewer characters(and they were boring)and a much slower story (there really wasnt much of a story; ODD THOMAS walking around underground...wow). I would give FOREVER ODD 2 stars. BROTHER ODD fares slightly better than the second mainly because the second one was so boring it was easier to improve upon. There are more characters in BROTHER ODD and boy are they eccentric as always.UGH...I know Odd Thomas is special but does EVERYONE have to posses a special talent or a deformity? Boring plot about quantum mechanics mixed in with Dean's favorite subject God. The Odd Thomas story should be put to bed..its over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my my my, Brother Odd","review":"Well I am a great fan of Dean Koontz. I read almost all of his novels. I loved Odd Thomas, and I thought Forever Odd was good. Lots of action. The storylines follow along possible real-life events that may happen in this world. So when I found out that Dean Koontz wrote a third book I was very excited. I wondered what was going on in Odd's life now. However now that I finished the book, i am a bit disappointed.This is obviously my own opinion but it had too much Science Fiction. Too much Quantum Physics. Too many far-fetched ideas. The dialogue between Odd and the russian lasted too long about things that, for me, were a pain in the rear to follow. I know Odd needs to grow and his stories need to be different from the last to keep interest, but i say keep the story lines in the supernatural/real life arenas and not stray off to these science/physics stories where it's just too unbelievable.My advice, get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"With Koontz it's either hit or miss.A total waste of money on this tripe.Started to put it down several times but plowed on thru hoping it would get better.It didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well liked in an ODD Way","review":"Been an enjoyable book.

Forever Odd was OK. This book bites.

But I agree that Odd Thomas is one of his most beloved characters.In Brother Odd, Odd has checked himself into a monkery (I guess the PC term is monastery) in order to preserve his sanity - to take a break from the insistant spirits that crowd his life. Of course, Elvis goes with him. And, you guessed it - there are spirits there too. However, the spirits are the least of Odd's problems. The Bodachs are back & they're waiting for a catastrophic event. Odd has to figure out what the event will be, and how he can keep it from happening.With the help of several saintly & courageous nuns & monks, and a government agent or two, Odd is able to save the monastery's most vulnerable charges. He's also able to give Elvis some much needed counseling.I hope - just like every other Koontz fan - that we see Odd again, soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always been a fan of Odd!","review":"Of the many characters in the many contemporary books I've read over the last several years, Odd Thomas is probably the most unforgettable. Quirky, yet sincere. Gifted and cursed. Self deprecating and funny. Brave, even when he tells the reader he isn't. Someone who does what he knows he has to do, what he knows is the RIGHT thing to do, even though it may be the last thing he WANTS to do. We need more people like that in the world today.Koontz has always been a masterful storyteller, and the Odd Thomas books, including Brother Odd, are some of his best. Sometimes a bit predictable, other times with surprising twists, always a feast of words, I love the way Koontz can turn a phrase.I would definitely recommend reading the entire series of Odd Thomas books in order. Although each can stand alone, they are richer when you know Odd's history."},{"rating":"2","title":"The saga continues","review":"The Odd Thomas character continues to evolve and surprise. New dimensions are added to the principal players in this ongoing series. Conversations are quick and witty and Koontz's verbal paintbrush sets colorful and engaging backdrops for a fast paced story with plenty of unanticipated twists and turns. Recommended for any Koontz fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Odd Thomas adventure","review":"Dean will have another hit with Brother Odd, but neither Forever Odd or Brother Odd have the gripping impact of Odd Thomas. Any Koontz fan knows that Dean has taken to installing his primary characters with his own moral construction (which is typical of all authors). Sometimes his character's internal dialogue feels preachy, but not excessively so. Perhaps it only seems preachy because the same moral guides are used by every protagonist Dean has used for the last decade and when you read two books a year from him to get the feeling that you've already heard this so why is he stressing it again?But then, I keep buying his stuff and reading it so what can I say other than he continues to entertain me at the level I've come to expect from Dean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful characters, some heavyhanded religiosity","review":"Like everyone else here, I love the character Odd Thomas, and agree that this book is a vast improvement over Forever Odd. As good as the first in the series, Odd Thomas, imo. Odd is just so sweet and funny that it's really an uplifting read.I also enjoyed the other characters here. The plot was pretty good, albeit secondary in quality to the delightful characters.My only complaint? There's quite a bit of what comes across as proselytizing. \\"There's no way science can investigate the existence of God\\"...? That notion is laid on pretty thick, even taking into consideration the monastery setting.Nonetheless, it's quite a bit of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Unbelievable","review":"I read the first Odd Thomas book on a plane and liked it, so I started reading the series. The second book, Forever Odd, was not as good as the first but was still enjoyable and interesting. Brother Odd, however, is extremely slow. We are treated to exquisite detail about the most mundane actions, such as a monk frosting cakes and Odd Thomas dressing to go outside in a snowstorm. The dialog is ridiculous - no one speaks like the characters in this novel. Readers have to suspend disbelief when reading Odd Thomas books because of their fantastical nature, and the absurd dialog in this book jars the reader out of the fantasy. I already purchased the next book, Odd Hours. I hope that book is better than Brother Odd - if not, I will not be reading any more Odd Thomas books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddly lame","review":"Not worth the paper its printed on. Quantum claptrap already used in dozens of books.Really thin on character development and please, can someone smack Thomas out of his whining?I can't believe I will probably read the next one!! but nothing about dogs! enough of the golden retrievers already... about a Pitt or a Chihuaha?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother Odd -","review":"While the first Odd Thomas will go down as one of my favorite books, Brother Odd left me wary. Humorous at times and thoughtful the book makes promises but never delivers. If you build an army you must fight and the fight has to be explosive. It's like Dean Koontz is writing this stuff on a whim and chickens out at the end. Come on this is Dean Koontz, author of Intensity and Velocity let it rip man....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...Had higher hopes for this series","review":"Brother Odd is the third in the series of Dean Koontz's novel about a paranormal man. Personally I liked the series & character of Christopher Snow better, the man with a rare genetic disorder that leaves him vulnerable to light. Something about living your waking hours in the night in Moonlight Bay--wonderful supporting characters. Have read those 3 novels many times & enjoyed the writing every time. Anyway, I would rate the 1st 2 novels of Odd much higher than Brother Odd...seems like he was stretching both the plot & character of this book...beyond my interest level. Not sure if I'll bother rereading this one. Others may like but it's not up to Koontz's best standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"First and last Koontz book I'll read","review":"I got the audio version of this from the library, and it's my first exposure to Koontz' writing. It will be my last. I got so bored I stopped listening after about halfway through. The language is way too flowery and overly descriptive, at the expense of developing anything exciting or suspenseful. After all those chapters, all that had really happened was that Brother Odd had a premonition of a disaster at the monastery where he's living, and a monk has gone missing, presumed dead. The book just plods along as if you're going in slow motion, waiting for something interesting to happen. Koontz seems more interested in seeing how many different ways he can describe the ferocity of a blizzard that has been raging throughout the story than actually developing an intriguing plot. I kept telling myself come on, let's get on with it, but one can only take so much torture. Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this character!","review":"Just finished this last night, and I really loved it. There is a quality about \\"Oddie\\" that I find very refreshing. His shyness and humility possibly?I am also an avid Dean Koontz fan. I love his writing, and to be honest, Mr. Koontz and my other favorite writer, Mr. King have spoiled me for a lot of other writers.They really possess a certain quality in their writing that I can't explain.I am not very well-versed, nor would I be considered grammatically correct at any level, but I do know how much talent both these authors possess.Please continue this character Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz is a master literati with a great story","review":"Mf. Koontz didn't disappoiint me. He never does. This book is fantastic. It continues the story of Odd Thomas in the third book about him and each one gets better and better. A must read for all readers, not just Koontz fans. You can't call yourself a serious reader if you don't experience Koontz' mastery of the English language. It is entertaining in itself regardless of the book's subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Koontz Best","review":"How can you not Love Odd Thomas! This book was especially heartwarming. Even through all his terror, Oddie keeps his sence of humor. The characters in this book were especially endearing. Combine that with a dog and kids, what's not to love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Em Coming!","review":"Brother Odd lived up to and I think exceeded the other Odd Thomas books. It kept me turning the pages and neglecting my work until I could devour it all. The only problem with a wonderful page turner is figuring out what to read after you've zipped to the end. All I can say is keep em coming. As a general rule, books tend to peter out after the second sequel, but the Odd Thomas books just get better and better. I can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Odd","review":"With a touch of humor and the talent for bring his readers the surreal, Dean Koontz leads us through another adventure of Odd Thomas.

Odd is having trouble dealing with the events of the first novel (which strangely didn't seem to be a prob in Forever Odd) and has secluded himself in a monastery strangely filled with ex-action heroes.Not long into the piece (actually thats a lie the plot is a little slow starting) the troublesome Bodaks show up, and something a little more skeletal and sinister that Odd hasn't seen before.The storyline is pretty good, albiet the monks are hard to humanise, and being set in a place of God Koontz cannot hold back on his infuriating moralising. I had liked the Odd books as apparently free of Koontz's opinions but I guess I was wrong.Overall worth the read, and looking forward to Hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much, much better than Forever Odd","review":"I don't even remember what happened in Forever Odd but you will not soon forget the characters and plot of Brother Odd. Elvis has left the house and guess who showed up? You'll end up liking Odd Thomas again...he's just likeable. Worth the read in an interesting and unique setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Odd","review":"Having read all or almost all of Dean Koont'z novels, I was so excited when this came out. Odd is a great character and I'm glad we got to see him develop further. Rodion Romanovich's entry to Odd's life added to the suspense and excitement of this well done quick read. Everyone should read this But as a Dean Koontz fan no character is better than Chris Snow and his life with the dreaded XP. We need to hear more about Mr. Snow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revisiting a Great Koontz Character","review":"The third installment of the Odd Thomas series doesn't disappoint, and keeps readers turning the pages at a frenzied pace. Odd Thomas is an extremely likeable and well written character whose unique talents, and sarcastic wit will be sure to please most audiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Audio Series! David Aaron Baker is a wonderful narrator","review":"All three books are extremely well read by Mr. Baker - probably one of the best readers around - and having an interesting story to read only makes it better - Surely something to make your daily commute more enjoyable. The narrator of \\"Velocity\\" just doesn't give the same life to his character -though to be charitable that story is not told in the first person."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love Odd Thomas","review":"I fell in love with Odd Thomas with the first book. Now there are three and I loved all of them. Dean Koontz is one of my favorite, but he really got me with this character. I think it got to him, too, as Odd has grown and come back to us in two more books. Will there be more? I will be watching for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Odd","review":"This Third in the Brother Odd series, though initially lacking in suspense, proves to be another winner for DK. The writing quality as well as some of the humorous dialogue make this a very enjoyable read. What was really laughable was the images I pictured of Elvis. I look forward to the next in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all the love for this thing?","review":"Fanboy Syndrome?This has got to be one of the worst books I've read in 40 years.

He has the kind of quirks that many people in the real world have, with the exception of dealing with dead people of course. So unless you hang out with the guy on TV who talks to dead relatives of the audience, you might just enjoy the other quirks of the lovable Odd. Where I was ready to dislike this series as I didn't much care for the Chris Snow books, it was a pleasant surprise to find how much I enjoyed this one. I was slightly disappointed in his explanations of Quantum Foam and other Quantum issues but I was glad that it wasn't as tedious as the explanations used by Michael Crichton in some of his books. I would rather read Koontz' explanations even as bare bones as they are. This is a definite \\"pass it on book\\" that I will share with others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brother Odd","review":"One of Dean's best characters.

The surprise villian kept me curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"COME ON ODDIE!","review":"Alright, if you're reading this review, you've probably at least know of Odd Thomas, one of the best charecters that Dean Koontz has ever written. I won't get into all the details about how Odd sees dead people and Elvis is one of his best friends.I was somewhat disappointed with this book. I love the fact that Odd has always looked upon himself humbly with sometimes without awe at his ability to see the dead. But, this book was completely out in left field with the plot. It was suspenseful, I must admit that, but it also, in my modest opinion believe that it is the worst of the Odd series.I can only hope the next time we see Mr. Thomas and Boo (to be revealed in Brother Odd), there will be at least some sense to the evil doer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Odd Thomas bores me to tears. I had to force myself to finish these books (since I'd bought them) but couldn't get over how all the characters sound just alike. They all have the same sense of humor. I can't get a feel for Odd Thomas at ALL. Half the time he sounds sarcastic. Half the time he's this annoyingly respectful sounding guy. He just never comes to life.There's no cleverness in these Odd Thomas tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to finish","review":"I'm a big fan of Dean Koontz books, and was looking forward to another in the Odd Thomas series. However, I found myself getting bored, and had it not been for it being a Dean Koontz book about one of my favorite characters, I would have quit halfway through.I loved Boo the dog, but Elvis got old really fast. And the bone things just didn't seem realistic or even scary for that matter, just pedantic at best.I wish we could have Stormy back--at least that made Oddie more interesting...Here's hoping the next installment is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brother Odd","review":"I love Dean Koontz books and have read all of them but this is the worse.

I like this one just a little less than the second one, but it's still a great spectacle of bands, and really showcases some great talent. It has two Saves the Day B-sides (sweet!!!), and they both rock, especially \\"Sell My Old Clothes, I'm Off to Heaven.\\" The Reggie and the Full Effect song is pretty cool too.

Like most anime series, Loki does not so much end as stop, leaving the viewer wondering if there is a \\"Loki 2\\" in the works, but the anticlimactic ending is a typical anime malady, and the end-of-series let-down is not as pronounced in Loki as it is in other series."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small","review":"Although the price was reasonable, upon receiving it the size of the lettering was too small and would require a magnifying glass to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is just a map","review":"I was diappointed in this purchase.

The only problem is that it is so gigantic and awkward that it is somewhat hard to carry.I believe this toy is very educational. It will make you have excellent mental durability, as well as the ability to arrange and create.The overall sturdiness of the piece was good.

Or if the ear guard shifts, my ear is partially exposed and there is pressure on my exposed ear. This is unacceptable as it no longer has a function as an ear protector.I have modified the earguard making it super tight, snug, loose and nothing works to make the earguard fit well and not have issues above.Also, I purchased from Cannon Sports which takes too long to ship the product.

One gets the sense of people who have truly grown in charity. In contrast, books by ex-Catholics who have hived off into some shrunken little sectarianism (such as this book) are always filled to the brim with an endless litany of bitterness like the diary of a petulant teenager. One gets just the opposite sense that the person writing this has dried up into a hard little kernel of nastiness that can only do one thing: play the tape of his grievances against the Catholic Church again and again.

The albums relative shortness compared to his others is a product of the realing company (Varasee) not the composer. The score was quite good because it blended with the movie well. Themes throughout the score brought out the majestic openness of the sea and power of the sharks as well as the fear they envoked. Rabin's use of brass and choral sounds enhanced this effect. This is one of Rabin's better works because it was very effective in the film as well as making for good listening on CD. I recommend this if you liked his work on Armaggeddon or the works of Hans Zimmer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative!","review":"I've had this book for about a month or two and have learned much about my plants.

The back of the book has a list of all the genera as well as its species along with zones, light, sun, height, etc. for quick reference. The one thing I do not like, however, is that all the photos are listed in one section in the back of the book.

But this isn't one of Uncle Floyd's boring foreign films! The ending is rather open, and you find yourself thinking about these characters long after you've put the movie away.

I remember when I saw them at The Hammerstien Ballroom in New York. During the big internet buisness boom of 1999, Yahoo had done some big promotion with Smash Mouth and Lucious Jackson. Interns from Tweck.com (which is probably out of buisness by now)were handing out free cup warmers. The Hippos were so awful that the whole audience began to throw them at the band. The drummer was pelted and one of the warmers hit his snare drum. Seriously, if you like Ska music then please stick with the classics like the father of Ska, Prince Buster or Madness. If you want modern ska then check out Less than Jake, and Aquabats. Don't waste your time with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grew on me","review":"Let me start by saying that I used to see the Hippos play at local shows before they got picked up by Interscope. I had their first album, Forget the World, and loved it even though the production isn't top notch. For me, they have always been a credible band; not some manufactured big label band.When I first picked up this album (2 copies) when it came out, I played the CD a couple times and tossed it aside. It sounded too much like TMBG (They Might Be Giants) and it sounded too clean/overproduced.But over time, I find myself always coming back to this album when I want to feel good. When I want to be comforted by catchy sounds and the poppy lyrics.I can't seem to get songs like The Sand, Pollution, or Paulina out of my head, and sometimes I'll just CRAVE those songs.Give this album a whirl. It's a pity that the band broke up.Michel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good follow-up album","review":"I love a lot of the new songs, especially tracks 2,4,5,8,10,11.

This album doesn't have much of the cool percussions like their first one, \\"Forget the World.\\" But the melodies make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad band, bad CD","review":"Lol. One of my favorite quotes by Jesse Swann (See above review): \\"These words mostly sound like they're from the secret diary of a 12-year old boy who is starting to 'feel funny'about girls and wants to relay all the fun little games and inner feelings he has for that certain girl of his dreams to somebody.\\" I certainly agree with this. This band sucks. It is borderline, crappy ska that no one should purchase. However, it is borderline ska, so I have to give it two stars. One star is reserved for Green Day and rap. If you want to listen to ska, check out Ska Masta Skibz's lists. Those will help you get an idea of what good music is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Alright, the reason I didn't give it one star was because I have to much respect for their first album. The synthesizers make it sound horrible. That could be the reason no other ska bands use synthesizers. Wait...maybe thats the reason NO bands use sythesizers but techno bands. Anyways I heard a lot of hype about the Hippos for this album but I should have known that was cause the preppies were saying it. I think the hippos are one of those bands that people want to be good. This is my opinion so dont get all mad at me. Check out their first album, though, cause it's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy FORGET THE WORLD!","review":"I first heard the Hippos on their debut album \\"Forget the World\\" and I loved it. When I ran across this CD I expected the same great ska sound from the other but I was wrong. My favorite song by them Far Behind sounds like some little hip hop 80's remix with the synthesizer. I thought remakes were supposed to be better than the original. Though these guys are a great band and have great potential I would not recommend this CD it is not their best work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame 80s flock of seagulls garbage","review":"i absolutely loved their first CD, even if the topics were fairly juvenile (high school kid in love, getting a speeding ticket, etc.). i got this one and much of the ska sound from their first CD was replaced by cheesy 80s synthesizers.

It's not like what you'd hear on their first album, but it is very good. They experiment with the moog synth, which makes them sound like The Rentals and Fountains of Wayne. They start out with a great ska song, \\"Lost It\\", and from there, they get into their new sound. The second song as got to be the best song of the summer, \\"Wasting My Life.\\" The song I least like off of this album, but is good, is their cover to \\"Always Something There to Remind Me\\", but it is still very catchy. Here's the real secret to the new Hippos album, they found out how to write songs that are as catchy as hell. You'll probably be tapping to the sound even in your sleep. If you're into ska, but are tired of the same sounding ska songs, then definitely check out \\"Heads Are Gonna Roll.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome..","review":"This album is really great. It's very different from their first album, Forget The World, which I love.

So the other CD was better","review":"To be honest, when my friend first played this CD for me I thought it was of semi-decent quality. However, after subsequent listenings, I was suddenly amazed with the quality of THE HIPPOS second recording.

I loved them then, and I love them now. If you think this CD is awesome, go to a concert and REALLY experience all of it ... full force. They are great performers and talented musicians. They are definitely no \\"One-Hit-Wonder!\\" They are here to stay. I hope to hear some more material very soon. Oh and don't forget: All you Moffatts fanatics out there, keep on the look out for Ticket sales for their upcoming tour in the USofA with LFO! It's going to be the best ever! Hope to see ya there! And one more thing .... but this CD if yopu havent't, their music is great! Especially CRAZY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome ... GrOoVy Cd!!!!","review":"I absolutley love this Cd.

I just think, well it's a been done before i guess... it all sounds the some. they have a good mix of songs on the album though. But if you buy this cd and you do like it, check out Gil, I think he's very similar to the Moffatts, but I like him more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moffatts:not that bad","review":"The Moffatts are a new (hanson-like) group.Yet it doesn't even fathom me to compare them. The Moffatts seem to me to have more talent! They write there own music , unlike Hanson. To add to the pleasure of listening them they are all adorable (especially Dave, sorry I had to say something about him).They also have more class. There songs are ballads that are heartfelt and could make any girl cry. My favorite titles \\"love\\", it made me think of the best romance in the world,my boyfriend and me. Now if a song can make you hear and/or see things beyond the music that group has talent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i think this cd sucked","review":"the only good song is the first one,and they r hanson wannabes,becuz hansons cd is way beyyer"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another wanna-be boy band","review":"The cd is margenal at best.With the exeption of the song misery. Don't get me wrong now I like boy band as well as any teen-aged girl but these boys guys have a little two much soft lovly boy next door with a Aerosmith under tone (not to mention really bad hair! ) In all I just say that this group needs to find a style and stick too it for the most part. In stead of buying the cd I'll stick to getting there single next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP LISTENING TO THIS JUNK!","review":"It's rediculous to see that more than half of these reviews gave this CD 5 stars.

In my opinion they are a bad copy of my favorite group, Hanson. They just want to copy Hanson because Hanson become so sucessful in 1997. Like, they used to do country music, but now they're doing pop/rock just because of Hanson. And, they've said that Hanson should thank them for their sucess. I think not.Sorry, but the Moffatts are not for me. Hanson is. Besides, the Moffatts scare me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The #1 U.S. Moffatt Fan!","review":"This c.d. rocks!

However, this new US release is missing alot of good tunez! Dave's 'Now and Forever', my personal favorite \\"We are young\\" and the kewl \\"Girl I'm gonna get ya\\" !!! Bah! I'm sure these new tunez are gr8 too, so i suggest you buy both, but the original (an import for u american folk ;>) is the best! :> They should have released this as an all-new album with the name Chapter 2. Duh. :>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring except for 1 song.","review":"I found this CD very boring. At least, the Moffatts co-wrote a lot of the songs on Chapt.1. This is the only positive thing I can say about them.I only like Fustration, one of the two hidden songs of Chapt.1. I think the other songs are all very annoying and formulaic pop rock songs. Don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to Dance To. . .","review":"This CD was a disappointment. Their style is a copy of other artists I have heard such as Aerosmith.

It had lots of my favorite songs like \\"crazy\\", \\"if life is so short\\", and \\"miss you like crazy\\". They are an excellent group and DON'T SOUND LIKE HANSON AT ALL!!!!!!! They are good singers and are also very very cute!!! Danielle, Dave's number one fan CANADIANS ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection in music","review":"Everyone on earth should own this CD...I guarantee you won't stop listening to it! And don't pay attention to these people going on about Hanson, cos Moffatts have been around since 92 which is more than Hanson can say. These guys are the definition of talent and they will always be a strong force in music. Buy Ch.1!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2 all Moffatt lovers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"If any one who loves the Moffatts needs to read the reviews to see if they want to buy the album then they don't know the Moffatts too well cause they would never write something the fans don't adore!!!!!!!! Well that's what I think!!!!!! P.S. Buy this album I KNOW you will be impressed with their work!!!!!! And they aren't copying HANSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I would have to give this cd a two thumbs up!","review":"The Moffatts' new cd is awesome! Not only b/c I am one of their biggest fans ,but because they write their songs so well.I really get a message out of their songs unlike some artists who use obscene and cruel language. They also do a very nice job of performing these and other songs live.I think the Moffatts are a rising band and I wish them much success for years to come. The Moffatts will always remain #1 in my heart. ~*AMY*~"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is so cool.","review":"The first time I heard this CD I fell in love with it. There are so many types of music on it and I like every single song on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I only heard them sing once and I bought the cd. Wonder why? One day, I went to K-nmart, and they were performing. I loved them even before I heard them sing. I was just like any other moffatts fan: I wouldn't leave the store without their autographed poster. Hey, buy this cd, even if you've never heard of them before. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm impressed!","review":"The first time I saw the Moffatts was on \\"Good Morning America\\" in 1995.

Great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"totally awesome","review":"A while back, when the Moffatts first started touring and all here in the States, I wasn't exactly what you'd call a fan. But after a friend of mine started telling me about them, I just had to get the album, and I was so blown away! The guys are so talented, and the album has something for everyone on it. I listen to it all the time (in fact, I'm listening to \\"Crazy\\" right now!) and I highly recommend to everyone. And also, let me say that Hanson and the Moffatts are BOTH very awesome, to clear that up! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK People... not that great!","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think these guys are very talented but they need work! Maybe get a vocal coach to improve the \\"squeaks\\". I didn't like this CD much. They need to harmonize better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their new style is the new thing","review":"I have heard this cd probably over 100 times. I'm from Canada and they have released a copy of this cd similar to this in Canada but without a few of the songs. I can listen to this cd so many times because the music isn't boring, it's got so many little details that just make it neat. That's all I got to say, this cd is as good as it gets, can't wait for the next album"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the BEST","review":"I'm listening to my CD now-the cd is so good and they have their own style of music and are just awesome. They've been out along time and personally i don't like country-but this isn't country its just awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The're TOTALLY coping Hanson!!!","review":"This cd is OK, but all the songs are about love! That's kinda annoying. Plus, they are totally coping Hanson's act because they think it will make them popular because of all the Hanson fans out there. That makes me mad (because I am like the biggest Hanson fan ever- well maybe not ever...) and if that's really why they did that, there's nothing I can do but say it's kind of annoying. This cd is not my favorite, but it isn't all that bad. So if ya want this cd, buy it, but there's other music out there that you might like more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best CD's my ears have had the pleasure 2","review":"Moffatts: I loved this album.

Although every song on here is about love, I still enjoy it. If you like Hanson, this CD is definitely for you! It blew me away how much Scott and Ike Hanson sound alike. My favs are \\"Until You Loved Me\\", \\"Misery\\", \\"Miss You Like Crazy\\", and \\"Written All Over My Heart\\". Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They are extremely talented...","review":"I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got it, but I absolutely love the music.

I definitly give this cd 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Moffatts ROCK!!!","review":"This is the best CD I ever bought. It's the only CD I own where I like EVERY SINGLE SONG. I'm a long time fan of The Moffatts and their music seems to get better with every album they put out. There is a song on Chapter 1 for everyone. The Moffatts are my new favorite band and I can't wait to see them live. If you only get one CD this year, it should be this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I had never heard the Moffatts before I went to JCPenny. The store was giving away free Moffatt cd's so i took one. I absolutely fell in love. At the first chance i got the cd. I fell in love even more. This is an amazing band it is definately NOT a boyband. I was really amazed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing, compelling, a great series.","review":"The premise seems simple enough. Take a single mom, throw in some mutant monsters, an ancient powerful weapon, and a tooth-achingly sweet daughter who is in many ways far more mature than her mother. Add a bit of violence, some well delivered one-liners, and fan-service (oh boy do you get some great fan service here!) and its destined to be great.I am not a great fan of dubbing, most dubs I have seen seem off. The voices don't fit the character or there just seems to be a lack of emotion on the part of the voice actor, but this series is different. Whether its Rihoko's sweet voice, Masane's somewhat childish banter, or Marry's distinctly gravely, almost female impersonator, voice they all seem to gel well in these first 4 episodes. In fact that's the only thing I didn't like about this buy. Volume 1 is only 4 episodes! It leaves you hungry for more so fast, the first four barely scratch the surface of what you can tell will be a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"This DVD is just as good as the first. Really enjoy the series. Will be purchasing the remaining discs soon. Unfortunately, the special edition light up/theme song DVD case did not work. The batteries were probably dead by the time it arrived."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still an all time favorite!","review":"For some reason, Speed Racer stands out as one of my all time favorite cartoons from the 70's.

Although a little pricey, I think they're worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing small!!!!!","review":"These targets are about 5\\" x 5\\" overall. WAY TOO SMALL. These target makers all exaggerate these descriptions to make you think you are getting more target than you get! MAKE SURE YOU READ EVERYTHING IN THE DISCRIPTION!

Target advertisers should be required to provide an overall GROSS target size FIRST before they talk about the targets sizes that are provided on the gross target size!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to shoot","review":"They're targets. You buy them to shoot holes in them and then throw them away. Not a lot to say except they are fun to shoot at. If you're shooting 22's you can easily see the holes. If you shoot larger caliber guns it's real easy to see. My wife loves shooting at the little dots in the corners, that also peel off. They splat also. So she says. I've never hit one..

GIven that you know you're going to put all your shots into a 3\\" circle at 50', why hang a 12\\" target that you're going to replace after a dozen shots? I paste up 9 of these on a backing at my club, and I have 9 targets x 10 shots minimum before changing targets. For pistol, I use them at 50' and 25 yards. Air rifle, up to 50 yards. And for a scoped .22 rifle, I use them at up to 100 yards. With an 8x scope on my .22, I can easily see the hits on each target at that distance. At less than 8 cents a target, these are a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great targets","review":"Small enough to test your skills. Makes it easy to see your results down lane.

However, I took them to the range along with what I had left of my other targets, and proceeded to fall in love with them.I start out the day by putting out a couple of typical splatter targets. The ones I use have 5 bullseyes on them. Then when the ceasefire is called, and I'm done feeling bad about the groups I printed, I just stick these little guys over the shot up ones centers of the targets and dot the stray holes caused by my abysmal marksmanship.If you're a halfway decent shot, and using a rifle, 3\\" is all you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is getting embarassing!","review":"Well....another flailing attempt to keep the Empire Brass afloat.

It's hard to believe that just 10 years ago, you were all BU students and now you ARE the Empire Brass and Rolf is very obviously simply along for the ride.In my opinion, the last three Empire Brass albums are complete garbage.

It fails, in my mind, because the author simply doesn't succeed in making me care very much about Joy's and Henry's views on marriage as an institution. If you like this type of genre, there are much better books out there. This one left me looking for the next chapter for a more satisfying ending - there wasn't one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Surprise","review":"Although Wedding Season is witty and smart and has enough laughs to go around, there's a quiet poignancy that sneaks up on you and makes this book worth your attention. The protagonist has constructed this protective edifice of belief around herself, and Cosper orchestrates events so that they keep challenging and prodding Joy's world until a deeper truth is revealed. The book sneaks up on you with a quiet accumulation of telling details which add up to a complicated, humane and real character - just as it does in life! Ignore the naysayers below - I don't know what book they were reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull & disappointing read...","review":"This is the first book in a while that I've been less than impressed with. I was glad to finish it so I could move on to something else. It is very obvious that this is the author's first work...at times the working is confusing and because of that, it is often unclear who is speaking. There are WAY TOO MANY characters in the book, many with little or no importance to the bigger story. She provides too much detail, it seems the first half of the book was dedicated to building the plot - too much! Ultimately I was quite bored with this one and am glad to be done with it...I won't even mention the less than impressive ending!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Joyless","review":"This book was pretty boring. Joy, the heroine, was annoying. Her boyfriend, Gabe (as mentioned below) was never really developed into a true character. Many of the minor characters were obnoxious. Joy was way too caught up on her principles to enjoy life. The premise of this book was great. I enjoyed the frantic pace of the weddings coming right on top of each other, but I could not get over Joy (or Joyless as one of the people in the book called her). The only redeeming part of the book were the weddings, and a mildly amusing episode of dress confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Library Loan, not a Buying Book","review":"I actually borrowed this book because I'd heard about the ending and was interested to see how the author handled it.It's not awful but it could have been SO much better. It's an interesting premise but the heroine's situation (17 weddings in six months) and dilemma are rather contrived and the author went through contortions to get to her chosen ending. The characters (far too many) are mostly stock creations and hard to care about, and Cosper obviously never heard of the maxim \\"show, don't tell.\\"It's a fair first novel but I agree with other reviewers that her editors should have sent it back for a few more revisions. Jane Austen (or even Austen-like), it is not.Bottom line, it's a light read for when you don't want to have to think too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Divorcing this book before the honeymoon","review":"I am adding this book to my personal worst list. I had such high expectations and it definately didn't live up to any of them. If you are expecting a fun, chaotic, spoof on courtship, engagement, wedding planning, and marriages forget it. I was truly so disappointed in Joy, she was a kill joy. The reason why I gave the book one star was for Gabe. The only likable character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book for a book club. Although it is outside my usual areas of interest, I was ready to be entertained and/or enlightened.I did not really enjoy this book. I found the main character unsympathetic, and there were too many peripheral characters. The plethora of peripheral characters made it hard to keep them all straight and also prevented the author from fully developing them, so they all ended up seeming very two-dimensional.Also, I disliked the ending. I felt that the author lost interest in her book just prior to the last two chapters (as had I) and made a desperate attempt to wrap things up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish reading it!","review":"Don't waste your money on this book. Don't even waste your time picking up a copy at the library. The characters are over the top and the author's writing style is cumbersome. It's one of the few books I couldn't bring myself to finish reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapola","review":"I gave this book every chance to interest me, but gave up by page 100. What a pretentious load of junk. I must be getting old...who are these characters the author writes about? Probably the artsy crowd I avoid at all costs. I hated this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly wordy and not at all amusing","review":"This book was terrible. What appears to be a lighthearted book is in fact completely a chore to finish. The main character was hard to like, confusing and overall extremely wordy. The only reedeeming quality was the best friend of the protagonist, Henry, was refreshing and frank and the only honest person in the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!!","review":"I could barely stomach getting through this book. The author is so worried about sounding intellectual that she made a barely readable book. Of course, the ending was unexpected, and would have been an interesting ending if there was really any revelation behind it. Okay, I get it, Joy doesn't like marriage, but they never really give any substantial or understandable reason for her belief. The characters were either over the top or had no personality, not to mention there were about a hundred too many with about seventeen different unresolved subplots. Stay away from this book- unless you want a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever","review":"Please people, don't waste your time or money on this piece of drivel. I was so excited to read it because I was a bridesmaid in six weddings last summer, so I thought it would be something great I could relate too. However there are too many characters in Joy's little gaggle, none of whom are developed enough for you to make any sense out of it. Thought it had a bad ending, didn't think Joy was a realistic character with realistic motivations. And did Hank and Miss Trixie bother anyone else? I mean there are two gay characters that I think the author just threw in there to have token gay characters that she decided she needed to have in there when she was brainstorming the story early on with her editor. It sounded to me like she had never met an actual gay person in her life from how overly stupid and animated these characters were. Awful, awful, awful book! I want the part of my life back that I wasted on reading this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The main character is this book's biggest flaw","review":"The good points of this book -- good writing in places; interesting descriptions of the various weddings; and a really fascinating job that I wish I'd thought of (an anonymous free-lance writing firm called Invisible Inc). Bad points -- WAY too many characters to keep track of; overly-colorful secondary characters that are so exaggerated they're stereotypes; and an annoying, neurotic heroine. This last is what will probably keep me from attempting this book again. It's impossible to enjoy a book when you have so little sympathy for the main character. It should be possible to be against marriage for whatever reasons without judging other people who are not against it and making their lives totally miserable along with your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this book but couldn't","review":"I will say upfront that I love chick lit and I really wanted to like this book. However, the Wedding Season was a 330-page disappointment.The characters were alternatively cardboard or unlikable and I thought that none of the situations, conflicts, or tensions were developed enough so I actually cared.The two worst things about the book were the passive aggressive nature of our heroine as it related to the villianess and the \\"I just believe in marriage too much\\" epiphany. The whole thing was just a little too much to take.Read Bridget Jones Diary again. It's a better use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is garbage. I agree with one of the other reviewers on this one: I'm glad I didn't buy it. I was intrigued by the premise of the book (17 weddings in 6 months) and was interested in what the main character (a successful career woman who is anti-marriage) would learn or what opinions she would develop after going through that many weddings. The author did not even scratch the surface on the character's introspection. What does the main character learn out of this whole fiasco? Heck if I know. And the ending was a complete disappointment.The diversity of the characters are interesting but the author doesn't spend any time on making them real or to help the reader get to know the characters. They're just scattered all over the place. The dialogue is atrocious. The author tries to be too witty, dramatic and \\"funny\\" by making her characters speak English in a way that no one does. It's so fake. Who actually speaks and acts like that?All in all, an awful book and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it...i really did!!!","review":"I really wanted to like this book...but by page 51...my interest was totally gone. I never bothered to finish it. It was stuffed full of characters whom i felt had no personality and everything was too confusing to keep track of. I think I'd better stick to Rachel Gibson, Barbara Bretton and Nora Roberts...they hold my interest FAR better! Maybe I'm just not a marriage-material girl!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious","review":"Darcy Cosper is a thinker not a writer. She gets so caught up in Joy's principles that she neglects the plot. Though she does have some insightful thoughts on the institution of marriage in todays society, she forgets to resolve anything in her book. Joy's stance on marriage is obviously derived from her parents divorce. What happens between Joy and Gabe? More importantly what about Joan? I would have liked to see more of what happened to her and her pathetic excuse for a husband. And Chris? unresolved. When writing a book it is in my opinion that you resolve or at least explain the problems of the characters thoroughly. Obviously Darcy Cosper is more intersted in getting her own opinions across than writing a story. She should be writing for newspapers and magazines. she should not be writing books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a lot better...","review":"I am so disappointed by this book. By the time I hit page 15, I felt like I'd read at least 100 pages. It's such a shame, since the plot has the potential to be really really funny. Instead, the book is really really wordy -- so wordy that it almost feels like you're reading a college lit book. Too bad the Shopaholic Lady didn't think of this book first -- I'm sure she would have did a lot better job. Reader beware..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough already","review":"Enough already with the author's and the publisher's blabbering on about the Jane Austen connection. This is not at the level of Jane Austen. I don't think Jane Austen could have stomached observing this world. And Jane Austen was a true talent. There is a fair amount of pretention to the writing, and perhaps too much flattery given to the airhead fluttering about Manhattan with a martini in her hand, pretending to be Deep and Smart. Yes, there is a bit too much effort showing in the writing...especially in terms of the attempts to be Deep and Smart. And Witty. And Philosophical. And just so Clever. Who are these people writing the rave reviews? The author? The agent? The agent's and the author's friends?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wedding Season","review":"With tight, honest dialogue and a swift pace, Cosper's novel is one to savor. The story's success is a balancing act between true reflection upon the rites of passage of engagement and marriage and sheer hilarity. Joy Silverman is a 21st century Jane Austen character with a bite! Wedding Season is a terrific summertime read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"I was so excited to read this book, and I couldn't even make it past page 30!! It is SO LONG and SO BORING! Half the time you can't even keep up with the characters, let alone who is male and female. The author is way to wordy and jumps around too much. It was a good idea for a book, however, the author just doesn't know how to write. Stay away unless you need a lot of sleep!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the last review is much better but read this one too, ok?","review":"Violent Religion has a pretty good variety of sounds and I've become addicted to all of them. There are crunchy guitar songs and catchy catchy pop songs that you'll be humming for days. There's also much more dreary stuff; Tyson sings in the song Violent Religion: \\"She lost it all on a whim, and for reference's sake we'll call that whim...him.\\" My favorite is still She's Gone Mad. After you've listened to the rest of the album, wait until no one else is around and it's very quiet. Turn up your stereo and put on She's Gone Mad and just let Tyson's amazing voice surround you. You'll see why I like it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd swings!","review":"If anyone knows swing it's Ray Anthony.From Glenn Miller's trumpet section, at age 18, to the present,he,probably better than anyone appreciates the \\"new\\" popularity of swing. The album features clean phrasing and a great ensemble blend. Every section has all-star players. \\"Route 66\\", \\"Opus One\\" and \\"Swing-A-Ding-Ding\\" are highlights. Vocalists Madeline Vergari and Patrick Tuzzolino are both very good. A nice mix of old and new tunes. Ray's trumpet is as rich as ever. Lead man Rick Baptist heads a dynamite trumpet section. This band is tight! Ray, go ahead and start on Swing Club II."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST RAY ANTHONY CD EVER........","review":"I have been a Ray fan for many decades but I am very disappinted in this cd. To begin with Ray took the piano out of the rhythm section. Then he tried to put a lot of vocals in. Then he took the melody out of the music.

After six months of use - mostly for childrens videos, the playback quality deteriorated - even on brand new tapes, and after several cleanings. Now, a tape will not eject, and that malfunction has caused the entire unit to shut down. So, now I have a brand new tape stuck in the slot, my kids' favorite DVD is stuck in the other drive, and we have to take it in to retrieve our media. What a pain. Now I have read the reviews here, and I realize this product is lousy. Bad choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Older Version of DVD/VCR Combo Works Great","review":"I have had the 1st generation of this product, the SD-V280A, for over 2 years now. It is used up to 5 times a day, 7 days a week, on both the VHS & DVD sides.The only problem I have had with it is that the DVD door doesn't open fast enough (for me anyway!). I work at a small town store that sells these units and we rarely get a complaint. The store owner refuses to carry crappy merchandise and we encourage our customers to let us know if they have a problem with anything we sell.If there were no bugs in the 1st generation, why would there be in the next? I have no problem with any kind of tape, pre-recorded or home-made (and I have HM tapes that are over 15 years old).I have no problem recommending Toshiba products of any kind.

I was worried that I would be compromising the VCR performance and features with a combo unit. The Toshiba V290 exceeded my expectations. The DVD, of course, works perfectly with great picture quality. The VCR slow motion, freeze frame and overall playback is very good quality. The display includes time remaining, time used, tape speed, and current time/date. The timer works perfectly. Instruction manual is 46 pages long (all in English), very complete and understandable. The remote control looks expensive - has 4 nice big buttons for the most frequently used functions. Why not 5 stars? The VCR tuner could be a little better. Some cable channels do not appear as clear as the I get thru the cable box.

Sometimes the machine would simply not record when it was supposed to; other times it would not turn off after it was finished recording.Also, the timer recording screen was very tedious to use.Amazon.com makes returns extremely easy, so I did not get stuck with a unit that I might have otherwise been forced to send to a service center and wait who knows how long to get repaired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Hi,I purchased the Toshiba SD-V290 DVD/VCR Combo for $136.94 on8/27/03.

Very little actual information about the actual album. I couldn't even force myself to finish the book, for fear it would taint OK Computer for me forever. What disappoints me most about this book is that someone at the publishing company actually read and APPROVED it!!

Where 33 1/3's XO brought a new level of depth to the Elliott Smith album of the same name within pages, the entirety of this book passes with only a few, if any, eye opening ideas. There are pages and pages where the write casually describes things that are not only obvious, but can very easily be learned by half-halfheartedly looking on wikipedia.Without a central thesis or thematic arguments, the book never builds beyond a few decent observations (There's literally a line that goes \\"In conclusion... OK Computer is a diverse collection of songs...\\" Really.); however, any Radiohead novice looking to pick up a few insights might enjoy this as a decidedly light and casual read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think Dai Griffiths Might Have Managed to Ruin My Favorite Album","review":"Just a horrible book.

As a previous reviewer said he spends more time on the album's one misstep \\"Fitter Happier\\" than any other track.

So little time is spent talking about A) The Music B) The Musicianship & C) The Themes of the album that I really wonder how this series can justify calling this a book about OK Computer.

Once the reader has labored through all the un-needed minutae the author thought was pertinent for the reader to understand the story of how \\"OK Computer\\" came to be, it's all academic.

Just do not listen to it with any pre-conceived notons of the 80's Tull or the 70's Tull or whatever. Listen to every track as if it was the first song that you ever heard. You WILL BE AMAZED. But I feel the music is the medium for the message and this albumn has amused me,enriched me and enlightened me. A personal note to Ian: Sometimes the parables are merciless but we boys won't go home until you hit the last note."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Ian, you should'nt have!","review":"Thank you Ian for the wonderful gift. Dot-com is much more than I expected. You are far too generous! Most men your age usually give the gift of I wish I was young again, those were the good old days crap. You move on not living in the past but, building upon it. A beautiful record!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Anderson Does It Again!","review":"Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull have done it again. For all you Tull fans (and you know who you are), this collection will not disappoint. Ian Anderson continues to compose music and write lyrics in his own style without regard for what is currently the sound or style. This collection contains licks familiar to Tull fans as well as new sounding material. Songs like Spiral, Bends Like a Willow, A Gift of Roses, and Far Alaska will certainly please the Tull officionados. The more you listen, the more you like it. Listen carefully to the mastery of his lyrics and the signature mixing of the music. For four decades Ian Anderson has reined supreme. I can't wait for the next concert!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Work for Jethro Tull","review":"This is (so far) the latest Jethro Tull album and it is one of their greatest. Ian Anderson writes some beautiful music and places in some great flute work in the songs. Many critics consider this album to be a blending of the different sounds of Tull throughout the years, and I have to agree. Amazingly, this combination works extremely well. On one album you have the range of rock, blues, and ethnic sounds. Great tracks to check out are \\"Spiral,\\" \\"Dot Com,\\" and \\"Hunt by Numbers.\\" If you're a fan of Jethro Tull, or are first starting to listen to the group, pick up this album and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Jethro","review":"What is the magic of Jethro Tull?

Now that both have gone into recession his appeal is similar to that of a maggot festooned cheese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Know when to fold 'em","review":"It pains me to write this. I have been a rabid Tull fan since 1971. I've never missed a show, but now this. When I think of the genius of Passion Play, Songs From the Wood, I'll even give Crest of the Knave a nod, but the albums have gotten more and more tired.I so would love to hear our Jethro Tull come back. I will miss all the shows, and joy Tull has brought into my life, but this album is what it is. The sounds of a truly tired band.I grieve the loss of the greatist progressive/rock band of all time, and that band is and always will be Jethro Tull....just not this effort. This is truly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great band, but a weak effort...","review":"Jethro Tull is one of the best bands of all time, but J-Tull Dot Com is their weakest effort since the putrid Under Wraps way back in 1984. As always the instrumental work is strong, but the lyrics in most of the songs are ludicrous. \\"Hot Mango Flush\\", I believe the first song written by guitarist Martin Barre, is an embarrassment. \\"Spiral\\", \\"AWOL\\", and \\"Far Alaska\\" are decent songs, but if you're looking to get into Tull or if you don't have much of their classic material I recommend Thick as a Brick, Minstrel in the Gallery, Stand Up, or any of their other gems from 1968-1978."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jethro Dull","review":"I consider myself excessively forgiving when it comes to Jethro Tull. I can usually find things to like in mediocre Tull records like \\"Heavy Horses\\", \\"A\\" or \\"Catfish Rising\\". \\"Roots to Branches\\", their last effort -- though I get the impression I was one of twenty people who bought it -- was actually pretty good. \\"J Tull Dot Com\\" is not. I have spun it several times, hoping to find that I was missing something. I wasn't. It's evident that Anderson still has a way with words, although he seems hard put to find anything to write about. His singing is mild. The music is tepid. Uninspired and uninspiring. A pity. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the old tull, Not the New Tull -- Somewhere in between","review":"It is worth buying. It has some flavour of old Tull and new Tull. \\"El Nino\\" is a fantastic showcase for Barre. All this talk about \\"Hot Mango Flush\\" is pretty much unfounded. It is an odd track, but quite listenable. All in all it is good to see these seniors still pumping it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"thank goodness","review":"Last night I was browsing in cd store and came across the new Tull cd. Afew weeks ago when I placed an order the cd had not been released. If I had ordered it then it would have delayed the order so I passed it over.

A joy to behold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready to die!","review":"After enduring Hot Mango Flash, and barely comming out of the experience sane, I felt the remainder of my fortitude would help me navigate through the typhoon of scum and floatsom, that comprise the lyrics of this album, but then came Mango Surprise and now I have degenerated into a level of existance far below that of a feral primate!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Click","review":"I am a loyal fan of Jethro Tull but I just didn't click with this album.

Hot Mango Flush almost killed my goldfish."},{"rating":"1","title":"J-Tull Dot.Com--Nothing to \\"e-mail\\" home about.","review":"I actually like the bonus track best on this album. Ian Anderson IS Jethro Tull, so I don't know how/why he puts out \\"solo\\" records under his own name instead of just recording as Tull. But it's there after \\"A Gift Of Roses\\" and it is quite good. \\"Spiral\\" is the typical opening rock track we have come to expect from Tull, and \\"Dot.Com\\" has been in my head all day...\\"I'll be yours, dot.com\\" is catchy. The album is reminiscent of \\"Roots To Branches.\\" I just wish Ian played more accoustic guitar on the album. It seems the flute is utilized too much and sounds forced on some tracks. Overall, this album is listenable and not half bad. I would like to see the band rock a bit more though. So, when is Ian's new album coming out...based on the bonus track, I have higher expectations for that one than the Tull release."},{"rating":"2","title":"1999 Grammy Award Winner: Best Heavy Metal Artist","review":"This isn't heavy metal any more than Crest of A Knave was, but it still makes Metallica look like a bunch of squires. It breaks my heart that more people my age don't listen to the brilliance of Jethro Tull (I'm 25). Ian Anderson appears to be a bottomless pit of great songs. This C.D. sounds as fresh and enthusiastic as ones they recorded twenty years ago. I think I like this lineup as much as those heralded rosters of the seventies, too(Barlow,Evans,Hammond,Palmer etc.). I also must say that Martin Barre puts on a clinic for other guitarists on this one: \\"How to tastefully rock like hell\\". The thing I like best about this and most of Jethro Tull's C.D.s is that they don't bore me after a few listens. They contain so many subtleties that they improve with each listening. In my humble opinion, Jethro Tull sound checks sound better than most music that came out this year. So buy four copies and give one to each of your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"The musical equivelent of Ecoli","review":"I just read your review(you know who you are)and your metaphor is flawed. If listening to J-tull.com is like eating a thirteen course meal and one or two courses are the equivelent of ingesting an Ecoli infested mango, it's unlikely you will live to savour the final course. It also may be that the Ecoli infested mango will leave a bad taste in your mouth, which will in turn sour you towards fruit in general; all that remains: an embittered husk of a gourmand"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Lord, please make the pain stop!","review":"I thought that Hot Mango Flush was by far the worst song they ever wrote, until I heard its degenerate son, Mango Surprise. I agree with Ian Anderson that his dog-eared years are here. He should realize that he has scraped the bottom of his musical barrel, and he is feeding us the rotting dregs. After the experience of buying this album, I will most likely become a recluse, or become feral."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's been done","review":"Not much new here, a lot of flute playing and a lot of interesting music. The problem is, is that it's nothing new and therefore is not that interesting. You can pretty much buy any latter day Tull cd and get the same feel. If you like that about the band, then by all means, get this cd. Frankly, I expect more from such a talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"appreciate Wicked Windows","review":"Let me tell you something. The lyrics / the song/the trip of the song that is \\" Wicked Windows \\" is a milestone in frankness and a true revelation concerning the Illuminati and the Elite that Run this World. So eloquent and privy of Ian to shed light on this subject, in a real, see it as the Man feels it way. There are Beasts in this world, and the Ultimate Beast is here and growing .. this song lends you into his mind. ROCK ON."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"I too saw Jethro Tull (wed. Sep. 29) and it was awful!! They played 90 percent new stuff, wich I might add, is terrible. I do not own this cd, but have heard most of the songs and am glad I decided not to buy it. What happened to Ian Anderson's voice? Maybe it has been this bad for a while, but I only listen to the old stuff. He sing's like a 12 year old girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Tull getting younger ? LOL","review":"I agree with the rest of you - this one's a winner. Strongest tracks are Spiral,Dot Com, Awol,Hunt By Numbers,El Nino, Far Alaska,The Dog Ear Years, and A Gift of Roses. Hey ! thats 8 songs !! whaddya know.. the new bassist is very good and fits in Tull like super glue. Ian's voice does indeed sound good and all the music is impressive. You have to wait about 30 seconds after the CD is done to hear the bonus track, its not on the CD list of songs, but its there. I liked it too, quite nice. I havent heard Ian sound as downright NASTY as in Hunt By Numbers ! and Martin's riff is simply BALLISTIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"soundsgood","review":"so far what ive heard sounds great i have yet to to find a song from tull i didnt like i was surprised to find another new cd from tull i am always looking jethro tull is by far the best rock group to come along they are always full of surprises"},{"rating":"2","title":"All the elements are still there after 30 years.","review":"Jethro Tulls most intriquing album in years. Even, Mango Flush, the weirdest Tull creation ever will have you talking which is proably Anderson.s motive in that strange brew. Lets face it, there is nothing more baffling than the sound of a 50- something Englishmen doing a folky rap tune. As for Anderson's voice, it has more texture to it than in any album since when his throat problems occured after Under Wraps. The flute is used to perfection in this album as is Martin Barre's electric guitar. Take away any human voice and you would still have an album worth listening to. How many rock bands could say that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad attempt by an old band","review":"So JT is now trying to cash in on the latest trend of the internet..

DO NOT BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfaction guaranteed","review":"Well, well yet another Tull album. How do they do it, one asks? Having been an ardent Tull supporter from the early days (circa Stand Up), I can honestly say there are few artists from whom I have derived so much listening pleasure over the years. Having declared my allegances, it must be said that Dot com does not stand amongst Tull's finest, but does this matter - I think not. There are some eminently hummable tunes on this album, and Martin Barre's guitar continues to embellish, as always. My overall rating stems from gratitude. Gratitude to Ian and the boys for being motivated to craft together yet another album for our listening pleasure. Thanks Ian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teeny Tiny and expensive","review":"This is not a book. This is a very short pamphlet for a lot of money (compare to almost any other of the books on blackjack).

I have had the LP box set of this survey of world singing for many years and it, plus Volume 4 (which is on the EMI label on 7 cds) gives a fantastic summary of the greatest singers of the first half of the 20th Century. They are divided by singing category -- from soprano through to bass -- and Testament, which has done a great job in bringing from darkness some of the gems of the EMI back-catalogue, have brought us here one of the greatest singing compilations ever assembled.

I have fixed this by holding it in the frame with rubber bands. It gets the job done but should I be using rubber bands to hold together the product!! Very poor quality.I have e-mailed the company and they never responded.When the units finally die I will be getting a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Menards is cheaper and better quality","review":"I bought a few pair of these here and noticed the wick is not really adhered properly to the frame.

HIGHLY disappointing. There may be folk who like this, but I'm not one of them. Coverage is average for a sheer, prone to streaking. It doesn't chip too quickly.But if you really /must/ have such a meh nude tone? You can get roughly the same color with Sally Hansen's \\"Shall We Dance?\\"[That's in their \\"Complete Salon Manicure\\" line. Oddly, it's LEAGUES better.

It looks like pink, with a hint of tan, maybe a light mauve, and has a slight shimmery iridescence to it...no pearl & not exactly a matte finish either. However, when I apply it, it is a very, very sheer pink, looks like it has a matte finish with a tiny bit of iridescence. I apply at least 3 coats to get the coverage I prefer. I like the fact that there's no pearl in it, but wish the iridescence showed up more than it does.

Bears the Mary Gaitskill seal of approval, always a bad sign. Features menus as chapter headings, another bad sign. Ends abruptly indicating the writer lost interest, a good sign. I lost interest, too, but sooner than the writer. Brevity works to the book's advantage, though. Yeah, it's still a yawn and a waste of time, but at least this careless tome can be read in the hour it takes to watch a piglet battle on Iron Chef.

Because I really like some of HP products, especially HP has been in ADF scanner business for so many years.So I went ahead and bought a HP 5550C with thoughts that I (as a computer professional with 12 experience and a former HP employee) can manage to make it work.But clearly I'm wrong, and so wrong that the 5550C software is by far the worst software I have ever seen!!! I really do not understand that why HP even bothers to release this product to market, and HP should really \\"fire\\" the software team and the QA team for doing nothing but damaging its reputation.I agree with other reviewers completely.

The software is worse than bad. I too could not believe the other reviews and wanted the ADF so bought it anyway. Normally, HP does quality work, but not this time.If HP had any decency, they would create a new version of the software and release it to the owners of this product along with an apology. In my many years of work in the information technology sector and considering the current state of technology, I cannot remember a product this poor from a major vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Hardware Software Stinks","review":"The software that comes with this scanner is so bad you will wonder how it was ever shipped. Just awful. I spend four hours at various times trying to get it to run with Paperport. Completely incompatible. All I want is to scan pages into PDFs at 300 dpi in black and white using Paperport. It can not do this simple task. If you use its own software for scanning the results are even worse.

I have finally reached my limit of frustration and will be returning this poor example of a scanner.The Customer Service people are extremely polite, however, unable to understand the problem presented. I found most of them to be almost incompitent. Additionally, when I was connected with a sales person to help me determine a more reliable scanner that I should purchase, I found that once again, they were unable to respond to the questions presented to them.

Physically the two scanners are identical on the feature set and form factor down to the buttons and hinges. The difference is that the 5590 comes with HP director software version 2.5. The 5550 uses version 2.0. The HP scanning software 2.0 does not load completely on windows 2000 precluding access to adjustments in scanning settings and changes in the default settings. Getting it to work at all took hours and each scan had to be have settings individually set up for an office trying to automate record keeping. What a waste of time and money.

Hamelin is pianism of the first order, busily and sometimes poundingly accompanying the full orchestra through an unusal 8-part \\"concerto,\\" a daunting 72 minute Herculean opus. After several listenings I still haven't grasped the themes or larger architecture of this lyrical work, a great wall of sound; it would probably take many more. It seems a generaly upbeat paean to civilization (clearest in the text of the men's chorus), with no hint of the dissolution to come in WW I. However, there is no attempt to imitate or suggest the musics of the three ancient civilizations Busoni invokes (in his frontispiece drawing) as the architectural underpinnings of this sprawling work. The notes (written in 1958) are extremely detailed, but would be more comprehensible if keyed to the timings of each long and busy movement (10-23 min each, slightly faster than \\"usual\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull & Uninspired Work played with cool pianism","review":"I bought this cd excited by ecstatic reviews like \\"as if Mahler wrote piano concerto\\" or \\"super human virtuoso.\\" It turned out to be a disappointment. The work is one huge mass of uninspired themes and developments. It is an offence to Mahler to compare this dull piece to his great creations.Hamelin's playing has amazing precision and ease, but somehow lacks fire and grandeur of the Russian masters. Critics are lavish in praising Hamelin's 'super-human' technique, but listen to young Rubinstein playing Villa-Lobos or Richter's early recordings of Prokofiev or Liszt concertos (Urania). Hamelin's virtuosity would seem tame in comparison!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unforgettable","review":"This video captures the night - I was there all those years ago on that very cold night in Feb.

Nick must face him and the uneasy relationship of a Vampire trying to become humans with Vampires like Lacroix and the beautiful night club owner Jannette who have no intention of changing their ways.Highlights of the season include where Shanke discovers the truth about Nick and the two episodes directed by Geraint Wyn Davies(Nick Knight) and the episode directed by John Kapelos (Donald Schanke).Season two will delight and impress viewers that enjoyed the first season but dislike the added sex and violence that over saturate season three."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC!

I thought it would be good fun watching Sacha Baron Cohen in a movie where he wasn't Borat or Ali G, but the \\"duel\\" that he \\"fought\\" with Sweeney Todd just didn't make any sense. Helena Bonham Carter, who is very attractive, is difficult to look at when she's made up in Marilyn Manson corpse make-up.

I'm surprised Johnny Depp fell for the discusting and poor taste of the film's direction and it's too bad Mr. Burton doesn't have the film making skills to leave something for your imagination as the original version. Hitchcock would have directed this movie in a way that would have you leaving the theatre feeling better than then when you arrived, not feeling like you need to take an antacid tablet.

So is J DEEP meets BROADWAY sort of speak.I literally wasted my money on this. I couldnt watch this past the first 1/2 hour. It is very bad because it had the potential to be something in the lines of SLEEPY HOLLOW and beyond. A very serious movie. Rather than that, Tim Burton whos a great director decided to do this masquerade with musical number.Johnny Deep and some of the other actors are not singers anyway, so why waste money on people that when they sing dont crack your ribs.I never like to give NEGATIVE feedback, but this one took the bakery for me.

If they don't, they may learn to appreciate it, but it will never become part of their soul.\\" I count myself in that second group -- before the learning to appreciate part.Burton's style is just not that appealing. I *can* appreciate the sheer artistry of his work, everything from the original \\"Batman\\" to \\"Corpse Bride,\\" but it just doesn't speak to me.

I knew it would be weird, after all, it's a Tim Burton affair, but man ....Not that I'm down on Burton. I think he and Depp are a true powerhouse couple. Alan Rickman rules anything he's in.

Depp and Carter couldn't sing and the dialogue was so muddled it was difficult to understand. I know I'm in the minority here but this was the hardest movie to watch that I've seen this year.

Too bad that with such great acting and great sets and costumes, they had to muck it up with entirely too many songs and too little dialogue in between. This R rated scary movie musical really failed. The special effects also lacked, the spurting blood looked pretty fake - we just could not take it seriously.

It's worth it. The tale of Sweeney Todd is such an odd story, and the fact that it's a musical makes it all the more entertaining, disturbing and strangely horrific. The cast doesn't sing that well, but the overall effect of the film is quite superb. It's a tale of corruption, betrayal and ultimate blindly maniacal revenge. One monster of a man, turns an innocent man into and even more brutal destructive force renaming himself Sweeney Todd.If you don't like musicals at all avoid this, but if you like horror you might override that notion and find other aspects to enjoy on a darker sadistically cynical level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweeney Todd","review":"Even though my wife and I are not particularly fond of musicals we wanted to give this one a try mainly because of Tim Burton, who is a favourite director of ours.

The hideous truncation of Sondheim's brilliant score is the central flaw, from which the film can't recover. Another serious liability is the astonishingly bland, one-note performance by Johnny Depp. That this talented actor was so utterly miscast in this role--only to be nominated for a Best Actor Oscar, no less--speaks volumes about what is wrong with Hollywood, circa 2008...and why Hollywood should just stop adapting great stageworks into unfathomably poor film versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't come close to the broadway version","review":"One word: \\"TERRIBLE\\" Very weak voices and basically just a terrible job by everyone involved.

The more movies i see the more i think movies will come to an end soon. There is simply no talent in Hollywood anymore. Usually when a Broadway musical is made into a movie like Sound of Music, they try to do it even better than the Broadway version. I think those days are over. Don't bother with this piece of trash.

I've seen a few of Depp's films, and I've admired his work, but didn't realize the breadth he was capable of in his craft until I saw this rendition of the old Bway musical.The music still haunts me, Burton's interpretation, the cacaphony in depicting the madness and rage, and the beautiful and lyrical love songs, to my amazement, were brilliantly melded into duets.I've never really been a big fan of Tim Burton, but, I have to say, this gives me cause to take a second look at his work.As for comparisons to the original ST, I'm buying the Lansbury edition too so I can watch them back to back.I still can't get some of the music out of my mind...so beautiful, so haunting. Coupled with a top ranked cast, this DVD should NOT be passed by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy screen adaptation","review":"I love the tale of Sweeney Todd. I have been since I first saw a recording of the stage production back in the early 90's. When I heard that Tim Burton was helming a big screen adaptation I was ecstatic. Finally something to wash away the abomination vomited forth by John Schlesinger that starred Ben Kingsley.My hopes were high and I was not disappointed. Yes, the film adaptation removed some of the musical scenes found in the Sondheim stage show, but they where scenes that would probably have left a movie going audience feeling that the movie was to long. We didn't need the scene of Judge Turpin flagellating himself for his impure thoughts to realize he was not a good person. As much as I would have liked the intro to have the Ballad of Sweeney Todd it wasn't needed to help layout the story.To me this was a well cast, well acted, well directed and truthful adaptation to the stage play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Burton fan, but loved it","review":"My first thought upon finishing this film was, \\"how can something so dark and gory be so beautiful?\\" And it's true, to me at least. This movie is gory and gorgeous at the same time. It draws you in starting with the (rather creative) opening credits. I usually skip through those (who doesn't?), but I didn't this time. I have no idea why people are having problem with the casting, I thought everyone in this film was wonderful. I'm not even a Burton fan, but I thought Sweeney Todd definitely delivered.

At first, I didn't know what to make out of it, but it definitely grows on you!By the way, the blu-ray, which has already been released overseas, has received rave reviews so the U.S. release should be just as good, if not better.

This is not to say that they are bad, but they just don't measure up to Broadway's demanding standards.Although I was very much looking forward to getting a newer version of this grisly story, I will stick with my older DVD for the superior voices on it. This new one disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this version too.","review":"I love the older versions of this bizarre tale, so I wasn't sure I'd like this one, but it's wonderful. A dark comedy with fitting music and quick action that keeps your attention. Though the story is a bit morbid, it is certainly entertaining. A great cast was chosen for this re-make. Depp and Helena Bonham Carter worked well together. Depp plays the mad barber set on revenge and Helena is delightful as the frumpy pie shop owner who is dedicated and intent on keeping Sweeney Todd for herself, though she knows his love is saved for his daughter and lost wife. Can't help but feel a little sorry for both characters.Chrissy K.

First, it is painfully similar to The Devil's Advocate toward the end. Second, the main antagonist, Jules Bois, is hardly in the book at all (when basically everything that is happening has to do with him...). Next, Grant is a psychiatrist, and most of the information about psychiatry in the book is inaccurate. I know, not highly important or anything, but it definitely had a hand in my dislike of the book. And well, the book over all failed to keep my interest; I finished it more out of duty than for fun.I think if I had read this book before The Devil's Advocate, I might not have been so critical of it.

I am especially grateful for the section about the protection of the father over the daughter. When a boy has to ask permission from her dad before he is allowed to even go out with her, it weeds out the boys that want to date her for the wrong reasons. It really lets you understand the protection a father is commanded to give his daughter according to the Bible. And opens you eyes to how a son \\"leaves\\" at marriage and a daughter is \\"given\\" at marriage.Excellent, excellent book. Very readable and easy to understand.

As fathers we do not own our daughters and it is not our place to give her away in marriage or to force young men to recieve our permission to date our daughters. This paradigm is dangerous for women. It has been proven that if men see women as objects (to be given or taken from the previous owners their fathers) and not as people, there is a greater chance that a woman will be physically, sexually or psychologically abused.

Boy was I disappointed. There is absolutely nothing going on in this book. You get to hear a lot about Jack Walsh and his goofy brother. He meets some other goofy characters that help him along the way. Then you get to the big ending. Anyone who has ever read a suspense novel can figure out the ending in this book.

The old one died after I managed to strike a glancing blow on the crystal. On the strength of my very good experience with the old Pulsar Solar, I ordered one of these. Hate it.This is a large, thick and heavy watch. So much so, that I find its weight on my wrist annoying. But the worst \\"feature\\" is that the crystal scratches if you merely look at it wrong. My watch developed noticeable scratches after the first 24 hours of wear.

I call Panasonic technical support, and they claimed that the 12.7 A spec was correct, and that there was no recall.

Which is a shame, because I liked the features and how cooked, right up until the lights went out.If you have a 20 Amp dedicated circuit for your microwave, you might not notice this problem, but it would make me nervous to know that an appliance is using so much more power than it was rated for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"Buyer beware....Poor quality and workmanship...An even bigger headache getting a new piece of equipment serviced.Panasonic NN-H965BF Luxury Full-Size 2.2-Cubic-Foot 1,250-Watt Microwave Oven, Black"},{"rating":"1","title":"Died within two months.","review":"That's all.

There are hundreds of tunings for the five string banjo, especially for old time players. A tuner that only tunes to G is useless. Even bluebgrass players will sometimes play in D Reuben and other tunings. Old time banjoists typically play in g modal, c, cc,ccc, variations of the d tuning, and as well as F tunings. So a tuner that is only G is useless.Goldtone and others make tuners that have the g tuning but can switch to chr0omatic. I also tend to think that tuners that have a dial are more useful. I go with the basic Korg tuners that cost little and do a lot.Lately I have been attracted to snap on tuners because a tuner that just listens like the one displayed here is pretty useless if you are in a band and all the other instruments are tuning up, let alone a jam or a banjo class. The smallKorgs do come with connection to attach a pickup."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a toy than a tuner","review":"Although I have read some reviews of how accurate this item is for tuning, as a professional instrument maker and performer I must beg to differ. It is useful as a stocking stuffer for a budding musician, but truthfully it is a little flat of standard A=440 pitch. Also, it sounds a tone for you to tune against, and in anything other than a quiet room this is worthless... one is almost better off with a tuning fork against the sound box of your instrument. It is inexpensive and a novelty, but if you want a real tuner to rely upon, move onto to another tuner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless banjo tuner","review":"Farley Pockettones Banjo Tuner was a dud.

Their stories will shock you, make you cry, and, ironically, inspire you. Their poetry will touch you, and as they find God, even in the darkness, you will wish you could love Him - need Him - as much as they do.

If you've purchased a DSLR, you obviously know about that\\". Well I didn't know about and so I never fully grasped his book.He gets into the technical aspects way too much also, which I didn't care about. I really don't care how the camera sensor retains the data, I just wanted to take good pictures. Boring.He doesn't even tell you how to take a good picture until page 129. Well by that time he'd lost me, because his writing style is tough to read anyways.I will say though, if you are interested in learning the evolution of the digital camera, how it works and David Busch's past exploits in photography, then this book is for you.

He should have started this one where his other books left off and not made continuous summaries and references to his previous book. It came across very \\"cut and paste\\". Very annoying.

The same could be said for Busch's \\"Digital SLR Cameras and Photography for Dummies\\" although it did go into more detail. This book was just right, with lots of in-depth material about using digital SLRs, as well as tips and techniques I could apply right away.

I would've liked to have seen more plot advancement, for both the Yeerks and the war, and the blossoming relationships between our angst-filled heroes.

It even has a decent denouement, something so often lacking in Bolan books.So why only 4 stars? Well ... certain elements of te bok--which I don't want to reveal specifically for fear of spoiling the story--were quite contrived, particularly the climax. Only in the world of Mack Bolan would someone have a gun but use it as a club so there can be a great firhgt scene, rather than jhust shooting their enemy and being done with it.

Anyone who has a child, at any age, can feel the bond that Lubin has to his son.

You are simultaneously rooting for the Marines to get the bad guys while you are praying for their safe return to their loved ones. If you are looking to better understand the war in Iraq, this is the book for you. You will stay up until all hours of the night to continue reading.

As we head in to our sixth year in Iraq we need to remember who exactly is out there fighting in the desert...young Marines from places like Morrisville, Pennsylvania; Mount Ida, Arkansas; Vinita, Oklahoma, and Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin.

It is true that the two legs of this level are not square to each other (it rocks on a square corner) -- in fact, it's not even that close to square (and short legs are easier to make square than long legs). Since the legs are not square to each other, this means the level vials cannot be accurate either.The tool's name is \\"cross test level and plumb\\" but if the vials are not at 90 degrees to each other, then it cannot test level and plumb.

Typography is used in ways I never thought could be done before. Basically, it's teaching me things I've never learned in my schooling. What fascinates me most, is the way papers, text, and color come together.

I've loved it since I read in it its original French back in high school. I just now found a copy of it on the Internet for free thanks to Project Gutenberg -- you may want to do the same thing if you're after a particular story or want a nice sampling of all that M.

It remains one of my all time favorite recordings of this composition as well, and the remastered sonics are beautiful--they always were! The BSO collaboration with Leinsdorf in the Tchaikovsky does not seem as impactful as when first I heard it. One reason, I think, is that the remastered sonics are not quite as successful. The performance, too, strikes me as a bit more reserved than I once thought it. Nothing wrong here, and a Cd well worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent brand","review":"Serengeti has great product, and I really think you get a lot of bang for the buck with their sunglasses, very well constructed, good quality, excellent lenses, and nice styles; I collect all kinds of sunglasses, and there are very good brands out there, but if I had to choose just one brand, I'd go with Serengeti, but Maui Jim, and Oakley are also great; It really depends on what your personal preference, style and purpose for the sunglasses is when choosing a brand and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value for High-end Specs","review":"Doesn't quite measure up to the Serengeti Driving glasses I purchased 30 yrs ago relative to shading adjustment to varying light conditions; but in today's dollars, the previous glasses would be in the $750-$800 range.

Boys are shorted when it comes to social graces. This book fills that gap. It is well written with a boy's attitude and is not all sweet and mushy like little girl books. The graphics are wonderful. Teaching children manners is important yet often forgotten unless a large social event comes along. Telling a child how to act 5 mintues before you get there is a accident waiting to happen. By teaching our children manners we are giving them control and empowering them. With out that control the child feels lost and with act up out of frustation. This wonderful book helps boys understand manners for just about every social occasion. Be it on the playground, classroom, telephone, or wedding. Children also learn about kindness to other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Etiquette for boys","review":"Very well written. This book is more than just \\"good manners,\\" but how to get along with others. Boys tend to resort to tough talk & rough behavior to establish respect.

I faithfully listened to the cd's right up to the end. It was great to set aside time each day just to relax. The cd's worked a little too good because I found my self getting so relaxed I would fall asleep. Easy to do when pregnant. They instruct you to practice some of the techniques throughout the day when your not listening to the cd's. I was not so good at remembering to do this. Anyway this practice must be the key to the whole thing because when I finally did go into labor I panicked and refused to even listen to a cd. I was sure that it would be irritating rather than soothing. Oh well.

Rose Lambert recounts her life and times with the Armenian children in an orphanage in Hadjin, Turkey with the predominantly Armenian population of 20,000. The work sheds light on the era and the cultural setting in the dealings between the Turks and Armenians. It is a very honest look at the events surrounding the massacres at Hadjin with incredible account of grace and love amidst the carnage of so much violence. It is truly reflective and poignantly displays the radical differences between the Christian virtues and the Muslim mindset."},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter loves it!","review":"I bought this book for my daughter when we found out Will Hillenbrand was coming to visit her school.

I thought that it gave me a tremendous amount of insight into the feature set of the product and allowed me to find a basis for forming my own opinion on its strengths and weaknesses versus Lightwave, Softimage, Maya, EI, etc.I particularly liked the fact that while Rob obviously loves MAX, he wasn't at all shy about pointing out its shortcomings (they all have them, you know) as well as trumpeting its more well designed, powerful features.Can't comment on the tutorials since I didn't have the software, but the rest read well enough to actually sit down and read.For those who don't own or have access to the program and the documentation that comes with it, this is a great way to get started.

I got this KitchenAid Pro Line and it works so much better and faster! And I got it for the same price as the Starbucks model so that is another plus!

That said, I think it really suffers from bad production. I can't understand the lyrics at all. The vocals are in the background, buried under layers of distortion. Listening through the album, I had the feeling there were two vocalists. One was fairly mumbly, (sang Shine, among other) and one had a clearer voice (Sang Don't be late). The music is fairly interesting, but perhaps could have been more uptempo. When I listened right through 'Rust' struck me as a stand-out track, and I also liked 'Don't Be Late' and 'Second Skin' was also fairly good, but none of the other tracks really stuck out. They were okay, disonant chords and 90's-rock distortion and decent melodies, but the vocals are just too buried in the mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Recording!!!","review":"As other reviewers have noted, it might not be the best *total* performance of Elijah (although it's still VERY good)....but Terfel gives the best Elijah performance that I've ever heard.

The recording is more than a half tone below the score as written by Mendelssohn. I've checked my equipment (both CD player and instruments) and the conclusion is inescapable. A DDD recording would normally accurately reproduce the original performance. If that's true, it would mean that the entire work was transposed. Is it conceivable that the Edinburgh Festival Chorus would treat such a timeless work with such disdain? Doubtful. However it happened, if it matters to you that you hear the work in the written key, DON'T BUY THIS recording. There are others that are true to the composer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A prophetable experience","review":"I've heard a lot of performances of Elijah, a well-crafted work that used to be more popular than it is these days, and this is an extremely good one. The musical direction is to the point, Fleming and Terfel are at their best, and the other soloists are extremely good. (Although I wonder if they originally tried to get an alto better-known than Patricia Bardon.) I'm also glad that there are enough soloists on hand: Mendelssohn asked for at least 8, and older recordings that make do with 4 (turning all octets into choruses, for instance) seriously distort his plan.The pitch of the performance is a result of the use of period instruments and the tuning standard selected. There was no single pitch standard at this period, but the one selected is plausible and may be one heard by the composer. It is not a \\"transposition\\" or a distortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long-sought classical item","review":"Very pleased to obtain this excellent version of 'Elijah'.

Guru seemed like he went through my entire collection and pulled out my favorite artist to put them all on one CD. The CD has everybody from the artist who gave us \\"soul sista\\" Bilal, the Goddess her self Erykah Badu, #1 soul sista Angie Stone and the international soulful sound of Les Nubians.

On the other hand, it's going to be more interesting to see what direction he goes off on.The instrumental production is quite superb and more hardcore. It's certainly better than the second one of the series and it delivers a true fusion of hip-hop and jazzy funky rhythms. The tracks are all solid but the fact that virtually samples weren't used prevented this from being a perfect album. However I will highlights tracks with Angie Stone, Nubians, and Herbie Hancock as the highlights which have the dopest instrumentals and brilliant rhymes.Remember that Guru provides a positive outlook of life.

I don't know what these other reviewers were hearing, but let me assure you that this is a *horrible* CD. I'm actually a Sco fan, and have seen him live. That makes the low quality of this CD all the more shocking. The soloing seems surprisingly timid and unsure. There are several *obvious* errors, really offensive to the ear, which I cannot believe were recorded as a good take. I would expect better from a high-school garage band, to be honest. Even worse are the guitar tones, which are thin, scratchy, and brutally annoying. The songs are dull, with little variety. My last ride in a public elevator provided more musical enjoyment. If you somehow get stuck listening to this disc in its entirety, I advise calling 911 immediately, or you will risk permanent damage to your ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like music from a bad porno movie...","review":"There was a time that I thought that Scofield was going to rival Pat Metheny for the crown of being the best jazz guitarist, but after his past few records, I realize that that won't be happening (also as Metheny's record's continue to diversify and get stronger). This is another installment in Sco's quest to pander to the MMW/Phish generation \\"jam\\" sound. It is somehow pathetic to watch a 50 year old guy trying to \\"get down\\" with a bunch of kids playing over basic rock/funk vamps that would have been dated 20 years ago. This is 'FUSION' at it's absolute worst hiding in different clothes that's all. Also, I am so tired of Sco's usual devices (the slightly laid back blues phrases, the slight distortion on ALL THE TIME, etc.) - it just sounds tired. If you have heard any of his last 5 records, you have heard this one. The only difference is they are all better. (except AGOGO which was just as sad as this one is)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More sinewy electric funk from John Scofield!","review":"Sco, it's well known, can play anything well, as his acoustic QUIET and bebop ventures with Joe Lovano attest. But one of the things he does best is play unpredictable, jazzy electric funk a la LOUD JAZZ and BLUE MATTER (see his back catalogue for these superb albums). BUMP continues the funkified approach he plied most recently with Martin, Medeski, and Wood on his last release, A GO-GO. Here are Sco's patented twisting, skittering \\"out-there\\" melodies, rendered with the familiar steely guitar tone, over top of a cornucopia of rhythms by a variety of today's best young funkmeisters. Of particular note: BEEP BEEP and KILGEFFEN (which sounds like it could be a jazz version of John Fogerty's biting \\"Zantz Can't Dance\\".) There's nobody like John Scofield--some may be faster, some may play more notes, but nobody HEARS melodies and rhythms like John, and then executes them with such idiosyncratic, zesty soul. Great stuff from the incomparable Sco'. Buy ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best for Sco","review":"Bump seems to be a pretty uninspired Scofield release. I've seen him live, been following him since Still Warm and must say, this CD won't make my wish list. It almost seems like he was fulfilling a contractual obligation. This lacks the exciting freshness and excitement that many Scofield records have. Even bad Sco is ok but for his level of ability and history, I gave it a 2 star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scofield Scores Mildly . . .","review":"As a person who hasn't heard much of John Scofield's work, I can only judge it against the other album I've heard -- \\"A Go Go.\\" \\"Bump\\" isn't quite as good but in the ol' ballpark. Scofield's brand of jazz/rock is appealing, energetic and inventive. He'll hit you with the fusion stick and then rip into Benson-esque arpeggios, adding needed variety. Unfortunately, I often wanted Scofield to blaze away, hitting the whammy bar a little more, etc. Apparently Scofield doesn't have much Hendrix in him. And that's too darn bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music to Wake to","review":"Joe Henry starts out \\"Kindness of the World\\" with the words \\"One day when the weather is warm I'll wake up on a hill\\" and sets the tone of the whole album. There are some upbeat tunes on the album, and fantastic guitarwork and backing vocals by the Jayhawk's Gary Louris, but for the most part, Joe Henry lays out some decent mellow Minnesota-style alt country with great lyrics and swell music.If you're into the whole Uncle Tupelo, Jayhawks, Gear Daddies alt-country type sounds, this is a good album for you. It goes well with the first Wilco and Son Volt CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"For me, this and Short Man's Room are his best - the lyrics and musicianship on each are stunning, and each time I listen to one of the two, I decide it's his best, until I listen to the other one again. But any of his later recordings - up to and including this year's Tiny Voices - are also stunning - more challenging musically and lyrically, but with sonic landscapes that are in a class of their own. And Joe's website - now www.joehenrylovesyoumadly.com - is articulate, moving, and well worth a visit. Thanks Joe. Any chance of a tour to New Zealand one day?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not a serious book.","review":"A friend recommended this book and it has some interesting sections, but misses the mark in many areas. For example, many major works of art are missing and many important figures in Italian and Italian-American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"best soap I've ever used","review":"I first became aware of this soap by staying in a Sofitel hotel (Los Angeles), where the hotel puts it in all guest rooms. I liked it so much I decided to order it, and I've now been using it for years. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting music","review":"First, let me say that I'm not crazy about writing music reviews, because so many of them are tiresome and pedantic enough that I don't read many of them either; they are from knowledgeable people speaking to (or trying to intimidate) others of the same ilk. I am neither a musician nor a music reviewer; I merely know what I enjoy. I found Norwegian Violin Favorites pleasant to listen to, a mix of familiar, unfamiliar, and \\"I know I've heard that before but damned if I know where\\" selections. The music is mostly melodic, sometimes a bit sentimental, sometimes emotional, occasionally Scandinavian-serious, but generally not extremely anything. As far as I know, it is competently executed, but I'm no expert.I enjoyed it, it was pleasant, I will listen to it from time to time; it's not a 'wow' acquisition, but it is quite agreeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many missing pieces","review":"This product was purchased as a gift. The person I sent it too has informed me that there are so many missing pieces to the puzzle that it is unusable.

He is also deeply involved in Scouting activities, and though I knew he would want to keep his regular compass to use with the boyscouts, I thought this compass would be great for him to use with his GPS and geocaching. Good guess! He is enjoying it immensely and it seems to be working well in tandem with his GPS. This is a great gift for hikers, backpackers, campers, photographers, etc. Sorry I can't give more technical information on it...but my husband loves it...Karen SadlerUniversity of Pittsburgh"},{"rating":"1","title":"A different viewpoint","review":"To me the electronic digital compass is an answer to a problem that doesn't exist. Here we have an $... electronic device that is incapable of replacing a $...mechanical one, for several very good reasons: 1) It uses hard to find batteries that can fail at any time in the wilderness; 2)It has no 'protractor' function for use with a map (so you'll need that mechanical baseplate compass anyway!); 3) It is less accurate in taking bearings to a landmark than a baseplate compass that has either a sighting mirror or long baseplate for alignment; 4) Unlike several baseplate compasses available on the market, it has no UTM romer scales or map scales for use with either a GPS receiver or map; 5) Although it's as heavy and bulky as a GPS receiver it can't replace either a GPS or a mechanical baseplate compass, so what good is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tropiccafe","review":"This has been one of the best purchases I have made. I have a sailboat and use this compass for so many things. It is fully user friendly. Great to take bearings, has return route,Can be set for deviation corrections. Well worth the money I spent.

Large inclusions visible with the naked eye at 5-ft away render this a poor gift to give to a lady. Prompt refund made the disappointment a quick memory though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather a disappointment","review":"Being a fanatic for Margaret's & Tracy's books, I was rather disappointed with this one. There is no comparison to the Dragonlance Saga or the Death Gate novels. The plot develops very slowly and even though someone would say that this is because the characters are being built up, I never felt any familiarity with any of the heroes. They seemed distant,I did not feel any bad or good or whatever feelings for them.They were indifferent to me(that's a bad thing!) I felt that Margaret and Tracy only repeated themselves, without having the spark of inspiration.They gave me the impression that someone forced them to write the book. Of course, I will surely buy the second volume when it will be released (it's an addict!), but they will have to do much better to convince me to buy the third one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book but not a paint by numbers.","review":"I have read many things by MW & TH since the time they started modules for D&D back in the 80s. I completed this book in 3 days reading while I was in Non-Comissioned Officer course \\"just couldnt put it down\\". It's not a piant by number, as many others have stated it is a bit slow at the start but I enjoyed getting all the background on each character. I was even drawn in by one of the characters I thought would become one of the main characters and was crushed when they disposed of him.It is a book well worth the reading. And for the few that seem to be overly dissapointed maybe you need to step back away from the book and look at it as the new series and type of book that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"New world,new adventures,fantastic plot","review":"Ok ok, I am fed up with these two.Will they never something that will be even a tiny weenie bit less than excellent?Of course I should give congrats to Larry Elmore too,for a very intriguing world he has come up with . Loerem is a world with great potential and I will be happy to travel it with Elmore,Weiss and Hickman . (I even wrote a short story taking place in Loerem ,but even I dont like it much :-) ) Oh,and Weiss,Hickman,thanks for the autograph in the book.Rest assured that dragons will ever fly in my dreams!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Until now, I thought MW&TH; were incredibly and consistently good in a genre that is often very formulaic, and that often seems to aim for plot instead of story. I decided to pick up Well of Darkness without even knowing anything about it except it was written by MW&TH.;Ugh, what happened?? Maybe, just maybe, I will still look for a loaner from the library, but even that might not be worth it. Ironic that the story was about the Void, because that is exactly what the book gave back -- no life, no nothing. One of the elements I really enjoy from their books is losing myself in the other worlds, where the the magic and the characters and the races and everything takes on a life of their own. This book just does not have \\"it\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Well Runs Dry","review":"The institution of Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have produced in Well of Darkness the beginnings of a promising series. Though I didn't like the new take on Dwarves and the new take on Orcs, the Elven society is interesting enough to make up for them. As for the story, there isn't one until the final seventy-five pages. Up to that point, the book reads like a role-playing game guide... and, that's kind of what it is, having been simultaneously released with the Sovereign Stone gaming system.As readers of fantasy know, Margaret and Tracy aren't Tolkein split in half; but they're not schlock-king Piers Anthony either. Well of Darkness is long and somewhat boring, but ends in a way that seems to hint... hey, the next one's gonna be really good. And believe me, good or not, the next one will be very different, as the town of Vinnengael and its Dominion Lords are turned completely upside down. I'm tempted to bump this review up to three just out of curiousity."},{"rating":"1","title":"standard fare, not particularly well done","review":"I gave the book to my brother to make sure I wasn't missing something. He agreed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring:this is not a MW&TC book","review":"Hey, what is it with you guys? I have been reading the reviews and I am really surprised that you rate it so high.I am a very loyal fan of Margaret and Tracey's books, I have read most of their books as well as some of Margaret's solos but this one was disappointing. Very slow development in the plot, I could not \\"link\\" with any of the characters, I never felt like not-being-able-to-put-it-down. I have not found anything new in this book.I agree with some other reviewers, the end looks promising,but I am still under the impression that MW&TC wrote it just to sell and not because they had something new and exiting to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, Wonderous World with No Real Hero","review":"I thought the Well of Darkness was a unique fantasy story with many new twists to some of the old races, like dwarves and elves, but there was no real *star* in the book that I liked. The characters were either annoyingly good, or evil enough that I felt like killing them myself.All in all, I am glad I got the book from my local library, instead of buying it right away like I considered. I think the book is worth a read and even a re-read, but I would wait to buy it in the paperback form. Hopefully the second book will introduce some characters I can begin to care about, like the outstanding Death Gate series that Weis and Hickman wrote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Excellent read.

I find it distasteful to find that they offer some cheesecake recipes, while keeping their own recipe secret. Poor form."},{"rating":"2","title":"recipes that really deliver!","review":"I recently made the Strawberry Cheesecake, and it was out of this world--best I've ever had. I find the directions to almost all the recipes very clear and easy to follow. The extra-big Tea Biscuits are fabulous, and the recipe for the Vienna Rolls alone is worth the cost of the book. (By the way, the rolls call for malted milk powder, which can be purchased from the King Arthur Catalogue. If you're not familiar with this catalogue, go to their web site; you'll love it.) Our family also enjoyed the Spaghetti with Big Meatballs and Mac and Cheese Pie. If you're looking for big flavor with an emphasis on comfort foods, this book delivers. I'm looking forward to making the Chocolate Fudge Layer Cake for my next birthday. This is one of my favorite cookbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasic history, but recipes are not precise","review":"I enjoyed reading about the evolution of Junior's and Brooklyn, but thought the recipes lacked clarity. For example: the Coconut Macaroon recipe never told you when or how to add the coconut!

The first year or so that I had the watch the battery would charge quickly and hold its charge for a decent length of time but by the time it was five years old, the watch would stop if it was not worn for a couple of days. Eventually it would only run while it was being agitated. I would far prefer a watch with a battery that costs two or three dollars and could be changed easily. It costs more than fifty dollars to have this one replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"No disappointments at all","review":"The watch was exactly as represented. The quality is what you would expect from Seiko and I love the fact that it does not need winding or a battery. I have had the watch for several months now and the finish on the watch and the band show no real sign of wear. Also, the crystal shows no sign of scratching or other abrasions as is often the case with less expensive lower quality watches.All-in-all I am very pleased with this watch, with the manufacturer, and with the vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointing follow-up to a great first album","review":"If you know what's good for you, you won't buy this album because you liked the first one. The only thing that N17 has maintained is heaviness, everything else about this sophmore attempt is completely worthless. Only one or two tracks even start out with any potential only to lose it in the first minute. Every track goes absolutly nowhere. If they would have tried to break things down once in a while it could help dramatically. This is the first album that I knew would never even have a chance of growing on me. I'd maybe recommend buying a single if they release one, but a whole album of this is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?

This may be the way the muffler is normally offered, but I had always assumed this was a conventional style glass-packed muffler. the retaining wire used to wrap around the fiberglass batting was there, but no batting at all. I had some batting, so I wrapped it up and reinstalled the resonator, and went on about my business. It gave it a less harsh tone than it previously.This muffler is loud and open flowing. I have it on a 125 single cylinder cafe bike. It sounds great. Performance remained the same, if not even a tad more mid range. I did not notice any different spark plug coloring, signaling the carb needed adjustment with the muffler, atleast in my application."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You","review":"I originally owned The Mystery of the Blue Train as a part of a set of DVDs, which was eventually stolen as luck would have it on a train trip to Florida.

Living like rodents in underground bunkers, between almost constant incoming artillery fire, the Marines emerged at every chance and gave it back to them, in spades. Despite seeming insurmountable odds, Khe Sanh never fell, and when the final tally was in, the number of enemy dead was staggering. Compared with 1000 Marine casualties and 750 South Vietnamese casualties, the North Vietnamese Army lost more than 12,000 men in their failed attempt to overrun the indomitable Marines at Khe Sanh.A great piece of military history preserved in a fine book. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I bought this because it contains a remix of 'Hear me calling'. It's amazing.

We purchased the Blue Booties Record Book, Calendar AND Memory Box. Thinking I could get ahead I opened the baby book and started writing...BE CAREFUL! The texture of the pages has a coating on it which does not appear to allow ink to set properly. I used a traditional ink pen which smudged on all of the pages. Also, when I wrote on one side and closed the book, the ink transfered to the opposite side. I was HEART-BROKEN. For our daughter, we had purchased the looseleaf memory book which I much prefer. You can take out the pages to write carefully, add photos, momentos, etc. and you know your pages will be safe from smudges and ink runs.

The surprise here is Pistolero, a blistering whole new kind of \\"Western\\" that should have found its way into Shanghai Noon (can you imagine!).I find some of the rest of the album too sparse for my tastes, but not dull.
