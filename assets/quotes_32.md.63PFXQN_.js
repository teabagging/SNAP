John Dears read on the Christian message hits home hard and in a big way. It challenged me on many levels, as material consumer, as peace maker, as one person challenging the system, whether it be political or religious. It clearly outlined the mission, as a call to work for justice at every point in our life.

This book tells of the Gospel of Jesus and relates it to everyday modern life, and choices we must all make. I never really understood the messages behind the gospels I read this book. This book relates the Christian message behind the death penalty, civil disobediance, belief in faith, and your sprititual journey in life. The book is well written and easy to understand. Each chapter starts out with a chapter in one of the Gospels and then relates it to modern day life. I will be forever changed by the reading of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone can slap a cross on their chest ...","review":"Anyone can slap a cross on their chest (or attend church) and claim to follow Jesus. This book gives the reader a much deeper insight into what Jesus' life actually represents. Jesus did not judge people. Jesus used nonviolent civil disobedience in a determined effort to bring about justice for the poor. He opposed war and a corrupt state. He befriended and advocated for the poor, the sick and the downtrodden. His ultimate aim was Love. In short, Jesus was an extraordinary activist in his times. And by extrapolation, the book intimates that if we are to truly call ourselves followers, then we too must actively engage society and seek justice for all. Highly recommended if the reader wants an authentic understanding of Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear reason to why Mary is queen in God's kingdom","review":"Being a cradle Catholic I was accustomed to call Mary, \\"Our Lady.\\" I never gave it much thought because that was the way Catholics have always called her. After reading this book I realized that this was her title because that is how one addresses a queen. I also found out she is not just a figurative queen but a real queen in God's kingdom. Scott Hahn, a former Presbyterian minister who converted into a superb Catholic apologist, explains in easy-to-understand details why she is queen. I recommend this book to all Christians -- Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Catholics will find a deeper understanding of what Mary is to us; and Non-Catholics will understand why Catholics revere her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great book! A must-read!","review":"I read this a couple of years ago and it was amazing!If you are a professional anti-Catholic who looks down on the mother of our savior (you know who you are), don't read this!

Eminently readable and insightfully structured, \\"Hail, Holy Queen\\" examines and analyzes the biblical and theological foundations of Marian devotion with insight and deep faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, elegant and faithful","review":"I highly recommend this splendid work of Scott Hahn. I believe that so many people will find \\"Hail, Holy Queen\\" very helpful in discovering and rediscovering Mary. The book's style is simple and elegant. Its message, in fidelity to Vatican II, is crystal-clear in concentrating our attention on Mary, the Mother of God, in her relationship to Christ and His Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep thoughts about Jesus & Mary made clear from scripture","review":"Scott Hahn reallly knows how to communicate deep thoughts clearly. In that respect, HAIL HOLY QUEEN is very similar to his earlier book, THE LAMBS SUPPER. Neither one is directed against non-catholics, like an apologetics book. Both are written mainly for average catholics like me. However, I liked HAIL HOLY QUEEN more, mainly because of how it makes more of the old testament come alive. His presentation of the images/types of Mary really inspire me to want to study scripture, and to get closer to Jesus through Mary, especially in the rosary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail Holy Queen","review":"Good exegesis and theological aruguments for the Church's teachings about the Blessed Virgin Mary. A little slow reading at times, but it is well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for beginners","review":"This book does well as an intro for people who know little about the tradition out of which Mariology emerged. If Mr Hahn wanted to share his scholarly insights with readers, however, the book (at least this edition) has little reference material...He tried to put his footnotes in the back of the book, but oddly enough, they correspond to no numbers in the actual text. Likewise, the few references he does cite have no corresponding numbers in the back of the book, (for example, he is missing numbers 45-51 and numbers 68-79 in his notes).It is one of the most mysterious \\"citation of references\\" I have ever read. He would have done better to just drop the source material altogether, and just presume we believe that all of his citations are correct, as so many other pastoral books do...For those who want a deeper read, it fails pretty badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A serious, thoroughly accessible study of the Marian mystery","review":"Scott Hahn is a Catholic scholar and apologist in the best sense of both terms. His mild, yet radical book, \\"The Lamb's Supper,\\" re-explained the Mass in ways that I found both surprising and convincing. In \\"Hail, Holy Queen,\\" Hahn asks us to view Mary in a new light, presenting what he believes to be her essential role in Christianity's redemptive message. By turns subtle and poetic, he writes about the Marian mystery at the heart of Revelation. Taking the reader through the Bible, Hahn sheds light on Mary's integral role in God's plan. He also examines the reasons why \\"Marian devotion\\" has waned among Catholics, Protestants, and Orthodox Christians. A serious, thoroughly accessible study."},{"rating":"2","title":"De Maria nunquam satis","review":"Dr. Hahn has done it again! Like _The Lamb's Supper_ or _A Father Who Keeps His Promises_, if you listen to Dr. Hahn's tapes you won't find much new in _Hail, Holy Queen_. What you will find is the insight of all his tapes on Our Lady synthesized into a single work -- complete with personal anecdotes and the usual healthy dose of excruciating puns.The book is an analysis of Mary in Sacred Scripture, in the doctrine of the Church, and in the plan of God. Yet Dr. Hahn doesn't want us simply to know more *about* Mary -- he wants us to *know* Mary, personally, as the Mother of the Son of God and the Mother of the children of God, Our Mother. If we only know about Mary but don't allow her to lead us to Jesus, our knowledge is in vain. More than anything else, Dr. Hahn's book is a call to prayer, inviting us to get to know (especially through the Rosary) the Mother he has helped us know more about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, but that is about it......","review":"I felt that this book had great potential to try to explain the Catholic dogmas about Mary, because I have heard great things about Scott Hahn. Well this book failed to explain to me the Marian dogmas of the Church. I do have a better understandind of some of the dogmas, however, it has actually lessened my faith in the dogmas of Mary."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Scholar?","review":"In Hahn's book he has the scene from the wedding at Cana. In it he has Jesus say to Mary, \\"What do you have to do with me.\\" THAT'S NOT WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS. It says, \\"What does this have to do with me.\\" He mistranslates the scripture to launch into a discussion of Mary's relationship with Jesus.Mary has a very special relationship with Jesus.

Even Bin Laden relies on offers of celestial girlies to spur the faithful, real stuff that'll make the most pious parson drop his Book on the floor, rather than reaching for pagan superstition that would persuade only a TV-addled New Ager.

This book explores the various attitudes and personalities of each temperament and how our worldly selves deal with them. Basically, if you have a close relationship with Jesus, then the weaknesses of each temp. is not that hard to overcome. Lahaye tells us is that we have a predominant temp. with one or two secondaries and it is interesting to see where you fit in, and how certain aspects of your life affect how you react to certain situations. This is similar to the Myers-Brigg Indicator, but you do not answer a lot of questions. One thing, I did like, was Lahaye's mention of the spiritual fruits and what each temp. is normally good at. If you are interested in seeing which temperament you are, and what your strengths/weaknesses may be, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist","review":"This book is too generalized and racist.

Some pages (i.e. 32 and 33) are downright so horribly copied as to be useless. Those two pages are partially covered up by some blob and page 33 is totally slanted and some of it is oddly magnified, the same thing you see when you put a book on a copier and don't straighten it enough. This is really inexcusable. Few enough students attempt reading Homer as it is, don't chase them away by making them pay a lot of money for a \\"new\\" edition that is so poorly put together.

One of my favorites, \\"Teasing is never nice\\" shows one puppy sticking out its tongue at the other. I'm not sure how the author got the picture of that, but it is very adorable.

The story is merely one section of an entire history not even discussed by the movie, which you could read in the manga. What did Dr. Kasuminome go into this field, what prompted him? Why did Ikuro become so attached to Sumire?You're treated, in this video, a single snapshot of a potentially wonderful series.

It is the story of a young man coming of age and finding his own place in the world. The first of ten authors begins the story with Dante, a poet who has more than one woman in his life and many desires.Butterflies are very mysterious critters, imagining them kissing is tough. The correlation between Dante's struggle with life and the butterflies is truly a work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"These butterflies will dazzle your heart and mind!","review":"Can you imagine what happens when butterflies kiss? It has to be simply beautiful and mesmerizing to witness one of God's most delicate creatures take time to experience the intricacies of love and passion. As Dante shares his experiences and observations, we also see what we too often miss when we rush into things. We miss the beauty around us as well as the beauty within us.This unique collaboration is creatively written, giving readers a sensual, passionate glimpse of the magic of butterflies kissing. As each writer tells their story of Dante's journey through love, you will sense the delicate flutters as the words begin to gently touch your heart and soul. \\"When Butterflies Kiss\\" is a piece of art which is best savored and not read too hurriedly.Enjoy this read and allow the gentle kisses to awaken and refresh your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"I find this to be a very rich ...","review":"I find this to be a very rich moisturizer, great for the legs, hands ,arms, etc. It was a bit heavy for my face, but it would probably be good in a drier climate.

I went home and ordered it right away, because I couldn't find it in the physical stores I checked. The first time I put it on I thought this could work. It felt good every time I put it on, but it took 2 days to completely heal my hands. When I forget to put it on now after a day or two my fingers start to split open and bleed again.

Now his skin is clear and soft where it used to be scaly and an angry red.The only drawback is that Cetaphil cream is thick/heavy and tends to run into your eyes when you sweat.

While I really enjoyed the first this book fails in comparison. The story focuses on Kurt, an Spartan II, and the newly formed Spartan III program. If that were all there was to the book it might be fine. However, the book has trouble centering on the main plotline and becomes a tiresome read as you'll be switching perspective every chapter, many times to characters you really don't care about. Add to that the large number of grammatical and typographical errors and it is pretty hard to finish this book.

After reading First Strike I couldn't wait to play Halo 2 and fight with the other SPARTANs. I was sadly mislead. There was neither hide nor hair of anyone mentioned in the books.

The spelling and grammatical errors are numerous, to say the least. At one point they refer to a female character as a he and then a she--in the same sentence. Very sad.There are about five different plot lines running through the book, and it just makes it seem choppy and laborous to get through.

But, not all birthmothers had the maternity home experience! Many were shipped out of town to serve time as maids, cleaning ladies, and nannies in exchange for a bed and food to survive. (I know of one young woman who had to care for two toddlers and an infant.) Still others lived in tiny apartments during pregnancy and moved to another location after relinquishment. Evans did not go to a maternity home. As a result, for more than two decades she didn't know of any woman who had surrendered her baby for adoption! Evans tells how she felt alone and isolated in her secret pain. Regardless of the setting where they lived out their pregnancies, birthmoms do share a sense of powerlessness! Most were sentenced to a life of inner shame, of unresolved loss. I give Evans five stars because her story shows the strength of the human spirit to survive."},{"rating":"2","title":"DB2 Developer's Guide - 4th Edition","review":"Being a mainframe DB2 DBA for IBM Global Services, I found this book useful but not the \\"Bible\\" that some have branded it.

It is a great starting point for someone looking to gain an overall knowledge of how DB2 works in that environment. But, here again, a text short on depth in many areas. But, in defense of any author trying to put together a text on DB2, there are just too many areas of depth that would have to be covered. I would like to see a text that covers typical knowledge areas and scenarios that a DB2 DBA would encounter on a daily basis and give solutions on the problem.

Also, when you clip the phone to your belt then unclip it, the battery pops out, cutting off your phone call.

Just the first few notes of the opening theme (this has an incredible soundtrack!) are enough to hook you.

For example, the book has the wrong information on what College actually put numbers on Football Jerseys. According to the History of American Football and Sports Illustrated in 1908, Karl Davis, at the time publicity man for the University of Pittsburgh, first put numbers on college football jerseys.Davis used that good old sales pitch, \\"One cannot tell the players without a program!\\" He quickly added to this service the refinement of switching the numbers each week due to Davis having the program concession. Davis thus became a double pioneer in player numbering and in \\"dynamic obsolescence\\". Both inventions have come a long way since.When I see such errors, I wonder how many other facts the author got it wrong or just did sloppy research. Anyway, the Internet Age has made such books obsolete and mistakes unimportant since they can be corrected easily today with easy research."},{"rating":"2","title":"How many more errors?","review":"This is obviously a monumental work, reminiscent of a similar book put out during the 1930s and 1940s by author Christy Walsh. However, with all of the resources at the disposal of ESPN, one would think that there would have been better proofreading and/or fact checking. Many have already pointed out what to them are relatively basic errors that should not have been made. Let me add another that may be the most basic yet. In the Conference Championship section, the Big Ten is listed as the very first named conference. Anyone with even a little knowledge of the Big Ten knows that back in the \\"olden days\\" the conference was known as the Western Conference, and was not officially named the Big Ten until the 1980s.Having said that, let me add that overall this appears to be a very goood resource.

Discharge, GBH, and The Exploited all demonstrate why it is that you're watching this (the history of 80's U.K. punk) by turning in some strong performances. Unfortunately, that's about all the video has to recommend itself, and the quality of the music pretty much jumps off a bridge after that. I must admit that I think much less of Toy Dolls, Peter And The Test Tube Babies, and Anti-Nowhere League after watching this - and those are some pretty big names. The lesser-known bands here range from uninteresting to incompetent, with some moments of Benny Hill-inspired punk that are just about unwatchable. I have listened to Crass compilation albums from the 80's, so I know that there was good stuff going on in the U.K. at the time.

He was eager to please me and make just that little bit of change in himself as well.

A very good story that I'm sure can be relived by many who were in the Nam. However there seems to have been some changes made in the month since I left to go back to the world. First...The M-14 did not have a pistol grip. Second...I never saw a corpman with a M-14,..They all carried pistols. Thirdly..the only fire support we ever got from Phu-loc 6 was 81 mortars. Forthly...what's with all the \\"showers\\", and hot meals. Fifthly...The M-14 bolt stays open when the last round is fired, and it only needs to be released to chamber a round.

That said, I waited anxiously for the disc to arrive, however upon listening, my heart sank as I realized that unlike \\"Live at the Jazz cafe\\" this disc is a recording of a concert done on the cheap. There is no horn section. This CD is comprised of stripped down tracks knocked out on a synthesizer. If you are expecting the big SOS production, forget it. The music sounds like a night club act covering their songs. Sorry Corinne and Andy, although you are the masters of re-packaging the same material again and again, you need to keep flawed product from reaching the market.

A small group of elderly people from the future have established themselves in the 1930s for unknown reasons, and they aren't the only people with access to the time corridor. And then there's a mysterious vapour which is killing people, and worse...Gareth Robert's follow up to his wonderful 'The Romance of Crime' is another great book. He has captured the characters of the Doctor and Romana from the seventeenth season wonderfully, and set them in great stories which put that period of Doctor Who (with the exception of 'City of Death') to shame.If you are a Doctor Who fan and you haven't read this, do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland arrangements","review":"I want to start by saying I really love Duck Baker's work...he's a fine player. The book doesn't seem to reflect his abilities. I felt the arrangements were very simplistic and not interesting or memorable.

I returned this book, but it could be this book appeals more to beginner fingerstyle players."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little known songs and lots of text.","review":"Most of these instrumentals will not be recognized by most listeners. I feel that a Gospel instrumental needs to be well known to the point that it brings back memories of singing it in church and even the memory of many of the words. There are some of those in this collection, but too many of those got jazzed up or bluesed up a bit too much in my opinion. Mr. Baker is a very talented player and arranger. I like his arrangement of \\"What a Friend We Have in Jesus\\", very Chet Atkins like, and am learning it. I got my money's worth if I learn 2 or 3 tunes so I'm not overly disappointed. Much of the book is text about the history of Gospel music, not music itself.

Love his show and his books. I thought Bone in the Throat was a great read -- light, funny, good plot, interesting characters. The protagonist here is interesting -- but he's the only one. It's hard to tell the difference between the two main female characters. And there's simply too many shoot out scenes that drag on and on. Bourdain apparently has a great knowledge of automatic weapons, but ... who cares? That's not why I like him. He is, of course, a great stylist and the writing is as sharp as ever. The problem is what he's writing about. It didn't interest me in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophomore Slump","review":"A rather disappointing followup to \\"Bone in the Throat,\\" this mob caper never reaches the breezy good humor of the Bourdain's debut. There are some decently interesting characters (a crossdressing mobster and a legendary ancient French commando being two), and some offbeat happenings, but the climax is wholly unsatisfying (at least to me). One redeeming aspect is that Bourdain doesn't shy away from killing some of the characters you least suspect will die.

This cable is actually pretty amazing and mind-blowing for some games, but it has many graphical errors for other games.

But for games made/licensed by EA (Includes BF3), Sega, Atari, or any company that isn't Bungie or Activision, the graphics get screwed up, and compared to Gamecube with a standard AV cable, the graphics look WAAYYY better on Gamecube. The reason its 2 stars and not 3 stars is because it costs more than the regular component cable, so you should get more for what you pay for. This is my review and doesn't work as well as you want it to.

There are few opportunites to repeat what you've just heard and no follow-ups to confirm that you've said the new term correctly.Also, the program appears to have been produced in the UK so some of the translations are a bit funky (for example \\"tschus\\" is translated as \\"cheerio\\")On the positive side, some of the dialogues on the tape appear to be genuine, real-life conversations that have been (surreptitiously?) recorded.As alternatives, I'd check out Pimsleur (very expensive but excellent) or Living Language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music","review":"I enjoy the album's first track, \\"Native Tongue\\", and the instrumental version of \\"Find Your Way Back\\".

I respect Craig's guitar work, he's an excellent technician. I just find the songwriting to be uninspired. This album feels antiseptic to me, it's not earthy and textured, it's spacey and smooth. If you like light jazz and new age, then this is for you. If you like acoustic guitar with humanizing imperfections then I recommend looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Driving Music!","review":"That's not all. It is very relaxing.

What you will find, however, is a study done on college age students who have found religion (no matter how superficially) or left it behind. I thought the work done by the authors was very shallow as to their presentation on why someone might take upon themselves a belief system foreign to them. There are no Muslim converts, Mormon or any \\"exotic\\" groups, only Protestant Christians. The subjects are pretty young, so there is no way of telling how deeply their newfound beliefs or freethinking will go in the future. The conversions are also not \\"amazing\\" at all.

The description here was minimal, and I wanted to warn other potential buyers -- this is basically a coloring book. The weird thing is that the concepts and vocabulary are at a first-year college or advanced high school level. I can't imagine just who is supposed to use this book, sixth grade geniuses with crayons, or easily amused college freshmen?

Worse, I felt no sympathy at all for this woman by the end of the book--and I'm a feminist! This is not the memoirs of a sane or rational person. She is certainly largely to blame for her troubles, in fact I think she's as mentally unstable as her husband. I bought this book merely for one's woman's perspective on what it must be like to live in Iran, but the book failed to deliver even that. The author lacks any insight into her own mental state and her descriptions of daily life are vague and confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious & awful","review":"Somehow I did make it through this book, but it was only out of sheer force of will. It was poorly written and dull. I thoroughly enjoy books on Iran in particular and the Middle East in general, but this book was more of an exhausting sob story than it was an interesting autobiographical journey. There's only so many pages that a person can endure a laundry list of complaints.

There are many names of relatives and friends that are almost impossible to keep track of during the contest of the book. As I went through it, I was looking for some clue to get the meanings of some words in Farsi, because the book did not include a summary of the foreign words and their corresponding meaning in English. I understand that there are some words that don't have an exact translation into English, however, I expected at least an aproximaition. I would not recommend this book, specially because the purpose of the author at writing her story is not clear. Even though the author had the opportunity to go back to the West and forget about her \\"nightmare\\" in Iran, she returned to her homeland for the second time and I don't think it is fair for a society to be described with such bitterness due to a unpleasant personal experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unveiled","review":"The first half of this book is totally frustrating. There are too many characters and the family tree is virtually useless. The second half is exasperating. Here is a woman of so called nobility and educated who, in rebellion against her upbringing, marries an inferior, rude, sexist, demanding, and controlling gigolo. The reader can only tire of her rationalizing a destructive marriage, conceived and executed with her consent. The only kind thing I can say for Cherry is that perhaps her rebellion against her parents, who ruled and dominated her early dating life, responded in the only way she knew how. Choose someone totally and completely the opposite of anyone they would have chosen for her. Well done....but why punish yourself?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hide this book under the veil","review":"After 20 pages, I was bored. I forced myself to read 85 pages, and it did not get better.

Maybe it gets better.... ?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible book that only increases cultural stereotypes","review":"I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book, and am finding it to be the tale of a confused, bicultural woman returning to an even more confused, multi-cultural country. It's a rather trashy and not partiularly well-written account of her experiences. While probably all true, it makes me sad to think that this, and its companion book with the theme of \\"horrible time in Iran,\\" Not Without My Daughter, may be one of the few views into Iranian culture for Western readers. I'm not sure what the author's motivation was (revenge? to raise funds?), but I'm finding it to be an irresponsible book that only increases cultural stereotypes. Imagine not knowing a thing about America's South other than its racism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to read when you can't find anything else.","review":"First on the writing style. This book is extremely hard to read and difficult to follow because she skips around too much and gets off subject. One minute she's 30-something, next line she flashes back to age 10 with no warning. I am an American Muslim and I don't pretend to know everything that goes on the world, especially in Shia Iran. So I can't say if she is telling the truth or not but for God's sake why do you expect IRAN to be like UK? It makes no sence to me to complain about all the stuff that happened when it was HER own decision to go there, not once but TWICE. If it was too much to handle the fisrt time WHY GO BACK? I think she brought all her hardship on herself. Not every Muslim is going to be as strict as the next. If you can't handle it, find a more laidback environment and live the kind of life you want. Don't go to one of the strictest countries (Shia/Islam-wise) and expect the country to change for you.

Cherry ranmbles through most of it and is almost incoherant when she dwelves endlessly into tales of various friends and family members that have little to no bearing on the story that she's promised to tell, that of her marriage. We don't even get to that story unti the last third of the book, and when we do, it's eye-rollingly silly. She married this man KNOWING he was bad news and STAYED with him after she realized that he was married to another woman and wasn't interested in the sort of relationship that she was.I didn't think this book had much to do with Iran; it was just another story about an unhappy marriage.

I liked the twists. The only criticism I could make is that I thought that they should have some of their facts examined a bit better. A sharpshooter's rifle is set for a person. The odds are that a rifle for Zikri would be set differently to Claybon.I liked the way that they brought the evidence in and I even liked the way at the end they left some doubt about whom did it. Life is not black-and-white and it is nice the writers left us with that view.Many of the actors are barely known but they all played well. I though in particular the woman who played Zikri's wife was extremely good. Many acted almost exactly as similar characters do in life.The filming is good. While watching the movie a second time, I kept stopping and playing it back trying to figure out how they did some of it. They wove real life and fiction well.By the way, I have little doubt that the conclusion after such an event some tough security laws would be introduced is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I never understood the reason behind making this film. I thought it might be something like \\"Look what would happen if Bush was assassinated.\\" However, other than one little dig at \\"President\\" Cheney trying to have his cabinet fit the facts of the crime to a conveniently accused Arab American (just like Iraq and the WMD), it barely touched the subject. The movie left me feeling - nothing. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Initial impression was wrong.","review":"My initial impression regarding this film was that it is some sort of political propaganda, but after finishing it I have discovered that I was wrong. What this film is really about is how our world has changed after 9/11.

I support the U.S. Democratic party, and, agree with Hillary Clinton in her accusations of this film. \\"I think it's despicable\\" and \\"I think it's absolutely outrageous that anyone would attempt to profit from such a horrid situation\\" are just a couple of quotes from her, and I completely agree. Why would anyone create this film other than to promote violence? Just wait and see what happens on October 19, 2007. Just wait and see. This is why the film did so bad at the box office. Because who wants to see the killing of their leader? We're not gonna change the facts at hand, so why not support him? If more of us supported him, maybe the country would be in a better situation. But no, that's fine. All I can say is, this film is bad news. Bad news indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FAIRLY GOOD MOVIE","review":"I was quite surprised that the only place I could get this movie was through amazon.com. The day it was released, not one place locally carried it. I presume that was because it was the assassination of a sitting president, which in and of itself is quite controversial. However, after watching it, it was a bit eerie in content. I enjoyed the interaction and weaving of the lives of those numerous people leading up to the assassination. I did think they handled the footage of the actual shooting well so as not to show the person who portrayed the president directly. I can see why it is so controversial, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raynox Adapter Ring","review":"Simple but effective adapter for your camera.

The writing is juvenile in manner and does not make for an interesting read. Mr Alpert should take the time to develop his characters. They seemed like caricatures of people he met at a boring cocktail party. I couldn't care less what happened to any of them as they were all dislikable. They storyline had numerous contradictions and the dialogue choppy and disjointed. For example, \\" Inside he discovered several francs totaling a great deal of money\\". I would hardly call several francs a fortune! The book jacket says that the author hopes to write 100 books before he turns 100.

I'm holding more hope for his subsequent books, however. This one was a flop: it starts out interesting with a thickening plot, but it loses steam and becomes exponentially ridiculous and cheesy. Some of the dialogue from Ashley to her son Jason made me want to gag. All of that \\"hun\\" talk is quite antiquated and unnecessary.

After reading reviews and the teaser on the back cover, I ran home expecting an original storyline. I was sorely mistaken. Everything about this book is totally cliche. The only comparison this book has to Jurassic Park or the Lost World is the fact that it has dinosaurs and an unrealistically invincible little kid as one of the main characters. The plot twists are entirely too predictable and more often than not way too convenient. Maybe I'm being too critical. I appear to be the first not to like this book, but if your looking for something more than what amounts to a predictable and routine B-movie in a book, my advice is to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous.

I love books that \\"read fast\\" and this one really fit that bill. Think \\"Jurassic Park\\" miles under the earth's surface and you've got the premise of this book. The characters were believable and likeable and the plot line had more twists and turns than an old wooden rollercoaster. You won't be disappointed (especially if you enjoy Crichton and Cussler)and if you're like me, you will eagerly await the next work by James Rollins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly awful!","review":"Terrible! Sounded good from the synopsis - a hidden world beneath the polar ice caps, and a team put together to go explore when another team goes missing - but the characters were so wooden and annoying that I fervently hoped all of them would die, violently, at the hands (well, teeth) of the T-Rex type creatures who live in the underground world. You had the stereotypical tough-gal single mom who brings her brat with her, the oh-so-hunky military guy she eventually beds, and the evil Arabic archetype who wants to blow everything up. I can't even bother to give more detail than that; it's not worth it. I'm surprised I even finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor character development & research","review":"Pretty good plot but the character development is terrible and research is worse. Main character Ashley is a whiner you quickly grow to detest. Ben is a nerd. Poor research. Khalid is from Egypt, a country whose \\"lifeblood is oil\\". Egypt has very little oil production. Another scene has a character who tapes a bunch of bullets together and shoots them to cause a explosion. An impossible feat. Author has two SEALs he ranks as majors. No such rank in the navy, would be Lt. Commanders. Two Marine brothers calling each other \\"soldier\\". Marines call themselves \\"marine\\", never soldier. This just goes on and on.

Perfect escapism for the summer reading season. Like the author I'm also a caver so this book had even more appeal to me - it's why I bought it. Although I would go along with much of Rollins' cave/cavern descriptions and the flavor of \\"caving\\", I did take issue with some aspects of it: his descriptions of rappelling (not they way we typically do it), the wormholes (don't believe this one, there are really no such things and we don't use skateboards!! - the author clearly invented it for the sake of the storyline), the batteries for the lanterns tended to last forever (would love to have their light sources), and the characters moved through the caverns remarkably well and quickly with all their gear, etc. Nonetheless, allowing for this \\"poetic license\\" and even some predictable plotting, the book is still worth a read. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't sleep till I finished it!","review":"I've not read a book this exciting for 15 years!

When I read the reviews I was thinking of something like \\"At The Mountains of Madness\\" meets \\"Voyage to the Center of the Earth\\". What I got was a monster-slasher book with more hackneyed plot devices than I could count: the Muslim terrorist, the whining teenager, the Navy Seal searching for his brother. The sad thing is that the novel began well - he set up an interesting scenario.

The ending seemed rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first James Rollins book...","review":"And it won't be my last!What an adventure and what imagination!A true page turner!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Planet Of The Apes meets An Inconvenient Truth","review":"I really wish I had read some other Rollins work, because this book was bad, and it has steered me away from any of his other work. Perhaps he gets better with time, but his politics are obvious here. Man = bad, planet = good.Here's everything you need to know. The main character, a woman archaeologist, hates anything military with a passion, no reason offered. (ie. \\"ham-fisted military types\\") This irrational disdain sets the underlying tone of character interaction. Oh yeah, she's a marksman with any firearm. Huh?This is a stupid story with a totally unlikeable (bitchy) main character. Mother nature worshiping feminists will love it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might make a movie, but. . .","review":"I want to reiterate what others have said about Rollins needing to research the military more if he is going to use military characters - he had the same problem as Greg Hurwitz in Minutes to Burn - doesn't know anything about the SEALS, just knows they are the cool action heroes of the minute. Oh, yeah, and grammar is a GOOD thing. ;-) And, remembering the thread of your story. I listened to his book, Amazonia, and the audio edition was a lot of fun, with fewer flaws, so I guess he is improving. But, like so many of the adventure writers today - Matt Reilly, Jack de Brul - Rollins often reads like a fifth-grader telling a story, \\"And then this happened, and then this, and this, and. . .\\" Take a breath, create well-rounded characters, consult a reference book or two, and it will all come out well in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subterranean","review":"One of the worst books I've ever read, but am one of those that keep thinking it will get better as it goes along; well, this one didn't, would notrefer this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting, poor writing that lacks research","review":"I really wanted to like Subterranean, but the writing is poorly constructed, the characters lack any complexity, and there are many nuances in the story that display lack of research. For instance, Ben, and Australian cave guide, sometimes has an Aussie accent and colloquialisms in his speech and sometimes he speaks with American expressions and speech. Additionally, it is irritating when the author does not refer to the proper rank structure for the navy and marine corps. There are no privates or majors in the navy or marine corps, for instance, yet the story presents this. For all of the minor irritating factors about the narrative, the story is just not that compelling to read. It is a shame, for I love adventure stories. I would avoid this book like the plague. Instead, look toward Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child. Riptide and the Pendergast novels are superb thriller/action fiction reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"A somewhat decent thriller","review":"A team of specialists including paleoanthropologist Ashley Carter, her son Jason, spelunker Ben Brust, evolutionary biologist Linda Furstenburg and geologist Khalid Najmon (who is not what he seems) embark on a secrecy-shrouded mission to Antarctica, where a deep subterranean labyrinth has been discovered. There's red herrings and a romantic subplot between Ben and Ashley (as well as Khalid and Linda), and wild speculations about evolutionary pathways, marsupialism, what really killed the dinosaurs, and a completely underground thriving ecosystem where plants and fungi can be as deadly as animals.I loved Rollins's \\"Amazonia\\" but this book left me (no pun intended) cold. I didn't buy into Ben's ability to telepathically communicate with his ancestors. I might pick it up again from the library if I'm in the mood, but otherwise I wouldn't spend any money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author - My Favorite","review":"James Rollins is by far the best author I have every read a book by. I became a fan of his after reading \\"Amazonia\\". I have read every book he has ever written, some of the older books twice. I love his Sigma Force books, but I have to be honest and say that I wish he would write another novel like \\"Amazonia\\", \\"Excavation\\", etc. Like I said, I love his Sigma Force books too, but it would be great if he would write another adventure book with strange creatures, crazy locations, and the deadly situations that made me a huge fan in the first place. I will continue to buy and read everything he writes, but one more crazy adventure with unexplained animals would be great. To fans of James Rollins first books like \\"Amazonia\\", etc.: you should read James A. David's \\"Footprints of Thunder\\" and \\"Thunder of Time\\"; and to die hard Sigma Force fans, you should try David Lynn Golemon's \\"Event\\" and \\"Legend\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit Tedious","review":"I read the author's book Amazonia before I read Subterranean. About half way through Subterranean I realized that it was almost exactly the same story, only below ground. I wouldn't have minded this so much, but the book was full of endless chase scenes which were all very similar. About half the book could have been successfully edited out. It would have vastly improved the pacing. Also, a few of the plot devices and characters were absurd or trite, such as The Arab Terrorist, and The Helpless Woman. I found myself becoming more and more annoyed at the characters as the story continued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another underground sci fi book","review":"This is my fourth Rollins book, I can see a trend here. Same old plot just different place. Books always seem to start out with a good story line and then go deep into sci-fi or not believable discoveries. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting but flawed.","review":"Rollins has give us a book that is well written and keeps the reader's interest throughout. However, the book is flawed by the political correctness that is apparent from beginning to end. The bad humans bring a blight into the world they find. One of the characters is a stereotypical Arab terrorist. Rollins also makes comments about the Earth's environment that show he is a tree-hugger and has bought into the fiction that humans are creating dangers to that environment. The book would have been much more enjoyable without these PC overtones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn from this one, Mr. Rollins","review":"Characters make a story - hopefully Mr. Rollins will learn from his mistakes in this novel and put character before plot. Characters must evolve and grow throughout the course of a novel. These do not. Also, more accurate research Mr. Rollins, please! - or don't write about things you do not know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subterranean by James Rollins","review":"A great adventure that keeps you turning page after page. A little like Preston and Childs genre with a little sci-fi added."},{"rating":"1","title":"Torpedo Subterranean","review":"Book needed an editor with a sharp red pencil. Too wordy without adding to story. I find it to be a non-plausible scenario. Makes me wonder about all his other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Off Good, Ended Hokey","review":"Started off exciting, but took a turn for the worse. Struggled to finish the book. Had all the makings for a blockbuster action-packed thriller, but turned out to be hokey. The erect alligators, telepathic communication, naked half breed cave dwelling marsupials with Indonesian names, stereotypical characters, and contrived plot simply ruined the story. Rollins could have done so much better than this. But, as with all Rollins books it is always hit or miss. And, this one was definitely a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MODERN-DAY EDGAR RICE BURROUGHS! WOW!","review":"It's simply one of the best books in this dinosaur lovers age.

Its worth every penny from beginning to end, leaving with you wanting more - GUARANTEED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, fast paced, well written adventure!","review":"At first glance I thought that this was going to be a sci-fi type book, and I wasn't really interested. However, I soon found that I couldn't put it down. Excellent characters, writing, and description. Action well balanced with dialogue; the book came alive -- I couldn't put it down. I highly recomend it,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting new author arrives on the scene","review":"James Rollins is a fine new author. I wouldnt even try to compare \\"Subterranean\\" to \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\". An entirely different era, add modern technology, an obvious knowledge of the subject (cave exploration) to a tense semi-scifi adventure yarn, throw in a little romance and fantasy, and you have a whole new genre. I enjoyed this book immensely and read it in one day. Sincerely hope new books by this author will be forthcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced and suspenseful","review":"Excellent read. Rollins gives just the right amount of build up before unleashing the hidden things that were below the Earth. The only problem I have with Rollins is that he seems to always paint his military characters as stone cold figures with very little emotion. Overall, a great book and it was very suspenseful and kept you wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This book kept me on the edge of my seat. I love James Rollins style and his subject matter. I will definately be reading all of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Good Concept, But Poor Characters\\"","review":"The concept and the world beneath Antarctica was good. But I just could not get into the characters. Most of them were either bland or just not very likeable. Seemed to plod along in spots. Also, Mr. Rollins needs to do a better job at research. Majors as Navy SEALs. There are no majors in the United States Navy. It just got to the point where I didn't care what happened to the people involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, LOTS of weak follow up.","review":"I'm surprised at the reviews here. The worst comment I saw was, \\"Bad use of Astralian accent.\\" Nobody mentioned that the accent comes and goes at random. How about the characters' clear knowledge of day and night while 2 miles below ground? Anybody wonder how the natives came up with a 26-hour \\"day\\"? Apparently the author also decided that Australian aborigines somehow decended from marsupials!? You could also get a little annoyed with how incompetent Navy SEALS (and everyone else) are at holding onto their weapons. In one scene the heroine snatches a gun from the hero and snaps off a couple quick, accurate shots. A few chapters later she fires a pistol and the recoil jerks it out of her hand! Now, flaws aside, it was an entertaining book. I wish the editor had done more to pick out the poor logic to some of the script. If you are reading this review, keep in mind that many of the other reviewers start with, \\"I'm only 13 but...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun fast read","review":"I am a big fan of Rollins' Sigma force series and decided to give one of his other books a try. I was not disappointed. This book was extremely fast paced. There was a little character development but the story didn't need it and I'm glad he didn't waste time with it. Would recommend this book to anyone looking for a quick adventure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXPLOSIVE JOURNEY!!","review":"This is a very, very, interesting book!!! I highly recommend this book to anyone who's looking for a great fast-paced thriller!!! This book has it all, action, adventure, horror, humor, and romance! The character development is outstanding!! I read this book in only a few days and it was gripping from beginning to end!! Mr. Rollins please be writing another book just as exiciting as this one!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent inital effort","review":"Subterranean is an excellent potato chip book, nothing to heavy and can be gulped down in a brief time before one even realizes it's all gone. I found the romance between Ashley and Ben a bit contrived and forced, but the action is stupendous, and the plot is plausible enough to be believed. The author's training and knowledge in his field has assisted him in making a novel of high adventure and satisfying climaxes. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, predictable, forgettable characters, lousy editing","review":"I can't believe anybody would really like this book. For anauthor on this subject to forget about popular icons (the Jules Vernebook, the classic movie \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" and Wakeman's symphony) is inexcusable! The jacket was misleading \\"Travel to the Bottom of the Earth,\\" and they get nowhere near it. Editing was horrible - just read page 330, when Ashley says, \\"There's no telling how many...crak'en are...around Alpha Base.\\" Did somebody - like the author - forget that Ashley et.al. have been cut off from all communication from Alpha Base? Duh. The cliches are ridiculous, characters are soooo forgettable, plotting horrible. Pass this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Such a great imagination. Suspenseful.

SUBPAR AND BORING !","review":"WARNING: This adventure was so boring. I struggled with the first 180 pages, and I had to let it fly to the trash can. I guess some people loved it. It was not worth it in my opinion. I would say that when the first book, of an author, does not come out in hard back first, the publisher does not have confidence in the product. I may say, at first, this book was moving along. It kept my interest all the way up to page 133. The main character, Ashley, the team leader, was doing very well. Then all of a sudden, JR made the adventure go deep underground. It dragged, and dragged. Weak characters blew it for this book. I understand JR next book will be EXCAVATION; due out JULY 2000. I will not look for this book guys. His new one will have to drop in my lap at the book store.Last words to you is, \\" borrow SUB from your buddy,\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"This was the first Rollins book I read. The story line was decent, but could have been developed better. There was too much gore - much more than was necessary.The main thing that got me was all sex.

Some of the events didn't seem logical.It's not one I would read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are horrid imbeciles devoid of any insight or integrity.","review":"This book can be most accurately equated to an 18 ounce can vacuum sealed full of rat excrement. You should all drink a gallon of bleach right before passing out unto the freeway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy, and not in a good way","review":"While the plot of this book was for the most part decent popcorn reading (aside from a few plot holes), the main characters were rather stereotypical, lacking depth, and nearly moronic. I suppose this particularly applies to the female characters. One goes from the standard strong, intelligent, motherly persona to simplistic love-struck schoolgirl at the flick of a switch, while the other plays your ridiculously stereotypical ditsy obtuse damsel in distress (think Denise Richards in the James Bond flick \\"The World Is Not Enough\\"). I wasn't expecting this book to be particularly cerebral reading, but really?I was tempted to stop reading after what little bit of character development there was in the first third or so of the book (to give it a fair chance), and only continued on out of curiosity for the plot, which I suppose says something about that aspect.Or I was just bored, and didn't want to feel like I wasted the few dollars the book cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rollins' first book, and it shows...","review":"It's a good thing I was first introduced to James Rollins through Sandstorm and not Subterranean, otherwise, I probably wouldn't have bothered picking up another one of his novels. Subterranean started off interestingly enough but then it quickly devolved from an adventure story into a comic book caricature of Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth with the introduction of the humanoid marsupials into the picture. The book is not without merit, however, as Rollins is fairly adept at weaving several storylines and bringing them to a successful conclusion. I still recommend the book, if nothing else than for readrs to appreciate how Rollins has steadily improved his storytelling abilities with his subsequent works."},{"rating":"1","title":"First 180 pages were good...but....","review":"I liked the 1st 180 pages of this book as pure escapist entertainment. The setting was interesting and I thought the author did a good job of putting the reader into it. The characters were at least adequate for the escapist nature of the book. But then...the author went of the deep end with some pretty hokey ESP stuff, and from then on I just couldn't buy any of the developments(unfortunately, I had already bought the book.) I also found it a bit disturbing that the author glossed over the marsupial-to-aboriginal Australians connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain silly","review":"I can not believe all the good reveiws! I stuck with it to finish it, hoping it would get better but it never did. Rollins is trying to copy Edgar Rice Burroughs but fails miserably. The 'monsters' and the 'little folk' even remind me of an old Tarzan movie! But Burroughs did it MUCH better. Stereotypical characters who fall flat. Sorry I wasted my time and money on this. Just plain silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for class lectures","review":"I use this recorder exclusively for class lectures and could not be happier. Most important feature I was looking for was clarity in a large room. I was very impressed with the sound quality. The recorder does not have to be anywhere near the professor to pick up their voice perfectly! I bought one of the cheaper sony recorders first, it was about $50, and returned it because the sound quality was terrible. For me this one is worth the money because I am recording from a distance. It's also very compact and easy to use. Definitely recommend it for students!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"I purchased the product for tape recording lectures in school.

Sometimes, the extemporaneous parts of a book bring as much flavor to the text as the overall story itself. In this case, however, the extra information handed out by \\"Slade\\" accomplishes nothing but bringing the book to a painfully grinding, wisdom tooth extracting halt. A hundred pages could've been removed from the story without anything being lost, and it might've made things more interesting. I'm new to \\"Slade's\\" work, so maybe this isn't a new thing, but there were times when it seemed that the author was including information just to show that they've done some actual research on the subject matter.

Of all the books out there, I can think of no conceivable reason for anyone to ever bother picking up this piece of crap and attempting to read it.

Well it certainly wasn't written to contribute to any further character development of the characters in his previous novels.The novel is the author's worst work to date, and I say that having actually enjoyed most of his previous novels. There is really no story here and most of the book is filled with historical notes few of which are germaine to the plot. There are a lot of fantasies and flashbacks to previous Michael Slade novels.Overall the book is boring and nearly unreadable. It certainly convinced me not to look forward to any other novels from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Putrid","review":"A vast, empty train wreck.

Absolutely the best analysis of the Southern mindset that I have ever encountered -- I'm a native -- and a dangerously funny read to boot. Ms. King writes with a caustic wit wrapped in an ever-so-delicate velvet glove. I quote her insights often, and almost always end up having to get yet another copy to give to someone.

The book is certainly well-written, probably by and large accurate (but how can this Yankee know for sure), deeply perceptive, and generally entertaining, but it is also overly and unnecessarily vulgar. The author clearly delights in defining various Southern types using sexual imagery, depicted at times delicately, at times indelicately, and at times crudely. It is these crude parts I take exception to.Perhaps the author seeks to emphasize that beneath Southern gentility lies crudeness. I, on the other hand, emphasize that beneath crudeness lies gentility. And it's not just my preference, it's a fact.Sorry, I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete Bridges in this reprinted First Edition","review":"This is a reprint of the 1st edition (1914); Bridges continued writing until his death in 1930.

The sound is horrible; better gun sound effects were routinely used on TV in the 70's.I'm a big creature nut and that's why I ignored the warnings, took the plunge and paid $3.45 for a used copy.

Having a love for most fantasy, monster and horror films for over 50 years, my bottom line review of this film is: I literally threw out the DVD after watching the film (rather than make someone else suffer by buying it used)! The derivative plot and horrible CGI make this the reigning king of the worst lost world movies ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZERO STARS OUT OF FIVE!","review":"This movie is atrocious. The acting is bad, the plot is bad, but the thing I cant forgive is the absence of the gorilla. I love killer gorilla movies so much, I recorded it on my dvr.

I've seen and played video games from 1999 with better graphics. I instantly deleted the film, but the King of the lost world will forever leave a stench on the memory drive of my dvr.

Now, I won't go into details since many other reviewers already gave the basic plot. This movie looked like it was made by drunk college students. Like many sci-fi lovers, I sometimes like a good 'bad' movie. This was waaaaay beyond bad. Save your cash. Like a previous reviewer I won't even sell this to another person.

It is really a survival story.

Still, it is fun sometimes to watch these hokey 1950's style drive-in movies. This one is not for little kids because of the language and that one woman's top is unbuttoned by the tribe members.

It's called 'compact' because the bottom part accordians out to reveal 4 additional slots for batteries. It feels cheaply made, and doesn't hold the batteries very securely. Also, you have to charge two batteries at a time (or sets of 2), and they are inserted in opposite directions. So, if you're charging 4 batteries in 2 sets of two, they would be + - + -. I realize that's how most devices are set up when you insert the batteries, but I shouldn't have to worry about that when inserting into a charger, especially since (according most warning labels on batteries) inserting it in the charger backwards may cause an explosion resulting in injury or death. That's a lot of pressure for someone who just wants more juice for his Gameboy.Ultimately, it does what it says though.

I thought she was giving me some kind of religious book and I don't do those, well wasn't I most pleasantly suprised when I finally started reading it and I am sure that if you like a little mystery, intrigue and a little suspense with lots of action right from the very beginning then this will be a book that you may very well enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follett's Worst Offering To Date","review":"This is the least inspiring offering by Follett since \\"The Big Needle\\" in 1978. It is poorly conceived and poorly written. It contains the earmark characters that appear in most Follett adventures, now in the guise of aging American hippies. It is obvious the author knows little about American culture, despite claiming a great deal of research.

The Hammer of Eden contains none of the character devices, which Follet used in his past books to capture the reader's attention, such as espionage and deceit. Sure, The Hammer of Eden has the classic Follet plot, with revolutionary elements and told from the point of view of the antagonist. But this book falls short of some of his classic masterpieces such as Triple, Eye of the Needle, Key to Rebecca, and Night Over Water.I believe Follet needs to stick to his greatest gift, writings of espionage, instead of the contemporary time period and Eco-terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epic waste of time","review":"When a writer is out of ideas, he writes about characters. And when he has no characters, he writes the Hammer of Eden. A briefly intriguing idea is lost through lackluster plotting, flat characters and painfully inadequate dialogue. The idea of a terror group actually causing an earthquake with a seismic measuring truck is just so preposterous that no suspension of belief is possible. Throw in a hippie commune, a female FBI agent and a bunch of forgettable characters, and you actually feel sorry for the trees that were sacrificed for this production.

A \\"Dangerous Fortune\\" is genious. \\"Hammer of Eden\\" is better than \\"Third Twin\\" but this is like saying coming in 87th place is better than 90th! This book is not what I expect from Ken Follett, he is a much better writer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely shameful!","review":"Ken Follet should be ashamed to have his name on the cover of this predictable, childish, uninventive, bland, and stupid book!

Follett is one of my favorite authors, but this book doesn't even seem to have been written by him. It reads like it was written for a cheeseball action movie. It would probably appeal to a high school level boy. Follett has written some fabulous books, too many to mention.

I tried several times to bear with this and give him the benefit of doubt. Unfortunately, my doubts were well founded. I just couldn't believe this was the same author. Never saying anything to my husband, we were talking about books just last night, and he said, \\"do you know the strangest book I've read recently?\\", you've got it! He is also a fan of Mr. Follett's. I enjoyed all of his others, especially \\"Eye\\" and \\"Pillars\\". In \\"Hammer\\", the plot, the characters and writing were very sophmoric.

The plot was interesting, but it just never grabbed the reader and got them involved in the storyline. The main villan just seems like another everyday psycho. What happened to the excellent espionage that Follet used to write?The strong and caring relationship between the FBI daughter and the SFPD father was a definite positive for this book.If you are a true-blue Follet fan, you will make it to the end of this book albeit with the hope that it gets better as you go along."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Attempt At A Comeback From \\"The 3RD Twin\\"","review":"I had truly hoped this book would be better than the awful \\"The 3RD Twin\\", but I was wrong.

Now, with \\"Hammer\\" following \\"The 3rd Twin\\", he looks to be coasting, at best. This book is boring, the premise is tenuous, and the characters are shallow. Even his trademark spicy sex is humdrum. The good reviews of this book by \\"professional\\" reviewers are simply showing deference to the author - undeserved.

This is an entertaining thriller to read while you're on a plane or at the beach but Ken Follett can write so much better.I actually had the same feeling after finishing \\"Eden's\\" predecessor, \\"The Third Twin\\", which was that Mr. Follett did a very superficial job on the story. It could have been a good thriller but it's way below his usual standard.Read \\"Triple\\", \\"Pillars\\", \\"Needle\\" or anything else except Ken Follett's first two and last two novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"Having read a few of Ken Follett's books, including Eye of the Needle, Pillars of the Earth and a Place Called Freedom, I have to admit to already being a fan of this author. I was not disappointed with this latest read, a book which I found difficult to put down from the very beginning. The idea, although completely fictional became quite plausible as the storyline unravelled. (It also helped to have been in San Francisco last year)When I read a book by a new author and thoroughly enjoy it, I try a few others and often find the storyline becomes very similar. Other author's I fell into this trap with were Jean Auel and John Grisham. Now I realise these are quite different genres, but in each of these instances I became quite bored after reading a few of each of these authors books. With Ken Follett though, each is completely different in content, but very easy to read and difficult to put down. I look forward to reading some more. Thanks Ken. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard To Put Down...Very Entertaining!!","review":"My first read of Ken Follett, and I was not disappointed. The storyline here is great and very plausible in today's world. The novel will and should make a great movie. The main characters are well-developed and easy to both love & hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"!Yea this guy is a fruit cake!\\"","review":"My response to this review is that I disagree with this person's review. I think that even though California may be earthquake country that there is no reason why anyone could create earthquakes. The book is not fast but it isn't slow but on the other hand I don't think it is thought out. The book doesn't really allow you to use your own imagination it tells the story in to much detail so that the readers can't think for themselves. I don't think that what happened in this book can actually happen in real life because sending something down into the earth to create and earthquake is fictional and just can't happen. Its not really a good book since it does show how terrible terrorists can be and since these people are from the U.S. it is even worse to know that these people are in the states. I just think overall this is a bad"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying to attract a younger reader?","review":"I believe I have read most of Follett's books. Pillars of the Earth, as I have read here, is also one of my all time favorite books. But Hammer of Eden, while it has an almost believable plot, and he gets you to almost like the hippies, is just too full of the f-word. Perhaps he is trying, like so many other contemporary authors, to attract the younger crowd. But for this woman 'of a certain age' it will be the last Follett I will purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A welcome change - a good read.","review":"Just finished reading 'The Hammer of Eden\\" and it kept me riveted from beginning to end.

Otherwise I think I will stop reading his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This awful book is unlike most of his earlier work.","review":"I only add my voice to the chorus of disapproval of this book in order to vent my disgust that Follett would so utterly disappoint his loyal following. How the genius who wrote the chilling \\"Eye of the Needle\\", the suspenseful \\"Triple\\", the splendid \\"Man from St. Petersburg\\" (my favourite work), and the classic \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" could write such amateurish drivel baffles the mind. The plot is ludicrous and the characters are absolutely implausible (a psychopathic protagonist who only wants to keep his idyllic commune in the wine-making business for another 25 years?) I have read all of Follett's work and loved them all except the sub-standard \\"The Third Twin\\" but this is the first one I could not get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even close to his best work.","review":"I've read every single book Follet has written and loved them all.

The leader is so smart but never learned to read or write. With his smarts he should have know how important reading and writing are and should have been able to pick it up rather easily. He can make everyone like him, both men and women. From what is written I don't see it. I understand about office politics but for all that Judy accomplished she would not have been overlooked on any level. That is just the first part of the book. Very stereotypical the way she is smarter than her superiors. So many of the characters are stereotypes (the people in the commune and the members of the FBI, for example). The novel is well written, but this novel is just a total waste of time with an unbelievable story and unbelievable characters.

I mean, the man gave the plot away in the bloody title!). Anyway, I actually came on-line to see if I was missing something!What has happened to Follett with his last two books? So commercial, his characters are totally unbelievable ... it's like he is in love with them himself.I'll borrow his next from the library so I don't waste my money ... you know, just in case he hasn't been reading his reviews and doesn't go back to his \\"Pillar\\" days (please God)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag me!","review":"As a fan of Follett's books, this one is a disappointment. I suspect that he was short of cash when this one went to press. It has little of the quality, in-depth character portrayal that I've seen in his other books and the story line is pure fantasy, not just fiction. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The novel equivalent of a stale Big Mac eaten in a hurry.","review":"After the magnificence of Pillars of the Earth, the pretty-goodness of Eye of the Needle, and the not-badness of several of his other novels, this one is clearly at the bottom of the heap. The story and characters are ridiculously implausible. It is the kind of thing that reads as if it were hatched by an author who found himself with a one-week deadline to write a book, and had to do so while on a skiing vacation in Aspen (would that I had such a life). It is formulaic to the point that it feels a bit like stuffing oneself with a stale Big Mac while driving in rush hour traffic (not that I've ever done that). Neither tasty nor satisfying, and certainly not memorable. After a string of Follett novels, this one made me leap for someone new. I'm trying Ethan Canin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hammer of Eden","review":"Some of Follett's books have captivated me for weeks after I finished them.

I've read all his works. The last three books . . . to be honest, I really suffered getting through them. I kept thinking it was a phase. I don't think I'll buy another Follett book again. He has totally sold out, or is dead and they got some kid using his name making up these idiotic stories. I feel like an idiot because I have read it and now I'm wasting my time writing this review. In fact, I think I've put more energy into this review than Ken did with this book.

So, when I pulled out this book on tape and saw, to my dismay, that it was by the same author I was expecting garbage.Boy, was I wrong. This is a fast-paced thriller with loads of office politics and just a touch of romance to keep the pot stirring. There were laugh out load moments, such as when Agent Maddox busts through her potential boyfriend's door.Was the plot feasible? Doubtful. But, it was still interesting and I enjoyed it thoroughly.The tape was very well-performed by Anthony Heald (perhaps best known as the Assistant Principal on Boston Public). five stars for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting bad guys","review":"The main villian is an illiterate, con-man, barely competent thief and murderer. And Follett managed to make me actually like the guy. The plot is believable when you take into account the great skills of the FBI managing the Chineese atomic spy case current now, or the grand manner in which they investigated the Branch Davidians in Texas.The complaints in the other reviews can be summarized as \\"this one is different, not historical, not England.\\" It is contemporary California and that is not all bad. Take this book on its own merits. It is a fun read and you get your money's worth for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News","review":"I sympathise with the editor of Hammer Of Eden who had to stifle the urge to re-write Follett's terrible prose.

Given Mr. Follett's previous works, this is a complete disappointment. The writing seems to be that of a female ghost writer, with lines like, \\"he was a dish\\" used to describe one of the characters in the book. If there is a need to read any of Follett's work, try Pillars of the Earth instead of this farce."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Follet's books but The Hammer of Eden is boring.","review":"I've read all of Follet's previous books and enjoyed all of them. The Hammer of Eden, however, is disappointing. The central character, a former criminal turned cult-leader, is not very bright or engaging. In fact, all of the characters, except the FBI agent and her father, seem one-dimensional and lifeless. Her mean-spirited bosses are cartoons. They're not real or believable. The story centers around the cult-leaders attempts at stopping the governor of California from destroying the land that is occupied by the wine-producing commune. The cult-leader steals a \\"seismic vibrator\\" and induces earthquakes. Somehow, it just doesn't ring true. Follet seemed to phone this one in.

It's hard to believe that this book was written by the author who wrote such gems as _Eye of the Needle_ and _Pillars of the Earth_. The plot of this book is derivative, predictable, and incredible (in the literal sense). The characters are cardboard, the dialog is wooden, and the action appears to be written with movie special effects in mind. The book is, at least, mercifully short. Don't waste your money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A scientifically inaccurate movie script","review":"This is definitely not one of Follett's better efforts. I agree with Mr. Blake that it's not a novel, but rather a movie script. Also, the main plot device, that a seismographic truck could cause an earthquake, is false. The energy that a truck could exert on a fault is a function of the mass of the truck, which is miniscule in seismological terms. If a fault were so unstable that this small amount of energy would trigger an earthquake, the small earthquakes which are common in California would have triggered it long ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ken Follett..some hack has assumed your identity.","review":"A reviewer on Oct. 21 gave this 5 stars and read it in 5 hours.

The lace was scratchy, the cups were too big, and it was *incredibly* hard to put on.The first might have been helped by washing it, and the second suggests that I might need something other than my usual size. But given that I would only be able to wear it when I has someone to help me get dressed, it wasn't worth going through a cycle of exchanges to try.Mind you, all of those things have also been true of other long-line bras I've tried.

We can't take it all on board - but we take on as much as we can - what's more the proof has been in how our Users respond to our software. They isolate the very things we include from the books suggestions and they love it! Alan - where's the sequel?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating a GUI lexicon","review":"About Face is worth having if you are a computer programmer developing GUI's, especially if you are developing in Windows. What I appreciated about it, and most other reviewers here have failed to mention, is that it develops a vocabulary for talking about user interfaces. Alan presents and defines a whole language for talking about user interface design. By setting forth a language it is much easier to verbalize concepts that didn't seem so concrete before, existing as they did only in the realm of ideas. Unfortunately, Alan's language formalization is not as well developed in some areas as it is in others and Alan makes no claim to having developed the ultimate language for talking about GUI design. Nevertheless, it does make a start down a very important road toward making GUI design a true software discipline and one that we can actually talk about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought it was great THEORY","review":"If you want to use this book as a cookbook to help you create better Win apps, then it is dated. If you want some of the vision behind the trends in Windows architecture, then it is great.Despite the advent of Swing with Java and Visual Studio.NET, the principles of GUI design have not really changed, and Alan Cooper's wisdom is still directly applicable!Easy to read, very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sophmoric, Disjointed, Overly Creative","review":"I bought this book thinking that it might be something that I could give to our programmers to help them in designing our software. The book is written in a style akin to James Joyce. He creates a whole ration of new concepts (ie, \\"what I call 'Interrogation Mode', 'Windows Pollution,' or 'preference threshholding'). He seems to have failed to read \\"Apples Guide to Human Interface,\\" and missed the point of a GUI. He has so many DO's and DON'Ts listed that a programmers DOESN'T know what to do. Although \\"Apple's Guide to Human Interface\\" is MacCentric, you would be much better off reading it and applying the concepts to your program."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After reading all the hype about this book in many publications that should know about this stuff, I bought a copy. This book is highly overrated. I learned absolutely nothing new about designing software. The press passed this guy off as a visionary...I'm sorry, but I just can't agree. He brings nothing visionary to the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short on concrete, ***********","review":"Its been some time since I read this book, but my lasting impression is that it is not very useful -- it's a 400 page ad for hiring him as a consultant -- based on promises alone.He describes writing a UI design document based, not on roles people play (not directly), but inventing \\"real\\" people with concrete skills and characteristics, imbedding stock photo in the document to make the \\"person\\" more real. Good idea to enhance UI Use Case type documents.But the book contains no examples. Only abstract statements. What does a good UI document look like? How detailed should it be?I contacted him via email to obtain so concrete examples. He refused claiming his examples are owned by his clients. I responded suggesting simplification to remove identifying info or he (or I) getting permission from the client for some limited access. No response.Is he for real? Does he have concrete examples? Prove it!! Or is he just blowing smoke."},{"rating":"1","title":"read Ben Shneiderman, Don Norman & Jakob Nielson, not this.","review":"Cooper kvetches too much.

He uses words like 'stupid', 'idiocy', 'dunderhead', 'idiots' and other colorful metaphors. He spends 80% of the text complaining a criticizing, but falls short of offering constructive criticism or recommended alternatives. The book read like a long venting of his personal views. This is not what I was looking for, and I'm going to toss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for the \\"Know it all\\" Developer","review":"I found this book extremely refreshing.Firstly, this book gives Microsoft (and other vendors) a well-deserved swift kick for some of the hideous ideas they've implanted into the minds of programmers.Secondly it challenges the way you think about how applications and humans interact, hopefully popping the balloon that has grown in the minds of far too many developers. Cooper begins by ripping your heart out---saying that everything you've believed in is garbage. Then, he shows you new ways to think about designing applications and their interfaces. By the end of the book, you are, hopefully, a more enlightened developer.Judging the tone of some of the other reviewers, I would recommend that the book, \\"The Psychology of Computer Programming\\", should also sit next to this one on your shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, but still worth a look","review":"I have to agree with those who have criticized this book. Cooper seems to think that EVERYTHING is wrong in typical UI design, and the somewhat haphazard way he goes about presenting his criticisms and solutions fails to form a cohesive argument. High expecations were not fulfilled. Nonetheless, there were some very intriguing concepts peppered throughout the book, and anyone who hasn't thought about UI design AT ALL will certainly benefit from reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"More is less","review":"About Face is largely a rant about examples of ineffective user interface design, with regular breaks along the way to expound upon some \\"golden rules\\" of user interface design. There's plenty here that's worthwile -- such as as hisarguments against the notions of \\"metephor is good\\" and \\"modal is bad\\" -- but it is spoilt by his poor writing style. Whereas Edward Tufte can concisely illuminate just the important elements, Cooper will labour for page after page over trivial points and then insist on trying to summate more complex interactions and subtle distinctions with clunky and trite generalisations. The examples and analogies are regularly unconvincing and sometime completely incorrect, such as when he tries to tell us the telephone was invented for business use. At nearly 600 pages, it's delivery ironicly echos one of its central points about user interfaces: more is less"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful when compared to other books.","review":"There are better books on user interface design, that are shorter, and have more information. This book complains too much about too little, without actually providing any helpful answers or useful suggestions. Try \\"Design of Everyday Things\\" by Donald A. Norman for a great starting point in user interface design. \\"TOG on Interface\\" by Bruce \\"TOG\\" Tognazzini is another better starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"ole is bitter when it comes to THE MAN","review":"Ole saying Flair is not a worker is a joke.....Ole sure could hold a headlock for ten minutes but Flair could keep eveyone on the edge of their seats for 60 minutes.

There are very few wrestlers nowdays (basically four: A.J. Styles, Shawn Michaels, Kurt ANgle and Chris Benoit) who could even hold their own with prime Flair.Most of the rest are all products of Vince McMahon's sad circus that he passes off as Wrestling."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book about how the past was so much better than today","review":"I used to admire Ole; however after reading these ramblings you can only feel sorry for him. This is really a case of some one who believes the world was better when we had ink pots and quills, rather than email, that the pneumatic tyre should not have replaced the steel rim.Ole, repeats and repeats him, stories are disjointed and jump over the time span time and time again. You get the feel for the book after the first third, the rest just keeps repeating. I read this straight after Terry Funks Biography \\"More than hard core\\" which a well constructed read was in chronological order.There is a lot of wrestleing history here, but i suspect it may be a little biased"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing Book, Poorly Written","review":"This is the kind of book that gives you a ton of useless classes to install on your system, along with about 50 pages of how to install the ... on your computer. If you don't watch it or read the fine print, one of the IDE's that the accompanying cd installs, will go and screw up your classpath during its install. The simple installing procedure to install some jar files is so complicated that you will spend a half a day getting it installed. And once it is installed the docs, make it impossible to generate the docs you need to use the stuff.From the beginning of the book, there is no smooth transition about how to use java, it just jumps all over the place. The examples you are suposed to do in chapter 2, ask you to do IO things which aren't even covered until chapter 8....? Why do people do that?The writer of the book did not take the end-user into account, but just wrote to get the job done.It is a terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid if you actually want to learn something","review":"If your aim is to actually learn to code java avoid this book. The book is needlessly complicated and long winded, managing to confuse you even with simple concepts, let alone complicated ones. I was forced to look up concepts the book was trying to explain on the internet and would never have understood any of them if my only resource was this book. Another thing, there are also no answers for end of chapter questions, making working them out a futile effort.The only reason I used, or tried to use, this book was because it was part of the syllabus for an advanced java module. I ended up using the SCJP book by Kathy Sierra which was much more clear and to the point(it covers most of the material in this book).

The light given off is very dim if light does light. They are worthless as any type of light other than a faint glow from the amber glass panels. You will break a leg if you rely on these to light your path. I ended up gutting the light and wireing the fixture with an extension cord and a plug in socket and a 4 watt night light. now they light adding a soft usable light that will last more than an hour or two, not a very green idea but with a dusk/dawn sensor these are now usable. without rewireing them they are junk, attractive but junk.

We noticed that they were actually trying to turn on around 4pm when it was still light out (poor design) and therefore, by the time it was dark enough out to want to see them, they had used most of their charge and usually only stayed on for about 1 hour after it was dark (if they had received a full charge in bright sun).After one year, we gave up on these Malibu lights and bought the Target brand solar lights that looked the most similar - which put out brighter light, stay on much longer, light up even on foggy days, and are only about $34 for FOUR lights. My parents and two sets of friends have had the Target solar lights (I think they're manufactured by Brinkman) for over two years and are thrilled with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful But Buy the Low Voltage Version","review":"5 stars for style. 1 star for performance. These put out very little light. Even with a full day of sun the battery life is short. Very disappointing.

There is very little of interest in the childhood years and that part of the book is mercilessly padded out with endless descriptions of houses, furnishings and distant relatives. It is much more interesting when we get to Roosevelt's political career and life in the wild west, but that is a relatively small part of the book. I belong to a book discussion group which had this as a selection, and the members agreed that it could be cut by about 40%-50% with very little loss. In any case it is of interest only to people with an indefatigable hunger for details about Roosevelt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable account of TR's early social life","review":"This was a fun and quick read that makes me want to study more about the great man known as TR. Be aware, however, that fully half of the book is about TR's father and his career as a prominent, socially conscious New York businessman.

The connection is weak at best.The book should be classified as historical fiction. An average read in that category. But as a supposed non-fiction book it rates only a 1 because it is false.So, average rating, a 2, but that is generous considering the fact that it is really a bunch of lies based on a few facts.

Amazon made this book recommended reading a few months back and I've put it on my recommended reading list for January 1998.After comparing to many others the book is obviously the best of its class. It professes to teach you mainstream techniques and it does so with flying colors. This book and Stanek's FrontPage 98 Unleashed are the only two books I've ever given a 5-star recommendation to! If that doesn't say it all, I don't know what does.Buy this book, you'll to learn Web publishing techniques that you can use now.

I DON'T KNOW. BUT I CAN GUESS THAT PERHAPS THE READER IS ACTUALLY AN AUTHOR OF A COMPETING BOOK. THE PROOF IS IN THE PUDDING OR SO THEY SAY. WITH THIS BOOK THE PROOF IS IN THE WRITING. MR. STANEK HAS A LONG-STANDING REPUTATION FOR WRITING EXCELLENT BOOKS. HIS TECHNICAL BACKGROUND IS EXCEPTIONAL! THIS BOOK IS EXCEPTIONAL!STANEK PUBLICLY DISPLAYS HIS MODEST RESUME AND BACKGROUND ON HIS WEB SITE FOR ALL THE WORLD TO SEE.

As for the book itself, it offers a lot, however, most of the chapters are not even written by Stanek! In trying to cover too much, the book fails miserably in that it does not cover each element thoroughly. I would recommend it as a door stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE RETURNED IT;-(","review":"I don't care for this one at all and should have returned it, but thought it might be good to keep around for a reference. It serves poorly in this capacity, however, for while considerable information is presented, it is sequestered in so much extraneous verbiage that finding what you are looking for is a chore. Ironically I later went to my local bookstore and procured Elizabeth Castro's Visual Quick Start Guide to keep handy at the desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...Well organized and well written!","review":"As an editor I know a great book when I see one. Simply put you won't find a better Web book that is easier to read. A decade of professional writing experience clearly shows in Stanek's work and if it didn't, his books wouldn't be the top-sellers that they are. Stanek has a long professional career writing books and magazines. I've read his work in PC Magazine, Dr. Dobbs and many other well-respected computer magazines.When it comes to meeting the needs of Web publishers, I haven't found a book that offers more than Web Publishing Unleashed Prof. Ref. The book weighs in at a heft 1500 pages, making it the largest Web book I have ever seen. Webster's Dictionary is large too, but I wouldn't exactly call it a great book, useful certainly but not great. So what makes Web Publishing Unleashed Prof. Ref stand out from the crowd? The answer is the author's clear and authoritative style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful author promotion","review":"I was suspicious about all of these glowing reviews (strange that they all sound alike and are from \\"a reader\\") so I decided to look at this book at the library before spending big bucks for it. I'm glad I did. The book is detailed and covers an incredible amount of material but it is too much for most people to follow. I have seen many other books on the market that are easier to follow and are just as detailed. Stanek may know his stuff but his writing falls short. Unless you do web pages for a living, I'd go with another title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.

Enough said"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand, easy to read, and interesting!","review":"Why read any other book when this one has everything you need? I've seen books like the 10 Minute Guide to Stylesheets and often wonder why the heck anyone would buy that junk. Why pay $19.95 for every HTML subject you want to learn? Recently I saw a book covering shylesheets, tables and frames for $39.95. Again I had to ask myself why?You don't need 10 different books covering tables, frames, stylesheets, applets, and all that other stuff. You only need one book and this is the one. Even if you've already got those 10 other books on your bookshelf, you will be much happier with this book. It is well-written and full of insights. I like it and recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Thumbs Up!","review":"I must've looked at 20 different Web publishing books before I found this gem! This is the only book that covers everything you need to know to go from a complete beginner to top-notch webmaster.

Stanek really knows his stuff and that is not hype, that is the plain and simple truth"},{"rating":"2","title":"Polished, professional AND truly awesome!","review":"Don't let the price tag scare you away from THE best Web publishing and Design book on the market today! At 1500-pages, Web Publishing Unleashed Professional covers MORE ground than 3 or 4 regular computer books. TOTAL coverage of the issues is what this book is all about. Stanek does a great job of explaining HTML 3.2, CSS Stylesheets, tables, frames and lots of other subjects. The book also has several contributors BUT fortunately, Stanek did most of the writing AND it is his words you want to key in on. He really knows his stuff--and that's not hype, that's reality. Whether you've got 1 Web book or 100 Web books already, get this book, you'll learn so much it is incredible"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Teach Yourself HTML in 14 days","review":"Great book, Stanek topped Lemay--and I've been reading Lemay books since Teach Yourself HTML in a Week.

Buying this book is like getting 10 for the price of 1--its 1500 pages cover Web publishing, Web site design, graphic design, HTML 3.2, Java, CGI, VRML, ActiveX, and Web scripting THOROUGHLY. You'll find tons of tips on Web and graphic design, boosting visual impact of Web pages, and more"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you EVER wanted to know about Web publishing","review":"If you want to create a cool Web site, this is the onlybook you'll need. This book teaches design as well as practical application. Stanek even lays out a step by stepplan for designing and publishing what he calls a \\"killer Web site\\" -- and, his book explained all this long before anyone dreamed up books on high-level Web site and graphic design. In short, for total and comprehensive coverage of Web publishing, Web design, graphic design, and Web site creation using all the latest techniques, get this book. (not sure if I put this in the right place the first time, there's lots of comments on the soft-cover edition of this book)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I never bought this book!","review":"If I could give this book a lower rating than one star, I would. I made the mistake of following the reviews on this page, so I'd like to set the record straight. To call this book a professional reference is a joke, it is padded out with chapters on using such 'professional' software as Netscape Navigator Gold and Microsoft Internet Assistants. The first and last time I opened this book was on the day it arrived 6mths ago. Any worthwhile content is surrounded by junk and makes the book completely unwieldy. If you know nothing about web publishing, you may gain an education from this book but before you finish it you too will be looking for something lighter to lift but heavier on serious content! I can't get rid of this book soon enough. Buy the HTML Sourcebook (Graham) instead - but you serious developers already know to do that anyway...."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best resources I've ever encountered.","review":"this book is the sum of all knowlage about Web Publishing and site management. this book delves into mysteries from how to use HTML to how to get those pages to load faster and easier... and more.

But I strongly suggest you check this title out at your local bookstore or library before spending your hard earned money. This book was outdated long ago and contains many errors. This author writes terribly. This publisher needs to employ a good editor. I suspect the raves are fallacious and a ruse. Amazon should investigate why a title that has not been on their computer best seller list for ages has so many more reviews than other more well proven titles, as allowing this nonsense to continue impeaches their credibility considerably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced and lacking in content","review":"This book tries to cover everything and in doing so, severely limits the amount of information that the reader needs for comprehensive coverage. The book is vastly overpriced and much more detailed information can be found in numerous less pricy books that are out on the market today. I would not recommend this book - it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof is in the pudding","review":"An author writing a book on a particular subject should know his subject, right? In this case, wrong! I went to Mr. Stanek's personal web site and he has white writing on white background! Duh, no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boo Hiss!!","review":"IMHO; this book tries to do too much and ends up doing none of it very well. The text will sail over the heads of most beginners while at the same time not deal with advanced topics thoroughly enough to be very useable. If you're a beginner looking to learn the basics, check out Liz Castro's fine work. If you are an advanced user looking for in depth info about topics such as Java Script, VB Script,VRML, etc., get a book targeting your specific needs. This one may wet your whistle, but you'll end up needing to supplement it in the long run. This book would be good if it was the only one of its kind available. But its not, and others are better.

I was dissapointed. The songs on Apurimac II all sound alike, not a single track posesses any kind of depth, the sound textures are plastic, and the melodies are trite. The track \\"Quetzal's Feather\\", in particular, sounds a lot like a cheesy 1980s TV show theme song.

It was easy to use and seemed to adhere the new headliner quite well. However, within about 2 years the adhesive has failed, and the headliner is again sagging. I suspect it failed due to the heat that can result from the sun on the truck roof. Admittedly, I am located in Hawaii so have a more intense sun than most, but the truck is garaged and only rarely is out in direct sun for hours at a time. Regardless, it proved unsuitable for that use.For less demanding projects where heat is not an issue, this probably is a fine spray adhesive, although it seems a bit expensive for a general purpose adhesive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this watch!","review":"I bought this watch 3 months ago. The watch was listed at $375.00 but sold for $92.00. Sound like a bargain? Think again.

I have had to make corrections to the time and date so often the stem just fell off. I contacted AMAZON who told me to contact CROTON. CROTON wanted me to send the watch and $25.00 to \\"tune it up\\". Call me silly but why should a brand new watch need a tune up and why should I pay them to fix a brand new $375.00 watch?

Spanning almost 30 years the 45 selections here has not only well known themes (The Good The Bad And The Ugly, Once Upon A Time In America, The Untouchables, Bugsy) but also some obscure themes as well (The Hawks And The Sparrows, Sacco & Vanzetti, The Garden Of Delights). Hats off to Rhino for producing such a solid and diverse collection of movie themes. I whole heartedly recommend it for those who even have the slightest interest in Ennio Morricone. You will be rewarded many times over. Long live il Maestro!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Self Help","review":"Kian Dwyer's book truly is beyond self help. This how to book shows how we can make a difference our own way and bring love, peace, and compassion into the world by living with integrity. Kian's writing is simply put, easy to absorb, yet so incredibly powerful. I've read it twice and refer to different chapters from time to time. I am married with two boys and find her motivational, spiritual book an inspiration. The book is a great companion and has helped me with my family and work relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Don't waste your time on this so called \\"fact\\" based video.

A more up-to-date section on human evolution (no mention of Ardipithecus Ramidus) but on the whole the book is a good synthesis of the state of the knowledge in this field."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped and basically useless","review":"Ok lets get down to why you should save your money and NOT get this book. First of all the author dedicates two or three chapters on WHY chicks should sleep with chicks. Well if your buying this book then I would think that your already curious or interested, correct? Then the author shares some really great \\"secrets\\" on the where and how to pick up other chicks, let me take the time to write some of them down here for you, first this no brainer, \\"Get them intoxicated, and my all time favorite,\\"take them behind a dumpster and get them to smoke weed\\". The author then fills the book up with helpfull hints like, \\"go put an ad on the internet\\" Dang, I would have never thought of that!! In summary, you can buy this book if you want, but don't expect anything other than common sense stuff, and I use the term VERY lightly!! Thank you for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"A lot of these type of books are cute and fun and show you things you might not have thought of before.

If you feel as if it was a bad book or you don't like the topic, perhaps you should read the title. It's a guide to sleeping with chicks, why would u read it if you didn't like chicks or couldn't read it with a light heart? Obviously its not for everyone. I'm not gay or bisexual but I loved the authors candor and truthfulness at approaching this topic. It's a great read and hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT FITS","review":"Fits like a glove.

The logic is backwards.This cover is designed specifically for my Weber Q220 (I didn't buy the wrong one).The cover for the smaller Weber Q100 fits totally around it's grill, controls and all - I wish this one was designed the same.I wouldn't want one of these even for free, you'd be further ahead using a GARBAGE BAG to cover your grill (which is where this cover belongs)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does it's job well","review":"I bought 2 of these covers from Amazon, one for my Weber 220 and another for the Baby Q. Both excellent grills. The covers are heavy enough to be durable for years and should be easy to clean when needed. There's a drawstring adjustment on the front and back to make a good fit. Very satisfied with the purchase, and price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rain gets in, doesn't work!","review":"I believe the point of a grill cover is to both protect the device and keep it dry. The one star rating I'm giving this is because, while it does protect it from nature's dry debris, rain water always gets in, and fills up the drip pan, which creates a huge, greasy mess on the table which it sits. I've tried adjusting it different ways, cinching the drawstring, not cinching, but to no avail, water always gets in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty lame","review":"Flimsy and ill-fitting.

First this CD has some of the greatest slow jams you will ever find. Chapter 8's I Just Wanna Be Your Girl Featuring Anita Baker, is probably the best song on here. Not to say songs like, If You Play Your Cards Right, Let Me Be Your Angel, Tender Love, What You Won't Do For Love, Come Go With Me, As We Lay and the late great Rick James's Fire & Desire are not great songs. Needless to say if you are a R&B fan you will love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Victorian Sherlock","review":"This book is excellent for those who are familiar with the Granada series of the 80's-90's staring Jeremy Brett and will encourage those who have never seen the series to give it a try. The care that went into following ACD's cannon almost to the end of the series is remarkable considering the problems encountered due to the health of the star and financial constraints. This book also explains the physical changes of the star that become obvious as the series unfolds. It's a tribute to Jeremy Brett and in no way reduces or changes the success of the current BBC episodes of Sherlock in the modern world. these two series are the best for the respective generations in which they are set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant and High-Quality","review":"Great lights and a great price to boot! These are very nice quality and dress up my yard very, very nicely. They're extremely simple to set up and are very durable. I've had some where the stakes are hard to get in the ground and the top part with the light has broken off the attached stake. That's not a problem here. The stakes go in the ground easily, although you might have to step on them if the ground is very dry. The light piece is not permanently attached to the stake, so there is no danger of it breaking off and being unusable -- if it happens to come off, you just screw it back on. Of course, there is also a carriage hook that allows you to simply lift the light off and put it back on as you please. The light output is great, too, much better than my old ones. I am absolutely delighted with these and would definitely recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Playing Roulette As A Business\\" ? You will not last long!","review":"\\"Playing Roulette As A Business\\", basically outlines a negative betting progression, similar to martingale type systems. The Author Claims, that his specific wheel number's, when bet in his recommended manner, will outperform actual probability, due to thier positon's on the wheel. If indeed, these numbers did hit as often as the author suggest's, you would not need a betting progression to gain an edge. \\"If\\" this were the case, these magic numbers could be printed and sold on an index card, and there would be no need to waste an entire book on the subject. That is what this book is an \\"Entire Waste\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only .01% better than just picking a number! NOT WORTH IT!","review":"This book makes itself appear to be an all encompassing winning strategy. It is not. I thought this book would have many strategies! All it has is 1 specific idea! And it only works on the double zero wheel! I was very disappointed. I tried out the system of play and it did not even put me ahead. I guess I could have stuck with it and waited to see the long term effect, but the idea in this book is stupid anyway. A person could write down this formula on a cocktail napkin(if he/she wrote very small.)It's based on placing the same bets over and over again, which is dumb because roulette is so unpredictable that you could absolutely never win if unlucky. It also uses progession(adding more $ for each loss), which is usually a bad idea. I really don't recommend spending your hard earned money on this. I think there are many, many better books with better ideas in them that I have read or own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all that bad!","review":"Nothing earth shattering as the previous review says but I wouldn't say this is horrible. It is rather innovative and although it is true you cannot overcome the edge via a progression no matter how clever this \\"system is not 100% garbage. I have used it many mnay times and far more often than not come out ahead in total. One CAUTION though as stated previously... this centers upon the distribution of the numbers and so this does NOT work with computer systems/simulation using pseudo-random number generators. If you want to play on-line I suggest you look at software that exploits the random number generators... there are several avail on-line.Should you quit your job and stake everything on this system? Hell no.. but if you occaisionally hit the roulette wheel it sure beats playing your \\"lucky\\" numbers... I do agree there needs to be more on money management and stop losses. Have fun with this but remeber they call it gambling for a reason... there is always a risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the system in this book","review":"I love the system in this book, and use it whenever I'm in Vegas or Reno. You can remember the system easily, and the simplicity of it turns a dangerous losing game into a relaxing and fun game. Half the fun of the system is watching other people come and go, dropping hundreds of dollars, while you stay for hours and enjoy free drinks. The system delivers on at least one of its goals, which is to avoid losing money. You cover slightly less than half the wheel, your bet wins slightly more than even money, you win when zero or double-zero come up (an important part of enjoying the game), and the argument about the consecutive nature of the numbers has validity if you consider that the wheel and the ball are not perfect, so the numbers that come up over time are not perfectly random."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This book is garbage. If winning at roulette was this easy, casinos would have closed down long ago. The cover shows a European wheel and then gives details solely for an American wheel. I am amazed that this was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"A system backed up with inaccurate reasoning","review":"The system that the author describes in this text could win but, the author's claims about the system are flawed. He claims for instance that by playing number that are adjacent you somehow increase your odds of winning. The odds of covering 17 numbers are the same if the numbers are scattered or adjacent. This book could have been a lot shorter. The sequences in the book support the method but many other sequences wouldn't. A shallow poorly written flawed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant bio, but...","review":"This is a great biography, but I only wish there was a little more about Hopkins actual writings.

One down part to this Sony is that the built-in speaker isn't that loud or great, but if you hook it up to a set of headphones, then it suddenly makes a great difference in the clarity of the sound. Also, the software that comes with it is easy to use and loads the voice files into the computer the fastest among the three... about 3~4 seconds for a 50 minute lecture on SP...literally.

The wringer itself is a push rather than a pull which is awkward and the mop would wring itself while in use.

There are some great things about the bag- there are lots of compartments for little things like pacifiers, diaper cream, bottles, etc., the wide strap is really comfortable, and the detachable changing pad are all nice features. But what I don't like about the bag is that it has no structure, so the middle part tends to \\"balloon\\" outwards. The most frustrating thing about it is the zipper. The zipper isn't connected at one end, so when you unzip it, the whole zipper becomes disconencted. Additionally, after 1 month of use, the zipper stopped working altogether- when I would zip it, the zipper would come undone in the middle and then open up completely. So I'm now walking around with a diaper bag that is always open.

Its a light bag, and even traveling long distance (flying), it never seemed to be heavy or over-packed.There are two drawbacks, neither especially serious. I join other commenters that the main zipper is composed of 2 separate pieces, so it does take two hands to get the main compartment closed back up. This is annoying. My second minor complaint with this bag is that the changing pad is TOO SHORT. You can detach the pad and use the bag flap for the baby's head, but if you have a wiggler, its very difficult.Still, I love this bag for longer trips. (I use a large Ameribag for short jaunts.)

It was written as if Reich had a special word processor that contained on its keyboard every cliche known to man. Characters were cartoons, situations were predictable, descriptions were trite . Is there anyone out there who has read this book who couldn't figure out the solution to Neumann's quandaries at least a hundred pages before he did? Was he really thay dull? If so, how could these brilliant captains of Swiss banking mistake him for a bright shining star? Some descriptions were truly laughable. Does Syria really have a 'royal blue sky'? Are we really to believe that Cerutti was found shot through the head with a white fluffy pillow resting on his stomach? Did Sylvia always have to laugh huskily before,during, and after sex?

Maybe the best thing about it for summer is that it's in a cold, cold country and it's snowing for most of the novel. It'll help you beat the heat.Don't expect to feel like you slept in a Holiday Inn Express after reading this, it's just a fast-paced, semi-predictable thriller set in the beautiful mountains of Switzerland. Swiss Banking has probably changed since this book was written, it's practically pre-digital age, but I think it's untechnical enough to still be interesting.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hope my colleagues aren't so!!","review":"I was very attracted to this book before reading it cos it spoke about banks' whirling-money world and, since I'm attending Finance courses (I'm just studying on the book mentioned in this one!) I thought it could be interesting. It is, indeed. It mixes really well banking thecniques, love stories, revenges and omicides, all in the serious and impeccable facade of Swiss banks. The novel is quite long, but your attention is quickly captured and you'll often say:\\"Ok, just only one more chapter\\" while you'll read at least 3 or 4 more instead! It is very well written, we can easily tell not only Reich deeply knows the financial system but he knows, as well, how to create a sophisticated cobweb of intrigues you'll desperately want to work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"The first chapter, provided online, is so abysmally bad, who could bear to read on?

His portrayals of men in the sanctum sanctorum of Swiss banking and finance are most believable and compelling. His ability to tie-in Swiss banking with U.S. Marine counterterrorist operations, Harvard Business School, Wall Street and the Hezbollah show delectable promise. Noone should be likened to Le Carre after one book, however, Reich demonstrates a talent that could well deserve these comparisons very soon. If I was Nick Neumann and Reich was an initial stock offering I'd be loading up on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing First Novel","review":"What an amazing piece of work for a first novel. I suppose we could compare Mr. Reich with Faulkner or Hemingway but I fail to see the purpose. Mr. Reich has written a suspenseful and well crafted thriller. For those who feel that every book must carry a lifechanging lesson or prose so beautiful it makes one weep than more than likely this is not the book for you. However, for those of us who enjoy a good romp while being thrilled and educated, you don't want to miss this one!! Let's not forget this is a first novel...I can hardly wait for 2,3,4 and so on!! Maybe THEN I will compare Mr. Reich to LeCarre and Grisham! In the meantime, my hat is off to Mr. Reich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angry at myself","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that this book must have slipped past the editor, or perhaps Delacorte wanted to rush this book to print in order to cash in on the recent headlines about Swiss banks. The characters are stick figures; I didn't like or dislike the hero and I didn't like or dislike the villains. I just didn't care. It read as if Mr. Reich said to himself, \\"Okay, he does this, and then she does that, and then this happens, and then that happens...\\". There was no fleshing out of the characters and no meaningful descriptions of the people or places, as if the author had a list of adjectives and adverbs on his desk, and used them randomly throughout the book. I felt cheated, and angry at myself for falling for the early hype on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"I started reading this book 4 times, the beginning had no umph. Then, I decided this book would not beat me, I was wrong. The plot started to pick up after the first 170 pages. My hopes were high at this piont. Then the ending, ... a was of waste of. The writing is very wordy. The book is simply too long.

Great story, starts out strong, carries well but he seemed to quickly write the end and get the manuscript quickly off to the publisher, I would have like to have seen the bad guy suffer more, sorry he deserved it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must read this, borrow it.","review":"Mr. Reich may have some greater talent for writing than this novel shows, but if this is his strength based on his past employment in the banking industry, let' s hope he does not try to write about something he is not familiar with. Given the recent publicity about the Swiss banking industry, the novel was timely and, if accurate, I learned a great deal about that industry. However, the poorly developed collateral plot lines and the shallow characters did not allow me to enjoy this book the way that I had anticipated. The editing of this book is also very weak and I am convinced that a stronger editor could have shaped this into a much more readable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow moving-hard to keep awake in the mid sections.","review":"I read about 25 books a year and rarely have I found a book to be as tedious as this one. The character development is slow, the writing uninspired. It is hard to believe that the author received $2 million for this novel. I have no idea what the publisher was thinking. If you want to read it, get it from the library--and hope that they give you at least a three week check out period to get through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the worst book I've ever read","review":"The publishers of this book should be embarassed and ashamed of themselves. It was worse than bad - it was ludicrously inept. I could tell that the author was trying really hard, but he didn't seem to have a clue of what really makes a good book - or he had barely a clue, and seemed to think that was enough. In the hands of a better writer, I suppose this could have been an entertaining story - in the hands of this writer, it was just relentlessly boring. I just kept feeling sad for all of the really good writers out there who can't get published, while dreck like this is unleashed instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"The only book this year that I couldn't finish. It just drags on and on. By page 150 you almost wish that the main character gets killed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor attempt at being Grisham.","review":"Not much here. Sterotypical characters molded to implasible roles. Brightest of the bright higher by the best of the best _firms_. Powerful woman is made his lover. Firm's president is oblivious to his actions. US government needs his help. (Sound fimiliar?) Plot moves at times slow, other times slower. Writing is mediocre at best. Cliches abound. Character development is weak. Dialog seems force. One example has the protaginist kissing a women lamenting how long it has been since he has felt the touch of a women. Yet, on the very next page we are reminded of his fiancé last seen only two months ago. Give me a break! I cannot find any redeeming values to this book. I finished the drival hoping against hope for a smashing ending. Sigh. No such luck. Save your money reread _The Firm_."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best I can say about this book is that it is mundane.","review":"Christopher Reich has picked a steroetypical lead; educated in the best schools, outstanding military service, American, a fiancee who does not understand him. Now the lead character chucks his life to discover who murdered his father. Voile! We need some bad guys! Throw in bankers and Arab terrorists. Since the fall of the communist regimes in Eastern European countries, we have had to have new bad guys in thrillers. Nowadays it is Arab terrorists. I got so bored with this book that I put it down a little over half way through it. Don't waste your time on this novel. There are too many well written books out there to read. Try \\"Memoirs of a Geisha\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite well done for a first novel and an unusual thriller.","review":"Give Mr. Reich credit for producing an interesting book on what you'd consider a dull subject -- Swiss banking or international banking. It has the ingredients:a rogue Middle Easterner (Turk, not Arab); a young man seeking his father's killer and determining WHY his father was slain; some neatly done sex scenes and the intrigue of financial manipulations that could impact banks around the world. And, with the revelations of Swiss bankers' dealings with the Nazis and the swindling of many Holocaust victims/families, it's a valuable guide to just how the Swiss banking system functions. A few cardboard characters, but -- overall -- good writing and clever plotting."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not a keeper","review":"I read this book over a week's time. It did not call me to it at the end of the day. I kept reading it to have something to do. I hated the flash backs. The action didn't move until the last forty or so pages. This book was a terrible disappointment to me. I also didn't think the characters were believable. I lost patience with them early on. This is definitely not, in my opinion, in the style of David Baldacci. Shame on you for saying it is. Finley Adams"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, not such a good story","review":"I was excited to read the book. The premise looked good, but the story line didn't pan out. The details into the banking world was not done very well. The characters were two dimensional. Not much detail into the Marine Corps officer program.For those who read the book, if you know a little about semi automatic weapons, there's a chapter where someone runs out of ammunition and does not know it. Doesn't the weapons's slide lock back when it fires it's last bullet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Astonishingly awful writing","review":"I bough this in haste, expecting a considered, perhaps rather clever financial thriller. What I found was the kind of mind-numbingly atrocious writing I thought had long since died out. I'm amazed the publishers let Mr Reich get away with it. It only shows what idiots they must think thriller buyers are...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, unimaginative, unrealistic","review":"I find the basic premise of this book to be totally unbelievable. Based on a few sketchy clues about the death of his father, the protagonist gives up a career in I-banking, something he has worked his whole life for, and goes off to Switzerland to work in private banking. It is simply a ridiculous premise. Compounding the flaw in the novel, the writing is boring and unimaginative. The characters are stereotypical. The plot is inane. The author tried to write an international financial thriller, but does not have the skills to describe the setting and plot. A few references to various streets and cities in Switzerland does not make an international thriller. The book is just plain bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to its Reviews","review":"I find the value of one liners plastered on book covers to be a dime-a-dozen, especially with NYT Bestsellers. However, I found Numbered Account to be worth its weight in words. I quickly became addicted and found myself unable to put it down. Thanks Mr. Reich for restoring my faith in one line reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulistic thriller","review":"I began reading with high hopes for a really gripping read. By halfway, I had to give up. The book reads as though written by a computer program; every chapter ends with a little mini climax. The writing style is \\"american thriller\\", i.e. nothing distinctive. I felt little empathy or sympathy for any of the characters, and most were cardboard cutouts - especially the arabs, who seemed to be uniformly cast as villians. A really bad knockoff of the Grisham style. Undoubtedly will be picked for movie of the week..."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre knock-off of Grisham","review":"Reich's biography states that he used to work in a private banking dept of a Swiss bank in Zurich, so I suppose that gives him the credibility to write a mediocre novel about private banking dept of a Swiss bank in Zurich. But to add excitement, he adds international terrorist plot, lots of beautiful but treacherous women, and equally numerous treacherous and murderous men. It proves a tedious reading, and you'll end up counting the number of obnoxious characters before drifting off to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for insomnia","review":"This book was boring, slow, dull. I can usually read a book of this length in 3 evenings. This one put me to sleep every night for 3 weeks. The characters are neither well-defined nor realistic; the plot is too contrived; and the story telling is ponderous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time","review":"I thought John Grisham had the market cornered on zero character development and unrealistic plots, but Reich not-so-pleasantly surprised me. The characters are all cookie cutter, the dialouge is laughable, the plot silly. After 350 pages, I didn't know anything more than page 1, and I sure didn't care. Do yourself a favor and go find Michael Connelly's new book and save yourself from this sophomoric tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I'm an avid reader who enjoys good thrillers. Therefore, based on its many strong reviews, I looked forward to reading this book. To my surprise, though, it totally sucked. The plot is terribly boring, the character development is non-existent, the subplots are worse than the main plot, and the ending is pathetic. Contrary to what anyone may claim, this book is nothing like The Day After Tomorrow. Simply put, Numbered Account is the worst book I have read in the past several years. My advice: Don't waste your precious time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I was excited to see a new author in this genre until I actually ordered and then attempted to read the book.

Don't waste your time on this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even finish it","review":"I chose this one for my cross-country Christmas plane trip.

Recommended for those who like financial thrillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was an education for me...","review":"...in the ways of Swiss banking. I bought it for a few pesos at a yard sale, and being unfamiliar with the author, was not convinced it was worth my time to read it. Once I began, I was hooked. The author created a sympathetic character who was smart, clever and accomplished, and Reich is quite adept at using flashbacks to provide motivation for his protagonist. He creates a world with which I am totally unfamiliar, and he makes it comfortably habitable for the duration of the book. He provides enough environmental detail to maintain the reader's interest and salts the book with enough red herrings to deflect any foregone conclusions. The book moves along with a steady pace, and as it picked up speed, I had difficulty putting it down. I might take issue with his female characters, who seem a bit predestined and two-dimensional, but perhaps that is the reality of the world they inhabit. I will certainly be looking for more books by Mr. Reich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Easily Cut Down To 300 Pages!","review":"This book had a good idea, but it reminds of the Chamber, where the author got all caught up in the good idea and forgot how to tell it. The tale goes back and forth and back and forth revealing little pieces of information that have already been told before, that you have already figured out, or that you no longer care about. But I still held out for 2.5 weeks to get to the end only to wish I would have given it up. The end sucks! Not because of what happens, but because if you take over 700 pages to tell a story, the least you could do is elaborate on who ends up where. Who ended up running the bank(s), was Sylvia out of a job, who was caught and went to jail? What about Armin, who wasn't even mentioned after he got the heave ho? Was he vindicated? Overall, it was too long to leave so many questions unanswered. The author clearly lost focus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Routine pot-bolier","review":"Interesting plot, but poorly written. I'm prepared to accept the poor characterization and unconvincing dialogue, but a thriller writer should get the details right. Reich's incorrect use of medical jargon, and his description of the injuries suffered by the various protagonists, show that he is out of his depth. Worse (because the blurb on the cover sells his expertise in banking) he incorrectly titles, and misspells the author, of a standard finance text - Principles of Corporate Finance (page 423). If he can't get the elementary things right how convincing is the rest going to be?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendously boring","review":"This is without a doubt one of the dullest books I have ever attempted to read.

This novel plodded along with dull characters, poor prose, and a not-very-interesting plot. I think the author (who has gone on to be published again!) must know someone in the publishing biz. I should have such friends! I must admit I could not get past the first 100 pages. Life is too short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the later books get better","review":"I tossed the book after only 50 pages. The plot action was too cartoonish.

I have watched him grow from the melodic style of this CD to an atmospheric approach in his adagio series. He manages in these later CD's to have enough melody to keep the music interesting but never overpowering. He allows the listener to fill in the spaces.I have several friends who practice massage and swear by Davison's music. And I am in a yoga class in which the instructor only uses Davison's adagio series.Davison manages to tap into one's emotions yet never panders to the obvious. He is a skilled composer who knows how to write for a wide variety of instruments from around the world. His music is evocative, ethereal and yet I can still touch it on a human level. This is clearly the work of a man who has both feet on the ground while his imagination is left free to create without restrictions. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hedy West is so hard to find","review":"Hedy West (who died earlier this year) is worth the price of admission here.

Though apparently she is not proud of her performance on this CD, she does stand out. Jackie Washington also has a great voice, though I found I didn't remember him any near as vividly as Hedy West.

Which is a shame, because this amazing book will give you thousands of new adventures, and is the perfect way to expand a campaign. The 96-page book includes: chronomancer experience, kits, subclasses, the nature of time in AD&D, timestreams, paradoxes, changing history, proficiencies, the Protectors, chronomancer spells, rules for desigining worlds of science fantasy, and more.

But my life had become far from normal. I was three days past very invasive day-long surgery, half way through a 23 day hospital stay. Despite a lot of drugs, I was hurting like hell when my wife brought in RITES after dinner. Here is how good that book is. Since the operation I was exhausted by 9PM and, after more medication, feel asleep soon after. But this night I began the book and stayed up until 2PM finishing it -- literally feeling no pain. I paid for this splurge the next day without regret. Then September 11th happened on my TV and I got so depressed I read RITES again. Again I was carried away, now from America's tragedy. Obviously, I am grateful for this wonderful work and recommend it to anyone interested in out nation's rich traditions. Like Whittingham's other work, RITES OF AUTUMN is far more than a sports book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an awful video!","review":"My 2 and 4 year olds watch a wide variety of videos, from educational to downright silly.

CD playback is excellent with no playback problems of any kind.The sound quality is excellent - for a system in this price range and size - better than most others I tried. Sound is clean and clear with no distortion. There are sufficient equalization and tone controls to adjust the sound as desired. Volume is excellent, with plenty of sound for reasonable small room listening at normal levels.The remote control is well made and well designed, and easy to use.So far, I am very pleased with this product. It serves my purposes perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bookshelf system","review":"Great looking, excellent sound. But not a bookshelf system.

Fits upright to minimize surface space. Headphone jack on top is good placement. (Sony had it in the rear and caused major struggles to find it.) No skips on CD.

We used it a couple times the first year then went to use the CD player and it grinds and says \\"no disc\\". I contacted Phillips via web chat and Donna (the contact) mistyped words and used a foreign variation of terms (centre for center). It was obvious that she is overseas and could NOT help me find a service center since Philips does NOT have any authorized service centers. I am so sad as the sound from the speakers was magnificant. It would be cheaper for me to buy another system then pay for the repair estimate labor and part replacement.

Months after I bought it, it began to skip tracks on CD's. I contacted Philips, they told me to send it back and they would replace it. In about a week I received another unit. It played fine. But, the one thing I did not like - it was a reburbished unit. And for that fact I gave it to a college student I know. He has not had any problems with it. The sound is good for the size it is.

These were the perfect compromise.They have mesh in the upper so your feet don't get too hot, but they are also sturdy and enclosed enough that you don't bang your toes. The mesh is sort of double layer, so it isn't see through, but lets air through. There are also little holes on the sole designed to help drain them out when used in water. He wears them just for everyday, not for water use (even though they are sold as water friendly..I can't attest to how they well work in water.) The holes do help keep your feet cool (and not stinky!) No ties, just slip them on. A little elastic helps them stretch to put them on and moves when you walk.

Occasionally we have the privilege to be drawn into someone's experiences with such power and clarity that we are possessed by their history and translated into it. Barbara Moss's story makes us members of the family as she weaves gripping tales of poverty, alcohlism, sickness and neglect into a book that you can't stop reading. As difficult as the circumstances are, the story is never without hope. The characters are in many ways ordinary and flawed and in spite of that, are amazingly appealing, interesting, funny, and often heroic as they struggle with the situations that compose their existence. In her writing she is able to depict seemingly ordinary events, turning them into human essences that touch our deepest emotional levels, where we live and laugh and cry and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life in the poorhouse","review":"Sad upbringing , mean drunk father, not a lot to live for in this book but amazed how Barbara finds hope in this memoir in Alabama."},{"rating":"2","title":"exactuly what you want in a book","review":"this was entertaining, unbelieveable, and a real page turner...exactly what you want in a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another View","review":"Our deep sympathies to Barbara for the agony of her past.

Her father was not held responsible for his behavior and is EXCUSED because of the ILLNESS which he is responsible for contracting because of his CHOICE.

I was quite surprised to find it to be a compelling story (memoir) of the plight of growing up in a family whose basic survival instincts were their salvation.There were only a couple of places I felt \\"lost\\" in the author's direction/writings, however, I was quickly back on track and following the ongoing plight. Part of the lure/hook of the book was that it was a rather contemporary look at someone's unique life (for a baby boomer like myself).I finally brought the book to work so I could read it during my lunch breaks...it was one of those \\"can't put it down\\" books. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was so engrossing to read!","review":"I could NOT put this book down. I started reading it Thursday night and finished it Monday night.

I had to keep reminding myself that this was a true story...and one that happened not so long ago! I'm so glad that the author turned out happy and healthy, because sometimes, reading the book, you start to wonder how that is possible.If you like true stories about real life families, this is a great book to read.

It claims to be usable for a \\"first course in abstract algebra\\" but this claim is completely absurd--it was my second abstract algebra class and I still had trouble with the book. I had trouble both because it said so little, and because it said it so unclearly.DO not buy this book--make a decision, based on your background and buy:(1) An easier to read book with better explanationsOR(2) A more comprehensive text.Trust me--you'll be better off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Legion Collection","review":"Some of the best Shooter stories during this period, with some excellent artwork by Mike Grell. I wish they would have included the very last issue of Grell's run (#224), Shooter's second Stargrave story and setup for a great character plot for Brainiac 5, that ended on a sour note when another writer took over in the middle of the multi-part storyline, for shame. However, this archive ends with #223, Jim Shooter's intro of Pulsar Stargrave. Both the Cary Bates and Jim Shooter stories are better than generally given credit for, particularly for this transitional time in all comic book stories, between self contained character oriented plots and latter day multi-part epics. I especially enjoyed the inclusion of Karate Kid #1 by Paul Levitz who would go on to become one the best Legion writers later. The extra cover galleries including the Tabloid size Grell cover for the Mordru reprint were nice to have.

There are some good stories in here like Grimbor and Charma plus the introduction of Tyroc, but in general it's minor stuff. I hope they resume the LSH's archives series because the title soon picked up quite a bit with the Earthwar sequence among others. Another redeeming point about this period is the art of Mike Grell.

Eric's work here is similar to that of his main project/band black dice, except this seems less sporadic, more atmospheric, and contains more live instruments.

He establishes himself as the lead drug-lord in his neighborhood and as he tries to expand, he runs into problems with another dealer, \\"Dame\\" (Dame Dash) and that's where things go wrong. This is the first of two films, with the storyline (State Property 2). Titled \\"State Property\\" because it's the story told by Beanz from behind bars, about how he ended up in jail.The filming isn't exactly Hollywood quality (it is a low budget made film), but it's not as crappy to say it's a \\"bootleg\\".

Those are as tall as a standard RPG book and have a good thickness and quality to them. The GM screen for M&M; is as thick as a standard 3x5 inch note card. The M&M; screen measures in at short 9&1/2 inches tall. Go ahead, get a ruler and see if that's the kind of screen you are accustomed to using.If the information is all you want, then by all means, pick this up and scan it in.If you want a useful GM screen though, I'd either pass on it, or scan this one and DIY a better quality screen.Overall, very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Great game with serious options for customizations.

What a delicious trip it has been.Mr Gorey also produced the opening credits for PBS' Mystery! series in the 1980's to my utter delight. I would often watch the credits only and skip the predictable british fare that followed.The character referred to in my title is my favorite Gorey drawing. It shows our poor mr. Titus, a rather dull looking lad, holding a package that will, no doubt, bring about his rude demise.

You can get lucky with some cd quality music, but don't think you're going to be able to watch YouTube music videos with greatly improved sound. I was thinking so, but it just distorts it, brings the wrong sounds louder, bass bigger, not really what the producer intended. The best pro I can find is that the unit itself is very good quality, along with the USB cable and pouch included. You can get lucky with some music, though. It's not always bad.

The drawback is that it doesnt do it correctly especially in the treble region. The x-mod makes cymbals and hi-hats are way too sharp and bright on most songs and distorts most of the rest of the treble region as well.

Some of the complaints from other reviewers state that there are audio artifacts, but I'm convinced that the artifacts are there, but revealed by this unit. If you want poor quality MP3 to hide poor audio issues, then don't bother. Also, if you are an audio purist, you may not want this unit, as you probably will have spent much more on high quality throughout the system.

Why this happens, and how it can be avoided is the subject of the text. The author looks at several abandoned projects, for which solid information has been made publicly known. These include the Denver airport's baggage handling, and the IRS Tax System Modernisation. Though surely many other failures have been quietly buried by other groups.The author finds that often, constraints, schedules or goals were placed outside the influence of the developers. While this does not pre-ordain failure, it seems to significantly increase its possibility. Another characteristic trait seems to be a lack of executive oversight. Leading to project drift, until that becomes irreversible.The book's best help to you might be when you are starting a project."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure in itself","review":"unfortunately this book does not deliver what it promisses. neither i find any theoretical in-depth analysis of specific software project failures nor reasonable checklists to guide practioners. instead, many common places that do not add value compared to the publications on the topic so far (Boehm, Jones, etc.).it does not help that the book fails to describe the problems that make specifically software projects so hard to manage. see the freely available NATO software engineering conference papers from 1968 for more helpful information on software project failures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"Here's a two-ingredient recipe for disaster: take a big organization and mix in ambitious plans for a state-of-the-art software system. The disaster already happened at the IRS and Denver International Airport, both victims of software development missteps. Such failures are common, costly and all-too-avoidable, writes academic Kweku Ewusi-Mensah. While his prose can be dry, the examples he uses prove quite juicy. A little common sense could have saved the IRS billions and the Denver airport millions. Both fell victim to surprisingly basic pitfalls, such as unclear or unrealistic goals and over optimistic expectations that inexperienced people could get the job done. Ewusi-Mensah convincingly argues that organizations need to share such learning experiences, although he acknowledges that would mark a reversal from common practice. We recommend this book to managers and engineers involved in developing software.

After all, this IS a police procedural, although set in ancient Egypt. You aren't going to have high speed chariot chases or shoot outs.

They are ruining reputation of item's manufacturer this way as well.I bought another one from different supplier and it is exactly as it is in the picture.

I find it has aged well. As usual Bloom squeezes his five poets into the Procrustean bed of his idiosyncratic typologies. This is justified as a necessary dialectic of the visionary imagination, a sort of Freudian analog. His account, thankfully, illuminates these figures and is rooted in Blake's own daft myth-making (or mythopoeia.) Naturally, it doesn't apply so closely to the other members of the \\"visionary company\\" though the basic thrust of his argument seems valid. The readings of key texts are close but not obsessive. As usual Bloom brings his characteristic empathy (identification?) to these poets of disappointment - \\"We poets in our youth begin in gladness/But thereof come in the end to despondency and madness.\\" (Wordsworth, \\"Resolution and Independence\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to the Romantics","review":"Really nice introduction to the Romantic poets. I love that Harold Bloom prefaces each new chapter with a quotation from a modern poet (e.g. Yeats, Stevens, Crane) who is an heir to that Romantic poet. For example, Stevens is used to introduce Wordsworth. The only thing that irked me is the recycling of essays from other Bloom compilations or editions. I have definitely read his Wordsworth essay on the Prelude elsewhere...I suppose this is the key to to Bloom's prolific output, but I was hoping for completely original content. Bloom is a tremendously sensitive reader and unafraid to make sweeping pronouncements, and thus he will always be one of our most compelling literary critics.

In my opinion, Gene Pitney tops the 60s pop crooners, and this compilation gives you the greatest variety and finest examples of his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive collection","review":"This is the definitive Gene Pitney collection : two CDs with all the chart hits, a generous helping of B-sides, albums tracks, and lesser-known gems in excellent remastered sound, plus a booklet with photos of LP and 45 sleeves and track-by-track commentary by Gene Pitney himself ... and all at the price of a single CD. Marvellous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"I only have hazy memories of Gene Pitney during his glory days. (I was only a little kid back then). I do remember Liberty Valance, It Hurts To Be In Love and especially Town Without Pity which I sent my grandfather out to buy, without success! LOL. This is a great set. If you want to know what great 60's music was like sung by one of the best 60's crooners, you cant top Gene Pitney. This has many more songs than the other compilations and is worth the extra price. Great music doesnt date and this is 60's music at its best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD SUCKS DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY YOU'LL BE SORRY !","review":"MAN I DONT KNOW MAN I USE TOO HAVE LOT'S OF RESPECT FOR SALSOUL THEY WERE GREAT ON LP RECORDS BUT A LOT OF SO CALLED RE-MASTED LP-TO-CD MOVE IS NOTING BEING DONE RIGHT IN MOST CASE'S YOUR BETTER OFF TRACKING DOWN THE SONG'S ON LP.

I'm also a fan of Carol Williams (very rare for my age group) b/c of her track 'Love is You' (of which I already own several mixes.) Through her, I discovered this album on iTunes and bought a few of my fave tracks from that.The quality sucks to no end, and I have to pratically turn my volume on my iPod up to 80% to hear it clearly on my headphones.But regarding the tracks themselves, they're great! This is a modern and more hi-energy twist to some of these Salsoul classics. I really enjoyed what they did with 'Love Break', 'Love is You', and 'It's Good for the Soul'- my fave tracks on this release and I can't stop playing them when I'm at the gym or even just at the office.I would not recommend buying these from iTunes as the quality is just disappointing. Not sure if the physical CDs are any better, but in my experience, they are. I do recommend it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to wrap with these wraps","review":"I am a beginner to say the least. I had originally purchased a different less expensive brand of wraps.

She's definitely a feisty character in general but I didn't feel like the actress delivered a totally believable performance. But hey! It's just my opinion and what do I know?!

Unlike other books, it does not deal in vague generalities or unsupported principles. It gives all of the steps and instructions to choose from that companies need to create an excellent plan. The steps are explained simply and a strategy on how to make \\"it happen\\".It is really useful because it gives a variety of examples from many different organizations and industries. It is the kind of book that you can use, sitting around with your staff, to agree on the process that you will take for your particular organization.I highly recommend it to an organization that wants to make their strategic approach stick.

The first 2/3 of the book are dedicated to a plethora of names and the background of radar development in both England and Germany. It is interesting in its own right, for sure, but at times is tedious. The raid itself, as daring and romantic as it was, is given only superficial coverage, with no depth or suspense.

Sorry, Bava and Euro/Iti film fans, but the edited American Version is superior to the original for this reason alone (the other drawbacks are relatively negligable). Why else use Karloff if you don't get the full actor? The Italians never shot synch sound, anyway, so even the original Italian version is dubbed! Dubbing is NOT the issue - in fact, it's a non issue.

If not, then be prepared for a lengthy and really noisy start up sequence, lasting for minutes upon minutes and then a couple of misprinted pages until it begins to work. In its favor are the individual ink supplies, but on the other hand, if you only want to print black ink on a page, as for text, it will not function unless all colors are in adequate supply."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm returning it tomorrow.","review":"I had no way of knowing (the manual has to be downloaded from HP's website) that if one ink tank is exhausted, the entire printer is useless. That's right - if all you want to do is print black text, and you've got a full tank of black ink, the thing sits and cries for its yellow instead of printing the black text. Never saw that trick before, and don't want to see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink hog","review":"I bought this printer because I was told it has the lowest cost per page printed (about 1.5 cents per page). That is absolute hogwash! After about 100 pages printed in draft mode black only, it ran out of yellow ink. About 50 pages later it ran out of magenta ink. Aparently it uses color ink for head cleaning and when printing in black mode only. It stops printing when you are out of any color ink. After about 700 pages printed (draft mode, black only) I am on my third color combo pack at $39.99/pack. That is 17.14 cents per page for color cartridges only and not the 1.5 cents I was told. If I add the cost of the black cartridge, the cost is over 20 cents/page. This printer is an ink hog and I would not recommend it to anybody!

(#1 black print nozzles clogging continuously, #2 replaced bad print head with another bad print head, but decided to send new printer instead, #3 replaced black print head again, #4 new printer has paper feed and head alignment problems). When it is working, it is reasonably fast, and the print quality is good. However, it does spend an inordinate amount of time and ink adjusting and aligning itself.

Called HP in Palo Alto, CA and was advised that the printheads have a separate warranty printed on them. HP FedEx'ed the printhead, installed the printhead and the printer printed ten pages before, and guess what? The black/yellow printhead light is again blinking. Again go through the HP recommended fix to no avail. Now the blue/red printhead is flashing instead of the black/yellow. Try the fix again, the blue/red printhead light is no longer flashing.

Only a few of the songs miss the mark, but most are very well done. They mix some very 90's elements into their music, with one song sounding like Alice In Chains, while another one left me thinking I had stuck Metallica in by mistake. But don't mistake these 2 albums for American rip-offs, Loudness continue to carve their own niche.

They think it romantic that the heroine overcomes a life of prostitution (one time? Please!) and that the hero is so upstanding and gallant. What they don't tell you is that for the first 200 pages of this book, the heroine is a whining, simpering idiot who is honestly too dumb to live. She shudders in revulsion when the hero touches her from a choice that SHE made. Did she ply her services as a prostitute? Yes. Did he rape her? No. Was she paid accordingly--and even three times what she asked for? Yes. End of story. No need to whine about it. But whine she does. Endlessly. Her stomach roils whenever our gallant hero comes near her, let alone touches her. More than halfway into the book that's still her sentiment. And that does not a romance make, no matter how sweet the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black as Coal!!!","review":"This book was horrible. Considering the positive reviews and interesting plot line, I was so looking forward to reading this book. Sadly, it was just AWFUL. Fleur was as flat as a pancake and a complete idiot. I did not care at all about the entire \\"Evil Cousin\\" scenario and it did NOTHING to the overall story. I feel that Balogh should have made Sybil and Thomas the main protagonists. There is also the fact that the Duke's disfigurement has very little to do with anything. The book didn't become engaging until the very very end after two certain characters died. That's about it.If you are looking for a \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" story, don't bother with this book......

It was a 390 page book that could have come to the same conclusions in 190 pages. So much of it was repetative, sometimes repeating itself within three paragraphs at the begining of each new chapter, that I wanted to scream. I forced my way through the book by skipping things I had read several times before in previous chapters. When I was done I realized I didn't care about any of the characters and what happened to them. Not even the little girl! Fluer was illogical and sometimes down right stupid and the Duke was anything but masculin and very boring. If the deaths of some of the people was supposed to be justice of some kind I didn't see it. I would rather have seen the Duke stand up for himself. What a whimp. Very dissapointing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but not to bad...","review":"I was disappointed with buying this book, thinking it was new. I see a few authors doing this, so I am careful now to look when it was written. Ive picked up 3 books lately that have been rewrites or I thought were new books, but they are older books. This one goes back to 1991.Now Mary Balogh is one of my favorite writers, but I just felt a bit gipped into buying an old book.The book is different in the hero is married, so the whole romance is not as romantic as her newer books. The first love scene is rough and she always has nightmares about it. So that alone makes the whole book unromantic. But the story is fine, and its good to read something different. Just not a keeper for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfull!","review":"Un libro meraviglioso, praticamente perfetto,il migliore della signora Balogh, per me.

The second disc is more acid driven; especially as you approach the latter half of the disc.

If you try and force kids to read something of course they will hate it, on principal. I can understand why this was chosen as a school text, it has a lot of issues and a lot of things to discuss, with real-life, everyday issues affecting the lives of the characters involved in a supernatural and often strange setting.

Ofcourse it's not the best book in the whole world but it deserves nothing less than four stars. I've read everything from Anne Rice to Francesca Lia Block to Virgil and Shakespeare.

Besides being pathetically written, it doesn't so much have a plot as a list of events which are poorly tied at up at the end. If you are a teacher looking for books to give to your class, please avoid this one. Try \\"Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\" or \\"Animal Farm\\". But have mercy, don't subject your students to this.

This kit goes together really well. If you trim and sand the parts right it goes together really tight. No trouble with the hands or core fighter. It displays really well but its a space suit so it looks better posed in the air if your into that. In terms of out of the box building it does really well. for the price this is a great kit.

I was looking to replace an older Panasonic that was really effective. Looking at both models together, this one seems to have a bigger safety cage around the steel blades. The impact is that this model is probably safer but is not effective unless you have really long hairs (and it won't trim those all the way down)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remington NE300 Review","review":"I found that the Remington trimmer did not trim as closely as Panasonic's similar model.

The starting hands based on position2. How to calculate the 'outs' (a nice chart in the back of the book)Adjust your starting hands based on your willingness to take risks and understand your outs based on the chart in the back. The rest is pretty basic and as everyone has stated thus far there are a considerable number of mistakes.If you are going to buy another book watch the poker tournaments on T.V and find a player you most enjoy watching play, that you trust and that wins and go buy his book.

Really insulting, if you ask me; I bought Hidden Passions the week it came out, and less than a year later *poof* most of the history laid out in the book has been changed.In Hidden Passions, Eve is the only child of well-to-do parents, later on we find out that not only does she have a sister, but that the family was poor. I could go on, but I don't watch Passions anymore for a very good reason.So, if you want to spend eight bucks on glorified fanfiction, go right ahead. If you're looking to read something that sheds some insight on the older characters' histories, forget it, Passions changes the motivations and histories of the characters like a normal person changes underwear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing is almost as bad as the show itself","review":"I used to be an avid Passions watcher, so when this book first came out I couldn't wait to read it. I've had it now for over a year and still not finished it. I find it really hard to get through it without laughing. I know that its SUPPOSED to be tongue-in-cheek, but its almost ridiculous. There isn't anything in the book that you don't already know if you watch the show. You get more \\"flowery\\" details, but actual facts are the same. I suppose if you want a good, mindless read then this is for you. If you absolutely HAVE to get it, then buy the paperback. You'll save yourself some money and they have added bonus chapters that aren't in the hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for the viewers","review":"As a long time viewer of Pasions, I have grown to love this show. Hidden Passions is a must read for all watchers of the show and those that want to learn about Passions. In it we learn some of the secrets that control the past of many of the Adults in Harmony. Answering many of the questions about what really happened between these people and why the anger and hatred amongst them. The book fills in only some of the gaps and leaves us wanting more.Those that read the book and haven't seen the show will still enjoy it. It stands alone and would be a good introduction to the show for them. But even if you never watch the show, you should still enjoy the book.As I said, this book only tells part of the story and leaves you wanting for more. I hope that \\"Hidden Passions\\" has a sequel that tells us even more about the past of this highly enjoyable show."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Passions, this book is a Must!","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down!

It has very detailed stories of Ivy, Julian, Eve, TC, Grace, almost all the members of Harmony. I loved the past lives of Sheridan and Luis! All in all, I love this book, and hopefully, there will be more books to come! I would reccomend this book to any Passions fan or Passions fan to be!

Perhaps the authors were aiming at a younger, less educated market, but the level of the writing is almost insulting to one's intelligence! I suppose it does a good job of telling the stories behind everyone's favorite characters, but that's only if you can get through the sacchrine sweetness and absolutely childish writing level. I think I'll stick to watching the soap on tv from now on...I wish I could get my money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NBC's attempt to market the book and not the show...","review":"should steer viewers and readers away from a book that can only be appreciated by long-term visitors to the New England town of Harmony.

It has some really beautiful songs. The instrumentation and performances are top notch. However, over time I've begun to tire of some of the slower songs. They've become a bit more tedious with more listens. And some of the keyboard-laden \\"schmoov schwagger\\" in a few songs (like Boulevard of Dreams), get a little bit tiresome. Maybe it's the Jonathan Cain factor... However, most of the songs' beauty can't be marred even by Cain's digital \\"stylings\\", since most of the focus is on Schon's absolutely gorgeous and varied guitar playing, and since at least Cain's stuff is restrained (unlike on his own solo atrocities). What do I consider his best, you may ask? Check out Electric World..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Thunder","review":"I am a Journey fan and have owned this album on cassette for years, until my tape broke.

My first impression was : TOO MELLOW, TOO CLOSE TO LIFT MUSIK. 3 weeks later I am proved wrong again. After about a dozen or more listens this CD has grown on me and I am slowly but surely falling in love with it. It will take some time for the subtle qualities of this CD to shine through. Georgous melodies and some very original arrangements make for easy listning but never boring music.My wife and most of her friends also love this CD ( in our household a very rare occurance ).

How literature has sunk in the last few decades. Everything about The Handyman was poorly done. The characters are so shallowly drawn that they're only flimsy, lifeless cartoons. There is virtually no dramatic narrative or plot. The initial concept was a clever one, but as soon as the author begins executing it, its absurd and amateurish. What a tragedy that a good basic idea like this fell into the hands of a thoroughly unskilled writer who can only assume a flip and hackneyed technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A BRAIN, YOU'll LOVE IT !","review":"Sorry, you've got to be either totally brainless or the world's premier class shallow phoney to be able to enjoy and appreciate this mega-bomb.

Both are part humor, part philosophy, part tragedy. It's amazing how the book (and \\"Dreaming\\") walks such a fine line between funny and sad. \\"The Handyman\\" is about a wandering angel of sorts. He's not aware of his angel status but we are. The book is a kind of \\"magic surrealism\\", much like the character in the book's painting. It's not important that See be a *painter* but that she be an artist to understand how truly accidental the creative process (and its appreciative audience) can be. I'd recommend this book in a heartbeat, particularly to young men who don't know what to do with their lives, but also to lonely women who are clinging to the past. It's a magical experience, this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an intelligent and delicious read!","review":"I'd been meaning to read \\"The Handyman\\" since it came out a year or two ago, but somehow never got around to it. Then, last week, when I was down and out with the flu, I picked the thing up figuring I'd probably only skim a few pages. Au contraire: I was immediately (and happily) swept into the book's thrall. First of all, Carolyn See's fine prose is wonderfully crafted. Yet she has done her work with such a light touch that the reader is only aware of his/her enjoyment, not the writer's effort. The good-natured plot is well worth the trip, for its own sake. But the deeper themes See has laced through her pages (deft and lovely meditations on the nature of creativity, and the varying paths one trods to discover meaning in one's life) make the book's overall effect greater than the sum of its individual parts. \\"The Handyman,\\" is enchanting, redemptive, smart and just plain fun to read. Thanks Carolyn. I needed that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read.","review":"This book won't shake up the world, but I loved it for a good, fun, enjoyable read. Too rare is just a plain ole' lose-yourself for awhile book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept unrealized","review":"Loved reading how it all turns out in the first chapter and then reading how it all began. Great literary device! However, since I couldn't care about any of the characters including the hero, it engaged my writer's/reader's mind but not my spirit. I still don't understand the creative process even though we lived inside the artist. I still don't understand the love process of the key characters even thought we're told it exists. The author just didn't bring it to life. Most of the characters were cartoons and uninteresting ones at that. As always, wish it could be better since there's nothing so great as finding a good book by a talented author. This isn't one."},{"rating":"1","title":"AS BAD AS LITERATURE GETS","review":"The person who recommended this book to me was having quite the cruel joke.

The writer is a true artist. Each sentence, paragraph,and chapter is carefully crafted. The characters, so deceptively simply, become real people about whom one cares profoundly. Above all, this book is an antidote to the cynicism that seems rife it out times. It expresses a mature optimism. As we know from her autobiography Dreaming, this writer knows that bad things happen in this imperfect word; but she sees hope and the good in the world as well. I am quite surprised by the slashing adjectives some of my fellow reviews have used to describe this book. Perhaps the lesson is, if you believe it is OK to bash a serious literary effort--this book is not for you. It somes from a very humane place, where everyone (even those you do not agree with) has a right to civil consideration on their own terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is a smart and engaging exploration of art in life.","review":"See's The Handyman is a well crafted novel that explores contemporary life in Los Angeles masterfully. More importantly, she draws attention to the important (and too often neglected) relationship between life and art. The book is as insightful as it is fun. And part of the fun for me was returning to the beginning and rereading the opening fellowship application (that frames the story of the main character's journey) after finishing the entire book once. I was tempted to continue reading the rest of the novel again, too. Yes, it was that good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGET IT!","review":"If you possess at least an ounce of intelligence, you'll loath this very poorly written novel.

Random floating thoughts and musings of an aging authoress do not make a novel, certainly not a remotely good novel. A failing effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy book.","review":"A trashy, amateurishly written book that views its main character as a cross between Alan Alda and Jean-Claude Van Damme, and its women as either hopeless incompetents or sex-obsessed Madonnas. The only good thing about it is it's fast reading so you'll finish it quickly enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"A FAKE, PRETENTIOUS BORE !","review":"I've just finished reading this extraordinarily disappointing novel. What on earth is all the critical hype and fuss about?! This is surely one of the dullest and most artificial books I've ever come across. For me, all of the characters were very poorly drawn stereotypes - each one contrived with forced, hip bizarreness and tedious predictability. They weren't real - and they weren't either interesting or entertaining. I realize that the author has tried to wrap her story in an uplifting idealism, but it just doesn't come off - and I don't see how any mature and sophisticated reader could praise it. There is a depressing and rancid air to this whole story and the phony world it creates. Dull, boring, off-putting in the extreme - this book is the darling of the literary elite who also praise bizarre artistic canvasses and the other meaningless abstractions of our confused age."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY BORING AND POORLY WRITTEN NOVEL !!!","review":"I REALLY HATED THIS BOOK! THE CENTRAL CHARACTER WAS SO POORLY CONCEIVED AND CAME ACROSS AS PHONEY AND TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE.

I trudged through, however, hoping to find something of substance somewhere...what were the reviewers talking about??!!

I only learned this after the car was torn down to get to the old pump, so I had to buy a replacement at a local parts house. See the number of one star reviews saying it doesn't fit their car -- I think there are three out of eight. The one I bought locally looked like the same quality at about the same price, so maybe buying generic replacement auto parts online isn't the thing to do.Fortunately Amazon took it back with a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get 25 cards cheaper at other stores","review":"I regularly pick up a 25 pack of blank cards and envelopes at chain hobby stores for 4.99, and they come in either white or ivory.

Shrake has developed a character that is the first person born on the American Continent to achieve sainthood, and until the last pages of the book the reader is kept guessing how he could deserve such an honor. The book reads as a memoir written by McGill as he tells the story of his life while awaiting his death. He lives the life of an indian scalper, buffalo hunter, and gold miner in 19th century Texas from the time of the Texas War of Independence until after the US Civil War. The more you read of this man's account of his life, the less you can believe he could ever desert to be Sainted.This book has long been out of print, and its re-printing is an excellent opportunity for new readers to discover a classic western. Any fan of Larry McMurty's books in the \\"Lonesome Dove\\" will love \\"Blessed McGill\\" and recognize that McMurty has probably gotten some of his writting style from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessed read","review":"As a student of Texas history in general and a reader of fiction about Texas and the Southwest in particular, I found Blessed McGill by Edwin \\"Bud\\" Shrake to be rich with descriptive color and accurate detail about the rugged lives and times of both settlers and natives in the 19th century. The characters are developed in depth.His repeated use of sensory descriptions such as the smells of things adds a dimensional aspect not usually found in this kind of fare. In my opinion, the only other Western fiction writer who stacks up with Shrake is Elmer Kelton."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT NEW TENOR PLAYER","review":"THIS IS MAINLY ORIGONAL MATERIAL AND OF A VERY HIGH QUALITY.

It reads like a doctoral dissertation rather roughly adapted for the general interest audience. And while Jones might be onto something *within one or two very specific cultural contexts* (e.g., China and Africa), in the main, I think he's very wrong to suggest this anthropological patchwork, where dragons are an amalgam of the eagle, leopard, and snake.

Snakes had the power to resurrect themselves from the dead when they shed their skin, (supposedly). Snakes were the unblinking, killers of men with one bite, (supposedly). Snakes were the models for the \\"python priestesses\\" and the raw materials that created the dreaded envenomed weapons. It is still the snake today that crawls through many a nightmare.

There are also chapters on African lions (including a great capsule story of the Man-Eaters of Tsavo), leopards (which rival tigers in India as man-eaters), wolves (of which there are almost no known cases of them killing man in Europe or North America), and cougars, which are deadlier than I had realized.

His reasoning is that Premarin which is made from pregnant horses urine is a natural substance, afterall it is natural to horses. Well, the last time I checked I wasn't a pregnant horse! If you are looking for answers to the sexual problems that plague us all as we age and do not want to take prescription hormones, do not waste your money on this book.

It also doesn't fit if a USB device is plugged in, as it is too \\"fat\\". You must use a 4\\" dongle that comes with it to plug it into such places, that dongle is easily lost, and the dongle does not easily fit into the carrying case that comes with the product.In principle, it works well. But in practice, being too bulky and not plugging into the usb port at the back of a typical computer without the aid of additional, easily lost parts is a real drag.

I have two issues with the book however. The first is the font. The font is a typewriter type, making the book feel sophomoric. The other issue is the tone of the book. If read by someone with no knowledge of yorkies they would extrapolate from all her warnings that yorkies are timid and fragile and need coddling...but that is far from the truth. For example, she recommends extreme caution in interactions between yorkies and other dogs in such a way that might make owner afraid to let their yorkie play with other dogs, instead of letting them explore and be dogs."},{"rating":"1","title":"they were working perfect and then the lights stopped working! they are installed and they are pieces of junk now!!!","review":"Yea thats right the lights stopped working, checked everything and well, the LED's dont work, what a shame job, work for awhile and then they stop just great.....................and I bought them for that reason, my friends stopped working too"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific set","review":"This set contains some of the best of the Uncle Wiggily stories (which is one of the best children's series in print).

I tried it over and over. Same thing. I wrapped it up and took it right back. I purchased a Pioneer DVR-520H DVD recorder, hooked it up to my very old VCR, put in a very old VHS tape and it recorded it beautifully. Don't waste your time with this thing...the manual gives you easy instructions to set it up..BUT- if you have a problem with it forget it!

Finally, they managed a way to get it to work, but the quality was really choppy--I got better images using the MPEG mode of my digital still camera. It would only work using the USB and the image quality just wasn't worth the price I paid.On a positive note, the tech support was very good, they really tried to help, and after spending several hours, the guy on the phone said he'd call me back the next day to contiunue to try to find a solution.

I would like to add two points. First, this book shares an all too common problem with IT books in that an editor should have taken another look at this book to catch the numerous grammar errors (notably in subject/verb agreement) and redundant passages. Second, this book has a fictional case study scenario at the end of every chapter. I found these to be poorly thought-out and not particularly helpful, especially when compared to the very informative, well-chosen actual case studies to which the authors did not devote enough time. I suggest teachers use a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy Read","review":"We used this text in my data networking class and I'm discovering what a poor choice it was for the subject of computer networks.

Of course, with a loose piece of cardboard, the cardboard falls out, gets lost, etc. I bought this specific leather cover since it was supposed to accommodate duplicate checks.

The entries are leftovers from Michael Gray's research for other Dylan books, namely \\"Song And Dance Man\\" (which I also own but have never waded through), and he doesn't seem to have edited it or put forth any additional effort. Many of the passages have incorrect information or mere guesses. I was in a book store in Berkeley returning from a recent Dylan tour, and they were selling it for $15. They had stacks of them.

I am continuely amazed at how much I find new everytime I pick it. This book is definitely a pick up and open and read and then let it take you to where it will with its links, references and connections to ideas, songs, symbolism, and the famous (and not so famous).

Largely apolitical, some were successful, some were not.

I was always worried about the germs from the table and I couldn't put a plate in front of him because he would dump the food and throw the plate! I also tried putting food on a napkin but that was even worse! I now use these with my second child and I wouldn't think of eating out without them. They are large enough to cover the perfect amount of table and I can relax knowing that she's not eating food directly off of the table. I apply the bottom sticky strip just under the edge of table and then pull tight to apply the top one. This is a must have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of $$$...","review":"My son also rips these right off the table. He is almost 11 months old so hopefully he will do better with them when he is older (fortunately I only bought the 20 pack). This is a great idea in theory but for my curious son it is not practical. I am back to using my antibacterial wipes to clean the table off which is the only effective method that I have found so far.Update: I have recently found two alternatives of this same concept that have worked out well. The local Dollar Tree sells their own version of table toppers that cling quite well (pack of 8 for $1) and the Hippopatamus brand that Target sells that have great educational themes of ABCS and numbers 1-10.

But now that she's 13 months, she would rather pull the topper up and play with it. My husband keeps one hand one side of it and I keep my hand on the other side of it while we're eating - otherwise she pulls them off (sometimes she still manages to do so). I agree with other comments that it would be better if the sticky stuff were on all four sides, not just the top and the bottom. I have found that at this point, the topper is useless for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never purchase these again","review":"I purchased these mats for my 12 month old son because I'm a germophobe & these sounded like a great idea for eating out. However, they barely stick to any surface we've tried. My son gets so excited with the bright colors, he rips them off in 1 second flat. And forget trying to re-stick them to the table. I emailed Neat Solutions who makes them, suggesting they use stronger adhesive, put it around all 4 sides, & take the adhesive to the edges so that little fingers can't get under them & yank them up. Their response to me was to make sure I laid the mat flat & pressed on the adhesive! (Duh, no kidding!) They also said that \\"even though others have suggested the same thing, that it isn't cost-effective for them to use stronger or more adhesive at this time\\"!! Since they have no intention of improving this product, I have no intention of ever purchasing it again or recommending it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for dining out","review":"We just love these things and always keep some in our diaper bag for our twins.They really stay put and stick right to the table.

He is very independent and loves to feed himself. I don't really like the idea of him eating off of a high chair that countless other children have used, so I bought these table toppers. What a waste of money. He immediatly tore it off of the table and threw it on the floor. I had it tight with no bubbles to draw extra attention, but he's not easily fooled. I wish that someone would come up with something that can't be torn off so easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Stay in Place!","review":"I had heard wonderful things about the Table Topper, but my 7 month old daughter rips these off the table in seconds!!!! There is no adhesive on the sides...which would be very helpful. I will not be purchasing these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definite must-have!","review":"I absolutely love these things. They are one of the best baby products ever introduced. The only thing I dislike about them is that the adhesive is only on the top and bottom. Now that my son is 14 months old, he has figured out how to grab on the sides where there is no adhesive and pull up the mat. Until he learns eat off a plate without it ending up on the floor when we go out to eat (or at home for that matter!), we will be using these."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for eating out with toddlers!","review":"I am not a neat freak but the thought of my toddler eating of tables that look like they haven't been cleaned in who knows how long really grossed me out.

I know this just sounds like an aggravated rant, but over half of the tables at the restaurant have one or more square residue outlines left from the sticky side of these place-mats. These marks aren't only frustrating for the restaurant staff, but are also unsightly for the guests of the restaurant.

Have these!","review":"If you EVER eat out with your toddler, you need to invest in these mats. It used to disgust me to see parents wipe off a table at a restaurant and then put their chid's food directly on the table. You don't realize how unsanitary that is. These mats quickly adhere to the table, typically stay put, and provide for clean-up.I deducted a star, because sometimes, just sometimes, I am fumbling so much trying to remove the covers for the adhesive that my child starts getting a little rowdy because he's ready for his food.

Though the liner notes do not indicate the recording date, it is clear from the pictire inside, as well as the nausea-inducing presence of a cheap ARP synthesizer, that this was recorded sometime in the eighties! Not that this would automatically make it awful; it's just awful period. The group DOES hit some nice grooves occasionally, but Walt's unmistakeable organ sound has all but vanished in place of a smoother, more homogonized tone that could just as easily come out of a Casio keboard; in additon, all the percussion sounds exceedingly bright to the point of annoyance. Over all, this collection completely lacks pretty much everything that makes the rest of Walt's work enjoyable. For die-hard completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively organ music with Latin beat.","review":"Great organ music with many songs being as good as, if not better, than Summer Samba - a song practically everyone has heard but, since it's an instrumental, you may not know its name.If you like \\"perky\\" organ music, this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Jazz","review":"The Eddie Condon's concerts at Town Hall, NYC in 1944 are an amazing dixieland jazz, be worth it!Os concertos de Eddie Condon no Town Hall em 1944 so fantásticos dixieland jazz, vale a pena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"Diane Coyle, a consultant and columnist, presents an in-depth and optimistic look at modern capitalism. Dubbing our current age a transitional period, she predicts that the result of our recent bout of high-tech fueled economic growth will be even more growth and a better society. Coyle refers to historical parallels and many texts to make her case that technology has transformed society in significant ways that even experts are only beginning to understand. We [...] recommend this compelling and authoritative book to executives and managers, and to serious readers and academics, all of whom will enjoy the way it makes sense of today's contradictory financial and social developments."},{"rating":"2","title":"My impression about this book.","review":"I will probably fail miserably if I attempt to make a learned analysis of this book, rather, I will share my impression on this work (purely subjective) with whomever cares to read this review. I found this book by Diane Coyle exquisite. I am no fan of Capitalism, yet, found her arguments very persuasive and full of common sense. I have an already admitted weakness for books of this sort (economic related matters for the layman). Ms. Coyle makes a powerful argument of why the new brand of Capitalism will be good for the masses after a transitional period and why it will remove from power most of these days' entrenched powers that be. This book is worth your time and money. Enjoy it. Somehow related to it is another good book I am reading at this time that is entitled: The Sovereign Individual (James Dale Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love My MP3 Player","review":"Although some of the reviews are not great.

Not great, but hey, I'm not complaining after some of the horror stories I've read. As for the battery life, 11 hours is about right only if you're not playing it for 11 hours straight. 2-3 hours at a time for a couple of days without charging is what I got for the first few months. I decided to buy the extra battery (also purchased from jukeboxaccessories.com) since they were the only store selling it at a reasonable price at the time. Now, I travel back and forth from home to school to work and back home and enjoy several hours of play time without charging the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"If you think Christina Aguilera has a good voice you should get this cd because Jessica Simpson has an incredible and diverse voice .

Ati Yoga is not a belief system; faith is an impediment. Rather, it is an epistemology; its literature a gnostic effulgence illuminating that part of our experience we deem the spiritual. \\"The Great Image: The Life Story of Vairochana The Translator\\" is a fluid, brilliant articulation of that innermost knowledge and belongs on the book shelf of any who revel in the history of human achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"appreciate achievements of great minds","review":"Analytic geometry is where the maths student first encounters the combining of traditional Euclidean geometry with algebra. A profound mix, though perhaps most students won't appreciate it as such. Boyer shows how, slowly, the necessary ideas in analytic geometry came together. He traces the first stirrings back to the classical era of ancient Greece and Rome. But the greatest step may well have been due to Rene Decartes and his laying down of the x and y grid in two dimensions. Plus, of course, analytic geometry was necessary for the development of calculus, with the concept of a slope.You probably are already familiar with all of the maths that the book covers. What Boyer offers is an appreciation of the great minds that preceded up and made these achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album of this style!","review":"I have this album for a long while, along close to a hundred other albums which feature music played on the spanish guitar.

Its ability to let you drag those clips onto a story board is excellent. Clipping bits off the front and back of clips is a breeze. Adding titles to your clips is pretty easy.Creating chapters and menus is a nightmare. It either uses your entire movie as the title (complete with elevator music) or it misses out a great chunk of your soundtrack so that your visit to Disneyland contains your commentary for your sister's wedding.

It raises the question as to why this album was made. After having been made, why was it subsequently released on compact disc? Why was a live album of the Nuclear Blues tour also released on compact disc? Blood, Sweat & Tears helped pioneer the jazz -rock movement. Their contribution to rock remains immeasurable.

Judy Mazel is one of us. She really knows what it is like to be an EATER! Best of all she teaches you how to continue being an eater. Sound impossible? It did to me too.

It's worth the tough part many times over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be a lot better","review":"First the good:Yes, food combining and using principles of enzymes and digestion does help.

I pretty much as already eating most of the time as this book dictates so it wasnt really a major revelation or anything to me. I read it in the bookstore and thought that it was ok but severely lacking in facts and references to backup what the author was preaching.

There is a TON of fruit on this diet and this morning I have to eat a good deal of prunes...but I also can look forward to days on the diet coming up when I can eat whatever I want in moderation and know that I wont gain weight because it will be followed by fruit days that will keep me from gaining a pound. This is a healthy diet. Fruit, carbs(other then fruit),protien, and healthy fats like olive oil.

However \\"Cash In on Cash Flow\\" by Laurence Pino is, by far, the best written book on starting a business and actually succeeding at it. There are so many books out there that offer theories and suppositions about the business world but Mr. Pino has been in the trenches and speaks from experience in a clear and understandable voice. You feel like he is talking directly to you and your situation! He even mentions meeting the reader someday. If that's not personal, I don't know what is. Don't hesitate, get this book and get yourself into the exploding Cash Flow business.

But, if you want to lay aside your cares and just enjoy a good time, then by all means buy this DVD. I couldn't help thinking about modern musical comedy, which fulills the same purpose as this earliest effort by Rossini: just provide an escape for a reasonable length of time. This production makes a good case for type-casting singers who not only can sing and act but are believable because they are more or less the ages of the characters they portray on stage. The entire production is suited to the small Rokokotheater used in the Schwetzingen Festival, and what's more important in this case, to the small home theater. Delightful entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the Basics","review":"If what you need is a detailed book with extensive writing on theory and practice with few practical examples, you may want to invest in a different text.

No tipping required. Flat I mean FLAT, It was amazing. The only problem was that it spoiled me. I thought all marine paints must be like this. So when it came time to paint the deck I went with one part epoxy paint three times the price of this. Huge mistake on my part. I should have stuck with Rustoleum. It was a 9 coat ordeal with wet sanding brush & roller marks out between.

Although I really like Lisa Kay's style, I was hoping for more of a work-out. The video is a little more than 30 minutes and almost all cardio. There are a couple of times where you use light weights for arm movements, but there is no sculpting for the lower body. Also, expect to do the workout a few times before you familiarize yourself with the moves. It is hard to get your heart rate up before you know the steps. It does use the fanny lifter but a chair and a normal step would work just as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money","review":"I purchased this dvd in the store and am sadly disappointed. I had read so many good things about Firm workouts. I guess if you're familiar with their moves, etc, you'll like this workout.

This was an exception. Wish I could return this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused","review":"I bought this tape thinking it was a regular cardio tape. I had no idea that all of the firm's tapes require the use of this fanny lifter thing. Isn't it enough I wasted money on the tape, now they want me to go spend money on equipment? Ok, well I guess some people don't mind. But they should at least make that clear in the video description so that people don't waste money on something they don't want.

This is the WORST of all time. The lead instructor flies through the movements without doing counts or adequate reps or instruction in a horrid twang that rings of an overly peppy cheerleader who is nothing but pure fluff.

I did not get a sweat out of this tape but, at the same time I could not follow through with them. They go from one step to another, as if you rehearsed each step with them for six weeks before the shot the tape.I was totally uncoordinated. They were doing one step, then another, and another, and I was still trying to figure out the first step. Doing this workout I felt like a chicken with my head cut off.I will just stick with their streingth training tapes. Those are awesome, and they really do tone you!For cardio, I would recommend the one hour Tae-Bo's. They are easier to follow.

I bought this one as an afterthought, to go with the Cardio Inferno. This one has a lot of mild techniques, but gets the muscles warmed up pretty good. I don't sweat as much with this one as the Infirno.I'm quick to pick up on the techniques, but also have to slow down at times to get the right form down.

Perhaps if one has read the series from the beginning, the characters would feel fuller, richer, more like people. However the sign of a great book is to make a newcomer to a series feel for the characters regardless of which book in a series is read first. I didn't feel much of anything for any of the characters. Likewis it seemed that the mystery was solved haphazardly with little evidence and more luck than anything and a satisfying conclusion came with a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I could barely get through this book.

Unfortunately, the book just didn't deliver in the mystery department. It is very descriptive of Egyptian life and I'll give the author credit for setting it in an uncommon part of Egypt. But the fundamentals of the mystery were off. It started too slow, it did build some intrique halfway through by creating a solid list of potential \\"suspects\\" but the resolution to the main mystery and a secondary mystery just left me unsatisfied. It's difficult for me to elaborate without revealing too many details of the book so let me just concolude that there are much better Egyptian mysteries available."},{"rating":"2","title":"History + Mystery = Superb Entertainment","review":"Lauren Haney has done an excellent job weaving multiple storylines of human interest with a compelling mystery set in 18th dynasty Egypt.

Many of Schulz arguements also examine the cost benefits and ethnical mores of aiding third world and other nations.While it took me quite a while to make it through the opening chapter of this book once I begun to examine the chapters looking at health care, environmentalism, and other topics the book began to gell for me.

The writing is superb too and I don't think there is a bad episode in the lot. That said, I have raves for the subsequent seasons, too, and hope that they are released quickly. This is where Taxi hit a peak and stayed there for a while. There's a good mix of different sorts of humor - the outrageous kind in the episode about Latka becoming Vic Ferrari, to more low-key, warming humor as when we meet Reverend Jim's family.

That being said, this is a terrific book. Hicks clearly lays out the elements necessary to create a tight, emotionally-satisfying thriller. He outlines the narrative structure of a solid thriller in clear, helpful language, and goes on to explain the characteristics of a strong protagonist and antagonist. He also offers an explanation of the differences between an action film, a detective film, a horror film and a thriller -- and he provides examples and script excerpts from great thrillers (such as North By Northwest and Breakdown) to demonstrate his ideas.

Not because of anything in the game, or the game play itself, as both of those things will forever remain a complete mystery to me. You see, from the moment I attempted to play this game, it began to crash (in some cases Blue-Screening the entire system) literally every minute or two. In some cases, the game wouldn't even start completely. I spent a total of 12 hours, reloading the game, reloading my computer, and talking with Sony's tech support to no avail. The game continued to crash every time I tried to play. I was never even able to exit the building in which you begin the game! Tons of people play this game, but I guess I?m not going to be one of them.My advice is that unless you're willing to take the time to trouble-shoot random, frequent game crashes and spend 45 minutes at a time on hold for tech support only to get no help, you should take you money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product bad delivery service","review":"This is well worth the money! however Amozon was supposed to deliver to my house 2 days after the release and here it is three weeks after and still no PoP.

Sony has perhaps made every mistake in the book and a few new ones managing this product. Customer support is almost non-existant, quality testing of game changes is a joke, and the rule set of the game appears to be written in disapearing ink. Pick the wrong class and you could find your character's abilities or equipment completely changed for the worse even after years of play. The latest high impact insult to loyal customers were of the Monk class, an excellent and fun class to play before recent changes. Monks are not the first nor will they be last to suffer from the horrid mismanagement of Everquest.

This is a great workout for everyone. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good weight video","review":"This won't get your heart rate going, at least until you get to the leg portion, but it is a good video if you want to work on weight lifting. Most of their videos pair weight training with aerobics. However some, like this one, is just weights. I like it. It is broken into segments....amrs, legs, arms and legs. I like to mix up aerobics with the weight lifting videos for better results. I love the Firm videos and the results I am getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite \\"go to\\" dvd","review":"I have many, many firm videos and dvds, but this is my favorite by far.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent little workout","review":"I know that I should probably work out more than 40-45 minutes a day given how sedentary the rest of my life is. But, really, I try to eat well and exercise everyday, and besides, my life is not my body. I am a nurse, not a movie star. So, having said all that, really, I like this workout. True it's not Cathe Freidrich or Jari Love, but damnit, I'm getting old, and I don't always want all that stress. Anyway, some days I just cannot face more than 40-45 minutes of working out in front of the television, and I can tell you that this little workout will leave you feeling pretty good. On days when I'm feeling hypermotivated, maybe I'll do Jillian Michaels Burn Fat, Boost Metabolism video (which rocks, by the way), but for those every day, oh crap I need to work out or the depression monster will get me needs, this is an outstanding workout (remember, you can always heavy up) that you can do quickly, and the rest of your day will be the better for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too eay and too much stretching in between sets","review":"The arm workout was entirely too easy and there is entirely too much stretching between sets.

It has three different sessions that can be done separately or alltogether. The upper body is really good and you can feel it, specially with the dumbells. The warming session of the lower body part is a little difficult to follow up for a begginner, because it includes different movements with little reps. But the exercises for the lower body are really strong and do shape the legs. The abs part is short, but is intense. I recommend it definitively for begginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as other Firm Videos","review":"I am a lover of The Firm. I have had fantastic results with their videos, but this one I find very disappointing. I did not feel worked out afterward. It is broken up into 3 sections working the upper body, lower body and abs separately. It does not have the advantage of the other Firm videos that do more in less time by working the lower body along with the upper body. After each section, I thought \\"Is that it?!\\" However, if you are really short on time or just beginning, this workout may be great for you. It is extremely beginner friendly and can be easily used in 15 minute sections. If you want a wonderfully intense workout and can exercise for a full hour, try \\"The Firm Body Sculpting Basics\\".

You will get lower and upper and ab work all on this one tape. I agree with some of the comments I have read about some of the older firm tapes which I have purchased that the instructors are not friendly and the music is kind of cheesy but this video has great music and instructors.

I usually alternate lower and upper on different days. The lower body has lots of squats and lunges with no floor work, so I usually throw in the Hips, Thighs and Abs too. I have really noticed a difference in just 1 month. HOWEVER, the DVD quality is really poor, and I have noticed lots of postings complaining about the quality. Amazon offered to either refund my money if I return them, or give me 20% of the purchase price. I am just going to keep them and live through the defects (totally frustrating), but I wonder when they will do something about it.

I've been cutting my 3 boys' hair for many years, having learned by using common sense and by watching my stylist's technique as she cut my hair. I was hoping this book would help me finally understand how to give a good haircut. Not so.If you are a visual learner, you will find it difficult to follow the step-by-step instructions, since there are few accompanying photos. At a minimum, the instructions for each type of haircut should be accompanied by a photo of that style, as well as head sketches or photos showing the progression of the haircut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an easy book to follow","review":"I feel bad giving this author 1 star because I can only imagine how difficult it is to write a book. And I'm sure she's a good stylist. But I'm a guy who wants to cut his own hair and I couldn't find any easy-to-follow instructions in this book. I truly am a haircutting 'dummy' so I need a book that will treat me like a dummy- and this isn't it. There were terms I didn't understand 100% but no glossary to explain them and the index was little help. Since the book is over 300 pages, I wasn't about to flip through the pages to find answers.I would suggest that the next edition have far less talk and have far more photos with step-by-step instructions.

Waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I cut my husband's hair, and was looking for some good direction for cutting and blending the back of mens hair, especially neckline and around the ears. This book could have been ever so much better if there were photos of actual hair cutting...how the hands are positioned, how the scissors are positioned, how the hair is actually held, what direction to cut in, etc.The book contains mostly drawings of cutting guides and how you should part the hair to do the cutting. I think these drawings are more beneficial for professionals. And although there are one or two drawings of the things I think would be most helpful (described above), they do not take place of photos (or series of photos) actually showing how it is done. The few photos that are included are of finished styles.While I did get one great tip from it, this book is not that helpful for people at home cutting their family's hair. I have liked other \\"Dummies\\" books, but I feel like I wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illiterate","review":"Elaine Spear may know how to use scissors, but she has less than a sophomoric comprehension of the English language.

Indeed, in these poems Shaykh al Akbar Ibn e Arabi (may his secret be sanctified) was revealing Truths which he experienced in his journey towards and in Allah (The Divine) and therefore unless one has similar experiences it is impossible to ascertain the real meanings behind the words. His explanations help a little but even they are really aimed at other Sufi Masters who are traversing the Path.

Maria is a strong willed independent young woman, which in some ways leads her into extreme risk with drug dealers in Bogota. However her strong will also saves her in the end as she escapes from the web strung around her and other young women like her. The film draws you into her situation and is suspenseful throughout.

What I like about the movie is it goes straight to the point no scene is in this movie as a filler, and all the actors don't seem to be acting they just simply are (what they're playing!) And the scene that touched me the most is where the Colombian hostess (who offered Maria shelter in her time of need)is explaining how one gets homesick in the U.S. but when one gets to send money back home after receiving one's first paycheck (how it affects you as the provider of the family) that just rips your heart right out.but because the acting is nuanced you have to pay attention to know where she is coming from!

The author did an excellent job of allowing us to see all sides of Grace. There's a lot of pain in her life, but what sticks out the most for me is Grace's sense of humor. I laughed out loud many times.To keep the story honest, Keavy Clayton, doesn't hold back. The story is peppered with four letter words and harsh realities.

The electrical unit in the first one I first purchased is approximately the length of the fleecy cover. I was unpleasantly surprized to discover that the heating unit in the newly purchased mat is only a small square, leaving approximately 2/3rds of the total mat surface unheated. I returned it immediately and purchased a competing brand that heats the entire bed surface (or close to it). My two arthritic and very elderly cats (17 and 18 years old) love their heated beds and stretch out full-length. I don't think they would be as comfortable if they had to curl up tight to get the benefit of the heated area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, poor design, way overpriced","review":"Thermo Kitty Mat--It seems that those of us in search of a heated bed for a convalescing or elderly pet are a captive market. This unit is a case in point. The exterior shell is a zippered fleece fabric pad with a thin piece of foam folded inside. The heating unit is a simple low wattage element encased in a plastic cover. That's it. Not only is there no thermostat control, there's not even an on/off switch--you have to plug/unplug the unit to turn it on or off. That's a pretty basic design flaw. This would be a bit of a ripoff at half the price; unfortunately, from what I can tell, it's more the rule than the exception. Every heated pet bed I've looked at is similarly flimsy in design and construction and outrageously overpriced. Anyway, you've been warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond disappointing","review":"The mat is 12x24, the heating pad part is 10x10, meaning less than half the mat is heated. But, in truth, maybe the deceptive size of the pad doesn't matter, because if you hold your hand on the mat--well, the portion the heating pad is in--you can almost feel a slight bit of heat. Almost.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"My cats love it","review":"I bought this mat for my elderly cat because I like to keep the temperature cool in the house and I was worried that she might be too cold. She spends a lot of time on it, but when she is not there, another of my 4 cats is usually there. It took a couple days for them to realize that the mat was heated, but once they did, they love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"heating element too small","review":"I assumed that the heating element would be roughly the same size as the bed, but it's much smaller. I already own a pet bed this size that has a heating element which is almost the full size of the bed, and I thought that I was buying the same thing. The heating element on this is less than half the size of the bed, which seems pointless.

Mitchell and her world-class backup band create one of the best concert albums ever.The video on the other hand features poor production values. The camera work is amateurish and the editing is awful. Why did Mitchell consent to releasing such sub-standard representation of an amazing concert?I almost cried when it got to the jam during The Dry Cleaner from Des Moines and saw nothing but crappy shots of the Las Vegas strip.Now, both Jaco and Michael Brecker are gone.

It is of course the music that makes it tick: Joni's smokey jazz-rock and unmatchable guitar work accompanied by the amazing Jaco Pastorious, Pat Metheny and others. This is 70s fusion at its best. Yes, some of the filmed creative content is dated (or nostalgic, depending on your point of view), but the musical performances stand tall. Shadows and Light was, according to legend, the first feature-length music video. What could one expect of Joni Mitchell other than innovation?

I recommend the dice over the alarm clock.The assembly directions were barely adequate - they are in several languages and about half a sentence for each step. However, she was able to piece it together. We still have no idea how to set the time, other than to wait until noon or midnight to put in the batteries. There is no schematic provided, so it was impossible for me to help or for her to learn how it works. The actual soldering itself is reasonably easy, and good for a beginner.In summary, this kit is only good for practicing soldering - you will not learn any electronics and you will not gain a useful alarm clock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to build","review":"This was a project for my 14 yr old son to build on a cold winter day. The instructions were step by step so the assembly was a breeze. They did short change us one L.E.D that was easily found at Digi Key. As far as the clock goes the procedure on adjusting the time is not clear so changing it is a pain in the neck. All in all it was fun for my son to do. If you have someone who is just getting into electronics it is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of [junk]","review":"The software stinks. The player hangs all the time. The reset is buried so deep you need a three foot long needle to get to it, and you do need to get to it all the time.

Unfortunately I wonder if I got what I paid for. The user interface is clumsy, especially while driving, which is my primary use. The unit occasionally locks up and must be reset, even though I stay current with firmware and driver upgrades. The size and shape is awkward, and I don't care for the design. However, it does work, and I have packed it full of about 150 CDs recorded at 192k. With my [$$$] ears compressed audio is fine for the car, but it still doesn't cut it for home listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage! Buyer Beware!","review":"This unit never performed as advertised. Their tech line kept leading me on that firmware updates would fix it, but never did. My primary use of the MP3 was during travel, on the airplane or cruise ship. It ALWAYS let me down. It finally died and would not respond to any command. Sent it back to Creative for a $20 test. They called and told me what I already knew, it died. They wanted $180 to fix, I said forget it. Next step will be to return it to their President...he can keep it, he needs it more than I do. He needs to fix their quality problems. I have now purchased a Gateway unit and just love it....flawless operation and much more user friendly."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK till it stopped working after 10 months","review":"Aside from being big and bulky, I was somewhat happy with this jukebox. After a brief 9 and a half months, it stopped working. I was getting an error message saying firmware problem and unable to listen to anything because the machine would not boot up. Customer service then mislead me into sending back the unit to be fixed or repaired. This was not the case- they wanted $200 to fix a 10 month old unit.

I love it. No problems with it. It installed and ran easily - I was using it within minutes.Lots of storage, interface took some getting used to, sound quality is great, battery life is good...(the additional battery pack is extremely helpful - I find I only charge every 10-14 days)It's quite durable - In fact, several months ago, I tripped on a sidewalk and my precious Jukebox crashed and went skidding (face down) across the road! I thought for sure this would be the end of it. There were a couple of ugly scratches on it, but it started right up and there hasn't been any side effects.I do have one complaint: you can't search for a song in a playlist while it's playing. Hitting the search button brings you back to the main \\"music library\\" search.This is a great MP3 player if you're looking for lots of storage. I can't recommend it enough.

I have had problems since the moment I bought it and foolishly didn't retunr it before the warranty was up because I thought their customer support team could help. They didn't...in fact they once made the problem worse and then had no more suggestions except to send it in..of course at a high charge. I have had problems loading music, faulty batteries, faulty AC adapter, faulty firmware, etc...and the problems continue to arise. I almost want to cry when I think of how much money I spent on this thing.

About six months later, it would not play off the battery. We returned it and Creative Labs said that the mother board was defective and that we must pay $75 to have it replaced since its warranty is only three months long. As far as the world of consumer electronics is concerned, a defective mother board is a manufacturer's defect, not the consumer's problem. Reality check....Apple is out there with better products, better design, and better customer service. Too bad that Creative Labs' won't even stand behind its own products.....you are better off going with an IPOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This thing is supposed to sound great. Well, first of all, it comes with what I consider pieces of junk for headphones. Try out the Radio Shack Titanium magnet portable headphones (the best portable headphones I have ever heard) and you'll see what I mean. Also, this unit has NO volume. It is adequate for in the home, but if you were on a plane or a bus, it could easily be overpowered. I have owned the Iomega Hip Zip player which blows this one out of the water. The Iomega is so loud, it rivals a home stereo. The only advantage is storage space for the Creative Jukebox. I returned it in 24 hours. It is great for a music junkie, but if you want the best sounding unit out there, shop around. I'll stick with my Iomega player."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not work with MusicMatch Jukebox; nonstandard charger","review":"It is nice to have 20 GB of music and 22 hours of battery life (with an optional 2nd battery). But I couldn't get the jukebox to work with MusicMatch Jukebox and therefore was forced to used Creative's extremely painful software. More painful was losing the AC adaptor. It is a 5V adaptor with a non-standard connector. So you can't go into Radio Shack and get a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"This jukebox gets worse with time.

I dropped my player quite a few times. Took it with me on missions. Used it every single day. After 2 years my player still works perfectly. Its worn beyond belief but still works fine. Just letting all of you know these units are as tough as them make them...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great -- if its works; purchase at your own risk","review":"The wide disparity in reviews illustrates that this is a great product -- if it works. Unfortunately, it quit working for me after the short 90-day warranty expired, as it apparently has for a number of others. The player would hang after a few minutes of playing. Creative tech support was worthless -- did little more than read the support faqs and put me through hours of clean-ups, reinstalling firmware, reformatting -- and finally advising me that the problem must be my MP3s. If you're lucky, like many of the reviewers, this unit is outstanding. If you're not, you'll end up spending many frustrating hours fiddling with this thing and ultimately you'll have an expensive paperweight.

I should have known better than to purchase an expensive electronics item that only came with a 3 month warranty.While it worked it was great. But it has cost me $150.00 a month for my son to listen to music and now it is useless. I suggest you wait until Creative offers a better warranty and stands behind its products before purchasing this.Everyone who has been shafted should complain to Creative. Maybe eventually they will listen.

First of all, I am a PC person, like many as opposed to mac people. The creative Nomad Jukebox 3 looks like a Cd player, can last 22 hours with another battery, can have over 5000 songs (if you really listen to that many at once) and has an easy interface. IF there would be any problem with this, it would be that it is a bit too big, although it does have a PLAYLIST like no other. On the IPOD, not only is there only Firewire (very uncompatible with many) but there is no way of seperating the songs, except alphabetically. Good luck finding your songs.

He seems to be different than your run of the mill guitar star. Sure, he can play fast and heavy, but he has always been more musical than most others. That being said, I don't know why I was as surprised as I was. I still expected much more overt flash than I got at first listen.Its there, but in different ways. His talent as a producer and composer is very evident in this collection. Spectacular soundscapes. Very interesting noises and tones. Strong compositions. Good, solid, inventive guitar work as well. Very highly recommended. A rare 5star cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Jazz/Rock Fusion CD","review":"Schon's playing is a tasty as ever on this CD.

There are no definate instructions given on the activities, just ideas and page numbers referencing other little house/pioneer books. It's seems it would be helpful in a classroom setting where standardized lesson plans and grading are necessary because the guide contains a large amount of information on evaluation, that is if you can actually execute the activity.There also really isnt a whole lot of coloring/activity pictures, the ones given are quite boring and not worth keeping the entire guide for.I'm unable to give any recommendations as I have yet to find a really useful Little House guide, especially one that could be used in a homeschool setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Old songs from a young J.L.Hooker.

Whether it be something from the late 40's or his newest releases back in 2000 with John Lee Hooker and Friends. That is what was great about this man, he just got better as time went on. To start out, The Very Best of John Lee Hooker is a great way to get into him if you are interested in the blues. You wont be dissapointed. The Classic Boom Boom, One Scotch, One Beer, are great, but the others that you may never heard of are just as good. It serves You Right To Suffer, Burnig Hell, and Crawlin' King Snake are just a couple on this cd that will grab you. I give this disc 5 stars and then some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boogie King","review":"John Lee Hooker, \\"king of the boogie,\\" is one of the most influential guitarists to ever record. He is also one of the most unique, as his rhythmic and dynamic senses are more free than what one may be accustomed to... he also changes chords rarely, if ever, in some songs. Now i myself have complained about 3 chord bands... this is different, this man hypnotizes you with his awesome, entrancing riffs and licks. This collection is probably the finest one disc compilation of this master's work and belongs in any music lover's collection. If you think that all blue sounds the same and all is 12 bars etc etc (any blues aficionado knows much better than to pay any heed to these ridiculously ill-informed stereotypes), John Lee Hooker is a good place to see that the blues is one of the forms most open for free expression and experimentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"one cd, one artist, one to have!","review":"Every serious blues collection needs something from John Lee Hooker, and this cd is a great place to start.

You cant go wrong with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good at what it does","review":"Be aware - this is a reprint of a 1970s-era textbook based on teaching ideas from the 1940s.

Say, a man walking on some indescriptive street and a voice behind tells who is he or what have he told some time ago.Plenty of accusations to the \\"official science\\" that they don't listen to a reason and don't want any proofs. Not much of actual proofs. It reminds me mostly amateurish informercial where participants pitching how great they are before pithing the product (in this case, their books, probably).The only plausible proof of their point that I heard in the movie was that many stones are done with a machinery precision, impossible manually. However, they were too busy complaining about \\"official science\\" and pitching how great they are to really demonstrate this machine precision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining FOP movie","review":"Like Channel Chasers, this is a fairly amusing Fairly Oddparents movie. I have to say that I like these movies better than most episodes, because of the longer and more involved storylines.In this one, Timmy has gone a year without losing his fairies and is rewarded with a cupcake that grants its holder one rule-free wish. Apparently a kid keeping their fairy for that long is a rare occurence because kids lose their fairies when others find out about them.Timmy can't decide on his wish at the moment, so he decides to hold onto the cupcake - and so the cupcake ends up in the hands of several other people, causing several different worlds based on the wishmaker's wish (a monkey bites the cupcake and the world becomes something ala Planet of the Apes) and the cupcake even ends up in Crocker's hands..Overall this is a good movie for anyone who likes FOP"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should have a Fairly Odd parent","review":"Maybe is the wittiest more intelligent cartoon I've ever seen since Dexter's Lab.

In truth, the monsters in that area are in the 35-45 range.

This book is very nice and it's filled with losts of pretty pictures with good useful imformation about each zone but it's not a guide to keep beside your computer while you play.While the maps are pretty, they are small with little detail. But the major problem with this book is that the zones are listed alpabeticaly for the whole world, I mean you don't put Alaska next to Afganastan!

The maps are very general (and in some cases inaccurate) and contain none of the detail needed to find your way around the various zones.

If you are a novice gamer, please do not buy this book as a guide to the world of EQ. The maps are grossly incorrect in respect to locations of landmarks, camps, town, druid rings, you name it. The zone levels listed are most incorrect and the \\"dangers within\\" background stories are erroneous.Ever since Sony shoved Verant Interactive out of the picture, there has a been a succession of poorly executed attempts to milk the EQ cash cow.

The maps are not easy to read or follow, and the beastiary has errors. One example is in the listing for Everfrost Peaks, the atlas says monsters there are lvl 1-15. Icy Orcs and Ice Giants are found in Everfrost Peaks and are considerably higher than lvl 15. I wonder how many other zones are listed with incorrect monster levels? The bottom line is that there are zone maps available on-line that are much better than the ones you will find here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Location numbers are important","review":"...location grid numbers are vital to maps in everquest, and so far in previews this map book is lacking them which makes it unfortunately worthless.

Most maps in real life have \\"grid coordinates\\" of longitude and latitude, so why not this atlas??For the Advanced and Expert Everquest gamers, the maps will be more of a hinderance and makes the Atlas more or less useless imho, as most tend to use grid locations to find out were they are or were they want to go.For the Beginer or Intermediate, this Atlas will contain much usefull information about zones/places they will travel.Overview: the zone information in it will be helpful but if they had put in a little extra effort and did the maps in grid fashion, this would be a hot item.

Brooks also does an effective job of discussing the background of the massacre with clear chapters on the \\"Mormon War\\" of 1857 that was coming. Unlike many authors, Brooks overcomes the tendancy to become emotional or polemical about the massacre. Instead of using the book to further her own agenda, (either to be an apologist or what is called an \\"Anti-Mormon\\" and tear down the church), Brooks attempts to bring to light not only the massacre itself but the motivations behind it and the cover-up that happened afterwards.

It should be required reading for any one who wishes to understand the current spate of killings and murders around the world and for those who can not imagine anything so terrible as the cold blooded killing of unarmed men, women and children in America.

However, old pros James Cromwell and especially Donald Sutherland both shine as they ham it up, and casting Rutger Hauer as Barlow works out extremely well. However, this mini-series never seems to get off the ground when it has an original idea floating around, and by the time it reaches it's drawn out conclusion and a punked out cover of the Rolling Stones' classic tune \\"Paint it Black\\" kicks in, you'll realize that this movie and the aforementioned cover have something very much in common: they are both pale imitations of the superior originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"To be fair","review":"Stephen King hasn't been treated well at the movies mostly because of Stephen King. When he's not involved in the adaptation, not acting in, or producing, the movies usually do quite well (The Shining, The Shawshank Redemption, Misery, The Green Mile, Stand By Me, etc.).Having said the above, you can't really blame Stephen for this mess. One of the previous posters was right, this movie went so far off the mark. I watched the earlier version before watching this new version, and it's not a fair comparison. Everyone in the earlier version did a much better job in their roles. I'm not sure why the director felt he had to change so many things. I can understand that certain changes need to be made, but this was ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"God-awful adaptation","review":"You cannot be a fan of Stephen King's classic book, \\"'Salem's Lot\\", and think that this was a good adaptation.Apparently this nightmare was supposed to be based on the Stephen King book \\"'Salem's Lot\\", but after watching it I was left wondering. It is very clear that there was a concerted effort to \\"re-imagine\\" and update the original story in order to make it appeal to a new audience, but fans of the book will hate what's been done here. When I heard that 'Salem's Lot was being made into a mini-series, I was very excited because it's my favorite King book. Also, recent adaptation have been good (The Shining) or even excellent (The Stand). But oh boy, what a let down it turned out to be. The flow of the movie is disjointed and inconsistent, and there are major deviations from the plot of the book. Not to mention how boring this thing is.In case you really want to watch this heap of crap, I won't spoil it for you. But wait until you get a load of how this things ends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"Though I am hardly ever disappointed in a Stephen King story, I have to say that I am shocked to see how this director was even able to screw this one up. Even with Rob Lowe's ungodly beautiful self, it still couldn't save this movie. The plot made no sense. Some of the scenes had no connection with the rest of the movie! It was a complete waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"West Wing/Homicide: Life On The Street Meet Stephen King!!!","review":"The West Wing's Sam Seaborn (Rob (B)Lowe) and Homicide: Life On The Street's Detective Frank Pembleton (Andre Braugher) team up to battle battle vampires in a bizarre crossover between two of TVs biggest shows! After leaving the White House, Sam Seaborn returns to his native Salem's Lot where unbeknownst to him Det. Frank Pembleton is deep undercover as a homosexual school teacher. Once the enterprising Seaborn realizes vampires are in their midst he enlists Pembleton in a madcap, picaresque adventure to rid the world of the bloodsuckers. Throw in a dash of Donald Sutherland and Six Feet Under's James Cromwell and you'll realize that you've just struck Hollywood gold when you sit down to enjoy this Stephen King extravaganza!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This 2004 remake of Salem's Lot is excellent. I'm a big fan of the 1979 original, but the remake is much better. The choice of actors and the modern special effects make this current version a definite hit. Rob Lowe's narration and the focus on the individuals and the makeup of the town lend very well to character development and story telling. I highly recommend buying this dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remake!","review":"I bought this movie not expecting much. I loved the first one and I was doubtful this one would even come close. I found the cheapest one, bought it and when I watched it I was pleasently suprised. A really good remake of a classic. Updated so it will fit in today. Pretty much follows the story line of the original with some changes. (I don't want to spoil it for you) Very creepy, keeps you interest. My only complaint about this movie is Rutger Hauer's part was too small. I would have loved to have added at least 10 or 15 minutes more of his screen time. So if you are thinking of buying this film, go ahead I don't think you will be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good adaption...not a good series","review":"This was not a good adaption of the book, but that's fine, because it was an awful movie as well. I don't want to 'ruin' it by saying what was or wasn't adapted well, but if you're a fan of the book, this adaption misses the point of many of the most significant scenes. Rutger Hauer and Donald Sutherland picked up paychecks for 20 minutes of sub-par work; James Crawford utterly wasted his time; Andre Braugher did a decent job (though his character is so unlike the book, that it is unrecognizable); Rob Lowe mailed it in; the female lead character was so forgettable I don't who played it. The special effects? Great, if it was still 1982. And as for the plot, the movie does have vampires, so it shares that with the book, but that's about it. The movie isn't spooky, scary or dramatic. All in all, a complete failure on every level it aspired to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad. Not Bad at All.","review":"Warning, my review may have a spoiler so you may want to skip my review if you haven't watched ths film! Salem's Lot the book by Stephen King is marvellous and this mini series starring Rob Lowe is really very good and highly entertaining. My only gripe with this mini series is that two major characters who didn't die in the book are killed off in this film but despite that little disappointment I still enjoyed watching this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST STEPHEN KING NOVEL ADAPTATION EVER MADE!","review":"I do not understand how this crappy crappy movie gets any good reviews. It destroyed Stephen King's great vampire novel. The plotline from the book has been watered down to the point of very little resemblance. Anyone who says that this trash is any good at all must have some sort of mental problem because it is not good. The Tobe Hooper film from 1979 on the other hand, stayed true to the book, doing it perfect justice, and therefore is thrilling classic horror. This however is just rubbish. The acting is just awful (even for the well-knowns that star here), the special effects are cheap, the scripting is terrible, the fear factor in nonexistent, and everything else about it just plan sucks. My point is to stick with the novel and 1979 film and avoid this disgrace to Stephen King's horror on film entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"Garbage. They tweaked it in every place that didn't need tweaking. Straker is no longer bald, Matt Burke is no longer caucasion, and now he's gay. The bus driver is now a vietnam vet instead of korea. In this adaptation, Ben Mears was the kid who found the bodies of Hubie Marsten and his wife. The story begins in winter instead of late summer. Ralphie Glick doesn't just go missing, he's drowned in an icey pond. Instead of Ben Mears coming to town and finding the Marsten house already sold, Crockett has already promised it to Mears, but now he's renegged and sold it out from under him. I don't see the point. They didn't just change the story, they didn't leave anything intact. It's bad. It's unwatchable, especially if you loved the book. None of the characters have Maine accents... Hmm. Could it have been filmed in... oh I dunno... AUSTRALIA PERHAPS??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a waste of potential","review":"A crappy rewrite that misses the tone ofthe bookand original miniseries. The characters were all made to be more jerky and unlikeable than theoriginal miniseries(except for Straker who was sort of wimped-down a bit). This series is okay, but the '70's one is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't stand up to the original","review":"Rob Lowe is mildly okay as Ben Mears, but his performance goes nowhere near David Soul's angst ridden, really convincing portrayal from the 1979 original. Donald Suterland is disappointing, and I don't think it needs to be said that his performance is less than spectacular, even absurd. He's no James Mason.Rutger Hauer gives a better performance than this series deserved. His portrayal of King's Barlow is more accurate than the Nosferatuesque Reggie Nalder, but somehow this seems to work to the film's detriment rather than benefit. Rent the original film, or miniseries. I had high expectations, maybe that they'd build on the original a little, but it's just rushed, badly acted, trying too hard to be modern, and in general, a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"I had much anticipation in seeing this when it was announced & debuted on TNT.

Waste of time/viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"should have been better!!!!!","review":"given that the first one was made and broadcast in 1979,this remake should have been better than this. all this one does is to make the 1979 version look even better(and it looked great then and still does today)!in tring to bring the story up to date they have once again missed the feeling of mr.king. the vampire is just part of the overall picture,and please read the novel,like the unlike first mini-series this one misses the boat in making the people come off as real,and the terror of the story is drained(pun ment)away as they don't let you get to know the people! a wasted chance here!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Your Time","review":"Tobe Hooper's original version of this Stephen King masterpiece was not perfect. Some liberties were taken, particularly in characterizations and storyline, but overall it was truer to the novel than this updated piece of garbage. I was so excited to hear of this remake, and then when I saw it. Another $25 million bucks wasted. Don't even give this one a chance. It doesn't deserve one. It's not scary. The acting is terrible, and the script is a joke. What a let-down. Too bad I couldn't give it half a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the old 1979 version instead","review":"I have to compare this to the original movie, there is no way around it. I can't review it on its own merits, simply because it didn't have ANY strong points. I am not biased towards the original, although it is one of my fave horror films.The new version stinks, totally. The FX are very fake looking, and the story just isn't scary. It had maybe 1 or 2 original scenes but that was it.It just wasn't scary.In the original, the Nosferatu like vampire scared me to death. It seems like movies today just don't know how to be creepy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent adaptation","review":"I was surprisingly pleased with this adaptation of Stephen King's novel 'Salem's Lot. I've always been a big fan of the book (and recently re-read it in reference to King's Dark Tower series), however, I never really enjoyed the original adaptation. Admittedly, this version strays from the novel, notably with regard to Father Callahan. Rob Lowe does well as the title character, author Ben Mears, and the other characters are well developed. An excellent cast of stars, including Andre Braugher, James Cromwell, and Donald Sutherland (though I would have liked to seen him get more screen time). Rutger Hauer is surprisingly good as Kurt Barlow.Give it a shot, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Could Have","review":"Salem's Lot is a awesome book and I watched this miniseries and while it stayed close to the book in some ways there was also stuff that did not happen in the book at all.Is it just me or did anyone else notice in that scene in Matt Burke's guest room after Mike Reyerson turned into a vampire that it seemed that Mike was coming on to Matt. Was Mike hitting on him? Was that intentional or not?Anyway I liked that they showed Mike as the young guy he was in the book.

Second, the disk I got with all the software and drivers on it was pretty scratched up, though it ran alright. And third, the box claims that the camera can clip to the top of a laptop screen, but the clip is a little too small for my laptop.

For the first three sides (four in all) the acting by the main characters is casual; the anger is casual, the happiness is casual...EVERYTHING is casual! It's as if the people who had done the voices had done audiobooks for decades, and therefore expect you to get the full emotion from what little they drip out or they're just not putting their best effort into it.

Buy 'The End of Evangelion' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing end to a good series","review":"I enjoyed the Evangelion series, but was sorely disappointed by the ending. Not only is it disjointed and largely incomprehensible, but it is a profound anticlimax, the series deserves better. As the plot becomes less involved in external events (which rapidly begin to leave behind the strictures of even the most basic logic anyway) and more in the minds of the characters (always my lease favorite part of the series) we are forced to deal with more of the least attractive parts of the series, Shinji's whiny self-absorption, Rei's withdrawl from reality, and Asuka's bipolar depression and rage. If you liked the series up to this point, stop before watching this \\"ending\\" - whatever you may imagine as the end has to be better than what they came out with."},{"rating":"1","title":"neon genesis evangelion (death and rebirth)","review":"LET ME FIRST SAY I LOVE THE SERIESBUT THIS DVD WAS THE WORST WASTE OF MONEYSAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE WHOLE BOX SET MUCH BETTERTHIS DVD IS JUST A BUNCH OF JUMBLED SHOTS PUT TOGETHER"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is going on?","review":"This was the first time i Ever saw Evangelion and i dindn't understand anything.

Basically, they have taken the series and boiled it down to an hour and 30 minutes or so. Mind you, it is the better parts of the series, all brought together, but really, do we need to pay to see that after we've bought the whole series?My take is that they sought to break up the real movie (End of Evangelion) on to two disks in order to jack the price. The last 30-40 minutes is new stuff that tells of the story after the Angels are all defeated (read the synopsis). It IS fantastic stuff, probably best action in the series. The problem is that it ends at a completely arbitrary point that can hardly be called a cliff-hanger.

I noticed two or three additional scenes slipped in there. Its the end \\"Rebirth\\" that is great, but it just ends.

What Classic Media did was to run each episode in one complete uninterrupted showing. This takes away from the original series' charm. The \\"Cliffhanger episodes\\" are banished into the features section which is a shame because the cliffhangers are classics in and among themselves. The features would have been better if they interviewed some of the actors such as Don Adams or even some of the people involved with the production such as Howard Stern's father, Ben.

Other parts of the cartoon have also been tampered with.

He put this one out shortly after moving to San Luis Obispo, and the \\"pub\\" is one I've been to. The accoustics aren't terrific let me tell you, so why he decided to do this album there is beyond me when he has his own studio space within a few miles. It just doesn't work.

But Jackson is a major pianist. His approach on the 1944 - 45 solos is unique and fascinating. He begins with a fairly straight presentation of the tune and, each chorus, adds some new elements of harmonic and gestural detail. This is particularly effective on Limehouse Blues, You Took Advantage of Me and Sweet Lorraine.It's kind of schematic, but that's not a bad thing, and it reminds me of the proceedures of Steve Reich in his Drumming period.

This product is specifically designed to connect to networks, and yet that is what it will not do without the user becoming a wireless expert.Once connected, it will not sustain connectivity reliably. Expect to reconfigure settings over and over and over again. Check, double check and restart and reset various configurations in search of the solution. Waste your time hour after hour.

Captivating, enjoyable and action packed, this story also teaches the viewer an important history lesson, as well as a lesson of life and freedom and our fellow man.

Unfortunately these HIGHLY disfunctional characters get no less disfunctional and.... restraining from spoilers.. lol. If you are looking for a great movie with a great plot and that is truly unique, you have found it.A few notes though...-It is STRONGLY recommended to watch the series first. It is just too confusing to try to jump into the movie straight away.-Watch this movie with another person. You WILL need someone to talk to after this is over, believe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ...?","review":"Here is a summation of this movie: mech fighting, screaming, and then random statements/conversations using the words reality, dreams, life, death, heart, being, etc. interchangably. I heard this was supposed to be a more coherent finale than the last two episodes of the series. Wrong. It completely devolves at the end into the randomness that was the last two episodes. I actually think I liked the first ending better for its no-holds-barred chaos, but that's not saying much. This series started out so well and then it just slowly fell apart. What is it with Japanese storylines that it can't finish logically even when it starts well? Xenogears, Final Fantasy, Akira, I've about had it. Stuff that is nonsensical at the beginning (Akira) I don't expect to make sense at the end. But this was good. For many episodes.Bah.The worst part of this movie is not the incoherent ending, but the fact that it made me wish I hadn't started watching to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much angst, not enough intrigue or action","review":"The first 1/3 of this movie is action packed, but it quickly hits a wall. The tail 2/3 of the movie consists primarily of Shinji, the main character, screaming, crying, wailing, etc. Included during these \\"boohoo\\" stints are several incredibly long still shots (20-30 seconds) that are supposed to build tension, but ultimately only fill time.When watching this, be ready to constantly moderate the volume. The sound quickly and repeatedly transitions from psycho-babble whispers to screams. Lastly, again, be prepared for an endless torrent of self-pity and angst from Shinji throughout the entire film."},{"rating":"1","title":"TO SHORT!!!! a disgrace to the original","review":"It deserved 5 stars butThis was a good ending to the Anime series until they shortened it by almost 30 minutes. They cut out some very good parts that would of explained what was going on in a series Evangelion way. I suggest that you just buy the original Japanese version you get it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time.","review":"This is the ending of Neon Genesis? Ok so the whole ending is about shinjin still crying like a little girl acting likey a punk. Awful! And the actual series ending was even worse! It's just an insight of what everyone is thinking about in the movie. Which drags on forever. This series could have had a way better ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"Disappointment is an understatement. I was hoping for a suitable closure to a great series, but found mindless babble. Looking at the series and the movies as a whole, it looks like the creator just didn't know how to end a great run, so decided to make it as vague and abstract as possible in hopes that people would think more of it then what it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A better ending","review":"The title shows another ending, but more understandable. I was very upset with the ending from the TV serie, I could not believe that kind of ending. I almost throw out the whole TV serie pack through the window!Fortunately, there is a better ending, which in my opinion, is more suitable. I rated with only 4 stars because of its sad ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time, animated or otherwise.","review":"Out of all the many, many anime series I've seen Evangelion is one of my favorites, and the End of Evangelion is my favorite movie. There's one thing some people may not like, and that's the fact that it has a really tragic ending. Through doing so, though, it makes a very deep statement about human nature. In my opinion, it's by far the best way to end the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazed~~~~","review":"I absolutely LOVED the finale to this series! The art direction and story line flows perfectly with the end of the tv series and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Although slightly grotesque, the entirety of this film is breath taking emotionally and visually. It really took anime onto a whole new level as far as creativity goes. The music has become one of my all time favorite soundtracks with the upbeat ending theme. I suggest this to all new anime fans. It'll have you hooked in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want philosophical enlitghtenment or...","review":"...just the film experience of a lifetime, watch this film.

I highly recommend the series its one of the greatest.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Fans of Evangelion? So was I until I watchEd this movie. Shinji is the most annoying character ever. He is all the most trivial problems of puberty lumped into one annoying whiny little jerk. Shinji is \\"afraid to shower in gym class\\" timeS a million. If you like those Animes that have long pointless and confusing endings, then this is for you. I guess Human Insturmentality is really code for \\"bore me to death with the pointless psycho-analysis of a shivering turd\\". And besides that, all I have to say about this movie is: What is going on? Seriously, I have no idea what happened except that I used to like this series and now I'm ever so angry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather Interesting...","review":"This wasn't exactly what I'd thought it'd be in terms of endings, but it was still great. The animation was absolutely spectacular and the suspense is on point. If your a major evangelion fan and wasn't satisfied with the series ending, you'll definately love this. Although the movie does leave you with some questions, it still has all the elements you love about evangelion. Blood, gore, annihilated eva's, mind tricks, and plenty of fighting. A must have for any NGE collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEFECTIVE PRODUCT","review":"I love the movie *so far*, but DUE TO DISC DEFECTS, HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WATCH THE LAST 20 MINUTES OF THE MOVIE. MANGA YOU HAVE TOTALLY DROPPED THE BALL ON THIS ONE. I have two stand-alone players that BOTH completely freeze at the layer change. I have returned the DVD 5 times. Every single disc does the exact same thing on both players (Sony DVP-S530D & Apex 1100W).Unacceptable. I'd have better luck with VCDs off Ebay. Unacceptable. Completely unacceptable. Unbelievable. This is probably the only important anime release that will ever pass through Manga, and thank goodness; they seriously f**ked up. I can't believe this foolish, utterly careless treatment the End of Evangelion. Blasphemy. All buyers beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"another ending","review":"This is the conclusion of evangelion, again!This ending features a lot of insight into the mind of shinji ikari and the mysteries surrounding the people he has encountered in his life.A lot of this movie focuses on the importance of the A.T field and the soul, so if you find you're totally confused, then youve been paying full attention.If you havent seen all or any of the series and you havent seen death and rebirth, dont watch this yet. Buy and watch everything else first, this movie has so much more impact on you when you are familiar with everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"wtf?","review":"This ending just made my brain hurt.

The last two tapes in the Eva series were confusing and hard to follow. Now they come out with Death and Rebirth (purchased a month earlier), and the End of Eva. These two releases in themselves are pointless. First off if you want to see the end i suggest you only buy the end and not death and rebirth. Death and rebirth consists of only a 30 minute confusing recap of what happened already, and a 30 minute teaser for the last movie. The End of evangelion consists of the same episode teaser they give you along with another short continuation on it. To be honest the action was great in the End, but still it was not worth buying it. They might as well of kept the original ending, because it made as much sense as this one did. My opinion is to buy it and see how you like it, but hold onto that recipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"What do you get when you put a number of clinically depressed animators into a studio and provide them with a non-ending supply of acid? You get the Eva series and movie.I was looking forward to seeing the wimp Singi choose life and kick some eva/angle ass at the end with his yellow-winged demon Eva01. But instead he becomes Jesus. People who watch this movie and see beauty, thought-provoking artistry and the answers to life need therapy.

I've seen the entire eva series, and frankly wasn't too impressed with it. With that said, this film makes no sense what so ever. After watching it I thought that I had been on an acid trip.

Shinji masturbating in front of a comotose Asuka was just sick.Unless you are a hard core eva fan, or a stoner avoid this DVD at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It [is not good]!!!","review":"I can't say anything nice about this movie really. If you weren't a fans of the series then you're going to hate this movie. It tries to finish the Evagelion story as best it can, but the main character Shinji seems more whinier now than he did in the series.

ANYONE THAT BUYS THIS UGLY THING MIGHT AS WELL BE SETTING FLAME TO ALMOST THIRTY DOLLARS. THIS MOVIE IS A TOTAL MENACE TO EVERYTHING THATNEON GENISIS EVANGELION FANS LIKE US HAVE WORKED FOR. DEATH AND REBIRTH WAS A WAY BETTER MOVIE THAN THIS 100% PIECE OF JUNK. WE BET THAT DULL ANIME SHOWS LIKE RAVE MASTER COULD DO A BETTER JOB THAN THIS.

The occassional repitition used in this book was a great way to remind my child what had happened in the story and how it ties in with what is currently going on in the story. There are just enough new words to help challenge the young reader yet not to many to overwhelm a child. The artwork in this book is used by the author as a device to further motivate the young reader to turn the pages and see what is coming up next.

Yet as any person familiar with \\"The Lorax\\" will tell you, that book is about how greed can easily lead to environmental destruction.

John Lennon initially tried to block publication, but legally could not. Failing in that, he read it. He was genuinely surprised how the book was devoid of any malice (Cynthia never took any swipes at Yoko) and he stayed up all night reading this with a lump in his throat. You might do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another piece of the pie.","review":"Cynthia's book was short on details once the Beatles took off but the information about the early days in Liverpool was fresh and a part of the story we hadn't heard before.

A touching story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Twist Of Disappointment","review":"It's not really her fault, but Cynthia Lennon has written a fairly bland book. She obviously doesn't realize what is so interesting about the guy, and what' makes a decent memoir. Gossip, juicy stories etc. For me, one of the most fascinating things about Lennon was that he was a Liverpool thug who had to wear a Beatle suit. Cynthia Lennon really comes across as being a bit dim. For my money, the most interesting part of a famous person's life, is what they were like before they were famous - she could have done a better job on this early period.

They've teamed up with Uncle Dave, some dude they used to hang out with in DC back in the day and he's come up with all these sensitive wordy country ballads and neanderthal rock anthems about his mid-life crisis. Hilarious stuff. He dreams up a fantasy woman for his future Uncle Dave wife and by the end of the album realizes she has to be killed before he can be free or happy or both. But it's OK 'cos she's not real, I geuss. The Wacos never sounded better and the rocking never stops. Uncle Dave has one of those weird non-singer story-teller voices that creeps up on you and gets in your skull! Perfect listening for unemployable single drunks staring down the barrel at 50...

And since the songs are threaded like a story and there's a wobbly-legged sequential sensibility to all of this, I recommend you pony up and either download the entire CD in mp3 or be a real sport and buy the \\"commercial\\" release (it ain't exactly Columbia or Virgin records in term of label and distribution).

I wish I had gotten the Leap frog, they have a way more books which keeps the toy very interesting for the kids.Another problem is that while playing with it, my son eventually touch other parts of the book with another areas of his hand when he points a figure, which make the PowerTouch Learning System starting spelling or reading another word instead of the one that he intended, making him confused at first.

I guess it is similar to the Leap Pad but since I've never seen the leap Pad I'm not sure. The board basically fits storybooks on it along with a cartridge that accompanies each book. Kids turn the page and the interactive story book plays and responds to your childs touch. They can press on basically everything on each page and hear a sound or phrase and even play simple number and color games. The voices are right out of Sesame Street for the book that comes with the set.It's quite easy for kids to turn on and use all by themselves. The toy is quite durable and is not a battery hog. I know that there are many more story books out for the Leap Pad. Hopefully Fisher Price will continue to support the toy with more and more story books because it is a very well made toy.

He has had it for 6 months now, and he still loves playing with it. He has taken it to school for show and tell. The other kids loved it as well and couldn't stop playing with it. It is very educational. For some reason, my son is in love with the Elmo book. Whenever I try to sneak another book in there, he finds the Elmo book and puts it back in there. The only downfall is that there aren't a lot of book choices for his age group. I know he would love the Spiderman book, but it falls under the next age range. Other than that, I recommend the Power Touch for all little readers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Leap Frog","review":"I went looked at Leap Frog , and Power touch and let my Daughter, who is 2yrs, Play with both in the store. She could not figure on her own how to work the Leap Pad. Hitting the GO and using the pen was very confusing for her and she would not have been able to play with it on her own. With the Power touch, she just pointed and it worked, no hitting a go button everytime you turned the page. You turn the page and the toy already knew. You do not need to touch very hard a very soft touch does it. I also really like that the ABCs are in the toy and when you touch them they say what they are. This is a great toy for a up and coming toddler. I want her to start learning early with fun and This toy is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!!","review":"This toy is great!

While there is both entertaining and educational value to this toy i feel like it could definitely be better made. The books are a bit flimsy and can get bent easily from just being turned by little hands. If your child likes to tilt books towards them to look at, as opposed to lying them flat on the ground this will cause much frustration as the book will fall off the system.

Changing the books and cartridges is easy enough for her to do it herself.

It was time to upgrade to the regular Leap Pad. However, when I went to buy it, I stumbled across this product - very similar to the Leap Pad, but with all of the things I always wished the Leap Pad had! For instance, my son finds that pen difficult to use, and the cord too short. This product uses finger touch - much easier. The other HUGE difference is that with the Leap Pad every time you turn the page you have to touch the green \\"go\\" button so it knows where you are - often confusing for my son. This product automatically \\"knows\\" what page you were on. My son had this thing going in no time. The final thing that makes us prefer this product is that the stories are Sesame Street, Blues Clues, Clifford, Dora, etc. - all characters my son knows and loves. The Leap Pad mostly uses its own characters, which my son just never got into. We've only had this a few days, but so far we are very impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for us","review":"I purchased this and some books for it for my 3 yr old, I loved the one at the store display. but when my son played with it, he would touch something on the screen and it woud say something different than what it was...thought the book was in wrong...so i tryed other books...same thing..thought it was the unit, changed it out. same thing. nothing worked for us, so i took it back...got something else for him. but i know its electronic, maybe i just got a lemon.."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional concert","review":"Plenty of superlatives have already been said about this remarkable DVD.

A young German youth, Michael, meets 30-something Hanna, who introduces him to sex and with whom he shares his literary studies by reading to her. After a summer of liaisons, she disappears. Years later as a young law student he sees her on trial as a Nazi prison guard. This brings up many strong emotions for him, and he discovers one of her secrets. He can't bring himself to step forward and reveal the information that would enable her to receive a more just sentence. The film ends with a moment of redemption many more years later, when Michael finally breaks the spell of silent shame and begins to tell his and Hanna's secret story to his adult daughter. The greatness of the film is its clarity about the ambiguities of morality and the importance of seemingly small things. It is a tragic story -- a tragedy hinged on secret shame and on missed intimacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the rare one's.","review":"I took me awhile to watch this feature, I finally did once I saw it avalible on iTunes, so I downloaded it to my iPod touch and my goodness!

This movie is not a mainstream commercial movie, so please do not expect a popcorn movie like plot. This one is for more mature movie watchers who look for depth in movies. The movie is set in Nazi Germany during world war II and starts with an affair that Anna Schmidt(Kate Winslet) has with a 15 year old boy. As the they go their own ways, their paths cross when Anna is convicted for war crimes in the post war time. As they grow older, their past haunts them...Excellent casting for the movie and beautifully directed.

The central question of law vs. moral responsibility in the concentration camp is interesting, although meekly explored. Pretty dull movie that doesn't cover any new ground. Over...rated Saying that, Kate does give a strong performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hoopla?","review":"I have not read the book, and I waited until the DVD to see the film. After all the Oscar nominations and rave reviews by friends, I suppose I expected something more. Instead, this movie is really about something less. A young man has an affair with his first lover, a damaged woman, whom he remembers for the rest of his life. That's it. The characters are one-dimensional, we never really see what drives Ralph Fiennes' character, and there isn't even much of a story line. If it weren't for the Holocaust factor, this movie may not have gotten a second look. Even that factor plays a supremely small, albeit admittedly powerful, role in the film. In the end we have a lifetime of lost love and unexplored secrets played quietly by two great actors. Great acting, directing, and cinematography seems to have puffed up an otherwise simple story. One kept hoping for a remarkable twist at the end that never comes. I really don't see what all the excitement is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kate Winslet Gets Neck'id","review":"This movie starts off as a pretty disturbing film. First, if this would have been a 30 something man having sex with full nudity on film with a 15 year old girl it would be scandalous and seriously it probably would not even be made. But I guess we are suppose to forget that this German Mary Kay Laterno is a child molestor cause she can't read. But anyway, it is pretty much soft core porn for the first half of the movie. And keep in mind I have nothing against soft core porn. But then the story takes a turn and I am suppose to care that this totally vile piece of human scum had feeling and had been in love. I feel and felt no sympathy for her. She was a child molestor and she was a murdering scum."},{"rating":"2","title":"the banality of evil","review":"Please refer to Hanna Arendt's book Eichmann in Jerusalem from whence the above phrase is coined.Was the woman in this movie a monster, a clown, or just a tiny cog in the wheel of slaughter who refused to open the door to a burning church because it was her job to oversee the jews who were burning inside and if they got out she wouldn't be able to round them up? Her defense (just as Eichmann's in his trial) was that she was just doing her job. Thus the banality of evil because in the end evil on such a scale can only be accomplished by thousands of people who are only doing what they're told. And we feel for this woman a bit because she likes to be read to from Homer which makes her all too human. She's sort of like us in a lot of ways. But then there's one thing at the end that's hard to wrap your mind around; she tells him (her former lover) she never thought about the night of the burning church until her trial 20 years later because she never had to.

In my opinion, this should have won Best Picture as well(i also have not yet seen slumdog though).

This paper does a good job (compared to glossy and regular matte papers sold by Canon) of preserving shadow details. I have used this paper on the Pixma Pro9500 and Pro9500 Mark II. It is sometimes surprising how rich and subtle colors can look on matte surface papers such as this one. One word of warning: Unless you have a screen calibrated to your printer and this paper (I do not) you should expect to see a lighter image on your monitor than on the paper. In other words, be careful about trying to print a picture that is darker than you think. It's too bad that Canon no longer supplies their Fine Arts Premium Matte and Museum Etching papers.

So do multiple searches for the same item on Amazon.I purchased this Canon rag photo paper a week or so ago and paid $29.95(good price).

How often do you see a movie where a zombie is a good guy? This is a lot better than some other B rated movies to come out recently like Return of the Living Dead 4 and 5.

Your career started out so well with Superman and while you have had a fewnot so good \\"B\\" scifi movies, I still had hope, but this movie is the biggest joke of your career.

The hose doesn't reach as far as other models do and when you pull too much it comes undone from the vacuum. It is louder than other vacuums and a little heavier. It clogs daily. The filter gets dirty quick and rotating it doesn't do a good job of removing the dirt. A new filter is $30. The brushes CANNOT handle hair at all. Every time we used this vacuum we had to spend just as much time unclogging it and cutting the hair off the brushes. Just today the vacuum finally gave up and broke.

I returned it too.The vacuum has great suction. However, if you have pets with fine hair, the vacuum will just push it around on berber carpet. It seems to pick it up okay on regular plush carpet.

I've had my electrolux for 20 yrs and recently thought it would be nice to get a new vacuum. Boy was I wrong! Save your money and the hassle of extended warranties in order to keep this piece of junk running. The extended warranty is another 60 bucks plus every time you take it in you're left with no vacuum.

This sound card does not live up to what it promises. USB bandwith does not allow the Extigy to live up to the Creative standard of its other product lines. While you gain ease of installation and a remote, you lose all software, EAX HD (it claims to support it, but in fact does not) and other features. This product hogs CPU usage because it requires the computer to do most of the processing due to USB limitations. When your computer is doing many things at once, audio quality suffers. It claims to support S/PDIF in but in fact only supports it as a standalone. Any digital signal passed to the Extigy is converted to analog before being transferred to the computer resulting in a significant loss of quality and the impossibility of actual digital recording. I am completely disatisfied with every aspect of this product and am subsequently returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inoperative when received","review":"Fortunately for Amazon's good return policy I was able to return this unit. I hooked it up to an XP computer by the USB port. When I turned it on there was no output at the speaker jacks. The audio gain control was also faulty. My computer met all the necessary requirements and the Extigy software was installed properly. This unit looked like just the system I was looking for but I am sorely disappointed that the quality control people let this unit go in the condition it was in."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"I bought this product in hope of making my PC have amazing sound.

The first time was 9-15, the second time a few days later. As of today, 9-24, they still have not replied. I bought a Nomad Jukebox from them the same day through a different vendor and although it works fine I'm returning that too because of the poor customer support.

The acting is entirely amateur and ranges from the sub-par (for example, the goth youth collaborators) to the merely dull (alcoholic hero Father Joe) to the whopping ludicrous (Marvin Schwartz as a Catholic priest). The direction as such is incomprehensible.A dreadful, rambling script is partially credited to horror author F.

This version of War are nothing more than a cheap mockery of what was one of the most important groups of the post-modern era.About the only thing on this release (1982's Outlaw) that warrants a repeat play is the track \\"I'm About Somebody\\". Unfortunately, that's it. The rest is pure dance hall funk rubbish done in nu-wave flavor. This release might entice a completist or a collector of War memorabilia.

What the author calls a waterfall is often just a tiny drip of water... I am an avid hiker and backpacker and don't mind an extremely strenuous day in the outdoors, but if I'm heading out to see a waterfall, I want a real pay-off. After using this book a couple times and quickly realizing it was just some sort of ego trip for the author, I went out and bought Ann Marie Brown's \\"California Waterfalls\\" published by Foghorn Outdoors. This is a far superior book, written by someone who really knows how to write a guide book and gives the reader a great experience on the trail. If you truly want to see waterfalls, don't waste your money on Shaffer's book. The only thing it has going for it is color pictures. Buy Brown's book instead. It costs less money and it is a far superior guide!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is seems","review":"You may find it interesting to check the reviews by the people who give this book five stars.

(First there was an extended e-mail exchange that resulted in Amazon agreeing that my review was within their guidelines. Then, a few months later, my review disappeared without notice.)

Moreover, his directions were frustrating to follow and were simply not worth the trouble when you're out spending your valuable free time trying to enjoy the outdoors. The fact it doesn't have useful maps didn't help matters either.When compared to the experience of using Ann Marie Brown's book, this book doesn't even come close to being anywhere near as useful as Brown's.While I do appreciate the color and the plethora of photos (so you at least know what the falls look like), the lack of quality (e.g. blurry photos), poor directions (e.g. Salmon Creek Falls north of Kernville), lack of maps, and incomplete chapters (e.g. the Waterwheel Falls chapter) make this a book difficult to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it claims to be","review":"I bought this book a month ago and have tried to go to three of the waterfall destinations featured. The directions were wrong to two of them (I lost about an hour at one, just driving around trying to find the trailhead). The third one, when I finally reached it, was not exactly what I would call a waterfall. I think this writer needs some lessons in how to write a guidebook. The book appears to be self-published (it's full of photographs of the author's friends, the layout is so garish it looks like it was done by a third-grader, and it is loaded with misspellings and bad punctuation).

His rating system seems to be on just right for the 10 waterfalls I've been too. I recommend this book for anyone who likes hiking an the outdoors.

Certainly there are waterfalls in Californians' backyards nobody would know about if it had not been for this book. I really marvel at the detailed descriptions: the driving directions, the exact distances of the hikes and the degree of difficulty. Imagine how many calories this guy burned hiking through the trails and up steep hills to reach these waterfalls.

Most other Japanese books I have read only make you memorize specific phrases and sentences. But this one tells you how to put a sentence together.

First, it only uses \\"romanji\\", which is rarely used by Japanese people. You can learn the basic Japanese alphabets with a few weeks daily study. What would you think of someone studying English using only Japanese letters? It doesnt make much sense. Romaji should be used to ease you in to the Japanese alphabet, not substitute it. This book encourages that bad habit. Second, it has no concept of \\"level appropriate\\" and throws out all kinds of idiosyncratic vocab.

Not even the great 1955 Eroica has the taut energy of this live performance from a year earlier. The finale is a spectacle to behold. The exposition repeats are present in the outer movements of the 4th, which features a highly rhythmical and exciting first movement. The Brahms 2nd is quite reminiscent of the wonderful Gilels/Reiner account from 1958. Geza Anda plays superbly in a virtually error free performance. Andante's sound is very good, especially considering these recordings were taken from broadcast tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice decals","review":"I like these decals. Very sharp and durable.

To each of us, however, this was boring and slow and slow and boring. An arty film in which every single camera shot or scene seems to last too long. One of the sons has sex twice with a trampy but pretty girl, and twice with a nice but less attractive partner. No steamy love on screen, however. We join them only when the action is over, and most clothes are back on. This is the kind of script that could have benefitted from nudity and sexual content. It is a downer, and for some movie fans, any film that's not a downer isn't really \\"art.\\" If you are like that, perhaps you will like this. I think the director may have some talent but needs a better sense of pace and action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"Wow, I can't believe there are positive reviews of this movie.

The green plastic case broke where the screws attach it to the frame. Bissell won't make it good. This machine saw moderate use in a 2500 sq ft home with three carpeted bedrooms and the remainder tile floor.The machine did a fair job of cleaning but left dog hair in little tuffs on the carpet for later pickup. We found that the automatic concentrate dispenser was using twice as much concentrate as the formula on the bottle recommended. We finally just shut this feature off and mixed the concentrate in the clean water holder as other carpet cleaners do.On the second or third use one of the two belts broke so I stocked up.

It won't turn on at all now. The rotating brush seemed to really struggle on my thick carpet. The cleaning power though for that first 10 minutes, was exceptional. It did leave large lint balls all over the floor so you'll have to follow up with a vac after the carpet is dry.

Now, I have USED this product as I have two cats, a dog, and two little boys who like to spill. I have never burned a belt; however, the suction ability of this product seemed to get worse the more it was used. It also left my carpet 'crunchy' after using the soap on 'high traffic' or 'half-traffic' so I just used water for the last year. And the integrity of this product is not good as my lever to release product to my carpet would 'stick' so water would continue to spray into my carpet when I released it.

(I'm not doing a ton of cleaning with this machine- I have only two carpeted rooms in my home.)Sometimes it would dispense water and soap and sometimes it wouldn't. Usually, I could make it work by thumping it around a bit. I've taken it apart and cleaned it and it hasn't helped. As of last year, it would only dispense liquids from the area used to hold the soap, which I filled with clear water. This allowed for about a 3-foot x 3-foot area of cleaning. As of yesterday, it will only dispense water from that reservoir if it is set to full soap, and the machine will no longer suck up any liquids whatsoever, leaving me with a wet carpet.It was a mistake from the get-go and I wish I'd taken it back immediately.I will never own a Bissell again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money!","review":"I am absolutely shocked that Bissell would allow it's name on such a poor quality product! In the first place, it is not a steamer at all, it uses hot water from the tap, but that's not the worst of it. It worked fine the first time I used it but it's been all downhill from there. The half moon device that makes up half of the suction nozzle catches on a Berber rug so the machine will not move in the forward direction. The customer service department (India?) is not particularly helpful either.

I am on my third pump ($30 each) so this is an indication of the quality of the unit. For the money ($150) this PowerSteamer would be a very good deal if the pumps did not continue to fail. The pump replacements are relatively easy to do if you are experienced but you have to almost completely disassemble the entire housing, which makes for a tricky repair if you are not experienced.It has a single beater bar for scrubbing, an adequate tool and hose setup for small jobs, no heating element and usually does a very good job, but the motor providing the suction of the water is not strong enough. The two belts (one for the pump, one for the beater bar) need to be replaced as often as the pump.If Bissell would put some quality control into the pumps for this model they would have a pretty good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Thie is the biggest piece of junk I ever owned. The false advertising that it is a powersteamer; the only hot water is what you put into it. The lack of suction to pick up water and the fact that the solution cleaner will not dispense cleaner. I even contact Bissell to get a new dispenser after I tried to use it the 2nd time, and the new dispenser doesn't work any better than the first. I will do everything I can to discourage anyone I know from purchasing a Bissell product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather rent!","review":"I thought buying a carpet cleaner made more sense than renting one each time but now I'm having second thoughts. First of all, the name is slightly misleading, this proSTEAMER doesn't actually produce any steam at all. What's more troubling is that I've used this particular machine no more than three times within a year and a half and it just pooped out on me today. There is a serious malfunction with the motor, Bissell is replacing the entire unit for me but I think I would rather simply get the money back and rent from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS JUNKER!","review":"Terrible, terrible, and terrible.

After about a year and a half it did not dispense the water and solution, a reason for this could not be found as the belts and tubes were fine.

It did leave hair balls so the carpet has to be vacuumed after it is dried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed with this Product","review":"Reading the other reviews posted on this web site has made me feel much better than I did. Why? We were pleased with our Bissell carpet cleaner when we bought it but now it no longer pulls water from the carpet. I doubt we'll take it to be serviced given the reports that others have provided which reflect the fact that the repair expense wasn't worth the trouble as the machine malfunctioned again.

It depicts a Tokyo based husband who is under seige by his children, his wife, and his boss. When he loses is job, he and his family have to make some 'adjustments'. The film is filled with comic sequences and is obvious that Ozu was influence by the Hollywood clowns Chaplin, Lloyd, Sennet, etc., although most of the film is quite naturalistic and lacks the 'herky-jerkly' quality of hand cranked silents. Having spent several years in Japan, it is interesting to observe the similarities and differences in Japanese life in the 1930's compared to life at the end of the 20th century. The lead actor is capable of a wide range of emotions and all of the actors are very good. It is obvious that Ozu is a real director. In fact, he is considered the most 'Japanese' director.

In fact, Motorola's website recommends against keeping the phone in the front pants pocket, and, furthermore, advises the user to keep the phone in the line of sight (!) with the receiver (at the back of the wearer's neck).I tried this headset with two of the new Bluetooth-enabled phones from Sprint (LG Muziq and Samsung Upstage).

It doesn't sound as good, but is more comfortable, and, most importantly, doesn't cut out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for working out.","review":"At first I gave this product a 8 out of 10 on CNET. But after using during workouts for a few weeks the side buttons stopped working. Low and behold I found out many people who did reviews of these headphones were having the exact same problem. Some over and over again after sending multiple pairs back to Motorola for replacement. Apparently, sweat is the issue. In addition, the buttons on my Moto Q9 do not operate the headphones. Thus, your only option is to use the buttons on the S9's. So if you want to use these primarily while working out (which is why I bought them!), do not waste your time. They will break down. Big waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I sent it back","review":"I didn't care for it and sent it back for credit. The buttons are small and I had a hard time not activatitng the wrong ones. The sound quality was good but you have to wear your phone above your belt for it not to have drop outs. (They don't recomend a shirt pocket either) It was not comfortable with sunglasses on. It squeezes the temples of my glasses against your head. It doesn't block much ambient noise so you have to run the volume pretty high while doing something like mowing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks easily","review":"I have owned two sets of these, both broke within a couple months. While they worked they had issues with being quirky and sensitive to fading and cutting in and out but I had to free myself from the cord so I tolerated it.

If you want to use these for workouts, do not ignore the warnings - go buy something else.I received them yesterday, paired them to my blackberry, and headed out to the gym. They worked great for about 30 minutes, then the left speaker and all controls on the left side (volume up, down, and phone buttons) ceased to work.

Maybe I'll try the Jaybirds next-"},{"rating":"1","title":"So far pretty terrible.","review":"I'm using these headphones for the iphone 3G. I would like to rid myself of wires but clearly that's not going to be possible. Audio on these headphones cuts in and out. I've traded the hassle of wires for the hassle of constantly holding my phone near my head. The controls are not working. I can't skip tracks. I could understand some compatibility issues but I should be able to perform the basic operation that I can with the one button wired headphones that came with the iphone. One button! This device has seven. At times, the device won't connect to my phone. Audio from phone calls only works in one ear. Why?It did work for thirty minutes while I ran on the treadmill. The design however, is not as workout friendy as I had hoped. The heavy transmitter on the back pulls and tugs while you run and is not comfortable.I may keep these for the Gym. I haven't decided, but I don't recommend buying. Motorola didn't get anything right with this one. I feel a little duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Malfunction, Malfunction, Malfunction, had to exchange 3 times!!!","review":"If you plan on sweating this headphone set is not for you!

They connect very easily to my LG Chocolate and the sound quality is great. But when I go to connect them to my Macbook the quality is not as good.

This product works as advertised with the exception that the music is choppy which is very annoying. It cuts off for about 5 seconds and then resumes. It does this about every 5-10 minutes. Another annoying feature is that even though it uses a mini-usb to charge, the standard voltage to charge it was changed my Motorola so that you cannot use anything to charge it except a Motorola charger built for this headset which is grossly overpriced. (Some have reported that connecting the USB to a computer will work - but mine did not).Motorola - if you are listening - stop making customers stock up on chargers that only work on your products. My IGO charger works beautifully on all of my electronics except this one, which I will promptly return for that reason alone. I am tired of this kind of corporate practice that makes me buy a new wall-wart for every piece of electronic equipment I own, plus another one for the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this product","review":"My future son-in-law had one of these and I had to have one after using his. The sound is amazing. Much better than I expected. I would defintely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, uncomfortable to wear, terrible reception outside.","review":"I found these headphones very uncomfortable, and the large piece in the back very irritating when moving my head, though they sounded great. The total dealbreaker for me was that they would barely work outside, and I had to literally hold my Tmobile G1 up to the reception bar in the back to get them to work. YMMV depending on head size I guess, but they didn't work for me and I an average size head. I ended up going with the motorokr S305, and am very pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod Touch 2nd Gen Owners be advised!","review":"I agree with most of what has been said before me in favor of the S9's. Sound quality is stunning at any price and especially for an instrument with a predictable and reasonable battery drain. I have tried to run them dead three times through continuous listening - haven't done it yet. Lightweight, comfortable, non-dorky. I work out for 90 minutes a day so the sweat alert is well taken.BUT...is no one going to mention that if paired to a 2nd gen iPod the forward and back buttons are inoperable? Strangely, when paired with my 3rd gen Nano, all is well. I thought my headset must be a lemon so I exchanged them and got the same result. Play/Pause works, just not the touch-sensitive guys to either side. Again these buttons do work with my 3rd gen Nano.Were it not for this concession, the S9's would certainly get 5 stars out of me. A challenging idea, adventurously conceived and elegantly executed. May my buttons remain ever dry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it with the G1","review":"This is a pretty solid product, but it's Achilles heel is the super short range.With my T-Mobile G1, it was impossible to use outside even when wearing the phone on a belt around the back. The only way to guarantee a connection is to basically hold the phone up nearby the receiver.The product packaging includes a picture of a guy's torso with a cylinder around it, starting several inches ABOVE the belt, and below the shoulders. Essentially, they're recommending you put your phone in a bandolier along your back. Who does that?In fact, it tends to cut out even when carrying the phone out of pockets beside you. So either the receiver is very poor, or the transmitter (the phone itself) is poor. It can also cut out if sitting down with the phone in your lap or browsing the web on the phone (because your body is between it and the receiver at the back).In short, avoid unless you're sure that your phone is a rock star of a bluetooth transmitter, above and beyond spec."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless!!!","review":"It looks cool but two things;1) It doesn't fit everyone's head and there is ZERO adjustability and the ear buds hurts!2) It skips!!!

So I returned it for another pair.That pair worked fine for about 3 weeks. Then it started skipping songs at random with great frequency (on Samsung T10). I did testing on it. With hardlined earphones everything was fine. But with the Motorola Headset it kept skipping.

Thus, using a weight bench at the gym is impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and Bad Sound Quality","review":"The quality is not that good, especially when comparing to other bluetooth stereo products. Very uncomfortable. Ear area is designed for very small ears. Mine are not huge, normal size, and after 30 minutes of listening I have to readjust because my upper ear becomes very sore. Outside of that, they do what they are designed for. Play music. No issues with it disconnecting when I move. Short battery life (approx 6-8 hours listening time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"1. The headset is uncomfortable.2. There are gaps in songs where the sound fades out.3.

My experience with Motorola products is that shoddy workmanship causes products to break. All Motorola products are not covered for physical damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The Motorokr S9 works as advertised. Stereo sound is clear and headphones are easy to pair. However, the volume control switch stopped working and got stuck in low volume rendering the unit useless, only after 2 weeks of use. Exchanged the item through AMAZON and got a new pair, which only lasted another 2 weeks of use again. I use them for jogging, and because of the design, a fair amount of sweat can get to the speaker mount and frame. I suspect this made the damage to the microswitches for the volume control, but isn't this unit supposed to be and ACTIVE SPORTS HEADPHONE??? Another case of good design and poor execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third time still isn't the charm","review":"I ordered my S9 last October, and 6 months later, I have yet to have a set of headphones that work for more than 3 weeks. There is obviously a significant manufacturing defect that causes various / all of the buttons to cease functioning so shortly after starting to use the headphones. I'm so frustrated with these things that I'm somewhat upset that 1 star is the lowest I can rate this item. At this point I'm just hoping that Motorola is going to refund what I paid.UPDATE - Today I spent 45 minutes and after telling two folks over a dozen times that I wanted a refund, I was finally escalated to Motorola Corporate Consumer Advocacy Office where I found a sympathetic ear. This is the only reason that I will ever consider buying a product from Motorola again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your Money","review":"I have to agree whole-hearted with a previous reviewer. I so badly wanted to love this product. I was stoked when it finally arrived. Unfortunately, that joy quickly vanished. The idea and design for the product is novel and very comfortable. However, the electronics of the device are GARBAGE!! The company claims that the headset is \\"sweatproof\\". That unfortunately is not even remotely true. I have gone through 3 of these (in warrantee issues) and every last one ends up with the same problem.....the touch controls fail after a VERY short time. NICE IDEA....JUNK APPLICATION OF THIS PRODUCT. Highly recommend against WASTING your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful- don't buy it.","review":"The sound quality is awful. Sounds like a $5 pair of headphones. Works fine inside, but go outside and it won't pick up a signal from a blackberry on your belt. It will however work, if you hold the phone within a foot (12 inches) of your head. Totally defeats the purpose of a wireless device. I have a friend that uses them with the Iphone, and he claims they work fine. Maybe I got a lemon? Or maybe Motorola needs to step up and give it a more powerful receiver and battery.Wait for the next generation to come out. At least wires work.cl"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"Works as advertised ... for a while. However, after a little use, and getting some sweat on them (these are sports headphones, right?), the volume buttons failed to work. Worse, the \\"down\\" button repeated itself, dropping the volume to minimum, and the \\"up\\" button wouldn't respond, so the headphones became uselessly stuck at very low volume. So I sent this first pair in to Motorola for an exchange. They responded admirably with a new pair. Amazingly, after a few more weeks of use, this new pair did the exact same thing! A bummer because I like the features and convenience.The only other negative is that for phone conversations, the sound only comes in one ear, not both."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOTOROKR S9 Bluetooth","review":"This worked for maybe a month, I bought it so I can run on my tredmill and after a couple of uses you cannot hear anything out of them. switching from IPOD to phone you have problems with the buttons and making sure it answers the phone correctly.

It claims that its sweat resistant, but after the third time I used it, it started adjusting the volume up and down randomly, and then started making random phone calls, after getting a little sweat on it. I tried it one more time for my next workout and it started doing the same thing again. It seems to work ok when I'm not working out.I would have given it 3.5 - 4 stars without this problem, but the whole reason I bought it was to not be wired to a music device when I work out. It is completely useless for that purpose, and it doesnt work as well as my other bluetooth headsets for talking on the phone, so it is pretty much useless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"These are just plain bad.- Won't consistently pair with either iphone or computer- Lots of static/noise- Frequent drop-outsDo yourself a favor and buy something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"As previous reviewers have noted, this headset will short out if sweat gets into the earpieces, which happens quite often. They seem to work ok after drying out for a few days. In addition, they are not very loud (about 60% of the loudness of the standard earphones that come with an iPod). In sum, if you plan to use them at home sitting at your desk, they might be ok, but forget about using them at the gym or to go running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Youll Be Sorry Ill told you so.....","review":"These are the most uncomfortable bluetooth headset around. Very poor sound quality with constant hissing and very bulky. Sports headset? You cannot run on the treadmill with these because if you turn your head the headset with scratch your ear and fall out. You cannot weight lift on bench because the headphones will pop out when you lay down from the headrest. You cannot DO ANYTHING BUT SIT STILL WITH THESE uncomfortable tight headset on your head. Anyone with glasses should never purchase any headphones or headset that goes around the ear. S9 or most products from motorolla do not seem to have too much thought in the design.

Choppy reception","review":"I bought S9 from Amazon. Worked great for first run with my Motorola Razr V3xx. After 45 min on full charge, music would get choppy. My phone was in my pocket. Problem got worse if phone was further out or after longer time because battery runs lower on power. So I bought cell phone arm band so phone would be closer to S9 headset. Problem was improved by 90%. Still occasional loss of music signal after 45 min of use with fully charged headset.BIG problem. Ater second run, volume controls konked out. Also the answer button konked out. VERY annoying. After I did a review search, I found out that I wasn't alone. I requested a replacement. I think I will cancel that and get my money back and buy a corded head set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it lasted...","review":"I purchased these headphones in spite of several reviewers stating that there were issues with the controls. I found that the down volume control ceased to function after only 2 weeks of fairly sweaty use (5k/day).I found that Motorola was less than helpful when I requested a replacement device.On the plus-side, the headphones are incredibly comfortable and convenient.I just expected them to operate reliably for a longer time (even with the sweaty conditions I subjected them to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going on pair #3 ~ Not sweat resistant at all!","review":"I love these headphones for working out. I don't love the fact that I have destroyed 2 of them already.It took some doing to get them to pair with my computer due to my Vista 64 OS and getting the right WIDCOMM Bluetooth stack.After about 3 weeks, the controls start tweaking out, the fast-forward and rewind activate even when not pushed; after about 4-5 weeks, the audio starts to decrease even with the volume maxed out.

Currently getting three full days out of a charge. The set does not come with any type of storage bag or case. This becomes a little inconvenient for travel.

Basically if it's not in your back pocket, it's going to cut out a lot if you move your head too much, etc. I prefer keeping my phone in my front shirt pocket, but that doesn't work so well with this headset. Also, you can't very well sit down with your phone in your back pocket either (and then it doesn't connect well either because you are sitting on the phone). So really only works well if you are standing up and it's in your back pocket.

It was so frustrating I went back to wired headphones.Another problem also occurred: as mentioned by others, the 'volume down' button began activating and could not be stopped, making the sound too low to hear.Finally, the headphones would not work with my Bluetooth equipped Lenovo laptop.A horrible, horrible product, that I regret having purchased. Please don't make the same mistake! Wait until Motorola releases a functional wireless headphone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"IN THEORY, a great item. I run 25-35 miles a week. I used this for two weeks, and suddenly the volume maxed out, and the button to lower the volume STOPPED WORKING. There are many other people who complain about the volume bottons malfunctioning. Somebody, maybe Motorola, needs to make a set of headphones that is truly WATERPROOF for people like myself who run. Blatent false advertising, since Motorola says that these are \\"sport\\" headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful bluetooth headphones","review":"Got them and opened the box. After holding them for a minute, I noticed the right arm was broken close to the back part. I thought, well, nothing hot glue cant fix, and that solved that problem. Took them to the gym and did a 1.5 hour lifting session with absolutely no issues linking up to or playing songs off my new iTouch 64GB player. Worked well with my off brand phone as well, just like it said it would in the write up.What it doesn't mention is the fact that when you sweat, all the controls stop working completely. I learned this when I went on a 30 minute run. I sweat when I run, just like any other person who runs. WHY on earth would you make a bluetooth \\"Active\\" headphone set that can't take any moisture at all? These headphones are an EPIC FAIL!!!DO NOT BUY THESE. I am disappointed and completely DONE with Motorola products all together. This isn't the first of their products to fail on me.GMR"},{"rating":"1","title":"S9 Bluetooth Headphones","review":"Don't waist your money on this one. The sound is clear but is not loud enough to overcome the chatter of people around you, or the sound of the road on a bus, WAY TO WEAK! The battery is not replaceable and does not last over an hour per charge and after 6 months you barely get 20 minutes out of it and it won't hold a charge for a day. The earphone are not bendable enough to match your personal preference of a fit inside your ear You also can not find a Bluetooth plug-in adaptor which will help you listen to your computer unless your computer comes with stereo Bluetooth. Other than that, I have no complaints. But shoot, that would be enough to scare me away.. even though these just happen to be the best on the market.. WHERE HAS OUR TECHNOLOGY GONE? I am waiting for a better system which addresses these issues. 1. Loudness, 2. Replaceable Battery 3. Bendable earphones, 4. Stereo Bluetooth Adaptor.

Then the buttons stopped working consistently, and finally stopped working all together. I got agreement from Motorola to replace the headset under warranty a month ago, and shipped it back and still not headset. When I called I got the typical call center garbage, putting me on hold, disconnecting the call, etc. Finally I got someone on the line and they claimed that the headset is out of stock and that is why I did not receive it yet. They never notified me of this, and when I asked when it would be in stock I was told they did not know, but I could call back in a week. I told them that was not going to be OK, and then they claimed to have resubmitted my order and I would receive it in a week.

It only rates 4 stars because it will not adjust to fit a large head size. My head shape and size is slightly larger than average. I feel that the S9 is slightly smaller than perfect in comfort because of the lack of adjusting the length of the arms. I would give the S9 a 5 star for sound and ease of install. The headset sounds very good even if you want to crank the music up. I did not have a problem pairing it to my IPod and my Motorola phone. I use the S9 at work for 8 hours a day. I do have to plug it in at my 30 minute lunch break in order to make the battery last the final hour of my work day. Overall, this headset is very nice.

These are almost the only headphones on the market today that are truely designed with runners in mind. They're sweatproof, they fit sturdy on the head, and they don't bounce around and aren't cumbersome. The only downside is you MUST wear your phone or bt pairing device on some sort of armband to get these to work at 100%, otherwise, if you put it in your back pocket or likewise the signal cuts out often, which can be very, very frustrating to someone who can't figure out what the problem is (hint: it's printed in big bold letters in the equipment manual) Don't expect to get stellar call quality out of the built-in mic either, especialy on a windy day, but it does its job and itsn't the worst built-in mic I've ever used (read: passable) The sound is clear from my mp3 phone and I would very much reccomend this to the workout enthusiast looking for a sturdy wireless headphone solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter crap.","review":"Sound quality is TERRIBLE. I wish I'd paid more attention to the negative reviews before purchasing. The first set I got didn't work, so I sent those back and got a new one, which works, but sounds awful.

Motorola and Amazon BOTH will not support the return or exchange of this item. Do your research and GOOGLE this item in various forums. If you don't sweat its great. Sounds goods, fits good, goes on and off easily...even the phone features work well. But it will NOT tolerate sweat or any moisture (rain).Been using the JayBirds for awhile now and they WILL tolerate sweat, but they don't go on as easily and the earpieces don't fit as well as the S9.Still waiting for the ultimate athletic headphone..... Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst set I've ever owned.","review":"Two big problems with these. First, they are very uncomfortable, almost to the point of being torture. A one hour train ride was too much because my ears were actually hurting hours after I used these things. Second, my set kept dropping the signal almost twice per song. I sent it back for a replacement thinking it was a defective unit, but the new one was also dropping the signal. Mind you, I carried the iPhone in my pocket, so the distance was about 3 feet. I've been buying gadgets for 15 years and this was high up there on my list of worst purchases ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid these like the H1N1 Virus","review":"I bought these for use with my Insignia Pilot Mp3 player, what greater waste of money could I have spent? The sound is so distorted (especially around the mid-range frequencies) that the rattling it causes is like listening to your favorite song through a tin can. Not to mention the terrible outside transmitting range, even with an armband and both devices being fully charged I still get tons of distortion. Reccommended for only to those you hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this headset!","review":"I was profoundly disappointed with this headset. It seemed perfect until I had been running for about 3 minutes. Then, apparently, my perspiration caused it to malfunction and stop working entirely, making it useless. After the fact, I looked on the web and saw that MANY MANY other customers have had this exact problem. I contacted Motorola but they were not helpful. I contacted the Amazon merchant and they refused initially to give me a refund (until I contacted the BBB). Amazon, however, was extremely helpful and refunded my money (although they were not the seller and had no obligation). Kudos to Amazon! Shame on Motorola for selling this defective product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Customer Service????","review":"I received the headset and tried to sync it with the device I planned on using it with. No success. I called the company CCMAccessories in Woodside, NY who is the Amazon merchant for this product. I was told that I would be sent out another pair plus a prepaid label to return the defective one. This never occurred. I then called back about two weeks later and told a gentleman named Louis that I had never received the headset and I wished to return the defective one and just be credited for the purchase. As of Monday November 30th, this has not happened. Let me say that this is the first time I have purchased something from Amazon and had this problem"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sweat proof","review":"Bought this pair of headphones because they marketed it towards people who work out. It was easy to use with a cell phone and the controls for the volume and fast forward/rewind are in a good place to access them. However, when I used it for a running workout and sweated it ceased to work. I wouldn't recommend this for someone that wants it for cardio. I guess they changed it to sweat \\"resistant,\\" but that is like saying my car is collision resistant until you hit it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great if it worked...","review":"Not much to say here. Got it out of the box. Paired easily. Worked a few times and then would no longer change the volume on the headset. I suspect a short. Regardless, it's not saying much for a product when it stops working after less than two weeks and barely an hours worth of usage. I wonder if Motorola just doesn't make a good product anymore. It sure would be great to have a working headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 pairs didn't get it right!","review":"My husband went through 3 pairs of these.

My first pair lasted about 3 weeks before the volumn controls got stuck decreasing. Sent them to Motorola and the second pair lasted a week. Same issue. I'm about to send these back and try a third pair. Read other reviews, this is apparently very common. I haven't read many positive reviews where the author owned these more than a couple of months. Three strikes and they're out.There's a lemon law in the USA to protect customers against companies like Motorola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea with problems","review":"I recently purchased this product from Amazon. Amazon was great, the product, however, was not. Even at the discounted price of Amazon the S9 is still quite expensive. The S9 has great features I really liked. The sound was good on my end but people on the other end said I sounded like I was under water and in a tunnel. My biggest problem though is that after only 3 weeks the phone and volume control portion of the headset stopped working. Volume control would randomly adjust and the phone button would randomly make phone calls. I would be talking to someone and the voice dial would go off. This would have been a minor issue if it only happened once but for 2 days I couldnt use the headset. I returned the S9 for another. Once again Amazon was great but sure enough afrer only 3 weeks it did the same thing. Sorry Motorola but this is a bust for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume problem","review":"I would give these a 10 when they work however the majority of the time the volume gets stuck on low. Then out of the blue the volume goes up and down on their own. Motorola is no help. Can never get an answer out of them. Of coarse someone new responds ea time and never reads the previous info. You would think that with all the complaints on volume control they would post some trouble shooting advice. One tells me to resink it. I ask how. Another responds contact Apple because I am linked to my Ipod. Excuse me but it is the headset that is not working. I have it linked to a couple different devices and it is the same with each one of them. These were a gift and the giver got rid of the receipt. I am stuck with them... working or not.

The replacement worked well for a day, but the volume up button stopped working after that. I was told that I could not get a third replacement, I was willing to try one more set, but now I think I will try the S9-HD as it looks like the buttons on it are actually buttons and not just touch sensitive buttons that stop working. They did pair easily with my iPhone 3G with the 3.0 OS update, but the track foward and back and pause buttons never seemed to work, but I think this is a known issue. I was surprised that calls worked well, I could not see the mic at all, but people said they could hear me just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound... PAINFUL fit.","review":"The sound of these Motorola S9 bluetooth earphones is pretty good... when it's working that is. I had numerous connection problems, but that's primarily due to the bluetooth stack in my laptop, not the earphones. I was able to successfully pair them with my cell phone and laptop most of the time. The stereo sound is good, comparable to wired headphones.My biggest complaint, which may ultimately lead me to return them, is the physical fit hurts my ears. I'm 6'4, 205lbs and have the smallest ear adapters (of the three that come with the S9) on the earphones and they still feel very large in my ear. I suppose they do this so that the fit is snug enough to get the earphones to stay on while working out. However, after 15-20 minutes, my ears really start to ache and I have to remove the headphones for a while. I use them mostly at work, sitting at a desk, to listen to internet radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!!!!","review":"I purchased this for use with my Ipod Classic and my Blackberry Curve. Getting it to pair was the easy part. What was most problematic is that unless the Bluetooth Adapter D650 for the Ipod was within a line of sight of the headphones, the music cut in and out. Very disappointing. Even having the ipod in my front pocket while wearing the headset, I experienced problems with a steady stream of music. After 15 minutes, I decided I could live with the hassle of a corded pair of earbuds without bluetooth stream interruption!"},{"rating":"1","title":"S9's work great, then fail every time, I'm on my 3rd pair","review":"So frustrating. Pair fine with BB 8820, and work for about 3 weeks.

When It Works","review":"I really enjoyed these headphones until they stopped working.The design is stylish and minimalist and the sound quality rivals that of wired headsets. I'm very active, so I want a headset that I can use to listen to tunes while working out or running. I connected these to my cell phone for music and calls.After about a week of taking these everywhere, the volume turned itself all the way down and the buttons stopped working. This rendered the headphones useless. My joy at having found such a cool product turned into disappointment as I read about the similar experiences of others. Apparently this is a somewhat common occurence with these. I returned my Motorola MOTOROKR S9 bluetooth headphones for a refund.Motorola needs to take responsibility for this defect and issue a recall. Until then, I can not recommend this product. I suggest shopping around for products from other manufacturers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I haven't even expected Motorola product is going to be this much worse.

I am having another Jabra BT620, this item is superb but only problem is it is little bulkier..3. The product is not at all comfortable for wearing.4. I attended phone call with 10 minutes duration I got pain at my ears.

It would worked sometimes,but most of the time it was choppy and very irritating. I thought maybe I had a defected bluetooth, so I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. The new one did the same thing. I tried to make it work, maybe recharging it after each use, but it would work at first, maybe an hour, and then it became chopping again. I would also start up the phone part which worked fine, and then start up the music. That worked at first, but once again the music became choppy. I called Motorola's help line, and they gave me suggestion that were no help. So I sent it back for a refund. You would think a Motorola headphone would work on a Motorola phone. I would understand maybe if it was two different brands. Good luck getting yours to work if you decide to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for.","review":"I was looking for a headset that was lightweight, sweat resistant and wireless to use with my moto q phone to play MP3's. Excellent product. The playback time must be around 5-6 hours. Music is loud and clear. Product is comfortable most of the time. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that when working out at the gym, sitting or laying back on a bench the back of the headset presses against the head of the bench and will push off my ears some times, but with the behind the neck design, I guess that is unavoidable. Make sure you buy a legit Motorola model with the hologram on it; first one I bought online was fake and would only last 1-2 hours and sound would cut out all the time. Overall an excellent bluetooth headset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for working out!","review":"I have always wanted a cordless stereo headset, since I tend to move my arms a lot when I am exercising on an elliptical, and I have pulled out many a wire. This headset is perfect for working out, and I don't have to worry about my Bluetooth capable cell phone being pulled onto the floor any more...or worse, being crushed in the exercise machine.It is great, working well even though I get quite sweaty. I was also worried about it not fitting my head after what I read, but it feels fine. As for sound quality, it could have a little more bass, but it is very clear and works well. My only complaint, and it is not really valid considering the way it's made is that, if you want to wear it while on your back working out, it would not be possible, since you push against it and it pops out of your ears, in my case anyway, so you just have to wear it when you're standing or sitting, and that's no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"I was so excited when this arrived. I had to charge it for two hours. Power indicator light would not come on. My Blackberry Pearl could not recognize this device. Called Motorola tech support.

Very disappointed with Motorola."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Performance...but","review":"The sound quality for both MP3 play back and phone calls is good.

Might be my big head though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable on my Neil Cavuto-like head","review":"I bought these locally-on sale-retail, and returned them the next day, which was a wise decision for me. The sides of the headphones, even with adjustment (pulling them apart as instructed) were uncomfortable on my Neil Cavuto-like head, especially with my glasses adding to the mix. My ear canal openings also hurt after a short time; tried both earpieces. Tilting my head upward made them even more uncomfortable; not good if I was biking. I will stay wired for now.

Also important are the spacey sounds, which is what makes it \\"atmospheric\\" and lastly, flow between songs (which I'm sure is difficult in this genre).There are a few good tracks that I really like on this set. The first CD starts out with a couple good ones that give you that certain good feeling you get from D&B. It's got some pretty good variety, but the flow from song to song is not very good. The second CD is not as memorable and I hardly ever listen to it, although it also has some decent tracks.Much better than this set is Atmospheric Drum & Bass, Vol. 2. Unfortunatly, Amazon does not carry that set, because it is phenomenal. With a few exceptions, the songs are excellent, as is the flow. I am always on the lookout for that kind of D&B, but its exceedingly rare.

Recently a dear friend handed me a copy of \\"Atmospheric Drum n' Bass: Volume IV\\". Talk about smooooth! I haven't been taken aback by such a smooth blend since LTJ Bukem released the last of ...well, whatever he releases. This is nice, so nice even I won't waste time picking it apart song by song. If you even remotely identify with smooth and jazzy drum n' bass, also called \\"intelligent\\" D&B, then sample this. To date I haven't steered anyone wrong. I believe in taking chances with my music. Kinda like buying a cd on a gut feeling, a whim, only to realize your instincts were on point again. This one is a keeper.

It begins with the oldest sister, Emily, graduating from high school, and the sisters taking their first \\"adult\\" trip to Santa Monica. The author walks us, the readers, through their lives with all the twists and turns that growing up can throw one. I laughed, cried, cheered, and screamed the girls on through the parts of life that everyone can relate to. As in true life, some of the decisions that the sisters make are not the best, but the beauty is how they pull together to make it through. This book will make you love to read about the Mathis sisters, and will make you appreciate your bonds with your sister/friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is a Must Read","review":"This novel swept me off my feet!

Dorothy Marcic, in a well-researched and documented, highly readable book, has succeeded in placing our nostalgic memories into a larger framework. The political picture, the economic realities, the evolution of female roles are all chronicled by incorporating the popular music that enthralled us over the years. Who knew that the path from \\"My Man\\" to \\"I Will Survive\\" led us along our own path of liberation and independence. A book that entertains and makes you think at the same time! If you ever get the opportunity to see Dr. Marcic perform and illustrate her material in person, by all means do so!

The battle scenes are excellent but really the script is shallow and the movie drags too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I'd binned it sooner","review":"This film will appeal to Muslims because it is essentially a story of Muslim brotherhood defying all odds against the overwhelming Italian modern war machine.I admired the clever devised desert war tactics, of armed cavalry beating tanks and machine gun mounted vehicles. That aside, I found the film accurately summed up in the scene where the Muslim cavalry retreated in the face of the Italian onslaught, leaving their women and children to be massacared. If you find this conduct honourable, then you'll probably enjoy the film. I didn't and found the story line over the top, the acting poor in parts, and the plot feeble. Wish I hadn't wasted my time.The underlying question for me was, why did Italy pour vast resources into a country that had nothing to offer ? not even the glory of conquering it ?Same could be said of Afghanistan today. But I didn't need to see this film to work that out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second rate","review":"I never saw this when it first came out and for some reason it had good reviews so I thought I would give it a chance, big mistake. Even though it had some big names in it, it is a second rate production with poor acting, direction and script. The noble Muslim against the Itaiian oppressors from a very slanted point of view. I am not excusing what Italy did but this is so very slanted that it has no real perspective to it and since the production values are so bad it just is a waste of time. Anthony Quinn is a fine actor but even he needs something to work with and this is not it.Don't waste your time of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This movie is beautiful. It's a true story and that's why I love it. The actors were great in that movie. The great director Mustapha Akkad made a smart choice by chosing a great stars like Anthony Quinn to play as the great Libyan leader, Omar Mukhtar. Also he chosed another great actor, Oliver Reed to play the fascist Italian General Graziani. Generally the whole work is great, and it deserves two thumbs up !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving epic","review":"Although this film was given a predictably limited release due to several factors, most of them overwhelmingly political, do not let that detract you from what is quite simply a breathtaking film about a subject that is often ignored, namely the brutal behaviour of fascist Italy in Libya. From the desert wastes of North Africa to the heart of Rome, the film traces the Libyan resistance to Italian occupation by a largely ignored hero of the era, Omar Mukhtar. The film draws no punches in its portrayal of the cruelty of the fascist army, personified by Graziani \\"the butcher\\" and Moustafa's recreation of the rivalry between these two colossal personalities is brilliantly executed. The historical footage that the film contains throughout as it documents real life events is an additional bonus and overall I would have to say that this film is an extremely recommended purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie about Italy's colony","review":"This movie may have had reviews but I liked it fine. I thought the camera handling was good, the costumes and vehicles excellently portrayed and the action fine. The story? Pretty good. I bit long but it keeps your interest. Certainly there is no depth to some of the characters but is it really necessary to get into Mussolini's head?I also loved the use of archival movie footage in this film. Some directors overdo this technique but I thought it was very well done in this movie.I was glad to get my hands on this gem. I'm sure I'll be watching it several times."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Film","review":"This picture is fairly detailed has plenty of resemblance to what the U.S. is going through in Irag.

It's all about a man (Mukhtar). who tries to save his homeland from colonization for twenty years.Anthony Quinn is incredible as Mukhtar. but I also praise Oliver Reed for potraying as Graziani the \\"Governer of Libya\\" sent by Mussolini to quell this rebellion. But there was a draw back of the film. It was a bit one sided, showing the Arabs as hero (righttfully so) while the Italians (as in soldiers etc) as ruthless and barbaric. While colonialization of other lands is wrong. I feel this film was a bit too slandorous against the Italians. But remember Mussolinni was the founder of the oppressive system of Facism.Pros: Exellent History of Libya Between the 2 World WarsBattle scenes are awesome Amazing actors (Oliver Reed, Anthony Quinn, Rod Steiger etc)Cons: One Sided,too biased against the ItaliansPoor sound Quality, music audio tracks takes over the action (I have a surround systems)But the movie was good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"It has a stupid plot - just natzis killing bedwins and bedwins getting even and it continues into a stupid violent movie of cold blooded killing. if you love violence watch this but don't waste your time - this movie is not worth the 3 bucks used DVD.

The devil is in details and I found a lot to learn here. Sure, it's a bit melodramatic, and, I suppose contrived, but I came away feeling I learned a lot. Quinn and Reed were persuasive -- I think they relished their roles -- and some of the underlings good, as well. There was enough complexity to avoid utter stereotyping. Who cares who paid for it. Sit back and enjoy some good scenery and lively battle scenes,then head for the history books to sort things out. And, it looked great on my dvd player.

The downside to the drive is not due to the drive itself, but rather the media: DVD+RW (write-many-times) is still not popular and may be be compatible with many DVD-ROM drives and certainly most DVD players. DVD+R (the write-once-only media) has better compatibility.

The carpet was finally clean with no more odor. And my couch -- gross. I was shocked at how dirty the water was that it sucked back up. When I was done with the couch I actually went around my house searching for more things to clean, it was both fun and easy to use.I've read about problems with the heating model, but I didn't have any issues. I think it's a fantastic machine but for those worried about the reliability of it the proheat model, maybe choose the non-heating one which will do the same job if you put in super hot water.

Aftter the third time I used it, the sprayer was clogged and I still don't know how to fix it. The instruction manual doesn't tell me how to remedy the problem. Furthermore, the Bissell website link to authorized repair shops doesn't work! Currently, I am forced to use the vacuum element of the machine while carrying around a water filled spray bottle and a can of Spot Shot. This is ridiculous!

I followed directions posted in a review to clean out the tubes, but that didn't work (and I broke off a piece of plastic taking off a tube because the tube had glued itself to the plastic). At any rate, it seems the heat box was no longer working and was overheating, and the heat light was on no matter what. When I put it back together, it still wouldn't spray, and then I could smell the machine overheating. I chucked it. Now I'm looking for a larger steam vac that will do whole carpets and upholstery."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Power and clogs","review":"I brought this yesterday. I was very disappointed in it's performance. The vacuum (water suction part of it) gets clogged and doesnt work without being cleaned repeatedly adding significant time to the task. It is also hard to clean since it is just a slit in the attachment. It didnt get all the water up. As well, the 'turbo' brush merely spins like any other brush. I didnt see anything turbo about it.Also, this is not good for cleaning a large area as you are bent down and have to get up close and personal with the floor with the hose. I am sure it would suffice for spot cleaning but that is not what I brought it for. I plan to return it tomorrow and exchange it for a larger upright model perhaps a different brand.

The first out-of-box use was wonderful. I cleaned and stored the unit. I pulled the cleaner out last week to clean a spill and I could not get the turbo brush to spray. It did vacuum and the brush rotated, but I could not use it to spray the cleaning fluid/water. My husband spent a good deal of time trying to identify and clean the clog, but to no avail. I tried the basic brush. Worked great for the first spray then clogged. Now neither brush sprays. This was a BAD purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for old and new pet stains","review":"Before I got this carpet cleaner, I bought the cordless Bissell Spot Lifter. I sent the Spot Lifter back because it would work only 5 minutes before you had to recharge the battery (12 hours). Even though Little Green isn't cordless, it is small and lightweight and works incredibly well.We had old pet stains on our cream colored carpeting and since we got the Little Green, we've been able to get all of them up from the carpet. Whenever our dog creates other messes, we're able to take the cleaner out right away and clean it up without having to go through too many steps to get the Little Green ready for use. I would recommend this to anyone, especially those with pets and small children -- I don't know why I didn't get this months before -- its made a huge difference in the look of our carpet and well worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't throw it out!","review":"As others have stated - it works well when it works. I was really happy with the way it cleaned. I especially liked the turbo brush. But when I went to use it for only the second time the sprayer wouldn't work - a frequent complaint I understand. You don't have to be particularly handy to fix it. You need a screw driver, a pair of pliers and a paper clip. Unplug the machine. Take the four screws from the top out. Pull the top up. Underneath you will see a black box with 4 screws - undo. Underneath the cover is heater box. Lift up and undo the 5 screws on the bottom. You will see what is causing the problem. You don't need to disconnect the wires. Release the clamps holding the plastic tubes with the pliers and gently remove the tubes. Use the paper clip, opened, to clean out the holes in the heater. It did not take long at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sloppy mess machine","review":"I bought this one after my 2nd Hoover SteamVac Jr. had a broken part. Granted, we have cats and an old dog in the house, so there is a lot of cleaning for the little Vac. Still, I was tired of having to replace the steam vac. So I decided to try the Little Green machine.Compared with the Hoover Jr (which is by no means a super machine), this machine does a POOR job vaccumming up the liquid it sprays out. It leaves carpet and other surfaces practically wet. But that is not what bothers me most.This machine is designed in such a way that one is bound to spill the nasty yuck one vaccums up. Part of the reason is that the bottom of the dirty reservoir leaks. Then the dirty liquid reservoir is designed with an opening on top (why???) and if one is not extra careful, that nasty stuff inside will spill out with the slightest tilt. It is exasperating how easy it is to spill the dirty liquid.This machine is not worth the trouble. I am going to get another Hoover SteamVac Jr."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"This is truly the best investment I have made in a long time. With 4 kids, a dog, 2 cats, a bird, 2 chinchillas - and a messy husband - I am saving myself hundreds in professional rug cleaning bills because of this handy item.I keep the Little Green (and the items needed to make a homemade solution) in a centralized closet - whenever spills, accidents, whatever, occur - I have everything immediately at hand and can attack the accidents quickly. The turbo brush works very well, even helping to remove paint that had stained a rug months prior.Small unit so storage is not a worry. Quickly heats solution if you need it to (you have the option to not use heat). Rinses out easily. Of course you wouldn't want to try to do a whole room, that would take forever but for the smaller stuff (including 3x5 throw rugs), you can't beat this unit for its effectiveness and ease of use.I highly recommend this if you have children and/or pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Within the first year we had to take this machine to a vacuum repair shop to unclog all of the hoses to get it to work again.

I am on my third one. It clogs up easily. I have found that you have to totally clean the unit after using, and hope that the sprayer is going to work when you go to clean the next time. I have started spraying on the cleaner myself, and just letting the vacuum do the cleaning up. OR, I just pour the cleaner on a heavily soiled spot, and then vacuum it up. I would NEVER buy one of these again. Very poor design for the money. I would rather use a full sized cleaner with an upholstery size nozzle for small spots. This is definitely not worth buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So not worth it.","review":"By the third use this spot remover stopped doing its job even a little. Had slight success the first couple of times using it but even then it always leaked. I have to set it on a towel to soak up the water that leaks from the bottom (and yes, I checked all the seals and the tank was on correctly). I get better results scrubbing stains by hand then vacuuming later after they've dried.

It's easy to use and easy to clean. I have two cats (and a husband) who, inevitably, make messes. The Bissel Little Green does all the work with it's fast acting solution, two different attachments and powerful suction. The reservoir that holds the dirty water is super easy to detach and clean out as well as the two different brushes. On another note, I am more than pleased with the customer service! Unfortunately, the heating element went out and was no longer heating the cleaning solution. I contacted Amazon, they e-mailed me a shipping label and I had my brand new Bissel within TWO business days....no questions asked and free of charge. Needless to say, I'm a happy customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaper to get a Shop Vac and a Scrubbing Brush","review":"What turned me on tho this product at first was the rotating brush. This became my biggest let down. The brush rotates with the vacuum suction and really sucks at scrubbing any stain let alone a deep ground in stain. I used this product to get a few stains out of my carpet. After getting fed up with the lack of scrubbing power I had to get and old school scrub it my self. To call this machine the \\"Pro Heat\\" is an absolute joke. The water barely got 2 degree hotter then when I put it in the canister. If there is one good thing about this device, the vacuum does suck up the extra water. My suggestion, wait unit there is a shop vac on sale at home depot and get a good scrubber. It will save you the embarrassment of having to purchase this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bissell 1425b Little Green Proheat Turbo Carpet Cleaner","review":"This was just a very poor quality machine, it heated and it sprayed but when the fluid is on your furniture there was little or no power to suck it up, so if you sprayed out 1/2 cup of shampoo you got back a few tablespoons, I seldom send back anything, but this item was a total waste of money..I went and rented the rug doctor ahd it worked just fine with the bag of attachments for furniture.

However, after emptying it and storing it away for awhile, the next time I went to use it it was clogged and I couldn't get it to do anything - the sprayer didn't work and it didn't suck up anything. Considering I was cleaning up after a sick pet, it was late and I had work to do, I had no time to deal with fixing it. It immediately went in the garbage.

It worked for a short while and quickly lost all suction despite the fact that I maintained it according to the instruction manual. Since it was just past the 1 year warranty I went out and upgraded rather than have the unit serviced, buying the unit with the heater and the powered brushes. I've used it but three times and it no longer sprays and it no longer pulls sufficient vacuum to move the brushes. In fact, it no longer pulls sufficient to draw the cleaning solution even if I spray it onto the surface manually. Unfortunately, between the last use when it worked and my current attempt to use it a time period which puts it out of warranty again has elapsed. I will never again buy a Bissell product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much mess","review":"I bought this product today to clean up a spot on my upholstered chair where one of my cats vomited. Not only did it NOT get the spot out, but it SOAKED the cushion. I also tried cleaning some smaller old spots on my light green carpet (they are still there). I wish I knew what I was doing wrong as other reviewers seem to think this machine works so well. In my experience, there is hardly any suction at all. I used half the water/cleaner tank and the dirt/flush tank had barely any water in it.

I would tell everyone you won't go wrong with machine if you live in small apartment, dorm room or ect. The machine is very easy to use and not to heavy to the aveage person to carry.

I asked for it to be replaced the last time I bought it to the repair shop as it was still under warranty and all they told me it was fixed and not to use tap water.

It did an alright job -- not great -- getting the stains out. However, the work to fill it, mess around with it, clean and empty it when you are done, then find a place to put the huge thing was more than it was worth. Then, it started to leak everywhere. This was just the second time I used it. I returned it and replaced the whole thing with a small bin of carpet cleaner, a scrub brush and paper towels. That works just as well, if not better, never leaks, will never clog and the best part -- only cost me $15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice when it lasted-all of only 3 times!","review":"I used this cleaner a total of 3 times, shortly after I purchased it and each time, I was happy with the results.However!

It is our guess that the pump went out.We did blow through the line, to make certain there wasn't a blockage but air did flow. Hence our thinking it the pump.To make matters worse (Bissell!) shortly after discovering that my Little Green was broken, did my beloved Bissell vacuum break and in less than a year!I have since concluded that while Bissell makes some nice products, that they are not built to last. To note, no...I am not hard on my equipment.On account of both my negative experiences with a Bissell product, I will not purchase another product from them ever again.Very disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll have to replace it every year or so","review":"This is my 3rd Little Green Machine in the last 5 years.

We bought it when we got two beagle puppies that were a little difficult to housebreak. This carpet cleaner has come in very handy for all of those little surprises. We've had this for about four years now and it is still going strong. Be sure to clean it out every time you use it. I'm guessing the negative reviews are from those who didn't read the manual and keep this thing cleaned out between uses. I'm giving it four stars as the turbo brush is a waste of time. The rotating turbo brush is powered by the vacuum and therefore greatly reduces the suction power. It might have been a good idea if it were powered by an electric motor. You can throw that brush away. However the non-powered brush does a good job, and we still are using this tool on accidental spills years after the puppies have grown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogs Up and No Longer Suctions","review":"First use was great. By the second use, the cleaner sprayer clogged up. So, I mixed the cleaner in a spray bottle with hot water and pretreated the stains.

For $100, Stanley Steamer will steam clean my entire house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a while","review":"I used the cleaner a few times, never putting any soap in the supply side, but didn't empty the supply bottle in case I needed to use it quickly. Wrong thing to do I guess. Now when I try to use this, it seems to have an intermitent clog in the line between the supply bottle and the spray nozzle. When you pull the trigger to spray water out, you get nothing, a partial spray, or a weak spray. Pretty much makes it useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Triple bummer. the heater stopped working","review":"This is our second Little Green + Heat.

Checked to see if heater was clogged, it was not - double bummer. The easy return window passed about 10 days ago - triple bummer.

Well, I got it cleaned up and then looked at the unit, and saw a huge amount of filthy water pooling into the rug from around the base of the unit. Clearly it was leaking. Never had this problem before so a search of the symptoms on the internet brought me here to amazon where I see that these indeed have this problem. Mine suddenly started doing it after a few years. Personally I expect a more durable product for the money but I did get a few years out of it. It hasn't really been as effective as I would like either at removing pet stains. We can still see them after it dries on our berber carpet. I expected more out of this product, sorry Bissell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yours too will quit working- I guarantee it!","review":"For all of those who gave this product 5 stars, I offer this predction. It will work great for a year or two-depending how often you use it, and then one day it will quit spraying. It happened to my original Bissell little green, and being an optimist, I bought another one. It also quit spraying after 18 months of use. Bissell's advice to unplug the sprayer with a paperclip will not work either.For a company that produces expensive products that quit working after 18 months and are expensive to repair to make another similar product labeled \\"earth friendly\\" is a joke. I can't even fathom how many of these little green machines are in landfills. It's inexcusable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bare minimal parts work, the rest (heat, turbo br.)broke quickly","review":"I can really only add my voice to the others here, mine has broken in significant ways rather quickly. The heat broke first, then the turbo brush stopped being able to suck the liquid back up, so now I have to use the tiny brush, which takes more time, and more effort. This is important to me, because I have a disability that limits my strength and stamina. The bottom is also leaking now, which I discovered when I found the water marks/damage on the floor of my coat closet where I store it.Despite all of this, I would recommend anyone with kids, pets, or an accident prone family member, to purchase a similar piece of equipment.

In the video I said I started noticing rust stains on the rug at about a year and a half. It was more like a year. And my comment about it glowing might of been a bit exaggered. However, it was hot enough to burn my finger and it started to melt the plastice motor support so it was hot. It did take me about 5 minuted to take apart. but still hot enough to get burned. One of the other reviews stated that the repair person said she should empty and run hot water through the system before storing. The user's manual has no such warning. Do I recommend this? Not really. The last Little Green lasted me almost 10 yrs. This lasted me one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't clean, just dampens the rug","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this product. Given some of the rave reviews, I was expecting at least decent results. I found that it just dampened my rug. The machine is just strong enough to show the water splashing about inside the nozzle head, but it's not strong enough to actually fully suck it out of the rug and into the canister. It just doesn't have enough power to clean the rug effectively. The result is that you've spent $90 on a machine that leaves you with a wet and dirty rug. You're better off taking it to the dry cleaner, renting one of those professional cleaning machines, or spending a couple of dollars on a spray cleaner that you let dry and then vacuum up with your regular vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate enough","review":"The book is Ok, but not quite there. There are interviews from Pro Pinochet people and familiars of the dissapeared. However, I would also have liked to see the opinion of a person whose relatives where killed by communist guerrillas. Also, at the end of the book she tries to portray Allende as the good and Pinochet as the bad guy. That shows she is one sided. Well, Politzer was the head of campaign of Chile's current socialist president Ricardo Lagos and she has her own views but I think she still has some emotions in her that don't let her see what happened in Chile with full neutrality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Item to Collect","review":"This is an extremely valuable recording for anyone interested in the different schools of violin playing in the early 20th century. So many violinists are represented and it is awe-inspiring to realise you are listening to the great masters! The program notes by Tully Potter are very detailed and they make very interesting and informative reading, with equal dedication to each violinist (some smaller names are included with the bigger ones). On the down side, there are problems with some of the noisiness of the actual recording, but that is to be expected with such old material. I think some of the performances don't carry well in the recording process - seeing these people perform would have been very different. Nevertheless it makes for thought-provoking on how performance practices and styles have changed in such a short amount of time. I thoroughly recommend this historical document."},{"rating":"2","title":"leaves you wondering","review":"This was a bit different book for the author, it left things open ended, both in the case and her personal life.

Did he fake his own death in order to defraud theinsurance company? Kinsey spends most of the book trying to put the clues together and runs into trouble along her way.I enjoyed the book and found it a good read, though not as good as some of the others in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame detective","review":"The premise of the story caught my attention -- a man presumed dead for years, whose wife had already collected a large insurance policy on him, appears to be alive after all. The problem is that Sue Grafton's fictional detective Kinsey Millhone is too incompetent to solve the case. How does she resolve her dilemma? By asking two other perpetrators if they were involved just to satisfy Ms. Milhone's curiosity. Lame! And then there is this subplot into Ms. Millhone's personal life that leads to nowhere. I don't know what \\"K\\" or the rest of the alphabet has in store for readers, but I'm not interested in finding out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a testimony","review":"It's an OK book I guess. It isn't so much about baseball as it is about this man's journey in life toward faith. He was a big baseball fan and so most of his stories of growing up have to do with baseball. Not really a sermon, but an OK testimony."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halloween Costume","review":"Fast delivery, but was not the size i order =(. Too late to order a new one so i had to wear a costume from last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good........","review":"Ok, the only reason I saw this movie is because Jeremy Sisto! is in it. Him and his performance is the only reason I rated this movie 2 stars. Elizabeth Hurley does give somewhat of a good performance but overall, I found this movie both boring and confusing at times. Not a horror movie. Only worth the rental fee if you are a Sisto fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CONSISTENT WTH R-RATING","review":"This product was rated R , and so I wanted to witness sexy scenes of Liz hurley. But there were none to my dismay. So it was really mis-leading to rate this product as \\"R\\".Are nude scenes shown in \\"Unrated\\" Movies.If so, then only I will procedd with purchase of DVD s' in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched","review":"This book is a badly written report. Firstly, it focuses mainly on only two roma groups, the Finnish Kaale and Canadian gypsies. Despite this, the author is too afraid to say anything specific, so most results of breaking any gypsy laws are left vague and unspecified. Second, many things are excluded in the explanations and research, such as women's roles and things like Divanos and Bandoliers. The book also glances at women's and family roles, and does not address any actual taboos broken or transgressions perpetuated. I found nothing like the information in the summary, all of which can be found in five seconds from reliable sites using google."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story in need of a plot","review":"At the reading of his estranged father's will, prodigal son Tag discovers that he is the owner of a castle in rural Scotland. He travels to the highland country to sell the estate, and literally bumps into a sexy stranger and has a one night stand on a cold winter night.Who would have thunk that the sexy stranger would be Maura, the woman running the run down Scottish castle? Over the course of the next 250 pages, the two basically just have lots of steamy sex, with a couple of conversations and boring narrative thrown in that don't add much to the story, as they debate on the true ownership of the estate.I was really disappointed; usually I am impressed with Kauffman's storytelling (her only other miss for me was \\"Cinderella Rules\\"). Rather than spend money on this one, check it out at the library. My copy will be available at a garage sale near you soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd buy it,but...","review":"I see that the timings of the songs are listed here, and according to it,this CD contains the 4 minute \\"edited album version\\" of \\"Spill The Wine\\" instead of the full 5 minute version. I counted the total timings & saw this CD is about 56 minutes long. Why on earth put the single edit here when there's plenty of room for the full version? I'd gladly buy this album if only it had the full \\"Spill The Wine\\". I already have the short version on my \\"Best Of War & More\\" CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"When the dvds arrived I did not watch all of the many performances in the first 30 days. Because of a manufacturing defect, some of the performances on one disc froze and were unwatchable. I contacted Warner Bros. twice but never received a response. All I wanted was replacement of one disc. I sent an email to Oldies, the company that filled my order. Oldies responded that they would not do anything because more than 30 days had elapsed. I am not blaming them for the problem. I do blame them for not providing decent customer service.I certainly blame Warner Bros. for not standing by their products. I will never do business with either of them again. Caveat Emptor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off again","review":"My advice is to NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I purchaed thid DVD-R some months ago, it will not play on my Sony play back machine. This is not the first I have been ripped off by Warner Bros. Cheap productd. DVD-r sucks. I have purchased several WB films and several will not play. I will delete WB from my buy list. WB is dead to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoes hats and fashion Dover Pictorial Archives Series","review":"There is a great need for reference material of the past. particularly the 1900\`s through 50\`s. This publication had some good illustrations but there were no references as to source, just a time period and thus only of general backgroud reference. . I also found that many of the images were common available images elsewhere. The low price made the purchase an acceptable member of my reference library even if it be only for tracking down better information from other more detailed resources of the images that were shown.

I have been using this toothpaste for many years and I have to say I saw no reason to change the formula. It is absolutely horrible, after brushing, there is no fresh minty feeling, I feel like I haven't even brushed. I will never order this horrible product again...why screw with the formula Nature's Gate?? I don't understand who makes these stupid decisions. Do not order this \\"New and Improved\\" product. It should say \\"New and Disgusting\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing and does the job","review":"You CAN clean and protect your teeth with a more natural product. I recommend the gel as opposed to the paste for a much fresher feel and taste, but both products are great. Because it contains no fluoride or other unnecessary chemicals, you will discover your teeth will not yellow. (You did know fluoride discolors your teeth, yes?) I do occasionally use a fluoride product, but I have had no greater incidence of decay using this for years than I did using the commercial, run of the mill toothpastes. If you want a toothpaste/gel that will clean and refresh without a list as long as your arm of unnecessary ingredients, my teeth and I recommend Nature's Gate. Much better than Tom's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really, Really bad","review":"I have never ordered Nature's Gate toothpaste before and was suprised when I realized that it didnt contain Fluoride...but I am taking this back to my grocer in the hopes that they will give me a tube of something- anything better than this product!

Schuller is a man who knows about life. He has been through all kinds of struggles and heartaches. Yet he has learned much from the greatest Possibility Thinker whoever lived. His name is Jesus. And in this Bible you will find many links discussing today's obstacles and how you can rely on God to help you overcome them. This Book contains great study aids and wonderful articles to help you on your positive journey with the Lord. Most Bibles just present the Word and that in and of itself is enough. What the New Possibility Thinkers Bible does is embrace areas of thought that have been largely ignored in evangelical circles. Namely health, nutrition, attitude and destiny. This Bible will take you on a totally complete spiritual journey. Dr. Schuller is an American treasure and this Bible is thoroughly inspiring. God will be more real, more involved and more influential in every area of your life.
