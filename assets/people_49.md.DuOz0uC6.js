By using this book it really discouraged me from continuing Russian! Quite a few students felt the same as I did about this text.

In the old school way, the bodybuilder eats whatever he wants to gain mass and later on sheds off the fat through aerobic exercise. The problem with that is, during the rigorous aerobic training, much muscle mass is also lost with it. The new way of bodybuilding (which makes alot of sense) stresses to eat alot and eat LEAN while you train.

After unpacking the driver file, run the hardware setup as administrator. Now, you can use whatever webcam/pc cam software you want.Following the above, I had this camera working inside 5 minutes.

If you're looking for uplifting New Age music, you will not find it here. Look into Vangelis, Kitaro, Jean-Michel Jarre, Secret Garden or so many other decent acts that truly get to your soul. Not this, PLEASE! (the two stars are for the three songs mentioned above: the rest of the album is worthless)."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must for Cusco fans","review":"This is an awesome CD!

A tool that is meant to be banged on hardly during regular operation should be made of the highest quality metal I think. The rubber grommets that hold the driving plug together also rip easily.

The quality of writing is remarkable and the subject matter is truly fascinating (at least to me).\\"Notes on a Scandal\\" depicts a story of an affair between Sheba - a 40-year old married school teacher and her 15-year old student Steven as seen through the eyes of Sheba's elderly fellow teacher Barbara. Zoe Heller offers a fascinating perspective on such a relationship, where the victim (in legal sense) initiates and controls this illicit affair. But the brilliance of this novel is that while this is Sheba's very personal story, it reveals more about Barbara's dark personality than it does about Sheba herself.In a few words, this is an unforgettable tale of loneliness, dependence, and obsession.Not recommended to squeamish and those who are looking for a light entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliantly Written","review":"Notes on a Scandal is a brilliant read. Zoe Heller has such an amazing taste for words and once you read a page or two, you find yourself not able to put it down. The subject matter was fascinating, how we as society see these relationships from the outside, however, the author makes you see the whole thing from a completely different perspective. It can almost change your mind on the entire topic all together. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a brilliant masterpiece. From beginning to end, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great winter read","review":"I read this book mostly in class-- it's satisfying and short enough to finish in just a few sittings. (or, in 3 classes) The story is compelling in that it takes taboo headlines and makes them human, and I loved watching Barbara, the narrator, slowly unravel and show off her true colors.

But even then Barbara is willing to accept that Sheba is simply nave and takes it upon herself to take control and stand up for her friend. She wants to be the ultimate friend in need ... why can't Sheba appreciate that? Why won't she simply let her take over and make everything right? Why is she once again being scorned?This is a story of hidden agendas, ulterior motives, malice and of \`friendship' turning into obsession. It is dark, chilling, well-paced and hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Thought Provoking Reading","review":"This is a great novel if you're looking for something a little saucy and out of the ordinary. The characters are undeniably flawed, which is what makes them so fascinating. There are some really funny parts, as well as some heart wrenching moments. Sheba's teenaged daughter is hilarious and written very well. I would highly recommend this book for the beach, airplane, or similar situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perils of voyeurism","review":"What Was She Thinking (don't you love the title?) is a double character study that is utterly engrossing. It examines the dangers of voyeurism, leaving readers feeling that's exactly what we're guilty of ourselves as we voraciously keep turning the pages.Barbara slowly befriends Sheba, another woman in the school where they are both teachers, and equally slowly Sheba reveals details of her relationship with a 15yo student. Through author Heller's piercing writing, the characters of both women are more fully revealed - and by the end we feel as if our own inner secrets have been probed with a dental pick.Superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great potential, but poor follow-through","review":"Although the foreward was intriguing, I found it difficult to actually finish the book. As I continued reading, I kept hoping for some type of excitement - but the incessant drone of the narrator made this a perfect need-to-get-sleepy book.The conclusions that I drew about the main characters in the first quarter of the book were the same as at the end - they evolved very little and very little new information was learned that was beneficial to character development.Overall, I'm a bit disappointed. For a plot with so much potential (two obsessions intertwined), this book dodged every chance at excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb stylist; excellent novel","review":"Heller has written a fine novel with an effortless, elegant, yet rigorous prose style. She is not, thankfully, the type of writer who likes to do tricks for the reader, directing attention to herself and how clever she is. Instead, the narrative (compelling), characters (real, recognizable, excellently drawn), and style (crisp and intelligent) all work in service of a fascinating fictional reality. I reserve 5 stars for life-altering literature, which this isn't, but WHAT WAS SHE THINKING? certainly deserves to be widely read. It is superb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"Although the topic of this book is interesting in itself, the authour missed an opportunity to do it any real justice. This book is easy to read and in parts very insightful, but at the end it isn't a very memorable or worthwhile read.

I said it was a true story about a teacher who has a romantic and sexual relationship with a 15yo boy and gets caught.. I was expecting to find out the teachers motives and possibly more about her sentence for doing the \\"dirty deed\\", but alas I was struck dumb when I read the book and found it to be written from a fellow teacher/friend point of view. It never got into any professional's point of view. It doesn't even go into the trial at all. It was mostly about this lonely teacher/friend who uses the teacher as her \\"pet\\" to fill her lonely days.. I did not like it, but if you just want a quick read about a sordid affair, go right ahead and order it..No problems (as usual) with the order or promptness in receiving it. I love to buy all my books on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another inspiring work by Klein","review":"After reading Gerda Weissmann Klein's classic All But My Life, I couldn't wait to dig into A Boring Evening at Home.

The author would benifit from application of scientific rigor that would add depth and credibility to his copious but superficial use of examples. Perhaps exploring a corporate strategy of diversification would of given him the credibility I needed to swallow all his claims.

I was baffled by the \\"spiritual' label given to this book. I was expecting something along the lines of Thich Nhat Hanh because of the author's Buddhist leanings. Instead, this read like the self indulgent smut of an adolescent. Harry Haller's rather boring journey from isolated arrogance to licking the earth may have been a more spiritual read if he found some meaning in his life through helping others or self sacrifice. Hookers and drugs hardly qualifies as a transcendental experience in my mind.My other complaint - Hesse is just downright windy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A turgid mess","review":"Reading this \\"novel\\" is like wading through molasses. It's unbelievably slow and turgid -- and all about how the protagonist is a genius, but unrecognized in the world (and yet, what has Haller actually ever done? He's only special because Hesse tells us so). It's hard to believe that this is great literature when we have the likes of Joyce, who can draw us a character going through existential despair in a few pages, and leave you aching.Any story in \\"Dubliners\\" has more depth and feeling than the whole \\"Treatise of the Steppenwolf\\", and in fewer pages by far."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a disappointment...","review":"The Version translated by Basil Creighton just does not work: as I go along, I can almost see the translator's efforts and getting stuck: as a native German speaker, I can certainly hear the German sentences and, frankly, I not only shall try and find a later translation (this one dates from 1929) - I am left with deep regret that I did not search out the German text.

Was no one besides Hegel able to see what Hegel meant?This is well worth still considering since the task -- overcoming negativity after becoming a self-consciousness aware of self-consciousness aware of itself and what this means -- is still a tragic fight for many of us. Perhaps only more tragic for those who never get to fight it.But what about those of us that do? Today instead of Jung we have folks like Yalom.Then compare these to folks like C.S. Lewis.

I felt like I had a measure of compassion for the characters in Demian and Siddartha, but Harry Haller's issues really just struck me as a needlessly melodramatic pity party, and this wasn't helped by the weird mystic/hallucinatory cabaret and imaginary conversations with Goethe and Mozart that Hesse sets him in.

Some of the theories are slippery slopes and tend to jump to conclusions...Season 3 details larger ideas presented in the previous seasons. The problem with S3 was that I wasn't interested in many of the topics (supernatural Halloween, American Old West, cults, American Founding Fathers). Some episodes were decent (Evil Places, Sacred Places). None were outstanding. It's time to evolve the series from Ancient Aliens to Modern Aliens and see some modern theories and types of alien species. Again, I welcome the benign and the ludicrous (but, if it's alluded that Jesus Christ was an alien hybrid again, I may stop watching...seems like every other episode they are saying this just to annoy any religious people)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't help but wonder","review":"First, let me say that I am a rational man that understands the truth about the Easter Bunny, the Toothe Fairy, and Santa Claus.

In the past all you heard about was Stonehenge and the Egyptian Pyramids, but until these shows I hadn't realized what an ancient civilization India had and what they add to the question of ancient aliens. Admittedly there are some suppositions that they make that I am not will to go along with, but when they ask why/how did the ancients build with huge blocks of stone that we would have difficulty with with modern machinery I say, that's a damn good question!

They lied, or were planted. The movie sucks. Very bad acting by unknown actors. Usually expected. But these people were the bottom of the barrel of Bad actors. The movie plot was very weak. But most annoying, was the overused sound effect of the startling loud banging of a large steel door, at the end of a long hallway sound, that ALL these elcheapo Horror movies use anymore, to surprise you, especially after a very quiet scene, where the actors are practically whispering to each other. Then, you already expect the loud BANG, noise to happen. And it does. Too often. I hate movies with no substance, and excessive annoying startling sound effects.

The instructions are not easy to understand initially because of poor photo quality. All you have to do is position the gauge in middle of the belt with the flange on the side of the belt and press down on the center plastic finger rest until it clicks and that is it. Very simple. I suspect that the negative reviews may been due to defective gauges but mine clicked perfectly every time though the plastic pressure indicator arm was slightly long and jammed in the measurement reading slot initially. Trimming the end of the arm lightly with a file to free the arm corrected that problem and consistent and repeatable readings were then achieved. Increased the tension on the belt and the gauge gave increased readings until the proper tension was achieved. This gadget is a little strange looking but works real well for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great for a 7th generation Honda Civic.","review":"I love the concept of this tension tester, but I had a terrible time using it on my 2002 Honda Civic LX. When testing the alternator belt, the frame and the engine mount prevent any human being with a normally articulated hand from using this tool. When testing the power steering belt the engine mount is once again in the way. The PS belt can be tested from below the car with the splash shield removed, but even with that relatively unobstructed view, the tool was awkward to use. The slightest bump on the indicating lever either before or after measurement can seriously skew the result.

That, and the monkey was funny - if they'd have kept him I'd have given this set 2 stars. The female actors are cute enough (except for Jennifer Aniston, whose attitude I've never liked). The men are losers all. The theme song is an atrocious stab at pop. The entire show is just bad, middle-of-the-road, mainstream junk.

Conceivably Rostropovich's or Ma's versions of the latter might be a tad more impressive, but this sounds rich and fine, the engineering is excellent, and the violin sonata is equally impressive. But the real surprise is the Six Metamorphoses, the variations for oboe. Not a particularly favorite instrument of mine, the oboe in Carter's hands really soars, and Britten's writing here may outstrip that for his cello suites. I don't care about the \\"programs\\" in program music but as pure affective sound this is imaginative and wonderful.In all a very worthy compilation for chamber lovers and/or Britten fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as mentioned...

Now I know why it was there to begin with! The music from start to finish has no hooks to draw one's attention or keep the listener engaged, and the lyrics had no real substance to them, only repeating the same lines and the same concepts without progressing to a definite point for one to follow.

What a mistake! First, Yuki wrote NONE of the songs on this album, so that is already a reason to bash her. But also, her singing voice is so weak that most of the time I could not understand what she was singing, even though she sings mostly in English! This becomes painfully evident on the track \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now\\" in which she duets with a male singer whose voice totally overshadows hers. The liner notes of this album don't even have the lyrics printed to aid in enjoying the songs. It's a safe bet Higher Octave won't ever release another album by this artist; she simply does not sing well enough to deserve it."},{"rating":"1","title":"At last, a published opinion!","review":"I wanted an inexpensive mp3 player, and this was on sale.

After going through the Pimsleur series, I thought I'd try the Michel Thomas course in order to pick up some of the structure of Italian. I had no idea how inept both the teacher and the students would be until I played the first CD. Michel Thomas repeatedly makes mistakes that I was able to pick up on after studying for only three months with Pimsleur, and he's supposed to be some sort of language expert. The students are constantly stumbling over simple concepts that Pimsleur instills in you without effort, and their accents are pathetic. Never try to learn a language from a non-native because you'll end up with horrible pronunciation. I'd recommend getting the Pimsleur CDs and a book on grammar if you're seriously considering learning Italian. Don't waste your money on this ridiculous attempt at a language course."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start","review":"This is a good way to begin learning you will learn some phrases and be forced to think in Italian. It is an easy way to pick up the language. The problem in my opinion is that you don,t really learn enough grammar, and by the time you've finished the 8 cd set you still feel you have a lot to learn. Having said that I'm glad I bought this set. I still listen to it when I want to take a break from the more challenging ultimate Italian by living language."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bizarre recordings","review":"The method in this course could work for some.

I think his idea about teaching is good, but he is NOT a native Italian speaker and the CDs consist of two students mispronouncing and misstating Italian over and over again, then Michel Thomas in his heavily accented English, speaking Italian. Mr. Thomas has a German-sounding accent and constantly speaks over the students.Honestly, you are ready to explode. No one on these CDs speaks Italian with a native accent.

I followed directions exactly and after rinsing out step 1 my hair felt kind of soft but then once I did step two and my hair was still wet I thought ok this seems good. I styled my hair and for a while it looked shiny but after a while my hair got extremely dry and frizzy. I looked like a cotton ball on my head. I was freaking out to say the least. The next day on my way to Sally's I scratched my head and felt I huge piece of skin that flaked off my scalp. I mean it was the size of my thumb nail. Worse thing ever!

I have to color it every 3-6 months with a natural hair product (Naturtint) because it gets damaged easily. I had heard that this works best for black hair, however I was told it's also great if you are white, but it doesn't seem the case after reading other reviews with similar problems. I have used Nexxus in the past as well as Joco and both helped add more stability to my hair, but after using this two-step treatment exactly as the instructions read, my hair has more split ends and breakage than ever before.

I knew this would happen based on other reviews so I armed myself by applying the Aphogee balancing moisturizing conditoner along with Shea Moisture leave in and Avocado butter, but the dryness was a little too powerful. I am literally afraid to use this stuff again... oh, and why didn't anyone warn me about the rank smell...

I used it like everyone else and sat under the dryer until it was hard. Then rinsed it out and immediately felt the difference in my hair. Soft, shiny, silky, and much much stronger.What they don't tell you is two things:1) make sure you use the ApHogee Balancing Moisturizer immediately following this treatment because it is a very powerful product. The Balancing Moisturizer does just that--balances your hair; and2) don't use this treatment more frequently than every six weeks.

Otherwise the piece turns into a travesty and a bore. In this 1994 live appearnace in Berlin, a decade before he was appointed music director, Simon Rattle approaches the vulgarity a bit too daintily, much as Riccardo Chailly does.There's not much to choose between them. Chailly gets better sound from Decca, and the Concergebouw sounds wonderful. EMI gives Rattle quite good sound, though, and he seems a bit more committed than Chailly, more mysterious in parts of the first movement (\\"Faust\\") perhaps a bit less romantic in the second (\\"Gretchen\\"), and more sprightly in the third (\\"Mephistopheles\\").If you want a reading of fineese, this is a good choice, but it doesn't shake the world.

Also, just too little on-board RAM, and if you save your applications on the SD card instead they are SO slow.HP's firmware and ROM updates from their websites actually made it worst. It's more stable with just the 1.00.00 firmware version out of the box. My only hope is that it's a Windows Mobile 5.0 problem and there will be an update soon.

But this unit does not feature Bluetooth.One could potentially use a LAN sync through the WiFi connection this iPAQ features - - - but Microsoft disabled LAN syncronization with ActiveSync 4.1.I've owned 4 Palm OS devices - this was my first (and last) venture into Pocket PC territory. If a device can't do the basics - maintain a schedule and phone book - then I don't care how pretty it looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"When I got my Rx1955 I was impressed with the wifi capabilities. Later I was extremely dissapointed that it lacked bluetooth functionality to sync with other devices. I also was dissapointed by the fact that it crashed frequently and had to be reset (windows mobile's fault). My Rx1955 ended up dying, the lcd decided that it would just show bars and not anything else one day. I called hp and they said replacement would cost around 200 bucks with the trade in (I went online and got the next model up with bluetooth instead)."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome ipaq","review":"I love my ipaq.

The OS on the HP locks up too much for me. I am not used to having my PDAs lock up. I can't say my Pilot or my current Palm Treo never lock up... but I can't remember the last time they did. The HP Wi-Fi and bluetooth work well, I give them that. However, the SD card slot broke just after the warrantee expired and now its useless. There are too many other good PDAs on the market to waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far, So Good","review":"Had my iPaq now for over 1 month, just ran into the memory card issue, with the help of others who posted here, I downloaded the firmware fix and so far so good.

Also helps to if your cpu OS is up to date. I rely on the fact that these are mass produced so problems could occur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elegant design and functional, when it worked.","review":"I recently purchased this palm for my mother who was interested in getting a new PDA. While the device itself worked perfectly, there was one major problem we seemed to have with it. The device itself seemed to stop turning on after a while. We had purchased the store's extended warranty so we just took it back and they replaced it. Second one, the same thing happened again. So we tried fiddling around with the battery, apparently the battery easily loses it's connection so the unit itself will not power on unless you fiddle with the battery. Two PDA's in a row with the same exact problem, and another reviewer encountered something similar, I think it's fair to say the initial release batch of this PDA has definitely had some issues. We ended up exchanging it for a Palm TX.My mother said she loved it while it worked, and is very disappointed such a trivial problem can cause so much annoyance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait until the bugs are out","review":"I purchased my rx1955 about two weeks ago and I've been having a lot of similar problems as the other reviews, namely the on/off button doesn't work half the time and I have to do a \\"soft reset\\". I've called HP and they will be sending me a new one, but after reading the other reviews I'm not too confident that the next one won't do the exact same thing. Also, since it has Windows Mobile 5.0 there are a few things that I've tried to download (mainly readers) that aren't compatible. The battery runs down very quickly with an SD card. So, all-in-all, I wouldn't purchase this thing again until they work all the bugs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ipaq Rx1955 needs reset to turn on; poor battery; slow","review":"I would have given the ipaq rx1955 4 stars if I can turn it on using the power button, and if it had a decent battery. Most of the time I'd have to reset the rx1955 to turn it on. Some people suggested a few fixes: leaving it out of the case, removing the SD card, and/or charging it with the SD removed. Not sure if any of these will work consistently. The CPU is underpower, but that's to expect with a low-end PDA from HP. Other than that, it's compact size and bright screen are perfect for my use. No issues yet with the O.S. and the Activesync software. Warranty is a pathetic 90 days by HP (online purchase) so that's how much confidence HP has with their iPaq Rx1955."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"My first Ipaq since 1999/2000 which was a 1500 series monochrome! So far I've had pretty good luck with the PDA. Windows Mobile 5.0 will probably have some bugs but it is new and exciting. The WiFi works well and easily finds networks - even just driving down the road. I picked up ESPN.com from a bakery while waiting at a stop light!Contacts etc. sync up well and I plan on using this as my MP3 player. It sounds great so far. Nothing to complain about in my first few days other than it has 1 pixel \\"out\\".

She was unplugging the cable when the plug came apart and spat bits and pieces all over the place. HP sent a new cable, telling us that they've had a real problem with the plug coming apart. Well, the damage didn't end there. When the plug came apart, the receptacle on the PDA got damaged. HP is refusing to repair it under warranty, despite the fact that they've acknowledged the cable problem. They want $210 plus shipping to repair it, and are claiming that the damage was our fault. The whole plug/receptacle assembly is one of the cheapest and most fragile designs I've ever seen in consumer electronics. It will be a durability problem for pretty much anybody. HP is being a bunch of (...)about the whole thing, and I'd think twice about getting ANY HP PDA. Maybe try the Del Axim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Machine, big disappointment","review":"I just returned this item after almost 3 weeks of frustration. No problems at all for the first week. Then I put an SD card in it, for 2 days still no problems, then the soft reset problem began. This was not a deal breaker for me so I kept it, because I was really enjoying it and it had a lot of nice features. Then... after at least 3 weeks of use, the power started to be zapped. Somehow it was turning on (and no I did not have any appointment reminders set that would turn it on) or in some other way draining the power even though it was definitely turned off for hours. If it was not going to be available for use when I needed it, it would be no use to me, so it went back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto Ditto Ditto","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewerss. The rx1955 is not a great success in terms of handhelds.

It is slow to take commands and if you hurry it will lock up. This is easily cleared, but it is a pain. The same goes for integration with a computer, it is slow and does things at its own speed. Downloading the updated program from Microsoft helps a bunch, but still leaves the whole operation behind the easy operation of my old Palm. This reminds me of the first computer I owned, slow, saw more of the blue-screen of death than I wanted.

I was also surprised at the way Gresham constantly maligned others in Lewis' life.Another disappointing thing about the book is that only the last few chapters are dedicated to the time period that Gresham actually knew Lewis. He speaks with great authority on Lewis' entire life, interpreting events before he was born as if he was there.If you are expecting a well-written and enjoyable book about C.S. Lewis, this book is not for you. I found the book tiresome and hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important addition","review":"Douglas Gresham has, in his second book on C.S. Lewis, added his unique voice and first-hand understanding of the man, in a very engaging way. As some have noted, at times is sounds as though he were writing to school-age children, but having watched several Gresham interviews (incluing the DVD included with the book), he is speaking in his own voice. An opinionated one at that, but unlike other biographers, Gresham is part of the story. As with most biographies and even Shadowlands, his brother David is nearly erased from history, and I would have liked to have learned more about him. We can be grateful to know more of the story, and so for Lewis fans this should be a must-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's Life: A memory of C.S. Lewis - simplisity at last.","review":"This book is a look at C S Lewis's life from the eyes of a boy who respected him and in some aspects idolised him.Simply told the book is a reflection of C S Lewis's life as understood by someone who lived with him for the last ten years of Lewis' life. There is little new information in this memory of him probably due to the many books written about Lewis since his death.The attached DVD with an interview by Gresham was an added bonus which I found was well worth viewing.I have since loaned my copy of the book out to a friend doing theological study and they found it very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm","review":"This book is written as if the reader is a child (Douglas Gresham is constantly defining terms he uses as he writes). I really wanted to like the book and find it helpful insight into the life of C.S. Lewis but it wasn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's Life","review":"I expect that it will be wonderful. I have always liked CS Lewis. How much more personal can you get as an author than his own son? I think that many will enjoy this and it is not written as CS writes but rather in a plain tone so that readers will stay interested and be able to stay with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"Did I expect too much? I anticipated so much more from Douglas Gresham. Was he writing for children? Even children deserve to be treated as if they could understand words of more than one sylable. Presumably many people who would be interested in reading about C. S. Lewis have some knowledge of the man, this particular book was entirely too condescending. Who needs to have definitions of simple words explained?In addition, there was almost nothing new in this description of Lewis. I hardly categorize it as \\"biography\\"; more an effort to sell yet another book given the hype over recent notice of Lewis' works. I could not recommend it in good conscience.Voracious Reader"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book for Young Adults","review":"This is a sterling biography of Jack Lewis for younger readers. Though at times it drifts towards hagiography, it corrects itself by being a careful, warm memoir. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and it was one of three biographies of Jack I heartily recommend. The book would have earned five (5) stars but for the wee errors towards hagiography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack's Life: The Life Story of C.S.Lewis","review":"My first read for one of C.S.

Dr. Jampolsky's book is, for me, a reminder of what each of us can do, as one person, to help heal not just ourselves but those around us. This is a book of skills, grounded in the realities of everyday life. What I most appreciate in reading Jampolsky's pages is the realization that spirituality is not a distant prayer but is really about living our lives with a focus not just on our own selfish needs but on the needs of all people, and all of life, on our planet. It comes down to learning the skills to not forget that we are truly ONE--regardless of how that might seem when we have been attacked. This book, in my opinion, makes an important contribution."},{"rating":"1","title":"OFFENSIVE ODOR!","review":"I ordered two of this item and cannot use either of them.

The cable was long enough not to interfere with the movement of the laptop and throughout the school semester, we experienced no attempts of thefts with this secured laptop.

Upon opening the package, however, I was overpowered by a strong, toxic smell. It literally stunk up my whole apartment. I left it on the balcony to air out for a day. I even washed it in the sink with sponge and soap. 3 days later, it still smells horrible and I'm considering just throwing it away. I think it might be a health hazard.

It is poor in quality. The lock itself isn't sturdy. The key's jacket (the black part) nearly comes off when you attempt to take the key out of the lock. This item looks (and smells) as if it came from a small street vendor in China. It has a very strong chemical odor similar to the odor in China-made shoes. The product was probably intended for the Chinese market as it has Chinese characters in the back of the package. Take it from the other reviewers, this product is not worth your money. It also does not fit two of my laptops. I have an Acer netbook and Hp 6730b. So this cable is basically useless to me. Do not get fooled by the low price. This item is not worth it. Spend a little bit more and get a decent product for more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely, positively, do not buy this cable!!","review":"Ok, I'm going to cut to the chase: this cable has a bad odor problem. The previous reviewers of this item were not joking.It's a strong, synthetic smell, and I guess vapor-like. I tried storing them in a desk drawer at work, and upon opening it at a later date, the smell poured right out. I could still smell it at a distance when I connected it to a work laptop.Cleaning it with alcohol does nothing.Worst yet, I was dumb enough to sniff it up close to check if it still had the smell. Bad mistake. I ended up with a headache pretty quickly afterwards after taking a whiff of it.So, even if the cable works, it's fair enough to say that it's not worth saving the money to get headaches or goodness knows what deleterious health effects one might incur from whatever is emanating from the cable. Buy something else. Just not this cable."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"Bought this for under a dollar, ended up being $2 total, but even for that, you can't go wrong. It does have a chemical smell to it, but I don't even notice it unless I hold it 2 inches from my nose. Its nothing too bad. The lock mechanism works perfectly, it is a bit loose on my HP DV2000 Special Edition laptop, haven't tried it on any of my other laptops. However, its still mounted to the thick metal hinge, so its not going anywhere. The cable is a bit thin, but really, who's going to bring a bolt cutters to steal a laptop? Its main purpose is to keep people from walking away with your computer. I often have rummage sales and sell desktops and laptops, and I may consider buying more of these locks for the price.

It was like being high without substances. It was psychadelic, funky, inspiring and fabulous. Another plus is that these guys are really nice. They came out into the audience and visited.

Just say no to software that does this! It's a hassle and it is completely unnecessary. Consider the fact that \\"cracked\\" versions of PhotoShop CS appeared worldwide on P2P networks even before the product hit the shelves, and you've got a draconian activation scheme that only causes a lot of hassle for the honest people.

It would appear that it was not even professionally made! If audio is as important to you as it is to me, this is another good reason NOT to buy it! The audio is CENTER CHANNEL ONLY!! What a waste! There was not a \\"no star\\" rating, so consider my 1 star a MINUS 1 star! Shame on any retailer that sells this DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Un-Faithfully Horrible!","review":"I wish I would have read the reviews on Amazon before buying. I, too, was looking for a good biographical summary on Faith Hill and some music as well. This DVD is horrible! It basically includes some clips of Faith, but mostly interviews with other people who are trying to break into the music business. The DVD focuses less on Faith than the title suggests, and is very poorly edited, written, and documented. The quality is horrible, and does a huge injustice to such an incredible person. If you are looking for a faith DVD, this is NOT the one to buy! Faith should demand they destroy every copy of this DVD/VHS, and fans should demand a refund from their retailer! It's not worth 18 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything how to use Resin","review":"This book is an encyclopedia about working with resin, but very good and easy reading.

This will never happen in Medieval 2. If you get attack by your neighbour. You are on your own because your allies will just watch and do nothing. This game has endless posibility as to what route you want to pursue such as exploration + colonization of new world or world domination where as Medieval 2 you only have one choice: conquer or be conquered.Europa has more replay value and more options.

It is mainly used to test persons with language or hearing handicaps but also given to disadvantaged and non-English-speaking children. The child is shown 17 cards with a variety of colored designs and asked to reproduce them using a set of colored blocks. Performance is based not just on the accuracy of the drawings but also on the examiner's observation of the child's behavior during the test, including such factors as attention level, self-criticism, and adaptive behavior (such as self-help, communication, and social skills).

I love how the challenges are actually relative to the ultimate prize. Another great thing is that the judges (especially Tyra Banks) seem to really care about the girls; they're not just around to make nasty comments. Plus, the various conflicts between the girls may be staged, but they provide that just-right amount of mindless fun that's necessary.

I was a bit disappointed by the bonus features. The boxset's final disc (all nine episodes and bonus features are provided on three discs) shows merely a few moments of inital castings and how the girls were chosen. It also shows a few interviews with Jay Manuel (the make-up artist) and Jay Alexander (the runway coach). I was hoping for more footage of the girls' catfights and behind the scene footage of the judging sessions.

Its has a prism crown on both sides so won't lay flat...its made to be hung. This chandelier pendant is pretty and sparkly and is well balanced for hanging and throws nice rainbows. The diagram is very specific about the number of bevels and its true to form. The one I have feels a little rough around the drill hole and one of the edges could have used a bit more grinding to make is smooth as glass as it were. Overall none of the minor imperfections will impact is intended use as a sun catcher, provided the the drill hole doesn't fracture.

It is nice to read someone communicate his experience without attempting to score cheap points. I would love to have had a bit more on where exactly Sweeney landed theologically and why, but otherwise it is a tender and insightful look at an important cultural group and moment.

Rosemarie Lennon, who I'm sure is a sweet woman who owns at least a few cats, seems concerned the reader is drunk during the entire reading (which, incidentally, I was), and each chapter repeats all the basic facts and quotes from every chapter before it.

Will Jack's father sign his deatj warrant. These are some of the questions that arises when you read the novel.The book is a good attempt at attorney-based novels.

They most definitely could of changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tediuous, repetitive, and altogether poorly written","review":"Sheppard's attempt to capture the \\"American youth angst\\" failed miserably. Instead what he created was a novel that felt more like a chore to get through. I never developed any connection or understanding of the characters. Each chapter seemed to stumble into the next, with the end as predictable as the next expletive Sheppard was going to use to give his protagonists a hard edge. You'd do better saving your money, driving to the nearest mall, and find the kid in the Anarchy T-shirt looking sullen, because it appears that is all Sheppard did in this work. Phew Stinker-rooney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not deserving of an award...","review":"Anyone who works with today's youth will likely see that Shepard had a hard time connecting with the teen mind when he wrote this novel. The situations patchworked into the storyline to drive along the plot feel almost completely unbelievable. More so, the dialog used by the teens in this novel is so contrived and so incredibly awful. As you read, it feels like an adult desperately trying to write like a teenager but without have the background research of how one thinks.I can't help but think this book gets more credit than it deserves mainly for the fact that it tackles such an incredibly difficult subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Project X","review":"This is the story of two eighth grade boys and their disaffected lives. They have no friends other than each other and seem to hate everyone else. This lack of friends has become such a defining characteristic for the two that when people try to reach out and befriend them they are blind to it. Eventually, they decide to get revenge by planning a Columbine-style shootout. Shepherd does an amazing job of depicting the delicate psyche of adolescents and how minor slights can escalate into a terrible tragedy. He spares nothing here and presents a far more accurate and revealing depiction of disturbed youth than I have ever read. Unlike the terrible Booker winner of last year, this is an important and substantive book on a disturbing topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never have I read better","review":"This small 165 page book total opened my eyes, and I thought they weren't closed before. This book demands you to, \\"stop the apathy\\", that is so common in schools today. This book takes you inside the head of an outcast of society (the largest hate group in the world, and the most deadly) and shows you why school shootings happen, and how they can be stopped. I think this book should be required to be read by anyone old enough and mature enough to read it. This book has a deep, deep meaning and shows you what society really is. As to the Librarian who gave this only one star, you are off; not him.

Would not recommend for anyone over the age of gen x ers. Written in short sentences and chapters didnt fully fledge out the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Jim Shepard took an unflinching look at junior high life when he penned \\"Project X\\". It wasn't a fun read, but whenever you're dealing with the awkwardness and loneliness the early teen years bring, there are moments of humor.This book delves into the heads of teenage boys, and how bullying does more damage than we probably know.It also points out how we as adults and parents are often just too busy to care, or too distracted to notice when trouble looms.We better all pay more attention to our boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ma Chevre","review":"\\"That means my goat in French.\\" As the narrator outright admits, The IHOP Papers has surprisingly little to do with IHOP and much more to do with being in love and in pain and not necessarily in that order. This book is also about being gay, being afraid of being gay, San Franciso, and goats, yes, goats most of all. Ali Liebegott has a true gift for creating witty, realistic, likeably imperfect characters. She is also an author who can find the absurd humor in even the most tragic of situations and make you laugh out loud even when you feel deep down like you should be crying. Reading this novel was an experience in the best of senses and the world will be a better place when Ali writes another.P.S. If you liked The IHOP Papers you owe it to yourself to read Ali Liebegott's The Beautifully Worthless, which is equally satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"If books came with a guarantee, I'd get my money back on this one. And I had really looked forward to reading it. I found it profound in many ways, but I totally couldn't relate to the angst or the characters.It was a chore for me to finish it. I realize it has won an award and it IS well written, but the main character was just too quirky and needy for me to relate to her. I'm glad some readers were able to laugh out loud, I felt sad in many ways, at the self-destructiveness, the isolation , the loneliness of the main character.

For curious Pats fans, this is a treat. It is very detailed thougH - surely to the point of boredom if you are not a Patriots fan.If you find yourself wondering why the Patriots let certain player leave, why they pass up on others in the draft, or why they have been so successful in a league that promotes \\"parity\\" at every turn... you will enjoy this inside account of how things work in a well-run football organization."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly written, shallow book on the Patriots","review":"I have very little in the way of positive feedback on this book. I would say that there are a few insights here and there that are interesting.Otherwise, this book was subpar in every fashion. The writing was very, very poor. It was simple, contained some errors, and was frequently very confusing. The writer jumps back and forth in time and leaves out critical details that constantly distract. About 1/5 of the book is comprised of very dull descriptions of a few football games. Another 1/5 of the book is repeating many of the same things about Belichick that we already knew.The only people I can see enjoying this book are people who either know very little about football, or fans of the Patriots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Depth and Lack of Structure","review":"As a longtime Patriots fan living outside of New England, I was hoping that this book would provide me with inside information that I was missing out on without the local media focus. It was inspiring reliving the first Super Bowl victory over St. Louis, but overall it was dissapointing. There were a lot of interesting specific antecdotes (most notably the Tom Jackson exchange), but nothing that really surprised me and no real in-depth analysis of their winning ways.The structure and grammar of the book are also quite poor. Although the book was short, it was not that easy to read as I had to continuously re-read passages to understand who the author was talking about or when the event was occuring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome behind the scenes book","review":"I thought Michael Holley's description of a team that had so many losing and dysfuncitonal seasons, to becoming the model NFL franchise, was truly terrific. It is a great easy to read book for those who don't read much and it provides a lot of behind the scenes stuff that you wouldn't find in any other analysis of how the team functions.It shows how everything in a franchise needs to be in order to have sucess; from a smart owner who knows that the key to success is communication with the coach, to the genius coach and his assistants who come up with mastermind schemes and motivational techniques, to the exceptionally intelligent players who may not be superstars but are supremely good 'football players', even down to the scouts and the combnines.This is a must read for any Patriots fan and any football fan for that matter. Awesome book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two years and this is it?","review":"Writer spends two years with the team yet offers about as much \\"inside\\" information as a guy who sells cars down the street at Rodmans.

Lazy writing, factual errors, you name it.Where's Michael Lewis - Moneyball when you need him? THERE was a book that was so in depth, so appealingly detailed it ATTRACTED the masses. Holley was a lazy hack with the Globe, he's a lazy hack here, and he's now a lazy hack on the radio.Somebody petition his editors for his notes so maybe we can learn some information we don't know besides Charlie Weis saying Patrick Pass can't play.

(Isn't it possible to give this book no stars?) I have never reviewed a book on Amazon, but this was so bad, I felt compelled to write.The author took a year or two off from his regular duties and this is all he could come up with? This is nothing more than another fan parading as a \\"journalist\\" who simply fawns over his subjects, providing no interesting insights, unless you consider the lightning bolt about Belichick ordering a shrimp cocktail and eating the whole thing interesting.In fact, it's written so simplistically that you would think it was written for kids if not for the constant direct quote of profanities which really serves no purpose at all.I'm sure the author scored a lot of points with Belichick but sure didn't deliver much for the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hyperbole Than Substance","review":"In purchasing Patriot Reign, I was hoping for a thoughtful insight into modern-day, post salary-cap NFL, a la Moneyball. All in all I found the book to lack in insight. The book provided more of a description of, rather than my sought after Belicheckian rationalizations for, the ingenious roster moves and overall management of the Patriots.Further, Patriot Reign was directed at a mass market audience, both in its writing style and its editing; the book jumped from thought to thought, and lacked Holley's regularly-displayed cogent thought process prominent in the author's Dale and Holley sports radio show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Perspective","review":"This was a fun book to read if you are intrigued with the inner workings of professional football. It was gratifying to see how everyone from ownership to coaches and players learned and corrected past mistakes. This book also brought to light some common misassumptions the average fan has for pro football. For example, it was funny to read Belichick's perspective of half time adjustments and how the organization looks at the combine and prepares for the draft. If you really like pro football, you'll really like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what you need to firm up quick!","review":"I love this video. I purchased it a few years ago and still use it on a regular basis. Its a 1 hour long workout thats divided into three 20 minute circuits. Exercises are simple. Eact set of exercises follows a stopclock on screen. I think its more effective than counting reps. Jake motivates you all the way. You have one piece of equipment (a bar - but a broomstick works just as well) and you have the option of adding weights for extra resistance. Buttocks ,hips, quads, hamstrings , inner thighs - everything is worked.Cardio in this video is low intensity. (I use this video as a follow up to a good cardio workout beforehand). The setting is pleasant, but the music can get a bit annoying.

It does not respect the child for who they are, who God created them to be, and for them to fulfill their God given destiny (Psalm 139). This sets them up to despise authority and eventually cut them off from God.

The American title seems to place too much emphasis on the murder, whereas the British title suggests that it is the overall situation that should be examined.I have to agree that this is not the book for the rank newcomer to the Hill/Lloyd saga but for those of us who have been following the ups and downs of DCI Hill and Lloyd and Their bedeviled police force, this is a good read.While the mystery is not all that impenetrable, the characters are well drawn-- I always find myself jolted by the realization that the British aren't Americans with funny accents-- and the plot, while ultimately relying on concidence, turns on the issues raised by the above mentioned births, deaths and marriages.Easy to pick up, hard to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has never been a help for my nursing needs on the job","review":"This was a poor purchase. As a nurse getting back into the field, I required a handy pocket-sized book to carry with me to have lab values and other valuable handy information at a moment's notice. This was not the help I looked to receive. The labs, nothing highly unusual, were not available here. Any other information presented was not worth a purchase price plus shipping. The cheaply bound spiral paper tore from the binding immediately.

They attempt to do skits, that are not funny. It's dryer than British humor, yet there is no humor. The worst part of this is that the video quality is very very poor.

It not only allows you to log numerical data, but subjective data as well. It also contains a fill-in linear graph for weekly mileage, race results entries, a pace chart, and basic training information. I love the color and black and white photographs of runners inside. It's a very well thought out design as far as log books go, and the most highly-evolved. I don't look for any other runner's log book but this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"RunLog is only 24 weeks long","review":"I just thought I would warn others that are like me.

Outwardly this series is perhaps like so many sci-fi animes that have come before; however, it keeps its audience entertained with just enough promise of potential and diverse story elements to satisfy.While this series does not hold up to the likes of Last Exile or RahXephon in terms of breathtaking visual quality, it does have an interesting and solid set of design and animation values.Judging from the low price and decent story, I would offer that Geisters is a fairly good series to get into, especially if you are just starting to get into anime.After reading about the series in Wizard, I pleasantly discovered that it happens to be among the first examples of Korean anime to arrive in North American markets.

Unfortunately, the author was sloppy with facts. Specifically, the book states \\"Thomas Edison invented electricity in 1879\\". Aside from the fact that electricity is a natural phenomenon studied by Ben Franklin and many others a century earlier, the author does not correctly note that Edison invented the electric LIGHT bulb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate and overly brief","review":"This book is filled with inaccurate or misleading information. In the first 3 chapters alone I have found over 11 errors. It is clear that the author is not an expert on this subject and that the book was not edited or proofread by someone knowledgeable in the area of security. Additionally, the information given is anemic. Sometimes giving only a few sentences to important topics and failing to make points regarding information on the exam.I find it hard to believe that the author passed the CISSP test, and if she did, then that might speak to the reputation of the certification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exam Cram? Don't you believe it ...","review":"CISSP exam cram? Not by a mile. I was very disappointed at how it glossed over most topics and how simple the practice questions are in comparison with those on the exam. The book is a decent intro to ISS (the only reason I gave it two stars) but doesn't come close to preparing you for the exam. The sad thing is that it gives the reader a false sense of preparedness. Don't think that by correctly answering all of the practice exam questions you're ready for the real thing.

That link is dead and her site does not offer additional information.I gave this a one star due to the errors, the insults to a person's intelligence in the practice tests and poor coverage (even at an ExamCram level) of essential material. This person has cobbled together much freely available information to make a buck.As for actual CISSP study, the other mentioned books are not perfect either but are a better source of information.

As a study tool, this book is a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Limited and Basic","review":"I found the \\"Exam Cram\\" books work great for one hour tests (such as the CompTIA ones), but the CISSP exam covers so much material in so much detail, something this limited is not of much help in studying. I used this as my first study guide for the exam, and was able to breeze through it in a couple hours and score a 49/50 on the practice test at the end of the book (well technically 48/50, but there's an obvious error in the answer key!). The sample questions from other books and websites were much more detailed and tricky, and you'll need plenty of time reviewing those in order to have a shot at passing the exam. While I did find this well organized, nicely written, and technically correct, it ultimately is not worth the time spent reading. I found Mike Meyer's CISSP Passport offered a much better level of detail, and proved much more helpful in my studying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I purchased this book with 2 other CISSP books.

So much so that they add nothing and provide no measure of your preparedness, which is supposed to be the whole point of practice questions.

Seeking to heedlessly gratify your desires or impulses of the moment to do things (or fail to do things) your conscience knows to be contrary to your standards of right, worthy and virtuous behavior is, in a mental, emotional and spiritual sense, akin to spending capital that you have not earned, and therefore will eventually cause you to feel very negatively not just about your behavior but also about who and what you are (except, perhaps, for sociopaths).

Amazing photographic record of formation flying, landings and takeoffs from the aircraft carrier Enterprise and land bases. Coupled with a very stirring, enthusiastic musical score by Max Steiner makes this movie tops! Also scenes of how San Diego looked in 1941, including some well-known landmarks (like the Del Coronado Hotel). Plot is moderately OK, but the photography alone makes buying this movie very worthwhile. A must for aviation history enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII IN TECHNICOLOR","review":"DIVE BOMBER is one of the many films of the early forties which glorified the service branches: here we have Technicolor, big-budget treatment - and the full cooperation of the Naval Air Corps. This movie constantly waivers. There was an interesting, rather detailed examination of the new techniques in estimating a flyer's fitness, in solving the problems of \\"blacking out\\" when a pilot pulls out of a power dive, and in overcoming the hazards of stratospheric flying. Truly breathtaking formation flying, enhanced furthur by smogless Technicolor, was used in abundance. This dramatic and topical material was contrasted with flat story development in combination with artless \\"romantic interest\\". A good deal of the film was photographed at the Naval Air Station in San Diego and in the air amid billowing California clouds. Additonal material was filmed at Pensacola Naval Air Station and aboard the aircraft carrier ENTERPRISE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical Naval Aviation at its Nostalgic Best","review":"This part of aviation history directed by Mitchel Curtiz, is a must for the mid-thirties aviation buff. The airplanes and the formation flying over North Island Naval Air Station are a tribute to Naval Aviation, and will bring back many lost memories. Unfortunately, the serious nature of the story, high altitude flying problems, is overshadowed by the comedic design of the equipment being flight tested to solve the problem. Be that as it may, it is still a great movie. Fred McMurray, Errol Flynn, Alexis Smith (the love interest) and Ralph Bellamy give their usual great entertaining performances. To me it was a 133 minute movie that took an hour to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dive Bomber","review":"A true aviation buff's film! Not a war film, but a pre-war film about the approaching conflict the US would soon find itself in and the problems aviation medicine faced in it's attempts to keep the American pilot number 1 in the skies. The flying sequences are beautifully handled with only minor model work (during the two crash scenes) and the film appeared well researched (though the Navy did not use the high pressure suit during the war). Like the mini-documentary hosted by Robert Osborne says on the DVD, \\"What's not to like?\\" It's got Errol Flynn, Fred MacMurray, Ralph Bellamy, the rousing score by Max Steiner and the aircraft of US Naval Aviation in all those colorful pre-war paint jobs in vivid Technicolor!

An autobiography was a no-brainer, but an audio book of Evans narrating his autobiography -- that's just a stroke of genius.Evans tells the stories of his many ups and downs during his tenure at Paramount Pictures, and beyond. Some of the stories are funny, some are sad, but all of them are pure Evans. Sure, he's completely self-absorbed, and you're only going to get his side of the story (the truth, right?), but it wouldn't be nearly as entertaining any other way.His voice, while mildly terrifying, matches the mix of factual and anecdotal information. He speaks in a steady, level and clear recitation, then moves to a more rapid, conversational and enthusiastic expression. This change in tempo keeps the listener both absorbed and informed.As far as audio books are concerned, \\"The Kid Stays in the Picture\\" is the king. Robert Evans wouldn't have it any other way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unable to put it down","review":"Loved the book. Very insightful, thought provoking as well as entertaining.

Its protrayal of Ho Chi Minh is a gross caricature, its description of contemporary Viet Nam could only have been written by someone with no curiosity and no sense of ambiguity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughtful argument for both sides to consider","review":"Michael Lind, iconoclast in many fields, has written a fascinating book about the causes of the Vietnam War. Specifically, he asks why the war was fought and whether it was necessary. Although many of his specifics are questionable, his overriding thesis--that the war was an integral and necessary part of the Cold War, much like the Korean War--is difficult to question. While those who question the value of the Cold War as a whole may not be convinced, anyone trying to maintain that Vietnam is \\"different\\" from other foreign interventions needs to read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Needed Perspective","review":"This a much needed and well-done analysis of the Vietnam conflict. It puts the conflict in a global perspective that, at the time, most did not understand or appreciate. What is most interesting is Lind's analysis of the Russian influence on the politics of Ho Chi Minh and the North's conduct of the war. As one who was there, I can attest to the Russian influence. For example, once when we overran a newly arrived North Vietnamese unit we recovered a number of their backpacks. All had indentical items in them--items from Russia, Czechslovkia and other Eastern Bloc countries. This was not a civil war nor were the North Vietnamese supported solely or chiefly by the Chinese. I think Lind has gotten it right in many respects. This is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visionary? Fresh?

Not being a reader of Mr. Lind's magazine, I'm just not with it, I guess. At any rate, according to Lind, it (the Viet War, and apparently most or all of the others in this century) was (still) all the commies' fault, and they (and anybody else who might think of challenging US hegemony) better look out, 'cause we are- or should be--- ready to nail them good in the next quagmire!

While Styron's \\"Darknesss Visible\\" and Cronkites's \\"On the Edge of Darkness\\" offer the comfort of knowing others share your experience of depression, the quest remains, how to heal the darkness. Grossman's book offers an answer. Read the simple elegant language and the idea that healing is possible begins to take hold. The anger, fear and anxiety that is a part of every person's life, and which indelibly marks depression, is expressed in such a way that acknowledgement, understanding and forgiveness follow almost seamlessly. Love supplants fear. Healing begins and love takes hold. This is unique. Kay Redfield Jamison touched on the healing power of love in her memoir \\"An Unquiet Mind\\". \\"To Be Healed By The Earth\\" shows us how to begin. Read this book, share it. It is special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmo's the greatest!","review":"I'm an adult having seen the movie and immediately bought the soundtrack.

As a shape sorter, I'm not pleased with this toy. The lid easily comes off, making it very hard to actually put a shape in any side other than the top. It's also difficult to fit the shapes into its designated hole. When my daughter does play with this (she's 1 1/2 now) she usually just plays with the box. Also, the wood is coated with a shiny substance, which makes me nervous if she starts chewing on the pieces. I wouldn't recommend this toy. Personally, I think the best shape sorter toy is the classic red and blue one made by Tupperware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sturdy but lid comes of too easy","review":"Very sturdy toy.

It looks like someone printed this overpriced, worthless image (I refuse to call it a poster) on a home printer. I had to cut away the excess white border which just makes it look that much more gaudy. The image isn't even centered squarely on the paper and their is little luster like the photo suggests.

This book may have captured the surroundings but the people dont seem real. As a 20-year veteran of law enforcement I was expecting a good mystery. What I read was a story where there was too little mystery and far too much detail. It reads like a police report. Short choppy sentences and no mundane details left out. Who wants to read about every time he feeds his dog and a description of every meal he eats? One of the characters is kidnapped and held captive but there is never a motivation for the suspects' actions. Police reports contain facts but not feelings, emotions, opinions or conclusions.

I also learned much more about my wife than she had never revealed. When I asked her about some of the things that other wives had spoken of in this book she admitted that some of those things had been on her mind for a while but she didn't know how to talk to me about them without hurting my feelings or making me angry. Thank you Mr. Cronin for helping me. If you are a husband, get this and skim through it. Don't tell your wife you have it and try some of the ideas and see what she says about the new you.

From songwriting to arrangements. Especially the songwriting. OK, and the arrangements. Blech.

Stand out tracks include covers of Dirty Water, Talk Talk and Some Kind of Wonderful (all three better than the originals). Their songwriting is not bad, either, with influences as diverse as Sun Records, the Everly Brothers (minus the harmonies) and the Stones.

Unfortunately, Shlain gets it wrong. His Physics is so often incorrect, especially concerning Relativity and Quantum Mechanics, that his entire line of reasoning falls apart. And as for his claim that artists lead the vision of discovery (for example, it was artists who envisioned the concepts of Relativity such as in \\"Nude Descending a Staircase\\"), he neglects the fact that Science is more methodical than Art. While a new style of painting is created and justified the first time an artist makes a piece, a new theory of physics is developed over a lifetime and must be rigorously justified. The questions and thoughts that gave rise to Relativity were created long before (it goes back to Galileo) the Cubist style of painting was invented."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art and Physics: Parallel visions in Space, Time and Light","review":"A good book to read before GEB (Goedel-Escher-Bach: An eternal golden braid)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy Thinking","review":"I was hoping this book would be at the level of Louis Menand's \\"The Metaphysical Club.\\" It's not. The core ideas grab the reader, but the writing is fuzzy and sometimes plain wrong.

Shlain claims that \\"only in the most mature languages... does a separate word for the color blue make an appearance...\\" Possibly technically correct, but conceptually wrong. \\"Indigo\\" has been around since at least Herodotus (450 BC.)

This is by far the worst of the bunch.Shlain consistently miss-represents the facts and draws farcical comparisons that remind me of the kind of thinking that astrologers are prone to. This book goes down with the \\"bible code\\" and those interpretations of ancient predictions that only ever get deciphered after the thing that they are prediction happens.I wanted to finish it before writing a review but this would have been a waste of my time.\\"Art & Physics\\" gives the art-science crossover a bad name and should be taken out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Topic, Poor Product","review":"I loved the idea of the book so much I couldn't wait to get it home from the bookstore. But like other reviewers the treatment of physics and art quickly eroded my esteem for the book.But what frustrated me the most was how any and every theme in art that Shlain happens across can do nothing but prove his thesis: An artist paints something completely still and it represents time near the speed of light, another something that moves and it represents something else at the speed of light, an artist paints elongated forms and the same thing, shortened forms and you get length contraction.In short, there isn't anything artists COULD HAVE painted that Shlain couldn't have somehow connected to relativity of quantum theory.The book remains curiously novel, and it earns it's one star if only because I like it when people explain art to me so I can understand it.

I just say this CD is simply amazing, from the first to the last song!Knowing he's written the whole thing and produced it too just amazes me and puts Ryan right on top of my favorites.Seeing his passion for music when he sings live makes me feel so good, and also the passion into his lyrics is great!!A MUST BUY CD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ryan Cabrera - You Stand Watching","review":"I am a huge Ryan fan. I thought his first album was pretty good considering it was his own music and lyrics. This album honestly is not good at all. I have met him and seen him play live. He puts on a decent show. But someone needs to remind him that he is not 13 anymore and he needs to step it up in his lyrics a bit. I'm sick of \\"Baby, it's you. When I look up in the sky...\\" or \\"We can dance, with true romance...\\" I rhymed when I was 10 years old...come on Ryan. Break away from your labels antics to appeal to the younger croud only.

Hm, pretty damn good. I like this CD, and I was especially impressed by the sound of each song--very different from the previous CD. I actually will go as far as to say that this album may even be a little better than the last. Yep, I SAID IT. I like \\"Hit Me With Your Light\\" and \\"Fall Baby Fall\\" because they remind me of some of my favorites off the other album, only they're more edgy and more Ryan Cabrera. Go out and buy this album; you're sure to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan \\"Shines On\\" Again!!","review":"You Stand Watching by Ryan Cabrera is an AMAZING album! I have been a huge fan of Ryan's since his debut on the Ashlee Simpson Show. His first cd was really awesome as well, but this new album blows me away.My favorite songs on the album are \\"Fall Baby Fall\\", \\"Last Night\\" and of course the very beautiful ballad called \\"It's You\\" which is just Ryan's gorgeous voice accompanied by a violin and a piano. The song \\"It's You\\" sounds like it was written for Ashlee Simpson, which is even cuter.This album definatley has more slower songs than fast up beat songs, which i love. It truley shows Ryan's talent as a singer, and his talent as a song writer.This album is a must have for any Ryan Cabrera fan, and everyone who is interested in him, it's a beautifully crafted album and one that i can't stop listening too. I have been listening to it non stop on my iPod since it came out on September 20.Buy a copy, you won't be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryan Cabrera Rocks!","review":"I was a fan of Ryan's first album and was anxious to listen to his second. After buying the second, I was definitely not disappointed! This CD is even better! A lot of the songs on this CD are a little less pop sounding, but have great lyrics and music. Although I love all the songs, some of my favorites are Shine On, Photo, Fall Baby Fall, and Last Night. These songs have lyrics that really have great meaning behind them. If you're thinking about buying this CD, you definitely should pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Impressed","review":"I was really excited when I heard Ryan was coming out with a new CD. I fell in love with his debut. I thought every single song was amazing. So I got You Stand Watching.....this cd is really not worth the money. The only songs worth mentioning are \\"Shine On\\", \\"Photo\\" and \\"Fall Baby Fall\\". The others are very boring and you will find yourself skipping over them after 30 seconds. Ryan proved with his debut he could sing and make very entertaining music. Why he failed to do it this time around is beyond my reasoning."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Stand Watching Rocks!","review":"You Stand Watching is the best cd. its amazing that ryan wrote all the songs on it and the songs are awesome.

Next was Take It All Away, which was so moving and wonderful. Now Ryan has blown me away with You Stand Watching. Some of the deepest lyrics from him yet. One of his slow songs,\\"It's you\\" is so moving and beautiful. Then you can listen to upbeat tunes like \\"Shine On\\", \\"Hit me with your light\\",\\"Last Night\\" and \\"There From the Start\\". He's given us beautiful slow songs beside of \\"It's You\\" such as \\"Fall Baby Fall\\", \\"Photo\\" and \\"Walking On Water\\". If you enjoy listening to true talent, the go out and buy Ryan's new cd!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow and Sweet","review":"Cabrera's voice has matured, and sounds a lot better than on his first album, but this one is almost all slow songs.

Numerous factual errors, poor research and over-the-top psychological profiling are thrown together with minimal organization to prove a point that's never quite defined. Pity, could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull book by a writer who didn't get it.","review":"Brock Yates did some reading about Harley-Davidson motorcycles, collected some pictures, and wrote a book. The resulting book is dull because Yates doesn't understand motorcycles. He tries to hide his lack of understanding of the subject and appear scholarly by using obscure words. (hagiography - look it up Brock!) I'm glad I got the book from the library. I'd be mad if I had bought the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it for a ride","review":"Brock Yates provides a compelling overview of the Harley-Davidson history, and interesting thoughts on what Harley means to America. In some cases his philsophical pronouncements exceed his grasp, and in a few spots he becomes repetitive. Still, as a Harley owner, I greatly enjoyed the book. It does not get mired in tech specs, nor in meaningless detail of the Davidson family lineage. It is definitely not a hagiography -- he strikes the balance between pointing out flaws and giving credit where due. Others here say he stumbled on some history, but I value his writing that quickly moved me from cover to cover. It hits the high spots, and entertainingly tells me more about the Harley company and history than I knew before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another author cashing in on us","review":"I would have thought that someone with the credentials of Mr. Yates would have done better. Instead, he serves up a book that is full of errors that should have been corrected with entry-level research. When something as basic as the correct year for the 50th anniversary of Sturgis is mis-stated, the complete lack of any interest in factual information is evident. I would dare say that Mr. Yates would never tolerate repeated mis-statements of fact without researching the subject in his magazine. He should be ashamed of this. Unfortunately, what he have is just another author whipping up a book without regard to content in the sole search for profit. Please don't waste your money as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating writer spinning a great yarn.","review":"I've read most of Brock's books and have enjoyed them immensely. Here he takes the reader on a historical tour of a timeless marque. He does it with his usual style, good humor and enlightened cynicism. He stands not in awe of the \\"Milwaukee monsters\\", but is a chronicler who dares to point out the pluses and minuses of a machine whose very existence is a minor miracle. They aren't high tech, can't compare in quality or performance with their Japanese competitors but enjoy a cache rarely afforded a product that falls short in so many areas.But Yates finds a way to explain this phenomena. He calls a spade a spade, but in doing so penetrates the veil of intense loyalty exhibited by the Harley Davidson trifosi. I own six Harleys and love them all! This is a fun book and a great read. Yates has another winner that deserves to be in the library of any Harley lover.

Secondly, we tried a wide variety of cars and it was pretty rare to get any of them to drop down and land correctly. I couldn't get any of them to launch from the boat.

He probably has way over 300 cars and we haven't been able to find one yet that works with it. I know it says \\"not for use with some cars\\", but that is ridiculous. So now my son has a toy that doesn't work, but that he won't let me return because he's convinced that someday he will find a car that works.

I ended up going at them with my drummel tool and widening and squaring the openings so that the legs would at least sink into them. Even after all that I'm glad that it's up against a wall.

After a few seconds there's no way of confusing Cheyenne Coate's irresistable, snotty attitude for Crystal Water's positive vibe. This song and all three remixes on this CD are guaranteed to set bums skaking around the planet. Bonus points for the video portion featuring Cheyenne's fabulous blue faux-fur outfit and the bathroom stall choreography.

The extras and London show are nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Zakk Wylde videos to date","review":"Many other reviews are already pretty sufficient, but I do need to add my bits:This video is better than the earlier videos - it focuses more on the music and the stage experience. Zakk's a great guy, and you don't see quite as much focus on Beer in Doom Troopin' Live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vocal Hernia","review":"Zakk pushed his voice beyond its limits on Mafia, and on this tour. Its really hard to take, and I'm glad he returned to his regular smokey voice on Shot To Hell.BLS are a great group, but Zakk's persistent use of this higher strained vocal technique scuttles Blessed Hellride songs that were sung in regular pitch on the CDs. Stoned and Drunk and Funeral Bell are critically altered to the point where I had to skip them.I'm actually starting to suspect that Zakk was using a vocal harmonizer tuned up an octave to achieve this effect, because I can't imagine how his vocal chords could withstand a tour sung this way.A few tunes sung this way I can handle, buts its total overkill on this DVD.The behind the scenes extras are enjoyable because Zakk is a funny guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLS in Widescreen and DTS!","review":"Outstanding video and sound quality on this release. BLS in widescreen and DTS is incredible. The Paris show is phenomenal and the acoustic jam solo is some of the best playing EVER seen from Zakk.

Everyone over the age of 40 should read and become educated about HGH--an amazing natural breakthrough for reversing the effects of aging. We can stop many of the ravishing and debilitating effects of old age. I am 48 years old and use HGH. Day by day and spray by spray I feel more energized and vitalized. It is now obvious to me that if your hormones are out of balance your body is not able to repair and regulate itself. Hormone production is very interactive so it can effect the whole mechanism. I highly recommend the human growth hormone for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great coming of age story.","review":"I first read this book about 20 years ago.

It does contain a couple hunting sequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book looked hilarious, but one mustn't judge a book by its cover","review":"The illustrations were great, and I found that the one page of text was addictive (the author originally published these in their newspaper column) but apart from one or two vignettes, it didn't have the \\"laugh out loud\\" factor that I thought I was promised by the cover.

A country full of lovely people...with the depressing, lethal trait of wanting to feel socially superior to someone else. Enter this book of 200-word character portraits of such archetypes as the Politically Correct Vicar (pastor) or the Uninvited Weekend Guest, collected from the pages of the Telegraph newspaper.You have to ask yourself, what is the point? Who would read this, and why? I think the answer is, people who want to feel part of a superior social group but are not. You can be sure that the real toffs feel no need to read this drivel, and the Telegraph is rarely read by what one would call 'blue-collar' workers, so that leaves a swathe of middle-class people who think that by snickering at these portraits they are somehow superior. OK, so I know it's a little bit of fun, but it just utterly depressed me.I'm awarding this book two stars solely because of the excellent illustrations, by Sue Macartney-Snape. Otherwise, drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relieves working mothers' guilt by bashing SAHMs","review":"This writer referrred to a mother at home with her baby as the worst child-rearing scenario possible, and that these mothers neglect their children. We can't be fulfilled at home, and no one can take care of children like minimum wage daycare workers. Life is all about me, me, me, me, me, not my child. That argument resembles the justification of the husband who cheats on his wife, or the drug addict; it's what they need to feel fulfilled.What a joke for this woman to justify her own neglect of her children by accusing those of us who willingly sacrifice so much to take responsibility for the children we bring into this world. My children may not love me more or have a distant respect for me, but that's not what it's about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes good points but has an agenda","review":"I loved the concept of this book and had such hopes for it. However, the author's whole point is this: men should share equally in all the parenting duties (what a brilliant idea that no woman ever thought of before!), and corporations need to accommodate working moms and be genuinely flexible about it (another fabulously original notion), and no woman should ever be a stay-at-home mom because of all the things it deprives her of and deprives her child of a lot of things to (excuse me? what about personal choice? just because I plan to continue to work in an office doesn't mean I'm going to tell other women what to do). She makes these points in the first two chapters, which otherwise make some pretty good points except for the obvious agenda. After that it becomes kind of a storybook about all of her friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Common-sense thinking about juggling parenthood and life","review":"While this book was written for a primarily American audience, it still made alot of good sense for me as a New Zealand mother-to-be. What she proposes is really very simple - moving away from the overparenting trap, including our children as part of our lives as women rather than our whole reason for being, allowing the parenting to extend beyond just the nuclear family and most importantly of all, elevating the role of the father as parent. Made sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking book","review":"I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would. I originally bought it for a sociology class I was taking.

Berke, the stand-up comedian who directed the film, sharply parodies not only Jeremy's image but the psychology of the typical male porn viewer. The results are outrageous and sometimes insightful, and Jeremy's willingness to play along with the joke makes for some infectious fun. Like Malkovich in the Spike Jonze film, Jeremy is making fun not of himself but of the public's perception of him, and aided by the sharp writing he gives a genuinely winning performance. Andy Dick adds comic support in some of the movie's funniest scenes, and Berke's self-deprecating style marks him as a sort of X-rated Woody Allen. A very satisfying piece of entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"I gave this book this rating because I think that it is boring.

If you must buy this album, go ahead, no one ever came up short listening to Frank Morgan.

There are a slight few reasons to use CS over 10 but for those few features you have to deal with the program crashing about 3-5 times a day (and note I work in Illustrator from 9-5). And if that wasn't bad enough most of the time it crashed it while you're trying to save as if to make you as mad as possible. Also you can't save for previous versions which is a serious flaw considering not everyone is dumb enough to shell out the $500 for the CS.I'm glad that I got to try this out at work where I didn't pay for it and that I still have my Illustrator 10 at home.I hope Adobe clues in to everyone writing bad reviews and decides to actually check their program before releasing it.

All other illustrating programs, including Jasc's Paint Shop Pro, are only great if you're looking for a computer toy.Adobe Illustrator does take some learning though.

Unfortunately, when it did arrive I sure wished I could get a refund.No doubt this material is of interest to scholars. But anyone just looking for something enjoyable to listen to is in for a disappointment.I have listened to plenty of old recordings but the sound quality on this is by far the worst I have ever heard, bar none. You really can't enjoy the music. The quality is so poor that one track of a particular genre doesn't register as any different from another.

When you talk about Newsradio, people remember it, but they don't remember watching it. The series was cancelled after Phil Hartman died and Jon Lovitz stepped in.The series was great and had it's moments, but this DVD package is utterly horrible. This is a review of the DVD, not just the show, which is why I had to give it such a low rating. This is a product review and the packaging for this product stinks.The dvd case is the type of plastic the halloween masks are made out of and the dvd are piled ontop of one another like a blank DVD case pack. Prone to easy scratches and difficult to get to the certain disc you want.

I buy a lot of DVDs, some of which sit on the shelf a very long time before; but not this - I've been watching an episode of two most nights since it arrived. An exemplar of how an office sitcom is supposed to work.Great special features, but the worst box in the history of box sets.

And boy, was I astounded by how terrible the quality was. The loading time is absolutely terrible, this show has been buffering for over half an hour but still won't play. I'm getting a \\"very poor signal\\" despite having a strong WiFi connection that readily loads other videos while this one slogs along and intermittently freezes. One would think that the Amazon version of the video would be of superior quality than that of a pirated version on Megavideo, but clearly that is not the case.

It's enjoyable to see how Top Chef has developed since the first season. The first couple of episodes are a little slow, but the show definitely gets better as it goes along, and the final five or six chefs could stand up against the chefs from any of the other seasons. Although it has its moments, Season 1 is less focused on personality conflicts than Season 2. I'd recommend it to any Top Chef fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"top chef season 1","review":"I haven't even seen this I don't know where it is and I don't know how to watch it even if I could find it.

The designs are incredible. There are projects for all levels, ie. the Sequin covered bag is perfect for the beginner while the Stained Glass or Japanese Bags are ideal for those wanting more challenge. Her technique explanations are so clearly written, you'll be able to pick up your needle and start right away. I liked most of the colours used for the bags, but you can use what you like. There's a lot of work involved to complete a project, but the results are stunning. In my opinion, the only thing lacking was a Supplier List at the back of the book, specifically for purse frames which can be tricky to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Uninspiring Product with limited information","review":"I totally disliked this book...if you want to make craft show type stuff then perhaps this is a good choice but I came looking for info on how to make high fashion high quality beaded handbags likened to some of todays top designers and thisbag did not even stracth the surface of what I needed.

My daughter's preschool teacher loaned me her copy, and I had to buy one for myself. What a different world this would be if every parent read it. It is full of practical wisdom and ideas for raising children to be kind and loving individuals. I loved the personal way in which it was written. It came across as very warm and personal rather than preachy or like a textbook. This book really is a Must Read if you have young children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limited to picture books","review":"Potential buyers should note that this guide largely sticks to picture books and doesn't talk about novels, despite the general title. The print is difficult to read--it is in green ink, for some reason, with whole sections where the typeface is small and faint.While I would recommend the Chinaberry catalog, this book just isn't as good. The organization is confusing and the book recommendations alternate with general advice on parenting.

And not being good enough to create his own characters, he's taken otherwise wholesome (and PUBLIC DOMAIN) characters from classic literature and warped and perverted these characters into violent, disgusting anti-heroes.It's almost like Moore has an adgenda here: take popular characters from classics and find a way to soil them in a violent, disinteresting (and ultimately forgettable) book. The art is fairly bad too."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good if not better than the first series","review":"Moore does it again, let's hope he keeps writing more of the adventures of The League. This series was a bit darker than the first but the mood fit the story well. If you're into comics at all do yourself a favor and read this. Pick up the first series also, it's not neccesary in order to follow the second series but you'll be missing a great read if you don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well crafted but not as good as the original","review":"A great read and well worth the money but not as good as the original"},{"rating":"2","title":"Macabre, Lewd, and Lovely!","review":"Half the book is a comic, and a rather morbid and ribald sense of humor pervades that half. The other half is a travel guide to the world of the League, where everything fantastic you've ever read about is true. The adds in the back that finish it off are bawdy. All in all, it's a great second story.My only whinge is that the characters, so strong and stalwart in the forst book, are not necessarily so in the second book. They express shock and horror rather more than less. I'd wish WM a bit more of the strong leader and less the whimpering maiden she sometimes comes off as in this one.At any rate, this is a great second comic in a series made for adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but not as good as the first volume.","review":"I really liked the 1st volume, and while I thought this one wasn't as good, it was still great.

The characters aren't DOING enough and excpet for Hyde aren't even remotely clever or engaging. One of your characters is a super genius, one is a superb tactician.. have them at least TRY something more brilliant than blow up the bridge and wait."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Moore,","review":"Moore's LOEG series was a thrilling story about popular book heroes who come together as a team to defeat threats to London. They are brilliant pieces of work, bringing out the inner demons in all of the characters.The second volume is not quite as good as the first, but it takes much more time with showing the personalities of everyone. It is packed with some humor, some action, some horror, and of course, a vital component in every teamwork story, BETRAYAL. It is overall a great book.However, the second volume is much more intended for mature readers than the first, including horrible violence in some parts, some language (despite the stronger words being blanked out) and two very graphic sex scenes.Read Vol 1 first though. I would recommend both volumes to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Weak Kindle Version","review":"This is not a review for the work, which, being Alan Moore, I'm sure is excellent. But the Kindle interactivity is very poor. There are pop ups of individual panels, but they are barely any bigger than the full page view. You can't pinch-zoom in or out or move within the smallish versions that to pop out. Nor can you turn the Kindle for a wider landscape view. All of these perks are available in almost all digital comics these days, and they've been available in most graphic novels I've bought digitally. Here, I'm very unsatisfied and wish I had my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as solid as the First","review":"Unless you are a die-hard Moore fan, pick up volume 1 and leave #2 on the shelf.The two stars is for the consistent quality of the artwork and thats about it. I like Moore, but this story falls way short of the first LXG and tends to cover it's lack of plot with a pointless romance and ridiculous traitor sub-plot.The fact that it was released as a harccover with an over inflated pricetag doesn't help matters either.

The sound quality is not too good, but the music is wonderful. The overall tone is romantic, with songs that generally unfold in an unhurried pace. In addition to a string section, flute and piano make appearances. At times the instrumental accompaniment recedes into the background (or perhaps drops out completely) putting Fairouz's singing on full display.

Although every story has been published before, the effect of reading them all through at once (at about a story a day since its publication, I am about a fifth of the way through) is stunning. In 1972, Vladimir Nabokov said that the greatest short stories of the past fifty years were written in America and he cited Updike as among its most inspired practitioners. He said, \\"I like so many of Updike's stories that it was difficult to choose one for demonstration and even more difficult to settle on its most inspired bit\\". Nabokov and Updike share the distinction of being the greatest American writers of the last half-century not to win a Nobel prize and the list of winners is made poor by their absence. American fiction writing does not get any better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magnificent Skill Of John Updike","review":"It would have been all but impossible for most of us to have gathered even the majority of these stories together to read, spread out as they were through anthologies that spanned multiple decades, and that makes it all the more satisfying to linger over these gems from the mind of a man I really think is in the top five American writers of the twentieth-century. There are no bad stories collected here and more than a dozen I'd dub as deserving literary immortality for their capacity to represent the pulsebeat of an era for generations yet to come. A richly-composed, well-chosen anthology that is a great gift for John Updike to give his readers, and a true monument to his dedication to the short story art form. This book will help define the legacy of a man of letters, imagination, and spirit. Early Stories is simply a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"John Updike is an amazing author who has written too many classics to count, this brings you right back to his roots of short story writing. Perfect for any fan of Updikes or the english language in General."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dull by anyone's standards","review":"I only liked maybe two or three stories in this entire collection. The rest were pretty timid and uneventful, as though Updike were afraid of getting his hands dirty and immersing himself in the flesh and bone realities of life and narrative. This hesitation to actually \\"go for it\\" is a hallmark of all of Updike's fiction in my opinion, which leaves all of his stories devoid of what you might call narrative vitality, or realness. It is this distance between Updike and what he's writing about that leads the reader to believe that Updike is not writing a story but merely philosophizing about one. Updike's pompous abstractions inevitably deprive these stories of a vigour that they might otherwise have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Hot + Lisbon is the perfect summer album...","review":"Onda Sonora is a summer party record.

The music and lyrics are polished vignettes that evoke times, places, and feelings with poignancy and emotion. Kind of like Counting Crows; kind of like Dave Matthews, but very much their own sound, too. I was lucky enough to see this band (never having heard of them before) in a small venue. They played a tight, hearfelt set, and displayed real musicianship. They know their stuff, without question. Charismatic stage presence as well.

Singer/Songwriter Barry Privett gives us great lyrics and his vocals are well complimented by the rest of this talented group. The album brings on a wide range of emotions and from start to finish it delivers a fantastic ride! Carbon Leaf has the added bonus of sounding just as good live as they do on their albums. They put on a great show and I highly recommend seeing them perform if you get the chance.

I got \\"Echo Echo\\" and played it pretty much nonstop for a few months. \\"Indian Summer\\" is also an awesome album, and full of the things that make Carbon Leaf such a great band--awesome instrumentation, good lyrics, fantastic rhythms and melodies. I don't think it's quite as good as \\"Echo Echo\\", but it still deserves 5 stars for being better than 99% of what's on the radio.

I could not BELIEVE that there were no reviews on it yet! This book came to me at a time when I was feeling very alone and isolated, struggling with the physical, financial, emotional, and intellectual challenges we all face as a single mothers. It walked me not only through the lives of other mothers, but straight through their very hearts. It was there that I realized that I was not alone. That no matter what country we live in, what language we speak, or what nationality we are... we are all the same in our love for our children. Easy reading. Simple format. This book will ALWAYS be dear to my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me That Old Time Religion","review":"Dr. Prothero describes in significant detail how the Jesus of the current Evengelical emhasis is 200 years old - tops - in a religion which is now over 2000 years old.Interesting how this Protestant version of \\"a personal relationship with Jesus\\" has come to be revealed truth to thousands of Americans, who apparently don't know it is a relatively new invention for modern Mega Church devotees.As for me and my house, give me that old time religion and let the Evangelicials invent Jesus and church to suit themselves.-Richard Dunn"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prothero demonstrates the range of religious adaptation","review":"In his \\"American Jesus\\" Prothero reveals much about the American religious imagination and how the powerful figure of Jesus undergirds so much of American culture.

Finally a religion book that doesn't assume its readers are all religious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!!!","review":"This CD is much better than her later live ones such as Summer Tour. The use of two guitarists is a big reason, because although her husband Neil is a great guitarist and songwriter on his own, he cannot sound full enough by himself and ends up trying to do too much on those later albums. This album has some fantastic interplay between the two axemen, whoever they are (Neil being one of them, I assume). Pat's voice is a little bit tired, which is understandable, considering how much she puts into her singing. She has to go into her falsetto during Fire and Ice a bit, but that's really the only negative I can think of. The tracks they include in this concert are a fantastic selection, but it's mainly the clear production and fullness of the band that make it sound truly great. Awesome guitars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Track-at-once great concert","review":"I love the King Biscuit and Westwood One concerts that are available on CD, officially and unofficially. The recordings are clear and well-mixed but never overproduced. The back of the CD states that it was digitally remixed and remastered. On this CD there were no program announcer voice-overs. However, King Biscuit released it track-at-once, meaning that there is an annoying fade-out and fade-in between every song. Unacceptable. Just when you are really getting into it, there is another break -- 12 all together in this 13 song collection.Since I am a bootleg CD trader with experience in remastering concerts, I mixed a gapless (disc-at-once) edition for myself. That's how KB should have done it. However, boot traders do not trade official releases, so I am sorry I can't help everyone -- I'd like to."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"This is a horribly hard book to labor through in my opinion. It was required for a graduate level class in my M.S. Instructional Design and Technology class and it was horrible to read. It is boring, written terribly, and a labor to get through. I fell asleep over and over trying to get through it. There was little to no creativity applied to the transference of this information. It is not even very well organized.

I have an 8 year old and she is now beginning to read it (with a little help from me). To say the least, this was my favourite book as a youth. It's easy to place yourself in Anna's shoes and dream about what it would have been like to be in a similar plight.I cannot recommend this book enough for children (male or female) around age 10...especially American youth whose perspective can be opened beyond what most have experienced at this age. There's nothing to offend in the book though a few questions may come up. Other reviewers give you the plot...I will refrain from repeating.To my delight, I discovered that there are two sequels to the book written by Kerr: Small Person Far Away, The Other Way Round. Guess what two books are next on my reading list?"},{"rating":"2","title":"When Hitler stole Pink Rabbit","review":"\\"When Hitler stole Pink Rabbit\\" isn't a book I would normally find myself reading but once I got started I couldn't put it down.

Unlike Anne Frank, this little girl named Anna was one of the fortunate ones who was able to flee Hitler's Germany. Even those who were able to escape paid a price. I think the pink rabbit symbolizes a carefree childhood. Anna lost more than her rabbit as the reader realizes. This is a gentle treatment of a serious topic. It is written with insight and compassion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great autobiography","review":"As required reading for my homeschooler, this was an excellent way to share the impact of Nazi Germany by examining one little girls life.

I found it on eBay & was delighted to win.......that is, until I started sitting down to learn the songs only to quickly determine that the tabs are poorly written, in the wrong tuning, and even capoed at the wrong fret. Sting Me, for example is tabbed out with both guitar parts for one guitar. Remedy is supposed to be played in Open G, but the book tabs the song in standard E tuning. Thorn in my Pride is supposed to be capoed at the 4th fret, but the book scores the song with the capo at the 2nd fret. This book is going back on eBay! Better, more accurate tablature is available on the internet, and live performances on YouTube help to back up the tabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Little black [crowes] book","review":"I didn't really know that this was available commercially, and I still have my doubts if you can really get your hands on this unless otherwise recieved as a promo like I did.

It comprises of commentary from both Robinson brothers (though mostly from Chris) about topics of \\"SOuthern HArmony and Musical Companion\\" LP such as the Black Crowes,recording the album, touring, overnight success, and the brothers themselves. Also wraps up with mini transcription for nine of the original songs on the album. Good luck trying to locate via Amazon. Best bet is to check out record shops.

Each one gives a great show and to see them playing and singing together makes this a great \\"ticket\\" to a concert where you have front row seats. Willie Nelson comes on about half way through, but they all sing your favorites and do a wonderful job, plus they look like they do this all the time just for their own amusement. The interview gave a nice behind the scenes look at Willie's bus plus their takes on music together including some of their history.

It is rich in description and humor. The characters are given distinctive backgrounds and attributes to make us like them.

Then I saw him on Letterman singing \\"Burning Hell\\". The opening guitar riff intrigued me, the still powerful voice impressed me, and when he belted out the first \\"No\\" and then \\"Yeah-hey\\" I was hooked. The performance totally blew me away! Got the album the next day and have been listening to it ever since.Don't look for any slick production here. It's the TJ Voice and everything else is there to support, enhance and flavor it. And what a voice it is! At 70, the Voice is a fine musical instrument: crafted and aged to perfection, well-tuned, effective in both the quiet and loud passages, and played by a master.There are a few albums that one simply must have if you appreciate music.

The spare production enhances the tracks, Jones sounds fantastic and prepare to sit back and smile as you listen. Put aside any reservations based on his career as a 60's/70's lounge singer - Jones is a legend for a reason and infuses the up-tempo songs with a bit of spit and snarl lending it all the cred it needs. Slower songs are heartfelt and would make even a heathen think about his everlasting salvation. Stand out tracks are plentiful, but try 'Burning Hell' and 'Don't Knock.' If Tom Jones was a religion, I'd sign up. This record should be the next 'Raising Sand.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Mixture","review":"Like many of you, I truly dig Tom's voice immensely. I've DJ'd on FM and done quite a bit of club work through the decades and have an eclectic and broad taste in music. Tom's rendition on the Blues DVD from 2002 of Ketty Lester's \\"Love Letters\\" with Jeff Beck is simply top notch. Praise and Blame can't touch the latter. This sounds like a CD Tom Waits, Leon Russell or even Dr. John would have been better suited singing. The CD has a stellar lineup of musicians..it's not them. The production and music are sparse and lean with an ole time 50's gospel/r&b/blues feel which altogether work well but Tom's voice just isn't well suited for this sound. The blend for the most part (not all songs) just doesn't work. \\"Don't Knock\\", \\"Burning Hell\\", \\"Didn't It Rain\\", \\"Ain't No Grave\\" and \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" are the strongest contenders. I'm not suggesting Tom's voice doesn't shine, it's just the wrong mixture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad ass dirty blues...this ain't vegas Tom Jones","review":"This ain't \\"What's New Pussycat\\" or \\"Thunderball\\" era Tom Jones. This is an old man discovering what brung him to the game. Not unlike Johnny Cash's American recordings, this is an old cat slipping away from this mortal coil and paying homage to his \\"real\\" roots. Hell, he even does \\"Ain't No Grave\\" which Cash also recorded on American VI.Basically it's roadhouse rock meets tent-revival gospel. A little blues and a little rock and a whole lot of Americana roots. Back to basics. No strings, no horns, no orchestra arrangements, minimal production and a mess of geetar riffs and a bluesman's crooning. Yer mom and granny ain't gonna like this. \\"Burnin' Hell\\" is a great piece of dirty modern blues a la Billy Gibbons n' ZZ with a tip o' the hat to the greats. His back-up musicians sound young and hungry and Tom sings like this is his swan song...one foot in the neon grave.Highly recommended, but know what yer gettin' into.

I wanted to get a feel for the type of exercises, but couldn't find any because they are hidden within the text, without any font changes, bold type etc. to guide you to them.It is 442 pages of the author droning on and on and I couldn't even find any examples of sample journal entries by the author or any other journaler.This book was not for me.

Brilliant book!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bold, Funny and Refreshing.","review":"This book is now required reading in both my home and office! Monahan's thesis is simple: Most of us spend a great deal of our time living in mediocrity and THAT is what causes the pain and dullness that many of us privately suffer. There is a very powerful exercise in the first chapter that makes it easy (and painful) to find the source of our own mediocrity -- and the rest of the book is about how to move out of it. Some may find this too tough and controversial because the focus is on personal responsibility and character, but Monahan is a gentle teacher who clearly is teaching from experience. Overall this book is tough yet charming, simple yet profound. The writing style is refreshing and smart for a self-help book -- this one is a gem and I am grateful for the message. After a few days of using the \\"Five Acts of Improvement\\" that Monahan writes about, I became addicted to improvement and everybody who knows me can see the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written,fantastic sweaters, a new classic for knitters.","review":"I ordered this on a whim knowing nothing about Sally Melville but since XRX published it I thought it would be good.

This time it's bow & arrow instead of guns, but that doesn't make much difference in the over-the-top \\"grrl power\\" formula Schurfranz employs yet again. The heroes are also slightly drawn (no surprise), with Cassie making her choice late in the story when we all knew it was coming. The biggest disappointment was Cassie's introduction to white society after being with the Iroquois since she was four. It is no more bumpy than the usual teenager switching schools. It could have been done so much better. I ended up speed-reading this one from page 100 and don't think I missed much.

The issue that I found with it is that it is too large to put into a full laptop case, so unless you're putting it in a catalog case or a large case of that nature it is not good for traveling. I used this case for a while to carry my macbook between home and work where I had a power adapter at each location and it was fine. Aside from that it was not very useful. If you want to carry your power adapter with it you have to order a side pouch from Brenthaven directly and pay just as much in shipping for the pouch as you do for the case. The pockets on the case are only good enough to carry a few papers in, not even a pad of paper.

I was pleasantly surprised by how tough and protective the case is. Corner protection, often a weak spot in these designs, is exceptional. The thing provides a very nice combination of slim design and thorough protection. I'm not in a financial position to run Mac-dropping experiments, but I suspect this could take some very hard knocks.A few caveats:The fit is tight, and I would have some misgivings about overheating the MacBook by running it fully seated in the case, as this would tend to block the main heat vent. There is just barely enough room in the back pocket to get a wireless mouse and power supply. Great for transporting the MacBook; probably less ideal for running it seated in an open case, although this problem is going to be present in almost any case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best laptop bag for me so far!","review":"I purchased this laptop sleeve/bag as I wanted a laptop bag that could function as a sleeve and a bag when needed, and also that would protect my investment.I must say that this bag covers all of my requirements.

Without You I'm Nothing had it's high points, but t'was nothing compared to their fresh, non-pretentious debut. With this single however, Placebo appear to have lost the plot entirely. Taste in Men was decidedly average, and this continues the theme with its watered down minimalist approach.These tracks sound shallow, lacking the density and power that make rock music great. Placebo sound as if they're disowning their roots to establish themselves as a unique band; but instead of creating something new and innovative, they trade their talent for a lack of melody, sloppy songwriting, and lyrics that make you cringe.While Black Market Music exceeded (low) expectations, Slave to the Wage remains one of the weakest tracks on the album, and even earlier, pointless B-side remixes were better quality than the two dire songs featured here."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Letdown!","review":"The beginning of this book showed a lot of promise. Calvin reminded me of people I used to know, and I even uttered some of his teen angst quips when I was his age. However, as the book went on, nothing really happened. Duncan is a talented writer and I really enjoyed the format of the book, but he kept dropping hints of things that happened (such as his younger brother's death), but he never really explained or followed up with them. I also agree with the other reviewer in that the message was \\"do drugs and have a lot of sex before you get old because then no one will want you anymore.\\" That's unfortunately the thought of many young gay men already and it doesn't need to be perpetuated.All in all, I would hesitate to recommend buying this book, but it's not too bad of a read if it's laying around or you find it at the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courtesy of Teens Read Too","review":"Calvin is a sixteen-year-old whose life revolves around video games, drugs, and clubs.

He's got to actually meet him in person.They see each other on the dance floor and things progress that night.Calvin sees Anthony as a blank canvas and it bothers him. Is there more to him than just sex? He tells Calvin that he's not really there while his photos and videos are taken. He says, \\"Take yourself out of the equation.\\" This seems very complicated to Calvin and he searches to find the meaning of those words.This novel was an intriguing look into the life of a gay teenager. Calvin seemed like he constantly wanted more than what he was getting, yet wasn't sure how to find it. Readers should be aware that this book does contain sexually graphic passages.Reviewed by: hoopsielv"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Another One","review":"Once upon a time I hated the fact that most gay books had the 'good' gay characters all dying or just suffering really bad. It was a sort of institutionalized self-loathing. Who knew I'd miss them? The story of the young gay teen with no real problems having to create them, sometimes even fatally, is a lot less fun and appears to be the new wave.

I did have to use an extension cord and splice the wires before attaching it to the thermostat. The thermostat works very well and has kept my greenhouse temps cooler. The only thing is the thermostat kicks in 8-10 degrees above what you set it to. For example if I set the thermostat to 80F, it won't run the cooler until the temperature hits 88F or 90F.

I'm talking 25 degree (sometimes more!) sensitivity range.

I have not had it 'trip' due to temperature changes, either in the on or off direction, more than a couple of times in months of attempted operation.

I can't think of another art book that I still enjoy after so much time. While it doesn't contain any painting instruction that you can't find elsewhere, the thing that I most enjoy about this book is Trevor Chamberlain's artwork, his simple approach to plein air painting, and all of the useful tips he shares. He talks about his equipment, a few very basic rules of oil painting, then he goes on to talk about painting in different situations: townscapes, interiors, summer, winter, figures and cars in landscapes, etc. The biggest downside of this book is that many of the images are in black and white, and some are rather poorly photographed. But Chamberlain's wisdom and years of experience in plein air painting really come through and that's what makes this such a valuable book for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaliyah is truly One in a Million","review":"In my heart Aaliyah is one of the most beautiful living thing to walk this earth. She has the voice and can back it up with her her tasteful dance moves. This CD, I Care 4 U shows her lifetime achivement in the music game. With tracks like Erica Kane and classic joints such as Back and Forth the CD is just a one time classic.

This CD would have worked better taken as a stand-alone hits album with just this new track added as bonus IMO. The Johnta Austin material, while good in parts pales next to vintage Timbaland productions.The lack of \\"Rock The Boat\\", \\"We Need A Resolution\\", \\"4 Page Letter\\", \\"Age Ain't Nothin But A Number\\", \\"If your Girl Only Knew\\", \\"Hot Like Fire (Remix)\\" etc leave the purpose of this release in some doubt..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Spirit lives On","review":"First it's an honor to be the first to review this album. I'm not a critic or anything so there won't be anything technical in here. I'm a fan and what you will read is straight from the heart. I really like this album because it has her previous hits as well as 6 new songs. The new songs fall right into character with her style. They're fresh innovative creative and mindblowin. I was set off at frist because I wanted a whole album of new songs but sfter listening to it I regret even thinking that way. It takes you through her career and you get to see how she has grown as a woman and as an artist. The extra special bonus is the DVD I mean it's a collection of all the videos you love.

Of the new songs, I Miss You and Don't Know what to tell ya are the best ones. The other ones are just plain castaways. The problems with this compilation is that some of her hits are missing (If your girl only knew, 4 Page Letter, ext.) I would have loved the remix for Hot Like Fire to have appeared. The great thing about this cd is that it includes a DVD of her best videos.

I never really noticed how talented she was, sadfully, till after she passed away. Most people never realise the talent and beauty of one human being till their gone, so, if i could now, i would be the most dedicated Aaliayh fan there is, but, since she won't have anymore new material besides unreleased items, i will have to live with her older materials, but for right now, the older materials are all i need 2 carry on her legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aaliyah \\"I Care 4 U\\" Tribute CD","review":"There are alot of word's I can use to describe Aaliyah's \\"I Care 4 U\\" Tribute CD but, the best word that describe's it is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reply and a review","review":"First of all that guy who said Haha she's dead..hahahahaha, NO.

Cause the beats are so tight the way she sings is tight, just the way the way she lays it down it is nice! And I would get the CD and play it so much.My favorite songs were \\"I CARE 4 U,\\" I MISS U,\\" ONE IN A MILLON'All of these songs are really great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just enough for the casual listener","review":"Aaliyah's career was cut short due to a fatal plane crash in August 2001. \\"I care 4 U\\", released after her death is a mix of new material and old classics. The songs on this disc capture some of her most popular hits such as \\"Are you that somebody\\", \\"One in a million\\", and \\"Try again\\". Beyond the few hits on this disc, the remainder lack depth and creativity.If you are seeking a light R&B; experience, Aaliyah does the trick with her angelic vocals and soulful production (Missy Elliot & Timberland). However, this CD is not one of my favorites in this genre due to its repetitive nature and simply dull non-hit tracks.Overall this an average listen and nothing more. If you are a fan of Aaliyah this will make a great addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I am not impressed with this album.

Not with these kind of basic grammar mistakes.Hopefully, I'm returning it back to Amazon!Jose G"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great balance","review":"I noticed it in the last book and I'll say it again - the detective is only pseudo-nameless. They do, in fact, refer to him as \`Bill' several times in the novel. That aside, it was a good detective story. It teeters on the edge of hard-boiled, but it's soft enough not to offend anyone's sensibilities. I think this is a great series for those who don't want the true cozies, but also don't want too graphic descriptions or really, really nasty plot lines. It won't give you nightmares, but it will make you think.I particularly like the very diverse group of characters portrayed, both in the agency and as bit players. The dialogue and interaction ring true, the storyline flows wonderfully, and there's just enough of an \`Oh!' factor at the end. You kind of see the ending coming, but not soon enough to spoil the surprise.

Mr. Tick's PhD is in Communications, not clinical psychology (or counseling or any other relevant phd). This might explain his naive approach to war and the healing of others.

Not only does Ed Tick's War and the Soul cover a part of individual combat trauma therapy that is often ignored, that of the spiritual (not necessarily religious) journey needed for recovery, on a larger level it places war in the context of our society and forces us to think of the ethical choices we often avoid. When I have asked combat veterans what happened to their soul, many veterans respond by saying they feel like they've been carrying their soul around under their arm since they returned home.

I agree with the \\"ad absurdum\\" reader below that this book is just one more in a series trying hard to defend a failing supernatural belief system. There is nothing new in this book and certainly no arguments that have not been made before. I have read C.S. Lewis and Behe\\u0019s books. They both make the assumption that a supernatural being exists and then go on from there. As the reviewer below, I think 300 years of modern science has shown the total baselessness of supernaturalism. The bottom line is that there is no evidence that such a domain or being exists. Christian apologists can say what they want, but convoluted logic and words from god do not count as evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old, poor quality figs arrive with many bags ripped open","review":"The dried figs arrived today packed in a box within a box arrangement and still some of the bags were broken open and the figs were loose in the box.

The large format permits the reproduction of strikingly vivid photographs of the most famous and beautiful gardens in Japan. The layout of the book provides an excellent introduction to the many styles of gardens which have evolved over the past 1000 years in Japan. Detailed narrative descriptions of the various styles introduce each section and include many drawings to help the reader to understand the development of the gardens. Of special interest and beauty is the description and photographs of Saiho-ji commonly refered to as The Moss Garden in Kyoto. The full page photographs capture the lushness, serenity and beauty of the garden at its peak of color. Having visited the garden several times over the past few years, I can say that the presentation in this book is much lovelier that the actual garden is and given the cost of admission to the garden the cost of the book is very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful full color photography","review":"As a monograph on the Japanese garden this book contains a wealth of some of the best color photographs currently in print. Although the text gives a general overview of garden history and design elements, I find it somewhat lacking in structure and completeness.This book does contain an excellent description of the origins of the garden at Saiho-ji, also known as the Moss Temple garden, and it is a varyed collection of material that will amuse the reader, especially the anecdotal accounts of the lives and statements of the more legendary figures of Japanese garden design.The Japanese have created a wealth of myths surrounding these figures, that have gained a special place in their cultural history, but in recent years most scholars have started to question the extent to which they were involved in the actual design and building of the gardens that are attriobuted to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story leaking like sinking boat","review":"Well, J.K. did it again.

In the book, the time traveler goes into the future and he was very disappointed with what he had seen. He saw that the people of the future were very uneducated, They had the mentality of a 4-year-old. It makes the time traveler appreciate the period of time he came from.

It even gets a laugh out of me as well. They enjoy watching this in the car or even at home. Their was a speedy delivery, and we all tuned in as soon as it got here."},{"rating":"2","title":"More season sets PLEASE","review":"Hey Mr. Warner can you put up the complete third, fourth, fifth, and sixth seasons on DVD please? Fans would really be really pleased to see the show on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids...","review":"Much like the Warner Brothers' classic \\"Looney Tunes\\" and \\"Merrie Melodies\\", \\"Foster's...\\" is a show for kids that's smart enough for adults. I just wish they'd bring out the other seasons!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Leelee Sobieski has the face of an angel","review":"I have seen almost every film gorgeous Leelee has made, but she looked better in this movie that any other of her other films! If you want to be mesmerized by a truly gorgeous woman, than buy this DVD. Leelee Sobieski has a very rare natural beauty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves Viewers in a Dark Place","review":"I am a fan of most \\"Turn of the Screw,\\" related works. I am normally a fan of Leelee Sobieski's movies. Not so this time.The movie was a sad, depressing jaunt through the horrors of men. There wasn't a single male figure that was a remotely positive individual throughout the run of the film, including the little boy she was supposed to be caring for. You can sum up all male roles in one word: abusive. The women were victimized, and the children fared little better. Unfortunately, the characters had precious little depth or plausibility.The movie was incredibly slow. It was dark, but senselessly so. There is also the sense that the main character is quite mad, completely unsuitable for work as a governess. The best thing about the film was the setting."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!","review":"Augh! I popped over to see what kind of reviews this terrible movie got, and am in complete shock that anyone would say this was a good movie. I rented it because the cover sparked my curiosity. I watched the whole thing from start to end, thinking maybe in its final moments it might suprise me. Didn't happen. The whole movie is so slow moving. And to make a slow movie go even slower, we have to watch the main character doing everyday things like bathing, walking the grounds, walking down halls, etc. None of which added any meaning to the plot. I figured out what was really going on early in the film, but like I wrote previously, thought the end might suprise me. In my opinion, the production of this movie was a total waste of everything--- space, money, time, plastic, ink, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"This movie is a total waste of time .... unless you want to watch it to get a good laugh at the acting, directing, storyline, ugly wardrobe and senseless bathrobe scenes. If I could give this movie a minus star, I would. What an embarrassing flop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I'm a fan of Leelee Sobieski. But even her acting skills couldn't save this snoozing loser.Fair cinematography, good start-up story. Downhill from there on. Confused and ridiculous ending.You'll be sorry if you waste your time on this film. One hour and thirty-nine minutes of your life you'll never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this movie -5 stars if I could...","review":"I went to the video store and picked up some indie thrillers to watch. Man, did this one suck. Yes, Leelee is very pretty and you get to see her almost naked many times in the movie. If that's enough for you, go ahead and rent it.SPOILER!!! I thought this was a ghost story, not a movie about a schizo child molester/murderer. I want my 2 hours back! Please, just take my advice and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I'm glad I did not buy this movie or pay to rent it. It was a waste of time. We were trying to figure out what the heck was happening the whole time. It had potential to be a great movie, but there were too many ways to \\"guess\\" what was supposed to be happening. Nothing was answered. I can understand some movies leave you hanging a little, but at least they do with clearer ways to decide for yourself how you think it ended. Not this movie. It's like the writter couldnt make up his mind. I think I would like to read the book now just to see if it made more sense than this movie. Dont waste your time or money on the movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"It was intense at times but overall the movie boring as it dragged on. It made little sence until the terrible ending. The flashbacks made no sence untill later but it would have been a little better without them."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS TURN GETS SCREWED","review":"This take on Henry James' classic TURN OF THE SCREW pales in comparison to 1961's THE INNOCENTS which featured an astounding performance from the late Deborah Kerr. This update lacks the sense of doom of that version, and LeeLee Sobieski is far from Kerr's league.This version brings the story into modern times and features the requisite lesbian love scene, which in my opinion, is turning up too much in our modern horror movies. There also isn't enough focus on the children's relationship with Quint and Miss Jessel and the ending lacks the dynamic impact of the INNOCENTS. Remaining still is the question: are there really ghosts or is the governess just batty? Stick to the INNOCENTS--it's a far better ghost story."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME!","review":"I LOVE Leelee, I think she's great, this film however was a stinker. I was hoping for a good scare, but all I got was confused. Although well acted, the story was boring and weird"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible.","review":"I read the reviews and despite some of the negatives I decided to give it a try. I really wish I hadn't. It took a very very long time before anything even remotely interesting happened. This wasn't so much a ghost story as a story about psychosis and abuse, poorly told at that. It was absolutely dismal as far as entertainment value. Not scary at all. Not interesting at all. Just lame. the only halfway entertaining bit is getting a few glimpses of leelees almost nekkid body, girls got it going on...but even then a rip off, no actual nudity on leelee's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Version Film Version of a Classic Story","review":"I have seen many versions of Henry James' Turn of the Screw, and I have to say this is the worst. The acting is terrible and reminiscent of a Lifetime movie The director seems to miss the entire point of the original story, he takes away any hint of a spooky ambiance and replaces it with a poor allegory for child abuse, which didn't really work. In the special features the director mentioned that he never read the story and didn't care to, perhaps he should ha rethought that. If you want to see a good, spooky version of this story I recommend watching The Innocents or even The Haunting of Helen Walker. stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't make sense at all!","review":"I was really confused by this movie. I didn't understand it at all. I thought Anna was out to protect the children, and at the end, watches the boy drown, then the girl that she keeps dreaming about appears in her face? I just didn't get it. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep inside you know you're him","review":"This CD collects the library cues that accompany Larry's trips to the office, to meetings with manager Jeff and to any place where Larry can create mayhem through no real fault of his own. The plots, the dialogue, the acting from an outstanding ensemble and, of course, the music set this show head and shoulders above the rest of the pack.A brave link perhaps, but Larry brings a little of Maestros Fellini, Leone, Rota & Morricone to Hollywood, while playing out a Spaghetti Western in the synagogue and a comedy of modern manners in a noodle bar or dry-cleaner's.This is a perfect accompaniment to the DVD's and lovers of Italian cinema music from the 60's and 70's will know just what to expect.A satisfying collection that is well worthy of investigation - highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Music","review":"If you like the show this album is great since you can picture each of thecrazy situations the gang gets in with each song. The sound is excellent and there are enough songs for your money. Happy music indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutest Book!","review":"Very cute, real photography pictures of real Strawberry Shortcake dolls in various nature scenes. The photo quality is very good, and the scenes that he poses the dolls in are too cute!The author uses 3 of the Strawberry Shortcake dolls (vintage 1980s): Strawberry herself, Huckleberry Pie and Blueberry Muffin. He poses them with real animals. Such as a hummingbird eating seeds out of a mini basket Strawberry has on her arm. He poses the \\"kids\\" as he refers to them, on a rock with a turtle, etc too.Very adorable book with a cute story line describing the dolls and what they are doing in each scene. Great for toddlers on up.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Play, DVD player cannot read disk","review":"Doesn't play / DVD player cannot read disk. Looks like \\"aftermarket\\" do-it-yourself CD recording. DON'T BOTHER BUYING IT. SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unvarnished truth is so rare as to be uncomfortable to watch","review":"It's a light hearted comedy in which about a hundred innocents are politely executed and the people are sheep armed only with idealist slogans and happy-faced song while awaiting slaughter. The juxtaposition of the politely murderous and naively suicidal is admirably bold for Hollywood, precisely because it is political and real, if uncomfortably strange.Gable plays the typical driven ... romantic lead of the genre. The hero in the story is his \\"presser\\" (a valet) who wants his daughter (Lamar) out before her heavily propagandisized ideals and big mouth gets her shot in a country as full of real political zigs as the movie's plot. The mix of slapstic romantic comedy and deadly serious Stalinist politics of the late 30's is a unique combination I have never seen before. Not even Chaplin's \\"The Great Dictator\\" was this \\"over the top\\" in terms of convention. Must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars for sheer entertainment value","review":"Aside from the fact that it rather glosses over some key films (Woody Allen's output almost altogether - a curious ommision in light of the fact that he proclaims Allen to be one of the few genuine auteurs of the period, and has Coppola saying as much in the conclusion) this is a great anecdotal history. Great stories culled from an impressive list of author interviews. It's a shame that he lets his disdain for the consequences of Star Wars and Jaws for the movie industry sully his opinions of those fabulous films. Infact, the one let down in the book is his resentful attitude to those two film makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating, engrossing, but should you be viewing this.....","review":"Don't quite understand the critics of the gossip in the book. It is obviously salacious and a selling point of the book. One wonders how any movie got finished, financed, much less of any quality, given their self destructve bacchannalia. The book could have been shorter and a better read as he includes many peripheral/or minor people. I don't rally have a great deal of interest in this particular era, but the book engrossed me and increased my curiosity about that period of filmmaking. I was left with a disturbing question of morality about such crazed people forging our cultural stories. Again, it's a marvel they produced works of respected art given their anti-saocial practices. Most drug people with these behaviors end up i prison, dead in the gutter and certainly forgotten even, by their mothers!!!!!!I was forced to question my interests in these works. Haven't answered them yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Follow, Kinda Boring","review":"I found it really hard to follow who the heck the author was talking about and who he was quoting. The way it was written, it just didn't flow, seemed choppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raging bulls easy riders","review":"This has to be the worst book I have read in years, do not beleive the cover reviewers as they have clearly not read the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recieved, No Refund","review":"They say they sent it to my address, but i never recieved it. I called them. they told me they sent it, and did not offer further help."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Myths of the Flower Children","review":"In stereotypical \\"I am an art movie elitist\\" fashion, Biskand subscribes to the silly notion that Spielberg and Lucas were the poison apples in the 70s cinematic Garden of Eden. Too bad he failed to notice that at exactly the same time the exact same thing was happening throughout the rest of the entertainment industry. Ever heard of an album called Frampton Comes Alive? The fact that the movie \\"business\\" has deteriorated into its current state has more to do with changes in the way movies are financed, marketed, and distributed than Bogdanovich, Coppola, et al. \\"blowing it\\".This book made for a fascinating read, but I'm so tired of the premise that The Godfather is vastly superior to Star Wars because of its deeper meaning and tragic ending. Get over your romanticism with gangsters and see it for what it really was, a pretty faithful adaptation of a best selling novel with great casting and cinematography."},{"rating":"1","title":"TABLOID GARBAGE FILLED WITH UNTRUTHS TO SENSATIONIZE SUBJECT","review":"This book is a compendium of old articals, rumors and dubious secret sources. It intends to sensationalize a an era in moviemaking rather than seriously document it. I know many of the people involved and am sure that much of what is in this book is not factual. As a book it is disjointed and clearly a work designed only to make it's author a bundle"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, painful to read","review":"This was probably the most pretentious pile of garbage I've ever had to read. Ignoring the movie titles them selves, this book read like a cheap check-out counter tabloid. It's obviously written by a die-hard hollywood fan, but not from a historical point of view. Oh no, it was written by someone desperately fawning over the in-crowd, wishing *so hard* that people were talking about *them*. If this book were a person, it would be found standing in a group of film students all trying to one up each other, just pining for the opportunity to say \\"Oh you don't know about so-and-so? pff.\\" before turning its nose up and continuing on its self-indulgent soapbox.By the end of the second chapter I had taken to just reading the first line of each paragraph and managed to get the entire gist of the book. Each paragraph is filled with so much gossipy fluff, you'd think it was being written by a student trying to hit the minimum word count for an English assignment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandal Sheet","review":"Considering Biskind was, according to his bio, an editor at both Premiere and American Film, this book is disappointingly short on intelligent film analysis and grossly long on sexual histories, drug exploits, and mean gossip. The aesthetic dimension is virtually ignored other than general remarks about critical reception of the various films discussed, but the behavior of the directors (on and off set) is plumbed. Everyone comes out looking very ugly. So what? If you're looking for gossip and a few interesting anecdotes, this is for you. Good film or cultural history it ain't. The chronology is confusing, the narrative very loose, the spirit truly Hollywood scandal sheet. Too bad, because it could have been much more intelligent given the author's obvious access to sources. The author's focus makes him seem every bit as repellent as the directors he sketches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash masquerading as scholarship","review":"Unfortunately, Amazon.com tends to selectively edit the reviews from publications. Joe McBride's NY Times review of the book was much harsher than the glint you get in the above quote. For a devastating review of the book, see last week's The Nation. Biskind is sloppy, bad writing and bas research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, These People are...Human","review":"I grew up in the 70's and I still believe that decade was the last great movie era of Hollywood. THE GODFATHER, CHINATOWN, JAWS, ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, THE EXORCIST, TAXI DRIVER, THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, ANIMAL HOUSE, THE OMEN, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, M*A*S*H--Hollywood isn't just living in the shadow of that decade, it's shamelessly looting just about every film from then!What makes Biskind's book so much fun to read is the open and candid way the filmmakers and everyone else discuss their rise and falls. These brilliant filmmakers made some of the greatest films of all time...but they're still people.(If you loved this book, then also check out the late Julia Phillips' book, \\"You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,\\" another funny and fascinating take on the great 70's era. Then check out Blake Edwards' 1981 film, S.O.B.!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I asked Coppola about it","review":"I was at the Niebaum-Coppola winery in Napa, CA in Spring, 2002; and Frances Ford Coppola was there receiving visitors in the wine bar. Most of the people were Midwesterners who wanted to sit on his lap and get a picture, or some similarly innane thing. I know that this would be my chance ot test him on this book. I sauntered up to him and asked him about the book, and asked if it was true. He gasped and said that it was all lies. He said that Biskind was a jerk and he \\"...merely took the one vice each of us had and blew it out of proportion.\\" Thus, Coppola seemed to affirm the validity of the tales in Biskinds book. I have a tremendous admiration and respect for FFC, but I didn't want to miss the opportunity to rib him a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"be careful","review":"beware of taking this book's anecdotes and details too literally. i know a few of the people biskind discusses in the book, and they all say he gets many things flat-out wrong. my take on the book is: he's generally right (sex, drugs, ego), he's gratuitously nasty (ok, they were all egomaniac jerks, but they did make some good movies), and he could have used a good fact-checker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining look at film history","review":"Entertaining and easy read on the \\"1970s\\" Hollywood era (covers 1968-1980). Covers a lot of ground and includes a look at almost every major or important director from that era, and how their ego and hubris ultimately restored Hollywood to the studio system. Reccommended for any fan of films of that era."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This book may present some theoretical views for beginner level game programming, but do not expect to learn the correct syntax for VB.NET. Actually if you purchase the same authors book for programming in C# you'll find they have the same first chapter (that's as far as I looked). This book was obviously a lazy attempt for these people to make a quick buck. Unfortunately they wait until the end of the book to let you know:\\"Most of the example games leave much room for improvement.

First of all, I was interested in the odd quirk of a linguist studying dialect and would have actually liked more details on this. The title suggested the \\"language\\" issue would be discussed, however, it really wasn't developed much more than as a plot device. This book was one of those mysteries that just keeps introducing more and more characters (and potential suspects) which confuses the plot terribly - even in the later chapters new characters appeared. I didn't find the immigrant isses as compelling as they may have been and were (in some ways) tangential to the story. Perhaps the book may be a fair \\"local color\\"-Southern-small-town story, etc. but it failed as a tightly written mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"This book was one of my biggest disappointments.It is a fairly recent book (1836) but a lot of pages and all 25 illustrated views are missing. Then I do not understand how can 1 page only be missing: if one book paper page is missing then 2 scannarized pages should be missing.Then the dark backgrounds are just fake.So to summarize:a recent book from an artist, famous for his drawings, with missing drawings and pages, so a book without any value.If Kessenger Publishing can not find a decent book to scannarize then they should stop their activity and claim that they want to spread culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter racquet","review":"This is a good racquet for someone just starting out.

And indeed the quilts are quite lovely, even though not many new patterns in there if you have her other books. The quilts are based on the idea of superimposing a pattern over another, eg maple leafs on logcabin blocks. Judy Martin has done this before and the results are always wonderful. I already have decided to make a small wall hanging with the friendship star quilt for my new office.I only gave the cookie part a passing glance. The cookies looked and sounded delicious, but I doubt I will make any. This is due to the difficulties to translate the American measurements (1 cup etc) to something my German tools will measure. But then I just might play around with it till it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cookies n Quilts book","review":"Beautiful book. I made cookies today following the recipes. Yeah, I know that this is mainly a quilting book, but I tried the recipes first.

The quilts are beautiful and I do plan on making a few of them too. The recipes are wonderful and I recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased with this product","review":"I returned this book because I found the quilt patterns to be very ordinary and boring -- nothing new or unique.

For swing dancers, this is a modern take on the classic rhythms of the 40s with some pretty jazzy improvisations. Big Daddy can play and they have a lot of fun with the music, showing a tremendous amount of versatility as well as humor on these recordings.

Listening to this CD is just like reliving that experience all over again. Fantastic!And the music itself is so wonderful that it will have you tapping your toes like crazy. I like to listen to this at work--makes the time go very quickly :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yellowed Pages","review":"Pages Of \\"Legal Tender\\" were received yellowed. I was disappointed in the quality of this book. It was not in good shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I like how this author develops her stories and weaves her law background into the mysteries. This book was particularly fun because I was in Philadelphia (Center City) for a businesss-related trip and recognized many of the sites mentioned in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun legal thriller","review":"Bennie Rosato is a partner in a law firm with her recent ex, Mark. She is still trying to adjust to the fact that he has broken up with her to date their associate, Eve, when she finds out that he also has plans to dissolve the partnership and start his own firm. But any shock that she feels is overwhelmed when his body is found, dead, at his desk and Bennie is the number one suspect. Bennie must try to solve this murder if she is to save her firm, reputation, and most importantly, her life. But the bodies keep piling up and the police aren't looking in any direction but hers. Will she be able to stay out of jail long enough to catch the real killer?Legal Tender is one of the earlier Scottoline novels that features Bennie Rosato. Like the more recent books, it is fun and fast. The story is somewhat contrived and unbelievable, but it is grounded enough in reality to let the fun carry the day. A very quick read, it will leave you reaching for the next in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably my favorite of Scottoline's many books","review":"I have a soft spot for Lisa Scottoline. Many years ago I was working in a used book store when I ran across her first book, 'Everywhwere that Mary Went' and I loved it. We had two copies of that book and we must have re-sold them a dozen times after I started recommending them to people who asked for someone new to read. Pretty soon, Lisa Scottoline was one of our hottest items - we even special-ordered in some new copies! I like to think that I had a very, very small part in her success, even though the used book store is now defunct.But, when you write zingers like \\"Legal Tender\\" you really don't need the help of a used book store cashier. \\"Legal Tender\\" is fun, light, full of quirky characters and also comes with plenty of serious moments. It just hums along and is just perfect for escapist, summer reading.So, I give this one a solid \\"A\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Strong Entry For Scottoline","review":"Lisa Scottoline's LEGAL TENDER continues a streak of strongly-written, character-driven novels that revolve around the legal world, this time focusing on attorney Bennie Rosato. Rosato is partner in a firm she started when her then-lover, who is now involved with one of the firm's associates and is planning to dissolve said-firm in order to start his own practice independent of Bennie. That's when all the trouble begins, which eventually leads to the murder of three people, and finds Bennie as the prime suspect. Along the way, we meet those closest to Bennie, including her mother and her best friend, all completely fleshed-out characters and far from the cookie-cutter characterizations found in alot of novels. In addition to the meaty character backstories, Scottoline also has a firm grasp on legal jargon, and remains one of the wittiest and funniest writers in the genre. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, original story line with engaging lead character","review":"Lisa Scottoline does an excellent job of engaging the reader with wonderful characterizations and a strong feminist perspective that never mentions the word. The story hooks the reader on the first page and the humor throughout the book is perfect. I love her style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Easy Read","review":"Legal Tender was a quick easy read. It was written before some of Scottoline's other works but was interesting to see Bennie's earlier life. It got just a little far fetched the longer she ran from the cops but some nice surprises in the end. I advise it for a short get-away from whatever you're doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, fast-paced legal thriller","review":"I picked up this book right before a flight to Orlando and I couldn't put it down. Although her style is often compared with Gresham, she is better. She starts off with a bang, grabs your attention and you're off and running full steam ahead. The characters are well written and fully developed. When I returned from my trip, I immediately found all of her other books because I couldn't wait to read more. Try Scottoline, you'll agree with me, she's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Attorney hides from law as she tries to prove her innocence.","review":"The main thing I want to post about this book, is the fact that the heroine is feeding a stray cat Snickers bars and Coke. Chocolate is toxic to dogs and to cats and authors should not print this type of potentially harmful information just to be 'cute.' I have written Lisa to get her comments, but she has yet to respond. Anyone else out there who loves animals and dislikes irresponsible authors?Overall, my opinion of the book was fair. I found it silly and not really suspenseful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"The only thing I regret is not the money I spent but the time I wasted reading this book.

I moved mine to new boxes to prevent this."},{"rating":"2","title":"S & S boxed set","review":"Great set - packaging issues not really a problem. great price. Picture quality and sound are pretty decent - you have to consider that these shows were from the early 70's, so don't expect high definition or five channel surround! If you like Sanford and Son it is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy series from yesteryear.","review":"I loved watching this when I was growing up and jumped at buying the entire collection on DVD. The packaging was kind of cheap but as the entire disk set came stacked loose on one spindle but the cost savings over purchasing the individual seasons is substantial.

The series was funny and I know he will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five stars for the show...but one star DVD release","review":"Like I said this is a five star show. The DVD package is poor and the show IS NOT IN BROADCAST ORDER. I am only on the third season and so far every episode is there, but like I said it is NOT in broadcast order. If you love Sanford and Son like I do you have no choice but to buy this, but be educated about your purchase. DVD's were bought new and skip and FREEZE up due to duel layering. This is our only choice to own...so I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanford and Son DVDs","review":"The Sanford and Son DVDs have been most enjoyable. I will continue listening to them time and time again. The DVDs were put together nicely and they play well on my player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Slim Pkging","review":"Yes, it's definitely Slim Easy Packaging, because all disks are on a spindle type thing and just on top of each other.

I was very pleased with every aspect of this purchase - quality, price, packaging and shipping. No complaints at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"great show bad pack","review":"I love the show but the slim packaging is crap. It only scratches up the dvds and have you so mad that after watching a couple of dvds you get frustrated trying to put the ones you watched some place to keep them from getting scratched while you watch the rest. I got so tired of that so I just went and bought the whole series in individual seasons that way they come in their own packaging with each dvd having its own space. It might be cheaper this way but it is not worth it spend the extra money and buy each season individually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sanford & Son","review":"I received the dvds pretty fast.

It could at times offer the dreariest, most obvious cringe-inducing \\"humor\\" imaginable, and at other times it could provoke BIG laughs. Like the time Lamont was rehearsing his part as Othello in the Sanford living room with the lady who was playing Desdemona. Fred is unaware of any of this and all he sees as he's coming home and looks in the window is LaMont strangling a white woman. Talk about the big one! Fred freaks out and hilarity ensues. But these gems were all too rare amongst the dreck.

Frank Warren's idea: to allow ordinary people to reveal a previously undisclosed secret annonymously on a postcard, results in some of the most authentic statement of soul ever witnessed. Each card becomes a window to the personality beyond. The revelations are both great and small. Some talk of buried wounds like rapes or suicide attempts. Others point to internal judgements and dissatisfactions. Still others are fleeting: thoughts about coffee and other momentary joys. All have the authenticity that we yearn for when we look at any work of art. Because of the annonymity and the matter-of-factness of the medium, there is none of the usual pressuse to produce something 'great', and so what appears is something 'true'. This book should be required reading for anyone who seeks to make work that touches others. It will change your life, if you let it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Secret....this book is amazing.","review":"I'm a long time fan of the postsecret website and I'm happy to know that now I can have them to read anytime I want. The postcards in the book share a broad range of emotions. Some are funny, some make you sad and there are those that make you examine a few things in your own life. Everyone has secrets. There's even a possibility that when you turn the page your own secret will stare you in the face even though you haven't mailed one in. I would recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of the postsecret website and to anyone who is a fan of expression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets shared are a wonderful thing.","review":"Big time fan fot he website and love this collection of books.

Its extraordinary!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible art and fascinating confessions","review":"The second I got this book, I couldn't put it down. I'd been a fan of postsecret for a while, and it was incredibly exciting to actually have a book. It's amazing what people will share with strangers across the world. I think the book struck an ultimate high point with me when I came across the page that says \\"'Dear Frank, I have made six postcards all with secrets that I was afraid to tell the one person I tell everything to, my boyfriend. This morning I planned to mail them, but instead I left them on the pillow next to his head while he was sleeping. Ten minutes ago he arrived at my office and asked me to marry him. I said yes' -canada.\\" Post secret is an ingenious idea that allows people to have a creative outlet as well as an outlet to let go of the weight of a secret without the pressure of judgement. I would highly recommend this to EVERYONE! Thanks Frank!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"As with any PostSecret book, this one was a fantastic read.

There were some very interesting bits in the book and some very shocking ones too. I swear I felt normal after having read a few of the entries and also had a few of my friends read some of the book.

But major layout problems ruin the reading.","review":"I bought this book on Amazon as a gift, but now that I've gotten to see it, I'm not sure I can give it. I understand other commenters' criticism of the layout. I am no master of design, but certain things stick out as very carelessly detrimental to the simple enjoyment of reading the book. Sometimes a horizontal postcard is spread largely across two pages, with much of the middle stuck somewhere in the book's spine. Other horizontal postcard are merely turned sideways to fill a page. Much more pleasing are the pages with two horizontal postcards; you don't have to keep turning the book back and forth just to read the page. None of these postcards is like the other, so a more uniform presentation might have presented an easier way to read the postcards with less stress for the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and thought provoking, but don't get caught up","review":"First off all I would just like to say, I love this book. I love Frank Warren and everything he has done.Inside this book you will find the deepest secrets of strangers just like you, and if your lucky you might even find yourself in this book. The only reason I gave it four stars if because I feel like...people get much to caught up in reading postsecrets and often think those secrets are about them. For me, the first time I read it I felt so...Weighted down by all the secrets...Carrying them around for weeks and feeling deppressed even if they weren't my secrets to be deppressed about. So, I only advise you to read this if you have a good sense of Judgement and can tell the difference between reality and not reality. Take Caution, and enjoy it.

I found the books to be inspirational because when I read through them, the secrets remind me how much I'm not different from other people. It just a very human book and it's refreshing to see others being so honest about what they have experianced. One particular secret I read was worth buying the book just to be able to read that one secret whenever I wanted. I think these books make great gifts as well, especially for friends who took pysch! I recommend them, just to have them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love PostSecret but.....","review":"I love PostSecret and I love what Frank has done with the project. In a world where people are hated and looked down upon for being different, the website makes you realize that there's others out there just like you. With the same secrets as you. You feel connected to others.With that said, I think Frank could have done a better job with his first book. I opened it thinking it was going to be full of secrets I haven't seen before but instead it was secrets that had already been posted on the site. 95% of them were repeats for me. For Frank to take something that I already saw for free and try to charge me to read them again I thought was a rip off. I'm glad I read it while sitting in a big comfy chair at Barnes and Noble. Don't buy the book but I urge others to keep visiting the website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those confessions are pretty extraordinary","review":"This was a gift for a friend of mine. She loves it.

Upon discovering that I had allready seen almost all of them on the website at some point, I felt totally jipped. I mean, I could've just PRINTED them out, stapled them together and saved a few bucks.*sigh* So yeah, if you think that by ordering this book you're going to get to view a bunch of never before seen post cards, think again...And what kills me, is that if the author has received over 10,000 post cards to date, you'd think it wouldn't have been that difficult for him to dig up some new material that he hasn't posted on the website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and thought-provoking","review":"I received this book as a gift and read it that night, in one sitting. I just couldn't stop sifting through the secrets on each page. So many were funny, disturbing, or heart-wrenching. And I could relate to so many of them.The artwork on the postcards ranges from quick sketches to gorgeous collage but, with every piece of art so personal, it's easy to get caught up in each image. The only complaint I have is with the two-page spreads. When the text runs over two pages, the binding can make it hard to read. I wish everything had been printed in its original size or on a single page.This is a beautiful book, full of so much of the human experience. It made me wonder what my secrets would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Coffee Table Book","review":"A great idea .. great for a conversation piece.Prompted me to mail in my own secret moments after reading it.If you appreciate the creativity of others, you'll appreciate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Private Look into Private Lives","review":"If you've ever had thoughts and feelings that you held deep inside and were afraid to share, you'll find it in this book.

Perhaps this is an arachaic notion, but the exploitation of another's pain, confession, and art for one's own economic gain is simply unethical--no matter what kind of altruistic spin you put on the endeavor.By the way, I just love the legal notice that appears at the bottom of the postsecret website:By submitting information to PostSecret, you grantPostSecret a perpetual, royalty-free license to use,reproduce, modify, publish, distribute, and otherwiseexercise all copyright and publicity rights with respect tothat information at its sole discretion, including storingit on PostSecret servers and incorporating it in other worksin any media now known or later developed including withoutlimitation published books.Smells a bit sulfurous to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"We Are Not Alone In This World","review":"I find such comfort in the PostSecret website and books.

This collection of secrets is a true testament to our vulnerability. As you read it you'll experience many emotions (e.g. sadness, hope, joy). In a way it is cathartic because it somehow makes you take a closer look at your life and examine whether you are truly happy or simply \\"pretending to be\\" happy while carrying so much emotional baggage. You'll love it. It's an easy read. You won't be able to put it down. Then you'll go back and read it again.

The secrets were, however, far more often than not depressing or worrisome. While the writers of the secrets may have felt released by sending them off (and that fact is itself debatable), I felt weighed down by knowing their secrets. Additionally, I felt a little manipulated in that we have no way of knowing if the secrets are real or fiction -- did at least some of these writers create secrets in the hope of eliciting sadness and concern in the readers?

These feet work very well on the factory Honda Pilot roof rails (09/10). I was a bit concerned about the rubber strap that wraps under the bottom, but it seems to be VERY thick and durrable - no concerns anymore. Unlike some of my old Thule feet, these engaged very easily with the load boars and the simple allen screw tightened everything up very smoothly.Note that these are only for the square load bars, not the aero ones. The end caps have a knock out for the Thule locks - which not included with the feet."},{"rating":"2","title":"450 Foot Pack","review":"A bit awkward to punch out the holes for the locks and you have to be careful of the rubber skirt, but otherwise an easy installation and feels solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thule 450 Croosroad Roof Rack Pack","review":"Product installed easily on my Subaru forester. With the entire rig installed (using Thule crossbars I already had, and Thule kayak carrier center posts) there was a lot of windnoise at highway speeds, and a mileage penalty of 2-3 mpg. If I had it to do again, I might try the factory aerodynamic crossbars, and forget about using the crossbars I already had. Now I remove the rig when not needed because of the mileage situation, but that is not hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tension is Tight","review":"I love Angela Bassett, and she does it again in this drama that captures the psychosexual tension infusing race relations in early 1960s America.Bassett plays Ruby Delacroix, the owner of a juke joint known as Ruby's Bucket of Blood; when her regular black male singer is unable to show up one evening, Ruby begrudgingly agrees to let a white man (Kevin Anderson)named Billy Dupre take his place. Ruby's husband deserts her, and Billy'swife is mentally ill, so their immediate spouses are conveniently unavailable. This allows their forbidden affair to slowly develop, as shown by their furtive glances and unmistakable body language. The othercharacters serve to fill in the gaps, and this film is a sultry dramain which the anger and violence aren't gratuitous. There's just enough to make it believable. It's immensely enjoyable and I hope you take the time to watch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars b/c it kept me interested enough to finish watching","review":"I thought this movie reeked! Angela, you can do so much better!! Probably the best AA actress today.Anyway, this movie was terrible to me. I couldn't figure out she hooked up w/the white man. What was the point?

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Deep, Not To Shallow","review":"The series does a good job keeping history geeks engaged without going over the head of those bored with high school history class. Peter Weller is a different kind of host, and a nice change from the typical \\"professor type\\". You can see Peter really enjoys what he's talking about. Getting his degree from Syracuse University in Italy, and having a great love for Roman history is where his new nickname \\"Romo Cop\\" comes from. Anyway, there is a nice variety of empires featured, spanning all around the world. Rome, Greece, Britain, and Egypt get a lot of attention from documentary film makers and networks, so it was nice to see the episodes on the Maya, China, Carthage, and Russia. There are only so many ancient empires, but I'd like to see the series continue. Definitely worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for engineers, architects, builders etc.","review":"So here's the contrary review, from a disgruntled viewer. Everything the other reviewers said about the series and what it covers is correct - my complaint is that this is not about engineering, architecture or building. It is about war and the quest for power. I should have known, as this is what all History Channel shows are about. As a builder, I had hoped to see in depth coverage of the actual building / construction. Instead the focus is on empire, and the 'building' and consolidation of power in order to dominate. The music, the tension, the conflict - if you watch tv at all, this is nothing new to you. And if this is your thing, then by all means buy the set and enjoy. If you liked 'Troy' or the new 'Robin Hood' then you will love this series. But if you are, like I was, hoping to see all the good engineering behind the great civilizations and their incredible feats, this series will be a disappointment, as the coverage of such is very thin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series!","review":"This is one of the best series The History Channel did.

I love this series, and they do a really good job explaining the empires throughout history. Although they may not hit on or go into extreme detail with every aspect of the empires, they do an superb job explaining the main points.

I thought I saw the show about the Parthenon on the History Channel and thanks to your review I continued looking. The show I was looking for aired on PBS \\"Nova: Secrets of the Parthenon\\" which shows what little we modern folks know about ancient Greek Architecture. The NOVA show gives some very cool Engineering and exceptional Architectural insights. I guess I'll post this as well. Thanks again.So is \\"Engineering an Empire\\" only worth 1 star? I rented Volume 1 and found it to be entertaining, but I don't want it for reference in my Library. I tend to read the 5 star then I read the 1 and 2 star reviews too.

If surgery isn't your bag then it's probably a bit much but is excellent as a reference for your patient's surgical issues. When compared against many of the larger texts such as Sabiston it doesn't seem to be missing much of the important information that I needed to write review papers or add to informal presentations. But it is much cheaper and less bulky, and thus ideal for medical students. I used this book along with the \\"Essentials of Surgical Specialties\\" volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lawrence-True Essentials of Surgery","review":"I inititally bought this text in my second year of medical school. It was both an exceptionally detailed text and also a good reference on a wide variety of subjects. I have continued to use it into my surgical residency and expect to do so until I finish. My only detractions are that on occasion it is too densely packed with information, and that the section on peptic ulcer disease and the surgical treatment of the same is a little dated. Otherwise, any topic that a student needs to know about on a general surgical service is _well_ covered by this text."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Star Luis Aguilar that is anounced in this movie only has a very short and unsignificant role","review":"Because the Star Luis Aguilar appears on this movie less than 10 minutes.

Club Cupid is a reissue of a story originally published in 1999, and Valentine Vixen is a very short story that is thoroughly boring and unenjoyable. Club Cupid is slightly better, but the book - overall - is not worth wasting your money on. The stories are both too simple; the characters do not have enough depth or feeling, the \`romances' are unbelievable, and the writing is generic."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"I absolutely love this book. After negative experiences getting off psych drugs, it was extremely refreshing to finally have some one in the medical profession speak the truth. I am extremely grateful for people such as Glen Olsen, Peter Breggin (I highly suggest reading some of his books, looking into his research as well) and others.At first I was angry that it took Mrs. Olsen fifteen years to realize she was participating in harming people.

I loved this book. I will admit that other reviewers have a point, he's a little more action hero in this story than we usually see him. John's also a little more restrained than usual. But I think the liberties taken with the character are a direct result of the stakes Constantine faces in this story. Also keep in mind, faithful readers, every major run of Hellblazer has had \\"tweaks\\" to the character. Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Denise Mina, and others all had the parts of the character they chose to focus on, for the kind of story they wanted to tell. Them's the breaks on a serialized graphic novel format. You're always going to favor certain writers interpretation. It's still all Constantine. Without giving anything away, my favorite part of the character has always been this: just when you think he's done for, he surprises you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic","review":"Poorly written, you could insert any other adventure hero's name and it could be that novel. Personally I used my copy to help me fall asleep a day before some surgery I was worried about. If we are lucky DC won't contract with this guy again as all of his adaptations are pretty much hollow echoes of seventy adventure novels with very little of the wierd spark that vertigo comics became known for.If you have to read everything Constantine, then check this book out at a library or read ir in the bookstore but for the love of all that is holy don't buy it or your hellblazer collection will be tainted.Personally the only reason I could see to buy this book is insomnia, preparation for suicide, masochism or membership in the authors family.PS The geography was iffy, and the basic impression of the book was that the author was given a name, a title and otherwise knew almost nothing of the main character other than the movie screen play when he wrote this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting yet, poorly researched","review":"Much of the military hiearchy, rank and equipment is poorly researched. The novel is well written but lacks the acerbic wit of the original comic and much of the charm.Personally I like the book, and would buy a second one as I have hopes that this author will manage to grasp the character better, but I would be hesitant to buy any other works by this author on the strength of this novel.Too be perfectly honest after reading this novel I had severe doubts whether some of the lauds printed on his biography page were done by people who had actually read his work and were not either bones thrown to a struggling writer or were favors done to editors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because Constantine has the potty mouth---","review":"This book has all the right things to make it a good novel. So why does The Raven only give it a measly two stars? Three words: Excessive language use. A character like John Constantine can be expected to use colorful language. Not a problem. In the real world, people express themselves in any number of colorful or off-color ways. But when the writer begins to add the words as part of the text, not conversation, I begin to wonder about the author's imagination. Isn't there a better way to say that without resorting to \\"gutter language?\\" The Raven thinks so. It is unrealistic to think that characters should not give way to full expression, it makes the character more human; you think: \\"Yeah, I know a bloke like that! Sounds just like him!\\" But in the context of the writing, it becomes: \\"Can't he think of another word? I'm tired of reading the f-word all the time!\\"Quoth the Raven...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainment","review":"I don't know how accurate was to the series but for me this felt like a vehicle for the authors own political viewpoints.

Witticism is piled upon witticism, irony upon irony, wordplay upon wordplay, to the extent that the first chapters are almost unreadable.However, to the masochist that persists in reading further into the book, there are echoes in his characterization of Melody Preece, and even in her dialogue, of Alba, Turk's outstanding heroine of Black Body. Also, in places, the overworked language of Ether Ore may remind a Black Body-obsessed reader (such as myself) of Alba's clever and clause-laden constructions.All in all, I found it of some interest in showing where this writer came from, before writing a mind-blowing masterpiece such as Black Body."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was brave of the author to publish this book","review":"I opened Ether Ore at random, the first time I encountered it, and read the partial sentence at the top of the left-hand page. It said: \\"...a physical sensation so strong as to be almost tangible.\\" I quickly slammed the book shut again so I wouldn't be distracted from my immediate sense of awe.That sense never entirely dissipated. I challenge anyone to remain unmoved while reading aloud from the scene with the buobs.I don't want to spoil anyone's enjoyment of the plot, so I'll limit myself to observing that cute little Melody wakes up at the end and discovers it's all been a dream.

It held up pretty well as long as he was content with the mallets that we bought that had colorful rubber balls on the end. The head tore on it when he realized that he could turn the mallets around and the drum would be louder. The stick that comes with this drum has two ends like the one that caused the hole in our drum -- can't explain that. He is only two but I think that we will be looking for a drum with a replaceable head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Drum","review":"My grandson is delighted with this drum.

The performances of both the Dvorak Bagatelles & the Martinu Quartet also rank as some of the best once could hope to find.Domus plays with a dynamic level of energy & sensitivity, and the sound quality is superb. If you like Czech chamber music, this is one CD not to be missed.

I thought that since it had the Eddie Bauer name behind it, it must be of good quality. I was wrong. When my daughter was 3 months old my husband and I were taking a trip to see his parents and we were horrified to discover that along the way, the straps had come undone from the back. Before we could take the carseat back to Babies R Us it happened again. Upon our return, the people at Babies R Us were well aware of this problem and told us that it happens a lot with Eddie Bauer car seats. They told us that they've written letters to Eddie Bauer but nothing has been done to fix the problem. We bought a Graco and never had a problem with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car Seat Base Does NOT Work","review":"The design of the car seat base is very defective. There is no possible way to get it tight enough. I could pull on the front of the base with one finger and flip it right out of the LATCH belt (that was pulled as tight as humanly possible). In addition, the car seat carrier was difficult to secure on the base and difficult to get off, losening the belt even further with each attempt. I returned it for the Graco Oakwood and could not believe how complicated and unsafe this Eddie Bauer Travel System is in comparison. Two thumbs way down!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do it!!!!","review":"Thinking about this system? DONT DO IT! I really regret this purchase.The stroller is HUGE and very bulky and quite heavy. Sure it passed all of the safety protocols, but I wished I would have read a review from a consumer before buying this. I had the average travel system (Graco)for my first 2 kids years ago. I thought I was upgrading, and found myself wanting the less expensive system. The infant seat is fine, but I suggest saving the box and receipt and try fitting it in your trunk space, and going thru the motions. You'll probably return it after that. Save yourself the time and much needed energy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Travel System!!!","review":"I bought this because my wife and I love Eddi Bauer. We have SUVs and therefore, we wanted the Eddi Bauer products to match. My baby came 2 week before his due date. When my dad and I tried to put the system together we notice that this is NOT a travel system because a lot of things are on the way. In other words, it takes a lot to fold it and unfold it. It takes to much time to put it together (Imagine your wife alone put it in together and with the baby. Also, it is to heavy when it comes to travel. I agree that products have to be durable but this Travel System is just too heavy.The car seat is very unsafe. It moves all over the place.

I was concerned with the bad reviews as any parent would be so we took the car seat to our fire department and they showed us how to properly install it. I asked the fireman if he saw any dangers with this carseat and they all agreed that it was perfectly safe. The difference to what we were doing and what they did was when they installed the base they put all of their weight on and then pulled the belt secure. It made all the difference.The only thing that I don't like is the carseat is heavy and it will not fit into a shoping cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good purchase","review":"I am currently searching through the reviews of all the strollers so I can replace my Eddie Bauer travel system, I figured I should also put my review in...This stroller is very big, hard to push around stores, and impossible to steer with one hand. It does have a lot of room for diaper bags and shopping bags. the cup holder/tray is also very convenient. BUT the most important things...it gets stuck when folding it up and the base of the infant seat is awful. I've also found that the infant seat is larger than most and doesn't fit onto shopping carts. Mine is a year old now and I'm not sure if they have made improvements on this model already. I would definitely look into another brand before spending your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This is not a good buy. We purchased this system and it has been a disappointment from the start. The second time we used the stroller, a wheel fell off. The bolt fell out from the footrest so much we discontinued use. The carseat does not work properly in any vehicle. We tried it in our Volvo V50, our inlaws Lexus RX330, and a Jeep Cherokee. This is a very unsafe seat. It tips over easily. The base was impossible to secure. Your carseat should not move more than an inch to each side. This thing moves all over the place and it doesn't matter if it is professionally installed. The company will gladly replace the base but what good does it do you after you buy a SAFE carseat? We bought a Britax Marathon and are extremely happy with it. It is easier to move in and out of vehicles than this ever was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Base Replacement Information","review":"I found this website from Eddie Bauer that will replace your base for this stoller at no charge and mail it to you directly.

Don't let the look of this combo fool you!","review":"This product is unsafe and way to heavy. The pictures of the base tipping over are no understatement. We tried everything to try to secure this car seat in both of our vehicles. Each time we thought we had pulled the belt as tight as possible only to turn around and see the carseat tips over every time. We tried the latch hook system and the regular seatbelt. If you have not looked through the example pictures above, do it now to see how unsafe this seat could be in a traffic accident. The stroller did look nice and rode smooth but way to heavy for everyday travel. We took this system back and bought the Graco Travel system. It is so much more secure and also weighs less.

Good luck hope this review helps!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Buy","review":"i work where we sell these travel systems and i look eveyday to see if it's been recalled! i have never seen a car seat made like that. It's not safe the base doesn't fit in some cars, it's very heavy. i have heard so many bad things about this carseat and even some places won't install it due to the fact of it not being safe. So please read up on your strollers and find one that is safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Car Seat Base is completely unsafe!","review":"I too received the Travel System as a gift. The stroller we absolutely love. The car seat base however is completely unsafe. Following the directions to the T on installing the base, we were able to flip the chair over and side to side. I truly do not want my baby in a seat that is not secure. We've called the company to complain as there seems to be no recalls on this particular model, and they have let us know that they have re-designed the base and will be sending it out to us free of charge. I just don't understand why they don't reissue a new base as part of a recall. We'll test it out an see if it works. If not, we are getting a new car seat!California New Mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would never put my child in this!!","review":"I do not understand how anyone can say that this seat is safe. I have tried my best to install this seat repeatedly for parents throughout Maryland and have concluded that it needs to be recalled. Where the base meeting the back of the seat is so narrow that no matter how tight you get it you still have way to much play it the car seat. In addition, if you get the base to tight, since it is rounded in the front, it rotates and slides right out of the seat belt. The one time I felt I did get this seat in properly the parents came back to me two weeks later and was having horrible problems with the seat that I could not fix with my best efforts. I am certified through NHTSA and exercise my skill frequently installing sometime up to 30 seat a week.

She said that car seats are usually not that difficult to install. My husband and I decided that it was not worth the risk. God forbid, we had to take it out for some reason, we probably would not be able to get it back in right. Also, something I didn't realize was that it didn't have a head rest. I was disappointed that for $200 it didn't come with a head rest!!! Anyway, I was really hoping for the best despite the reviews and I'm really disappointed that we have to exchange it.

Lots of pockets, easy to use, etc. If I could purchase JUST the stroller - I might.The car seat is a nightmare. First, no instructions on how to anchor to car -- so who knows if it's right or not. Second, once properly attached, it wobbles from side to side because the thing is so damn narrow at the end. The seat can literally fall from side to side if you twist it. I can only imagine what would happen in an accident.The bottom line: my wife and I were not willing to take the risk. We exchanged it for a Graco model, with a very wide and stable base. Sure, it's not an Eddie Bauer, but it is $20 cheaper and the peace of mind is priceless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advice For First-Time Stroller Shoppers","review":"Here's what I've learned. I was very disappointed when shopping for a travel system at the selection of colors (we are not finding out the gender so it needs to be neutral). So I bought this one because I loved the look. After reading the reviews and talking to a very knowledgeable sales clerk who strongly advised against this system, I returned it.Here was the breakthrough: I was under the impression that to get a stroller that had the feature of the attachable car set, I had to look at a \\"travel system\\". Not true! If you don't mind spending a little more, there are many more options if you buy the stroller and the car seat combination separately. The seat still connects to the stroller with all the benefits of a travel system. I am excited about the Graco Quattro Roxy that we purchased. By far superior to the Eddie Bauer and in a neutral (somewhat sporty) pattern that we liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it","review":"Cosco continues its reputation as a cheap brand and the car seat on this travel system takes the cake.

I bought this for my daughter for Christmas because her older brother was getting new games, but NONE of us have been able to conquer the camera angle problems and that problem of Scooby getting in the way. Take my advice (and the advice of others here), rent it first. We have tried over and over, but just give up in frustration after about 15 minutes of play. Oh, man! I could have bought MYSELF something with that money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scooby doo animation is \\"ruff\\" !","review":"Scooby Doo Classic Creep Capers is not a very animated game, Everything has to be read, and the only sounds are bumps from the villains, or scooby saying \\"reah\\"! I bought this believing it would be as animated as most games are now,but it seems to be from the 70's animation. I would not recommend buying this before you try it...the company needs to either lower the price, or bring the animation into our new millenium!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS RULES!","review":"Scooby doo:Classic Creep Capers is a combination of technology and classic Scooby Doo. Based on 3 episodes, it makes it all the much better! The views may be different, but it just adds a level of difficulty that some people dont like. That game needs brains to solve the mysteries, and a deductive mind. Well, you dont have to figure out WHAT it does, but more WHERE it is, and that can be sometimes hard! All in all, the game is one of the best games on N64 (altho i like the Zelda's better). Its a definite 5 STAR RATING from me! SCOOBY HAS ANOTHER HOME RUN!!!!!WOOHOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SATISFIED","review":"I finally started to receive FAMIGLIA CRISTIANA this week, week of May 23.

WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!Fabric looks ans feels cheap, it's kinda shiny, from the polyester I think and the stitches are of very poor quality.The whole set makes the room look cheap.If there's one thing I've learnt is to always go for 100% cotton, never a blend of cotton and polyester.When you look upclose at it, the color looks funny too. Not solid brown but \\"fuzzy\\".One more thing, no matter how hard you try, it's always full of wrinkles and bumps. Bed doesn't look neat.Don't waste your money on this set. Looks nothing like the picture, feels even worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great, a little itchy","review":"The cover is great looking. We also got the matching curtains and pillows. We really like the look of it and it goes great with our bedroom. The only downfall is the material is a little stiff and itchy. We have very comfortable sheets, so this really isn't a big deal because we don't sleep directly with the comforter and pillows that are really only for decoration. Overall, it has helped up great with many washings, and it looks great in our bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't believe it!","review":"Normally I like to read anything and everything. It doesn't take much to get me interested in a book and my interest is usually held throughout the whole thing. But this book was one of the worst romance books I've ever read! It started out promising, but the ending was horrible! I kept expecting it to pick up as I read on, but before I knew it, I was at the last few pages and the ending left me more confused and disappointed than I ever thought possible. This is my first review of a book on Amazon and I'm writing because I had to warn others before they made the same mistake I made I did when I bought this book. If you want to read a real romance novel, read any of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. They are the most amazing historical romance books I've ever read! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This is a great book if you are looking for information on breeding boas.It gives strategies and proven methods for a few different boids.The info is great.The reason I did not give this book a 10 is because I think they could have added more pictures for the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally it worked!","review":"I wish the technical support Philips offers was better! It is pathetic!!Bought System I from Target and wired it up. Fantastic sound but the progressive scan pic was red. Called up Philips service but the bloke had no clue. Returend the system thinking it was defective. Enter system II - Panasonic - pathetic sound but good pic. Not so simple to wire. Returned this too! Enter system III - Philips again - red pic again - but this time I was sure that there has to be something wrong with the settings to have 2 sets with the same problem so drilled into the settings and finally got the system working!This system is good value for money indeed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hissing is a Bad Thing","review":"We own the HTS3400 bought at Costco. It is possible that the newer \\"D\\" model has fixed the hissing we hear during stand-by mode. We have owned it about a year now and I believe it is getting louder. When the house is quiet I can hear it in the next room. It doesn't bother my wife; she finds it restful. I don't like it because I don't think it should be making any sound at all. Given the choice I would NOT buy this product again.** Update** This player only lasted a couple years. Now it is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hummer (H 4 maybe?)","review":"Well, I thought I had bought a Home Theater system about a year and half ago. Little did I know that I had also got a Hummer in bargain!!It's been a little over a month since it started humming on powering up. It is almost like it is a kid with a stomach pain - when I apply pressure on the top it cries cries out louder - as if my pressure just increased the pain that it is going through.Although the sound quality is about ok for the price, I would not buy it or recommend it. I am not sure if I will even look at Philips for my next Home Theater after this one either dies out or needs to be euthanised because of the intense pain it seems to be undergoing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD player","review":"I have bought and returned three of these units now. Each one has been defective, and finally I just gave up on returning the system. The DVD player constantly gives \\"Bad Disc\\" errors and skips if there is even the slightest smudge on a disc. The sound quality is very nice for the price, but since the player doesn't work, it's essentially useless. This is a complete rip-off at any price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This system is a very good buy. The sound is quite good and with asimple hack code, this system can be made to play region free.In dvd mode(without a disc in the tray)press- play 1590 2379 390 play.This will change the region code to 0.I have not had any humming problems like other reviewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We bought this last year for my in-laws and as with many, the DVD player already quit working after less than 10 uses. When we purchased the item, it also did not come with all the parts and when we called customer service, we could not give them the serial number because it had been scratched off with a knife (note to other sellers, only buy from Amazon and not third party seller if you aren't looking for a unit with the numbers scraped off). The surroud sound works pretty well, but it seems useless to have such a terrible quality DVD player with it. I think it would be better to just buy a system without a player built in and buy a player to hook up. We will definitely learn from our mistake with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This","review":"I bought this home theater system from Philips last year and it worked fine for about 14 months, and then suddenly it wouldn't read discs any more. Any discs. I tried dozens of clean discs but each time the display would read \\"no disc\\".The warranty only lasts one year so I'm out of luck. Don't make the same mistake I did- don't buy this system. Try another, more reliable brand. Philips just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another duh lesbian guide","review":"Why is it that these comedians write as if we all have below average IQs? This book was only good for me to show to new dates that they should not talk about the exes on a first date. After that, it was Common Sense 101.

However, it is a witty commentary on and guide to same-sex girl relationships and I thought that overall it was a great read. Reading the book really makes me want to see Mo live! This is less a resource guide than a tongue-in-cheek commentary on all aspects of Lesbian singlehood, relationships and dating. A good read for anyone with a sense of humor..gay or straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Becoming A Master Manager - Book Review","review":"I found that the book, Becoming A Master Manager, to not be very helpful in an Introduction to Management course. Although the idea behind this book is good and for the most part helpful, it is not adequate for the type of course I am currently taking. The idea of having each chapter focus on the different managerial roles is one that could potentially be very helpful. Since each section contains various compentencies that focus on different aspects of these roles, this book could be helpful for a course that was structured differently. However, since our class is structured toward the basic fundamentals of management, this book is somewhat useless. To be honest, I did not really look at this book extensively because I had another book that worked better for this class. I just felt it was not worth my time to continue with this book, since it did not help me in my studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally ineffective","review":"I installed these in every room of my apartment about two weeks ago, after seeing a mouse in my bedroom.

I gave it only 4 stars, not 5 because I haven't played the entire game, just the demo. Don't get me wrong, from what I played, it is the most realistic snowboarding game I've played. Everything from the snow scraping off the board to the laces on the boots of the boarder to the realistic wind effects. Everything is awesome in this game. It probally deserves 5 stars, but because I haven't played the real game, and just the demo, I will just give it 4 stars, for now. Just looking at the game makes me want a PlayStation 2!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre game, at best","review":"I had purchased this game right after renting SSX. I had hoped that since it had the ESPN license, that it would be just as good, it not better, than Electionric Art's game. But to my dismay, \\"Winter X Games\\" didn't provide 1/2 of the thrill that SSX did. The animation wasn't as good, the tracks weren't as breathtaking, and you went really slow. And if that wasn't bad enough, the game is incredibly hard. I've been practicing for a month and I still can't match the scores that the A.I. players get. When it comes down to the bottom line, I don't care how authentic a game is if I can't enjoy playing it. If you are looking for a snowboarding game, SSX is definitely your best choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"i seen beter","review":"iv seen better snowboarding games i played it in toys\\"r\\"us the graphics are alright but i dont like the gameplay if you have nothing to do maybe you should get it but i think you should get SSX."},{"rating":"2","title":"This rocks!","review":"This game is the best because its not like those dumb fake games.

U dudes got to get this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Garbage","review":"This game is the worst release for Playstation 2. Its WACK! The graphics are alright, but the boarders look like they all just came out from the hospital and straight to the course. The only thing missing would be crutches. If you want great snowboarding games, do yourself a favor, check out SSX & Cool Boarders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Snowboarding game ever!!!","review":"...Everything is so real unlike SSX (still a great game just unrealistic). In ESPN Winter X you can be pro riders like Peter Line, JP Walker and Tara Dakides. You can also make your own custom boarder and get filmed in movies to make money so you can buy boards, bindings, boots, jackets, pants, and goggles. It even has brands such as Volcom, Billabong, Forum and Four Square. The graphics are amazing and the controls are easy to remember and use. All in all ESPN Snowboarding is the best snowboarding game for the PS2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best realistic snowboarding ever","review":"This game is unbeleivable!

If you like snowboarding run don't walk to buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Game","review":"This is really cool game. It is not really repetitive but after a while you do need a break from it. The graphics are amazing and the feel of playing is also awesome. There are some really cool tricks on this game and they don't take to long to master. Everytime i played i learned new tricks. I give this a 4 star rating because it is a really cool snowboarding game and fun to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Snowboarding Game out!","review":"This is the best snowboarding game I have ever played! If you like a more reaistic game then this is the game for you! Unlike games like cool boarders and ssx this game has all realstic tricks and a wide choice of real snowbarding brands like volcom, burton and forum! The courses are identacal to the 2000 winter Xgames in mnt. snow Vermont! If you get this gam you wont be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snow","review":"i would have to say this game is awsome. it has pretty good graphics and the tricks are pretty realistic instead of the cheesy tricks where you can do triple backflips, you actually can do realistic tricks like rodeos, corkscrews, mctwist, ect. the only thing bad about this game would have to be the grabs, in the game the snowboarder reaches down to grab, i think it would be and look better if they brought the board up to them more like in real life. also, the competitions, they are fun but they are way to short and you only have one try in each competition in the snowboarder mode, you should be able to have the best of 3 or something. i think it is cool how you work your way up to getting sponsored and get filmed. i haven't played cool boarders 2001 or ssx YET, but i think a real serious snowboarder, sorta like myself, would really appreciate this game mostly on its realistic tricks and how you can get sponsored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty tight, but hard","review":"this game is pretty pimp in the snowboarder mode you have to win competions and get $$ to buy your gear. when you beat the second comp you can get sponsered. When you get sponsered you get everything from that company for FREE. Thats right FREE. there is the X-games mode where you can play as your favorite pro like Peter Line, JP Walker, Todd Richards, and even Tara Dakidas. In the X-games mode the courses are the exact same as in the real Mount Snow Vermont. I have SSX and X-games and I think SSX is a little better because X-games is WAY to hard. If SSX had the real pro's and just had the showoff mode(where you do tricks) and not racing mode everyone would want that game."},{"rating":"1","title":"SSX IS WAY BETTER......","review":"Unless you are a real snowboarder (which I am not) and into watching ESPN Winter X-Games 24-7 you will prob. think this game really sucks...for the money buy SSX Tricky, and thank me later...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hollywood legend under the spotlight","review":"Nellie Bly has done a superb job in documenting the incredible life of excess of one of the greatest actors ever.

The standout tracks to me would have to be \\"Papercuts\\", \\"Cupids Chokehold\\", \\"Faces In the Hall\\", and \\"Taxi Driver.\\"If you like music such as the The Roots or N.E.R.D. or if you just want to try something new, check out The Papercut Chronicles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gym Class Heroes worth the money","review":"I'm not going to start by saying this album was refreshing, but do have to say it was very good or close to excellent.

My skill level is not very high (around 1300 rating), and much of the DVD talks about looping and more advanced skills than I possess. However, there are sections on warm ups, drills, and other areas (notably lobbing) which I found both interesting and helpful. If you are serious about table tennis and have a rating under 1500, this may be for you. I especially enjoyed some of the actual tournament play sequences to illustrate certain techniques (the lobbing in particular was super). Hey, it's cheaper than a decent sheet of rubber, so you might buy it and share it with your club (helps everyone). I do recommend it. One thing they do not cover in the video is doubles.

The games I reccomend are Diddy Kong Racing and Zelda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun and interesting, and challenging enough","review":"This game is really fun. You can pick what Rugrat you are, and you can play 1 to 4 players. The games that you can play are mostly fun, but some of them, like ninja bumper cars and start the music, are near about immpossible to beat. Also, mini-golf takes forever. You can only explore EuroReptar Land with 1 player. Otherwise, the computer picks four games for you to play, and after everyone's had a turn at each game, whoever has the most red tickets wins and it's over. Red tickets float around in some games and you can get them by walking into them, plus you recieve them when you win different games. This game is really fun and you don't get tired of it after a while like some games, so I would recomend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Kewl!","review":"I loved this game! So many fun games to play in one! My favorite game is probaly the Chuckie Chan! I'll suggest this to almost any Rugrat fan!

We all loved the movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Fun","review":"This game is fun for both kids and adults. There are so many different games to play, such as miniature golf, bumper cars, and skeet ball that it will keep you entertained for hours. The only game I didn't like was the miniature golf, which took forever if you don't aim correctly. You have your pick of characters from the Rugrat family. My sons' favorite is baby Tommy. Mine is Angelica. She laughs maniacally as you guide her through the mazes to hunt for red tickets. Rugrats in Paris also has another challenge. For instance, I had to obtain 50 red tickets to buy a pencil from the prize booth to give to Tommy in exchange for a gold ticket. The challenge was remembering where to find him.All that aside, this is a very easy game to play. There are no fancy maneuvers you have to make (aside from the golf game). The premise of the game is easy to understand even for the little kids. This game was definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"In this DVD we find out in the first episode featured that Vincent price has a talent for humor that you don't normally get a chance to appreciate.

It's hard to find a really good female artist who can pull off the electronic genre. For anyone into synth, goth, industrial,or music to dance to, this cd is of great choice. I stumbled upon the artist when visiting a club out west where she performed. I knew I just had to get the cd. Her songs were tatooed in my brain before the end of the show.

The version I bought included a second disc of remixes which I enjoyed listening to a lot as well. I really recommend catching Ayria live.

Her songs sounds amazing live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretend the 2 means 2.5--Not a DVD worth buying","review":"You might be looking at the card and thinking (wow this is pretty sweet maybe I should buy it or Netflix it) But I'd advise against it. As neat as it is that the PPV features the UFC debuts of Rampage and CroCop, neither fight is entertaining. Quinton's was especially disappointing as the first round was seen by many as rather boring. Before the finish actually it all was pretty unentertaining. In CroCop's case, he was booked purposefully against a less skilled fighter to get him over with the audience unfamiliar with him. Well he destroys the guy, but it's not as fun as some of his other one sided beat downs.For the rest of the card, Lyoto and Cote both have boring fights while the main event is decided in a non-title fight with a contender who's overweight and already gassed. Though it is interesting how close he is to finishing Silva. His exhaustion point cost him dearly though.

It is probably the hardest game to navigate around, and you can't even tell what you are trying to do in this game. The game play is horrible, the graphics are horrible, I can't find one thing I like about this game. If you want to spend $50+ for a good basketball game, but an old Sega and play some of there's.

However, I wish I had bought another one of their albums (such as Welcome to Mali) instead of this one, which I find to be overly influenced by Chau and his repetitive music. A few of the songs are okay , but as an album it doesn't sound much like Amadou and Mariam, lacks their joyful music and singing, and gives over entirely to nasal Chau who seems to sound the same on every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"OIL MAN","review":"I bought this book for my husband.

This game should have never been translated to ANY console and you will notice this quickly after playing for a minute or two.

My guy beat this game in one day...he had to take a couple of breaks to let some steam out hitting his golf clubs. I have been told the arcade game is way more enjoyable.

Dont get me wrong... Metal Gear Solid was the greatest and still the greatest game! Even using the PSG1 was more fun than playing silent scope.If you really liked the arcade versions of Silent Scope and Dark Sillowette, the console versions would just be a little let down since you cant use the large sniper gun.

The gun was the whole attraction of the game, which was otherwise just a dull shoot-em-up.But my question is why? Why repackage a game that was clearly marked for the Arcades with the extra guns and what-not. Yes, Playstation has had some success in repackaging some of the arcade games for play at home, and yes thay have made great games with shooter attributes without the gun, but if they were to re-package a shooter game where people have gotten used to using a gun in the arcade for Playstation-2, they should (and could) have gave us some sort of a gun for just a few dollars extra and at least made it worth its while."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY","review":"I got this game with my ... pal ps2 and it .... its cool at first (but only with a mouse, the joystick settings are terrible) but it gets boring, and it doesnt give you the arcade feeling of the cool sniper gun. the only thing that keeps me playing it are the cool secret modes for expert snipers (available in the official website)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Johnny, Get Your Gun","review":"This would be an EXCELLENT game if they'd managed to ship a light gun with a scope on it with the product.Instead...I think it's best played at the arcade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Pure junk.

The \\"scope\\" moves so slowly, and it is rather frustrating to look for enemies while being shot sixty million times because it takes twelve years to move the gun scope around to find targets.

When I first got my PS2, this was one of my first games. Actually it was the first I played. The game is very disappointing. First of all, unlike the gun feature at the arcade, using the joystick makes scoping in on targets difficult at best. This is even more true when shooting at bosses. The sound was nothing special. The graphics were ok. These short-falls in the game would have been ok if the gameplay was there. So, if I could go back in time, I'd rent it and never rent it again.

David Phelps has always been the singer that I have strived be, but I could hardly make it through the sample sound clips. After hearing Revelation, I was impressed at how he put his own spin on rather contemporary sounding songs, but he still had a rather classical sounding voice.

When I originally read the comic, the formatting seemed weird: the pages seemed like they should have been presented in a horizontal format (like they are in this hardcover collection). The problem with this double-dipping publishing strategy is that it will scare people away from buying the original comics if they know they are going to get double-dipped later. I know I won't be buying anymore 'Eightball' comics knowing I'm going to get double-dipped later. Should you buy this comic? Yes, if you don't have the original comic.

I know, I know -- Clowes is one of the stars of the genre, and I actually very much enjoyed the award-winning _Ghost World,_ but this one isn't in that league at all. In structure, it's a series of very brief, semi-connected vignettes centered on a variety of residents of the town of Ice Haven, most of them teenage or younger.

The next day he shot most of the morning. Then some of his friends came over and they shot. By late afternoon all the stiching had come loose from the elastic straps so the guard could not be worn. Rather than return it we stitched it back together. The design it good because it can fit tiny arms like my son if the straps are crisscrossed or large arms with the straps straight around. The materials are good quality. The construction is the weak point. Lots of the stiching did not line up so you had stiching that did not actually attach anything. That is a big mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"very practical","review":"yes this is a very practical piece of equipment to have, though i wish there were sizes for longer arms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"I kind of liked it better back when I made my own guard out of duct tape.

The many quotes from those involved, coupled with the great story telling, has given me a good sense of how these cars came about.The gorgeous photography does a great job of covering these cars in phenomenal detail.

There's evidently a lot of good research behind it, but it's hidden beneath the taunting of the Diary doubters. The whole tone seems to be to whip up the folks who already agree with him. Folks who believe the Diary is a hoax won't be persuaded by this book, and people like me who have no prior knowledge of the controversy aren't likely to be convinced by Feldman's ranting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitively not the final chapter","review":"Paul Feldman certainly works hard to prove his thesis that Liverpool merchant James Maybrick wrote the infamous Diary and that this gentleman was the Whitechapel Murderer. Regrettably, the author's style and methodology leave a great deal to be desired. The writing is poorly directed and tilts at the wrong targets. Much of the argument is facile and lacks credibility. Some of the theorising is interesting, but overall there are so many red herrings that the theory has no credibility. Written in the 'train of events' style beloved of many novice writers, the book is unpleasant to read and not a little insulting in places. Ideal as a primer on how not to write a true crime book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feldman does his best to keep the Dead Horse going","review":"Feldman does his best, but this book--a follow up to THE DIARY OF JACK THE RIPPER--is ultimately diappointing. Too many books have dealt with too many aspects of the Diary in recent years, and the sum total of it all leaves Feldman fighting a tide of circumstantial evidence with even *more* circumstancial evidence.

However, I liked this book so much that I purchased a few hundred to hand out to my congregation this Sunday. While I appreciated the other authors treatments, the obvious problem I see Dan Brown's book uncovering is the masses are biblically illiterate, ignorant and gullible. Many actually believe The DaVinci Code's claims! While other books on the subject are scholarly and good, this little book by Josh McDowell is interesting, informative and very readable, by the masses. I think the relational style of pulling you into the coffee shop to sit in with three college students who are asking great questions WITHOUT GETTING ANGRY at each other, is brilliant and is a model of how to \\"share the hope we have in us with gentleness and respect.\\" Thank you Josh for your excellent work and providing the books at such an exceptionally low cost.

This is a case where artistic growth doesn't make the band suck - the songs are still just as powerful and original and it has an extra-heavy quality that the other albums don't. One thing that strikes me is how much it sounds like Gruntruck, the lead singer's other band. If you are a fan of Gruntruck, or Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, or any dark-sounding early grunge music for that matter, I highly recommend this - the songs are fantastic, the production is incredible (if you care about that sort of thing), and it is possibly the best music from a band that heavily inspired Alice in Chains' sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for adults too!","review":"I also ended up buying this after checking it out from the library first. I couldn't decide between this and Kids Knitting by Melanie Falick so I got both for a 10-year-old. Kids Knitting has some beautiful color pictures and more projects but Kid's Easy Knitting has the basics and is more reasonably priced for someone you're not sure will continue to knit. Each has strengths and weaknesses in how they explain techniques; if you don't understand how they're explaining it in one book, it's helpful to look at the other one.

They explicate a complex topic systematically and render theoretical constructs immediately useful. Numerous clinical examples add clarity and life to the theoretical aspects of their presentation. This book is readable by practicing clinicians and by the interested non-professional. As a post-graduate lecturer and psychoanalytic supervisor, I have found this book to be an excellent introduction to Kohut's Self Psychology primarily due to the authors' ability to hold the readers interest, to make difficult concepts clear, and to stay close to Kohut's the original ideas.

Now the bottle has internal leaks and plain hot water will pour out brown after a couple of hours.There apparently is no warranty on this product, and writing and emailing to many of the US distributors and the European headquarters have produced nothing in 3 months.

He may be both the most concrete of improvisors and the most abstract, with clear grounding for his stranger moments. ////See him live///: BF has a surprisingly joyful stage presence,, rather than the serious demeaner I would have thought such a master might have.

Whereas on the show, comedy was mixed in with emotion for the genuinely geeky otaku, in this film, they've basically take a pretty boy Japanese actor, put a bad wig and glasses on him, then guess what? half way through the story they give him a makeover, and voila! he becomes a pretty boy again. puleez. Two favorable points about this film, The TV actors makes a cameo at the very end, picking up the continuity for the TV movie, Densha Otoko Deluxe. Train Man: The Movie exists within the 'world' of Train Man, that is, when his story became famous in the TV series, they made a film out of his life, being this film. After its release in Japan, they made Densha Otoko Deluxe, wherein they show posters for the film and ridicule it. The film's release has made all otaku celebrities, and women hound them wherever they go. Complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice movie","review":"The story is inspired from real-life events in Japan. Nerdy boy rescues beautiful girl in a subway train from a drunk tough guy. The profusely shy and apologetic hero gets help from anonymous friends on an Internet User group (Bulletin Board Service) and musters courage to ask the girl out. Boy has immense insecurity issues and girl waits patiently as he works them out. A similar real-life event was reported in New York a few years ago when a man first saw the love of his life on a subway. The girl got off at a station before guy could speak with her. He soon located her through the \\"Lost and Found\\" section in Craig's List. It is not known if that encounter transformed into a lifelong relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Quirky","review":"This is a sweet romantic comedy. The geek falls for the pretty girl and must find away to win her with the help of his internet friends. All the characters are quite interesting and you really start to root for train man by the end. There are a few scenes that are a little difficult for an American audience to get culturally speaking, but overall it is very cute. I would highly recommend it to people who like quirky movies and quirky romances."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie for everyone","review":"A wonderful, sweet movie, with superb performances by Takayuki Yamada and Miki Nakatani. Unlike American romantic comedies which culminate with the two main characters getting together in bed, this film focuses not only on the awkwardness and difficulties of first love, but the impact one person has on the live of others. As Train Man's fellow chat-room members (who are invisible to him) help him and cheer him on, we the viewers see their own lives change as well, as they gain courage to move on and become better human beings.As a Japanese film, this story works well. If Hollywood gets hold of it and Americanizes it, like they did with 'Shall We Dance?' it will be ruined!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Geeks in love...","review":"Train Man is a very funny, touching and twisted story of a young guy who falls in love with an older woman. The only problem is he is a Otaku who has no social skills. In fact, outside of the world of computers, anime and the world wide web, he has no other skills to speak of. So the people on 2ch, the most popular and largest bulletin board in Japan and the world, decide to help him with hints, advice and encouragement. In the end his own actions also encourage them to turn off the computers, step outside and face the real world.With Otaku commentary, an ASCII art dictionary, culture tips and Train Man manga information, this disc has a lot of extras. I enjoyed watching this film and would suggest it to everybody into Japanese culture, Otaku culture or just enjoys a good love story. Even if it isn't true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"We played an older version of this game back in the 80's. Great to see it's still around.

Here, all you get are still shots of previous Gradius box artwork. But the newly-created into cinematics were awesome. Maybe Konami should look into creating a new Gradius game, one designed to take advantage of the PS2's power.So pick up this title only if you have all the other games and need Gradius 4 to finish your collection, which, being a newer game, has much better graphics and sound.

This version actually has fewer weapons and options! Furthermore, I don't know if this is related to my config or what, but the only sound on this disc comes from the intro movie. The games are played in silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"While this is the original (not enhanced, very original) versions, the graphics on the box seemed to mislead me into thinking that this was going to be a pretty awesome version.

In this age of cross-dressing, transexuals, transgenders, and generally confusing messages from all directions, Eller explores what it means to be a woman these days. She may as well discuss what it mans to be a human being, it is that basic.I enjoyed Eller's convversational style and sometimes alarming frankness.

Read it in 2 days, time out for work and sleep. The characters were more fleshed out and if you didn't care about them by the end of the first book, you did in this one.

An engaging storyline, characters that a reader could quickly identify with, a budding romance that takes your breath away. Then I read \\"Wounded\\" the sequel...and found that all the wonderful points I adored \\"Vulnerable\\" for were even better! Cory, the lead female protagonist, and Green deal with a horrible personal loss. This loss has the capacity to either bind them closer together forever...or rip them apart. A fabulous mixture of paranormal, urban fantasy, romance, and even a spot of humor create the perfect read in \\"Wounded\\".

For those of us non-professional mortals that can't afford the really expensive glass (and be able to write it off on our taxes), this is a good place to start. It's a nice solidly constructed lens that feels a lot more professional than most of the typical consumer grade lenses that I've had the opportunity to mess around with. The only flaw that I can find with the lens is the light fall off that creeps in when you're close to 18mm and in the neighborhood of f/3.5 to f/4. Personally, I like the look that gives in certain images, and used to Photoshop that in quite frequently before I purchased this lens. It covers a good focal length range, and almost never comes off my camera unless I'm using a specialist lens for some specialist reason. For general day to day photography, it's wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't mind Dirt INSIDE!","review":"This is a great lens for outdoor photography and works ok indoors with a flash. Also a good all-around starter lens. I purchased mine in a kit with my camera.However when Nikon designed the lens they ignored the fact that every time the lens is zoomed in and out, it sucks in dirt and dust from the outside like a vacuum cleaner! After owning it for only a couple months, I started noticing dust inside all over the front lens group. Once contaminated on the inside, there is no economic way to remove the dust. Having it serviced by a Nikon authorized tech is cost prohibitive. Might as well buy a new lens. Too bad, otherwise it's a very versatile lens. If it weren't such a dust sucker, I would rate it 4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great till it broke","review":"I purchased this lens 6 months ago. I started out being every thing I hoped for. I was light weight and takes decent pictures. I know better than to compare this with some of my 2.8 lenses, but, this lens held its own. The pictures were acceptable and it was easy to use. That was until it stopped working. Last week I went to Florida and was taking some pictures when the zoom stopped working, fortunately I had other lenses with me. First it would no longer go down to 18mm and then stopped going up to 70mm. That left me with a 28-50mm lens. Even at those ranges the zoom was very stiff. As I said I wasn't expecting a great lens, but, I was expecting it to last more than 6 months. I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product good, Delivery toooooooo slow","review":"Love the lens.

My brother bought this game for his 7 year old daughter who kept calling me to help her play, because she kept saying \\"it's too hard\\". Kids loose interest in extremely difficult games, since you can't get much proggress playing for hours and IT IS hard to get golden tickets! And you can't do anything without them.About Graphics, I think they could have done a better job. It's kinda fun with the character's comments but that's just it.

You can wind the strap to get a very good hold on the rack but be sure not to over-tighten so that you don't damage the factory rack (if that is where you are using the foot pads). I purchases the multi-lock pack so that I am able to use multiple locks with the same key. If you anticipate that you will use may types of racks or lockable systems, it is also a good investment. Once I placed the foot packs to wear I needed them to be, it was a simply install and very secure once the locks went in.

There was something there. A sound that was tight and had enough variation in hooks that it reminded me of something familiar. Several songs reminded me of the Clash. A couple of songs reminded me of Tenpole Tudor (I told you I'm aging!).

I watched it with my kid because I thought it would be educational. The title and description give the impression that this is about the engineering feats of the Romans. Instead, it was mostly a sensationalized pseudo-history of the Roman Empire emphasizing as much blood and gore as possible. This DVD is prime evidence of how low the History Channel is willing to go. The actual engineering feats are quickly brushed over, giving almost no details at all. Instead, the emphasis is on bloody violence, such as the stabbing of Caesar, gladiatorial gore, and Nero's murder of his mother.

What he brings to us with \\"Showtunes\\" is more of his clever lyrics and catchy tunes.One track is especially remarkable - \\"Hail, Son of Heaven\\". It sounds to me like the Iraq War Anthem.

Before you allow this to sway you, look at his other reviews. This is a guy who's favorite band seems to be Chicago. Also, it would appear that he has purchased more than one box set of the TV show \\"Frasier\\".Take a negative review by this guy as a sign that the \\"Showtunes\\" album might well be excellent.Stephen Merritt might be a little too adventurous for someone who's brain has been turned to pudding by the blandness of Chicago and Blood, Sweat & Tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Drivel I've Ever Heard","review":"This album exemplifies the relentless self-absorption and boredom of performance art.

I thought that Hero's Trial was great, so the conclusion must be even better, right? Well, I don't think this one measures up to its predecessor.Many parts were great. I thought the Han-Droma breakout was great. Even Wurth Skidder and the yammosk was good. The best, however, is the last chapter with its stunning revelation that makes you wish James Luceno would've kept the story going.I didn't really care for the Centerpoint Station's role or the Hapans' parts in the novel. Centerpoint just seemed a little too convenient.This book is a worthy addition to the New Jedi Order, and I'm looking forward to more of James Luceno's writings. This book is worth your time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best NJO book yet!!!","review":"I totally enjoyed reading this book and found it very difficult to put down. Another nice thing about this book is you need only to have read Agents of Chaos to understand it. The only problem I have with it is I wish Mara was in the book and wanted more Luke/Mara."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Book","review":"I ordered the book listed (Star Wars New Jedi Order, Agents of Chaos 2, Jedi Eclipse)but received Star Wars New Jedi Order, Agents of Chaos 1, Hero's Trail. A book which I had already ordered from a different company."},{"rating":"1","title":"90% build up for 50 good action pages","review":"I have read 20 or more Star Wars books. This one is the first book that I put down for days with out wanting to pick it up. I finally got interested and finished the book when the action started about 50 pages from the end. This book has way to much build up and way to little action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too happy with this book","review":"Sorry, I just don't like this book very much. Solo is hands-down my favorite character in the Star Wars universe, and I feel that Luceno's storyline is not doing him justice. This is due, IMHO, to an attempt to cram too much into a couple hundred pages. I agree with a previous reviewer that this novel (and the entire NJO series) feels like it was rushed into production using a set formula (must have ALL the surviving Heroes of Yavin AND some history AND be under a certain number of pages in order to make budget). In short, it is a valiant effort, but tries to do too much in a relatively short book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things are looking grim, and I love it!","review":"At the end of JEDI ECLIPSE, I could not believe how poorly things were going for the New Republic and the Jedi. I absolutely love the fact that this book leaves tons of loose ends at the end, and that I have no idea at this point in the NJO series how the Yuuzhan Vong are ever going to be defeated. I have really enjoyed Luceno's style of writing. I think his dialogue is true to the SW characters, and I especially like his ability to inject humor into his stories despite the generally grim situations the characters are in. One of my favorite dialogue scenes is the one between Han and Leia near the end of ECLIPSE. It is a dead-on read of the characters. Can't wait to read BALANCE POINT."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad","review":"I thought it was just me. But after reading some other reviews I'm glad it's not just me. This book [is bad.] I can't stand this writer he's just bad. Whenever he went to describing some planet or space station or creature, I lost interest. It's almost like he's trying to hard to be good. It took me a long time to make it through this book. Read it casue you need to, but you won't enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agents of Chaos II : Jedi Eclipse (Star Wars: The New Jedi O","review":"This book is very exciting. It gets a lot of information from the books previous to it. (agents of chaos , vector prime) It is however a good book on its own. This book takes a lot of information from other books wich makes it a key read. Try not to miss out on this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring. The worst of the NJO series.","review":"Jedi Eclipse is boring. There is nothing original about it. Han Solo continues to run around with the Chewie clone, and there is a small subplot involving Anakin and Jacen but overall, there is nothing original or exciting in the this novel. There is simply to little going on to justify the amount of writing Luceno does for this story. The only original idea in the entire story is the droid revolution that Han Solo gets involved in. Jacen is portrayed as a whiny, spoiled brat, while Anakin could have ended the whole NJO series with the flick of a button. There is too much that doesn't add up, and too little of the other SW characters to make this book interesting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This book is a disappointing effort by a very capable and stylish author. While much of it will interest Star Wars fans, it lacks a believable story line.Chief among these story problems is that the most famous Jedi don't know if they should fight to save their own galaxy from the biggest threat in history. The Jedi act like immature adolescents who don't know the difference between idealism and duty.Another story problem for the reader is finding a way to get interested in the \\"refugee evacuation challenge\\", to which 50% of the book is dedicated. This plot is clearly insignificant compared to the Galactic War, yet the war remains firmly in the background until the very end of the book.If you need to read this book to \\"connect the dots\\" in the series, go ahead, it's well written. If you're looking for a \\"gem\\" from the many Star Wars books written to this point, continue your search."},{"rating":"1","title":"The NJO series just isn't getting any better...","review":"The plot was mildly interesting but not enough happened in order to keep the book entertaining. It follow's the same basic concept of all its predicesors: the Republic is about to accomplish something but in the end the accomplishment is foiled by the Vong and they get one step closer to Coruscant. Nothing is accomplished in the entire book.Don't get me wrong I'm a full blooded Star Wars fan, I've read just about every Star Wars book out there, including the other NJO books, but if you ask me you should save yourself the money and skip Onslaught on up through Conquest; you won't have missed anything by doing so.R.A.

There were at LEAST 15 comments like: \\"for more information on this topic, please read our book .....\\" The fact is, I was reading THIS book, and the information was not there. The length of the book, apart from the appendix, is only 120 pages, and there are so many graphs and charts in here, that there isn't any real meat to this book.Maybe the authors knew what they were doing by telling us to go read their other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Buy","review":"I got the Sanus DFSAT, but immediately returned them because I thought the product was not worth the price I paid. The Nustone based does not have the \\"look and feel\\" of granite, instead, it is really just medium grade plastic.The stand itself is too light, and the base is too small, so there is a risk of the standing falling over. While my speaker wires may be on the thick side, the holes to guide the wire through the poles were too small. The entire stand is basically held together by two screws, and thus the entire construction will, at best, be always wobbly and insecure.I do not recommend purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well with satellite speakers","review":"This stand is perfect for small satellite speakers (which I use). The base of the speaker stand is heavy and provides excellent overall stability. Only a hurricane would knock these stands over (No need to use carpet spikes). The ability to adjust the speaker height is also a bonus. The speaker wire can be conveniently hid inside the speaker \\"pole\\". I was able to hide 16 gauge speaker wire easily.Although I was shocked that speaker stands in general are SO expensive, I am very happy with this product. Hence, I'm dinging it one start due to price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this crossword book if you already have....","review":"I frequently do crossword puzzles and am always buying the New York Times Easy Crossword Puzzle books. This one is really disappointing, it has many of the same puzzles as The New York Times Crosswords for a Lazy Afternoon : 200 Easy, Breezy Puzzles. It was a waste to spend money on this book when it has the same puzzles as the other book. It sucks to open up to a random page and have the puzzle be exactly the same as one I have already done. I wanted an easy crossword book, that just makes it too easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"comparable to CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL","review":"Battlefield Baseball is a wonderful outrageous film, similar to CANNIBAL! THE MUSICAL. It's a lowbudget romp with an abundance of cheesy jokes, plenty of gory bloody effects, and an occasional musical number. It's also got a ridiculous psuedo-heart warming backstory behind the main character.What it has beyond, though, is crazy zombie-like monsters intent on killing, and who kill in bizarre baseball-related ways. It's got off the wall martial arts battles between family members. Just top notch.It slows here and there, but still picks things up again pretty quickly and easily gets you back in the swing of the humor and action.So if you've been looking for a baseball movie with tons of violence, over the top silliness, and a couple of musical numbers, this is absolutely your one stop shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed.

Then, here's the big one...once engaged, all you have to do to shut it up is hold the handle down. Well, what offic doesn't have tape or rubber bands.

For that reason I started to pick up his original LPs and, since digital days, quite a few of the the compact disc tributes. What is really disappointing is the way that much of the same recordings seem to get re-packaged over the years and just the odd new track is added to make die-hard fans buy it.

The examples on ConsoleOne and NWAdmin don't tell you where to find them or how to set them up or how to add snap-ins. It seems to be unncessarily detailed in some areas and missing vital information in other areas. It is definitely not the book for someone studying for the CNE 6 exam.In short, I regret buying the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mastering Netware 6 by James E. Gaskin","review":"This is the worst book i have ever read. The title seems attractive \\"Mastering Netware 6\\", but please don't expect you can master Netware 6 after reading this whole book. What you will learn here is just the basic skills in using Netware 6. There is again and again explanations of how to configure NDS settings such as set restrictions. Just a few easy steps but the steps are listed and explained again and again in different chapters. There is only one reason to buy this book....for the 90 days evaluation Netware 6 CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly comprehensive","review":"...It has precious little or ,in some cases, no information on the new NetWare 6 features. Every time I have referred to it, the information I need just isn't there.If you are looking for information on NetWare 6 clustering then look elsewhere. There's just a short review of Cluster Services for NetWare 5.1, which is about as much use as a chocolate teapot. This is inexcusable, considering that clustering is an integral part of NetWare 6.You're far better off looking at Novell's on line documentation (and that's not saying much!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music That Touches The Soul","review":"He has really outdone himself. This is an absolutely amazing album. Every single song is fantastic. The way he has captured words of love, of pain and of longing for another touches the deepest part of your heart. You ache and your every sense comes alive. He makes you fall in love again. Song #3, Dastam Begir, is my absolute favorite. I cried. The music of song #4 is \\"Pink Floydish\\". His words are so intuitively familiar and so poetically put together. This album is absolutely worth buying. You should get one for the car and one for home."},{"rating":"2","title":"PARKER DOES IT AGAIN!!!","review":"I have read many, many of the Spencer books. Some I liked better than others. I rank this one close to the top. Spencer is hired to find out who killed Olivia Nelson. She was killed with many blows to the head with a hammer. The police have done all they can to find the killer but had no success. Spencer is hired by Olivia's husband. A trip is made back to a town in South Carolina, where Olivia Nelson came from. But is her real name Olivia Nelson? Yes, there is a person by that name but where is she? Why would a Senator want to keep Spencer from finding out anything? Spencer in jail?????? Many, many twists and turns. The ending is very good, really two endings, finding the killer and finding out about the senator. A good Spencer read! The only thing that would make it better, for me, would be less Susan and more Hawk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good dialogue, undeveloped plot","review":"I have read several of the Spenser books. This one started very promisingly, with witty dialogue and an interesting background. But about halfway through the book, the plot gave out. Spenser gets a lucky (too lucky) break when he spots a certain photograph, but the thread it offers to unravel the mystery is only minimally drawn out. The murdered woman remains a cipher to the end, her secrets barely unveiled. Too many secondary characters are mere page-filling red herrings (the sexy secretary, the sexy Southern detective, the overaggressive teenager). The murderer eventually just confesses his/her guilt to a passive Spenser. And, worst of all, at the last moment, to create the illusion of closure, the author invents a new, unrelated crime, both nameless and motivationless, so that Spenser can have one of the suspects arrested in a sham climax. A good premise gone nowhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some tragic stories unfolded as a mystery","review":"This is another Spenser story with the flavor of a who-dun-it and a very tragic undertone as you learn the stories of the murdered woman, her husband and children, her mother, her father and his servant, and a new continuing character introduced in this story, a gay police detective named Farrell.Part of Parker's skill is shown in the way previous characters reappear. There's a brief reference to Vinnie, Joe Broz' long time hit man who left the mobster in a previous story. Susan plays a lesser role this time, as does Hawk. In Hawk's case, this is only fair since he carried the last book in the series.All in all, this is a very good Spenser, but be prepared for the underlying tragedy of several lives here."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Better Spensers","review":"I've read most of the Spenser novels, and I find them great entertainment. The problem, however, is that most of the later ones pretty much follow the same formula, and ultimately end up being quite predictable. Still, Robert Parker is a good enough writer that I enjoy nearly all of his books, even though I find them pretty much by-the-numbers at this point.PAPER DOLL is a murder mystery that has a couple of decent twists, and I was genuinely surprised by the identity of the culprit. Some of the characters, such as the corrupt U.S. Senator, are on the cartoonish side, but that's a minor complaint. The dialogue and descriptions are top notch, and you can finish this novel in one or two sittings.In short, PAPER DOLL is a fun diversion, although not a spectacular effort. If you want a great Spenser book, you may want to try one of Parker's earlier novels, such as GOD SAVE THE CHILD, EARLY AUTUMN, or THE JUDAS GOAT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book has very little narrative summary to support the dialogue. As a result, it reads much like a movie script. Character development is weak and inconsistent, and the prose is almost juvenile in spots. It is something I would expect to see from a freshman college student, not a well-respected, seasoned author. I haven't read Parker's other books, so perhaps they are all written in this same over-simplistic style. It apparently works for some people, but not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Control Function EVER!!!","review":"I love the films, I think the game set up is great, familular and fun.

The two handed weapon system would be cool if it had ANY accuracy what-so-ever. Even the simple process of opening a door becomes tedious. Walk up to the door, hit O, nothing happens. Walk up to the same door at a different angle, press O, still nothing. Repeat about 5 times until success...and all the while constantly respawning Deadites are pounding on you. That is of course if you can find any doors aside from those in the cabin. You may just give up after wandering aimlessly around the woods for two hours without any hints of where you should be and what you should be doing. The annoying camera angles and mundane backgrounds don't help...often times there will be a path or item right in front of you and you can't even see it!!

The animated intro is the best part of the game and you don't actually play during that part. The enemies are confusing and the ammo/weapons ratio are low.Many times it's confusing where you need to be, and where to go. I would recommend you rent this title from a local video store before EVER buying it. Try it first and if you like it, then buy it, but I'm a big fan of Sam Raimi, Evil Dead and Bruce Campbell and I think this game is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy it if you're an Evil Dead fan..","review":"..otherwise, don't bother. Even then rent it first. The story line is kinda decent. There's two things that turn me off about the game. The controls are crap. I've had better control over a game after I drank 12 beers. The other thing that turns me off is the fact that the deadites never stop respawning. Ever. So you never really clear a board in addition they also hit for a bit of damage. If you're not careful you can die with only being hit 3 times. I really looked forward to this game when I heard it was being done. I'm really disappointed in the result."},{"rating":"2","title":"The dead rises again...","review":"This game is a spectacular instalment of the past 90's movies \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"Army of Darkness\\". It uses great voice overs (For instance... Bruce Cambell).

I reccomend this game for (...) teens everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not Great","review":"I bought this game over amazon.com, because ever since I heard about it in July, 2000, I've been waiting forever. I bought it and immediately put it into the Playstation. I thought it was ok at first, but the Deadites keep coming back. You get no clues on where to go. Your chainsaw runs out of gas all the time. And the Deadite's hardly give you health. The boss's were hard, the deadite's were hard. And when I got to disc 2, I said, \\"That was the shortest ... disc I've ever seen. They should of made it only 1 disc.\\" I beat the game in about 3 hours total. The ending wasn't much of an ending. And there were too many bosses. I give this game a 2 star. 1 star for giving you something to do for 4 hours. Another star for Bruce Campbell's voice. Don't waist ... your hard earned money. Rent it and beat it that day."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks it is not fun at all it is way to hard.","review":"The only good things I can say about this game is the graphics are good and bruce campbell's voice acting is good but the gameplay sucks and the game is not fun at all when your chainsaw runs out of fuel in the game and the chainsaw is your most useful weapon in the whole entire game because your shotgun handgun and rifle are all pretty much useless the left handed weapons in Evil Dead A Fistful Of Boomstick like your 3 shotguns and your gatling guns you have and your laucher you have in that game are so much better and so much more useful than the 3 left handed weapons you have in Evil Dead Hail To The King this game sucks ass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I would not have open it","review":"How is it that a sucky game like this one retails at almost $100.

I tried to get some where in it 3 times but I finally gave up after the monsters kept killing my person.If you're one of those people who love really difficult games that are hard to get any where in then this game is for you. But if you're one of those people who would at least like to get some where in the game this probably isn't the game for you.Over all good graphics and music. Just to difficult to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first foray of the cult Evil Dead horror movie series into video games began here with Evil Dead: Hail to the King. Using the Resident Evil formula of pre-rendered backgrounds with 3-D animated characters, Evil Dead suffers from poor polygon designs, clunky controls, and the same \\"find the key to open the door\\" type gameplay we've seen in games like the Resident Evil series and Alone in the Dark. Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell lends his voice to Ash and breathes some life into this otherwise dismal game, but the terrible control layout and configuration really bring this game down. The Dreamcast version was a bit better with improved graphic and sound quality, but all in all Evil Dead: Hail to the King is worth checking out for fans of the Evil Dead series or survival horror games only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible","review":"I cannot wrie much on this game as I just cannot get anywhere with it.

I was instantly overwhelmed by the amount of screws and parts. The poles are pvc and do not fit easily into each other. The little plastic bumps that are on each piece to help you align the poles break off easily so it's hard to get them straight. I bought two sets but don't want to spend the 30.00 to send them back so I'm stuck with them.

But I found the author's glib style and the lack of thorough editing to be rather distracting. I read the book in short bursts, but usually found myself aggravated at the poor editing -- typographical errors and incorrect use of words -- which, for me, detracted significantly from the points the author was trying to make. In addition, the author has a very \\"black and white\\" view of the world, and uses expressions like \\"There are only two possible reasons for this...\\" when there are clearly other options as well. Given these defects, I cannot recommend this book without serious reservations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic tray melted","review":"The plastic tray included for microwaving the chicle melted (leaving a big mess in the microwave).

Would have been really helpful to include some empty paint pots as I can't sit down for long sessions at a time to complete them and hate to let it dry out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Autumn Wolf","review":"I have to say that Dimensions creates incredible paint by number kits. This is the second one I have completed and I plan on doing many more. I bought this to have a relaxing activity to keep me occupied while listening to books on tape (multitasking hobbies!). The painting is very detailed and many of the areas to paint are small (so not really suitable for small children or older adults who may have arthritis, etc). This results in a fantastic finished product, however. Plus the mixing of paints allows for variety and some creativity on the part of the painter. So if even you and a friend do the same painting, it may not turn out exactly alike :) I love the colors in this particular kit. It's great for fall with the oranges and reds. The wolf is very realistic and not cartoony like some other kits I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I enjoyed doing this one and it came out just like the picture on the box.

Hmmmm... maybe I'm gonna start my own gossip column... maybe not.I will say I'm sure I'll buy Sheryl's next CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proud to be a Crow Fan","review":"I think the core of Sheryl Crow's fan base comes from her remarkable ability to \\"sing the soul\\" of her followers while graciously giving us a glimpse into her own. Even at her most upbeat and rock-riffed self she still displayed a sense of things that was always grounded in humanity and embraced our nature to dance in both the dark and light sides of living. With Wildflower she does it again, but with a haunting and understated delivery of what are truly powerful and demanding lyrics. Accompanied by her steadfast gifts for melody and vocal style, Wildflower is truly a delightful gift to the fans.Thanks Sheryl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildflower is no wallflower","review":"This is an amazing album. Of course I loveSheryl Crowe's singing. This album moves inthe sense that she sings candedly and alsomore softer than past albums.

Madeline"},{"rating":"1","title":"This 'Wildflower' is A Weed","review":"From the debutante annoyance of the shrill 'Tuesday Night Music Club' to surpassing expectations with the non-sophomore slump of the excellent 'Sheryl Crow' to the ambivalence and skill of 'Globe Sessions' - well, it's been downhill ever since. She's long ago morphed from a debutante to watch to a major nuisance. She's not only lost her voice, but she's here to prove that there's a cliché born every minute, and we're the suckers buying into it. She's never been more formulaic or mediocre. My grade: C-"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect for doctor's offices; elevators","review":"Man, what a yawner! If you consider oatmeal \\"too spicy\\", then this is your kind of music! One song blends right into another, with utterly nothing that stands out.

Great album to use as background music, 'cause you'll have it tuned out in the first couple of minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"I can't believe other reviewers are calling this record \\"artistic.\\" This CD is overproduced to the point of laughability. Every song sounds like it's been done before by either Sheryl or someone else (Beatles, Elton John, etc), only this time, there's an overabundance of STRING SECTION! to make them sound a wee bit different.It's a bunch of DRIVEL. Really.

It's a more radio friendly, slower more depressed then rock songs but definetely some wonderful songs. Perfect lie and I know why a heart gets lonely are some favorites.

There wasn't one decent song on the entire CD. It's lame and sterile. I gave it to my lady friend, and she gave it to her daughter. What happened after that, I can't say. I can't believe that so many people gave it such a high rating. To each their own, I guess. I have never bought another Sheryl Crow CD, and won't likely do so in the future. Awful! Reminded me of Pat Benatar's Tropico and Huey Lewis' Small World.

But with middle-age and celebrity, her music has gotten weaker and weaker. C'mon, C'mon was awful. Maybe \\"Good Is Good\\" will be her nadir. The whole Lance Armstrong thing was such a huge distraction, in which she clearly gave more than she got back. I look forward to what she might write -- if she faces up to the reality of being in a youth-oriented profession, single and in her mid-40s, if still obviously atractive and talented. Crow is more interesting on her own than she seems to recognize. If she shows more courage and gives up on the Prince Charming nonsense, she might produce something that ranks with her early work and that speaks to other baby boomers. If you're looking for something honest and introspective with Wildflower that ranks with her first few CDs, this isn't it. She's sounded lost for years."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZzzzzzzz","review":"I've always seen Sheryl Crow as a middle-of-the-road rock artist.My wife and I got a couple of her disc's, plus that \\"very best of\\" CD and was really looking forward to her latest, but this one...zzzzzzzz, makes me wonder what they're putting in Sheryl's coffee.Some reviewers are saying there's \\"heart and soul\\" all over this album?That may be, but it's also very slick dullsville stuff too.As for the album cover graphics, I don't see the Roger Dean Yes covers or the 60's style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote, but a very \\"modern\\" graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using. Kelly Clarkson, the Vines, the Donnas, the list goes on.Highlights: Good is Good (I guess it's time for a new \\"very best of\\" collection)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem","review":"This is one of the best albums yet - but you have to give a little time.

Not only does it contain astonishingly beautiful acoustic guitars, but Sheryl's vocals and lyrics are beautifully touching and heartfelt.My favorite song is \\"Wildflower.\\" With it's delicate vocals and beautiful guitar, it's a song of the fragility and immense power of love, and the hidden beauties that surround us.\\"Always On Your Side\\" is another of my favorites, and is heartfelt ballad on the difficulties we sometimes face, and the love that surrounds us if we would only look.Honestly it's very hard to pick a favorite song, as every song on this CD is filled with insights and inspirations that go beyond the typical songs of love lost or love gone wrong.Sheryl Crow's \\"Wildflower\\" is a journey into the soul, and the sorrows and beauties that keep us coming back for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"suprisingly disappointed","review":"I was excited to get Sheryl's new CD, but found it quite boring. As a woman who is the same age as Sheryl, I can relate to where she is emotionally. There is a sense of ease and relaxation that comes with being in your 40's, and I can hear it in her songs. But I was hoping to hear more of her upbeat songs like \\"Steve McQueen\\", \\"C'mon C'mon\\", or \\"Soak up the Sun\\". Many of the songs on this CD sound a lot like other songs she has done, but with different lyrics! Sure, I'll listen to this now and then, but it definately won't be a favorite. I will put her \\"Very Best of Sheryl Crow\\" on before I put this one on. This CD was more of a sleeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooo","review":"Oh wow, what a disapointment to the surprising Cmon Cmon, Soak Up The Sun was soooo awesome. I also loved the last big hit, First Cut Is The Deepest and millions of fans turned on to her greatest and not so greatest hits. But it was a comeback just the same, and had a lot of fans waiting for the next big CD. But is this it? These songs are pretty bland and boring, this would not rate high at all compared to her overall catalogue. Mark my words, this CD is going to be a dud. It will probably go gold quickly on the strength of her popularity right now, then fall off the charts fast. The songs are boring, why not some cheery or upbeat songs? Sheryl Crow sounds like an artist not on the way up, but on the way back down. She dont sound happy in these songs, maybe she is miserable? Her misery cries out in these poorly written songs. It made me depressed, music is suppose to make you feel good. Booooo for Sheryl Crow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Album","review":"The old adage 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' holds true on this album. Nothing groundbreaking here.

Good is good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Normally I love Sheryl Crow. I have all of her CD's. But this CD is so boring. All of the songs sound alike for the most part. There is no \\"soak up the Sun\\", there is no \\"If it makes you happy\\" , there is no \\"everyday is a winding road\\", there are no catchy songs. It puts you to sleep. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the lead single is OK, (good is good) and I like the album art work. Otherwise, don't bother"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACK & WHITE","review":"My favorite songs on this CD are \\"Good is Good\\",\\"Live it Up\\",\\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" and \\"Always on Your Side\\". The music and lyrics are generally good however the vocal range on the songs could have made the songs better. The only song on the CD that comes close to exhibiting the range I am referring to is \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\". I feel that if another artist such as Jo-Dee Messina covered some of these songs it would have been an improvement on some well thought out lyrics and great instrumental pieces. I also liked the duet with Sting. The inside art is very well done as well. I only gave it a star because as a whole I felt it wasn't worth anything more. So there you have it the black and white of my opinion on this work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheryl is a bad singer!","review":"The lead song, \\"wildflower\\" is sung by Cheryl way too high pitched. She can't hit the high notes and it sounds ear piercing. The guitar sounds better though. She should stick to the sort of bad girl, hanging out songs that made her a star. Mix it up with other singers and musicians too. That makes it more interesting and gets away from the same old same old lame, cry baby stuff. Try some power chords with a distortion pedal. I think metal may be good for Cheryl and some rap tunes. Get with the present Cheryl. Don't live in the past. Go \\"bad girl\\" and have some \\"fun\\" (your song)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What a waste of my time. I couldn't even listen to the entire CD. Not what I expected.

But if you liked Sheryl Crow before, be warned.

This disc is great, but I would recommend getting the special edition instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music to slit your wrists by","review":"I've always been a big fan of Sheryl Crow, but this cd is just disappointing.

The premise got my attention and I think that there's a family that hasn't been touched by mental illness. As for the book, it is way too long and clearly BeBe could have benefited from some good editing. I am midway thru this book and I'm committed to finishing it...no TV to watch due to problems with my cable. There were many opportunities to liven up this novel by developing some the other characters...Clyde, Orlando, PJ and her friends.

So empty, lacking of any drama, that I felt a need to write a review to warn others.

This story brings home the reality of mental illness and related addictions, and it illustrates the resiliance of a mother's love. It is strange that in the black community, drug addiction is reluctantly acknowledged while mental illness is still taboo. I hope 72 Hour Hold helps to change that.Aww Sookie Sookie: Omar's Revenge"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall, but a bit full of itself","review":"I thought this was a very interesting take on bipolar illness, certainly from a different point of view than most (i.e., once they get help they're cured). However, the parallels the main character draws between herself and the underground railroad are totally disproportionate and disjointed to boot. The idea, if I understood it correctly, is that having a daughter with bipolar disorder is roughly equivalent to being a slave, traded away from your family at random. Huh?! I think the main character ascribes a wee bit too much gravitas to her own situation.In addition, the references to slavery come totally out of the blue. There is no context. It's almost like someone else came along later and sprinkled sentences from a completely different novel into this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A mother's love","review":"After reading this book, my heart went out to all the parents of children with mental illness. She really demonstrated the love and committment it takes to endure the hardships that come with a family member's devotion. The story was fast paced and yet very descriptive. I felt like I was there in the house observing the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I have a better understanding","review":"A loved one of mine is bipolar. Though she told me that she was bipolar and had been hospitalized I really did not understand the disorder or how it would affect our relationship. After two years of being together with many ups and downs ending in our breakup I was bewildered and became depressed. I began too late to read about bipolar disorder. I could recognize some of the symptoms that I saw in my loved one that I lost but something was missing. The altered states of reality, the cursing, the hate; those symptoms were treated fairly lightly in books written by professionals of mental disease as though the 'reality' would perhaps defame those that are afflicted. Ms. Campbell's book, though fictionalized, reads like \\"this is what experiencing bipolar disorder is really like.\\" Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unsettling, Enlightening, and Riveting","review":"A friend, whose son has a dual diagnosis, told me about 72 Hour Hold. She was amazed at how vividly Bebe Moore Campbell depicted this mother's struggle with her beautiful child. I am already a big BMC fan; \\"What You Owe Me\\" is one of the most powerful novels I have ever read. Even as a psychologist, I learned much about the internal process of a mother's challenge. It has given me even more respect for my friend and all the other parents whose psychotic children reach their majority. Our system needs much retooling to support these families. And 72 Hour Hold is also a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent guide to the Katy","review":"I have only seen two other guide books devoted to Missouri's Katy Trail, but this one is hands-down the best. It covers the Katy from west to east and has a wealth of historical information on the towns along the trail. There is also a fold-out map of the trail and a table of mileages between points along the trail. Good information is given on services available along the trail. The only serious criticism I have of the book is that I'd like to see more detail given to the directions for getting to the trail from I-70 at each access point along the trail.Overall, this is an excellent trail guide to the Katy Trail and an excellent book in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I learned quite a bit about the Katy Trail and the towns located on or near the trail from this book.

The first thing I noticed was how the Opal lacked the iridescent play of color they are known for. The second thing I noticed was the color of the silver; slightly brown. It does not look like sterling silver; it resembles silver I've seen from mines in Mexico that cause discoloration on the skin. I'll have to check the silver, and I'll be taking a closer look at the 'opal' to see if it isn't really Slocum Stone.

The book is also very clear and also very understandable when it came to all of the missing planes, ships, and boats.In the book, I do have a few disklikes of this book, eventhough I did also have some likes of this book. When the author wrote the book, he wrote it with a lot of factual information without any action or any type of detailed past-accident details. He did give a lot of details of planes going down, but not how the passengers and planes or boats were doing after the accidents. More post-accident details would have been better.I have a split recommendation for this book.

Then, the costume is this very flimsy thin thing that will last maybe one or two uses...this costume is for a little child! I think this company should be VERY ashamed to have sent this to me for my $33.00 (with shipping and handling).

I find that her writing style is very long and rambling. Everything feels overdescribed and \\"padded\\", as if Canham is trying to reach a certain word count. I found this book more work to read than fun. I know I'm in the minority here, but I'm not just saying this to be different.Canham's writing style reminds me of the writing of the following authors: Laura Kinsale, Kathleen E. Woodiwiss, and Rebecca Brandywyne. You can take that as praise or censure, depending on how you feel about their books. I like fast moving writing, in the style of Sabrina Jeffries or Jacquie D'Allessandro.

Over the last couple of years she has offered several of her books for free, and I have purchased others as well. Typically the books I have bought were of a seafaring nature. Her attention to detail is precise and thorough, which I love! This time around, I had a detour from pirate ships to Coventry, England at the time of the French Revolution. Again, Ms. Canham draws a vivid picture of that dark time, and what the fate might have been for French aristocrats fleeing to England. It doesn't hurt either to have a dashing hero and some steamy romance to go along with the history, but this is definitely more than just fluff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pale Moon Rider","review":"Plot was very good and entertaining.

I first heard about Spaced when reading up on Edgar Wright and his film Shaun of the Dead before it hit the US shores. The premise of the show was pretty basic, but that was the beauty. You have two strangers in need of housing, what do they do? Well they pretend to be a married couple and the hilarity ensues. I wanted to see this for years, but because the US doesn't get much in the way of overseas shows, my dreams would dwindle. That is until the BBC channel aired a few episodes...and it was amazing. This is a very smart show and I think everyone can relate to the characters in one way or another. Its sad that this was a short lived show, but if you have a region free DVD player you can pick up Spaced in a great collectors set. If you loved Shaun of the Dead, then this is a gimme, you'll love this too. Edgar Wright does awesome things and I can't wait for Hot Fuzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars if I could find it...","review":"Currently not available?Like others I am SICK of seeing this on sites about this DVD set, I want it sooo badly!

So since those two films are a creation of Wright/Pegg/Frost, and Spaced is work of Wright/Pegg/Frost, I was hoping for something as hilarious and witty as Shaun and Fuzz from this show, but the wit, fun and humor just is not there. Pegg and Frost are fine, but ALL the other characters were horrible, especially the morose downstairs neighbor, Brian (Mark Heap). Every time he's on-screen, the show just dies. And the female lead, Daisy (Jessica Stevenson Hynes), is another show-killer. Just could not stand her. Honestly, I just don't know why this show is getting such rave reviews on Amazon. It's really not that good. Nowhere even close to being great like other UK TV comedies like Coupling and The Office. Now THOSE are hilarious shows. But Spaced? Not even close to being hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get your inhaler...","review":"At some points, I laughed so hard I couldn't breathe!

I often find the low budget stuff to be more charming than the big budget stuff and it was definitely true with Spaced. They seemed to all enjoy each other and the fun came through.

But the commentaries are fun and the whole package is so worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like to laugh and you like British Comedy this is for you.","review":"I was reading EW one day and they mentioned this show n didn't think much of it and one day I saw it on Amazon and I thought why not give it a shot because Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz were hilarious in my view. I was not disappointed I laughed so hard I could barely breath and I only laugh that hard unless something is really, really funny. One of the main reasons I like the show is because it throws so many pop refrencenes at you so many their is actualy a subtitle option that tells you which refrence it is. Like in one episode a guy is being ambushed boy a pack of teenagers one is at the front and a bunch flank him from the side he says \\"clever boy\\" a refrence to Jurassic Park (1993). This just one of hundreds.The show is great you want to laugh buy it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"British comedy at it's finest","review":"I bought Spaced on the names Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright alone, and I am thoroughly pleased. A quirky British comedy about 2 flat mates, Spaced was a thoroughly entertaining series. It's one of those situations where you wish they'd made more.The reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is the humor may not hit everyone the same way. What I thought was funny in a few episodes, a friend did not, and subsequently vice versus. However, it is easy to see where the genius behindShaun of the DeadandHot Fuzz (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray] comes from. Check it out, enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"***** if it were possible, it would be the best TV show from the UK","review":"The show itself is amazing. Laying the groundwork for future works SHAUN OF THE DEAD and HOT FUZZ, this TV series has more depth and is probably one of the most Americanized britcoms ever made. With pop culture references and movie homages so ingrained, SPACED keeps rocking. Unlike their feature films, the writing here includes Jessica Hines (nee Stevenson) which adds a level of depth and even crass humor missing from the movies.The DVD's include an extensive documentary on the show, commentaries from the cast and crew, as well as newly recorded ones with the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Kevin Smith. There is even a special subtitle track called the HOMAGE METER that lets you know which movies and TV shows they are spoofing on screen.Dig this series. It's amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Indulgent","review":"I found this book very misleading. I had thought it was more about abusive relationships and how to overcome them - it would be no help to anyone in such a situation. Instead I found it basically a poorly written tirade about the problems this woman had at work Quite frankly she seemed to have been fired so many times its a wonder that anyone employed her again. The radio industry in the last 2 decades of the 20th century was obviously a hard place to work but I really did not enjoy reading about how this woman kept getting laid off. The book hardly touched on the troubles in her relationship or the foundation to help others in abusive situations. Basically it is just a self-indulgent rant by someone who should have got out of that industry and into other sales if she was such a good salesperson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and homiletically useless","review":"The introduction/ preliminary chapters are very informative and worth reading. Great information. Unfortunately, it seems the rest of the book merely demonstrates the astrological connections to everything John writes in his apocalypse. I wanted to read the whole thing in order to better understand this mysterious book... no luck.I was very interested to see how they unpacked their division of Revelation which seemed good, but they never really explained it.Also, they reject any allegorical element of Rome, which I think most scholars would disagree with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough flow to be useful","review":"It is pretty sturdy even though it's plastic.

I liked Up Country because her descriptions of the characters made me laugh out loud on occasion. I also have a weak spot for cold New England Winters (even though I have never lived through one). I agree with some of the other reviews that it was slow at times but overall this was a great read laying poolside on vacation and would be an even better read laying in front of a roaring fire with a nice glass of wine on a cold winter day. Pat Conroy might have the market on \\"Beach Music\\" but ARS takes the cake for Beach Reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche with bad use of similes","review":"Normally I don't notice the use of similes in writing, but when she compares pillows to teeth, and says a dream receded like \\"a train going away\\", the similes jump out and jar me. She uses so many cliches, the worst of which is when a woman who must have been a child in the 1950s says that Dennis Ponder dipped her pigtails in the ink jar. I seriously doubt ink jars were in use in any schools in the 1950s. Also, there were discrepancies that bothered me, like when the one-legged Dennis Ponder is \\"running, falling down, then getting up and running again\\". I think it would be nearly impossible to run on one leg with crutches. Also impossible was when Dennis and Molly's father brought Luze over from Dennis's camp in a fireman's carry. How is a one-legged man on crutches going to help carry a woman?I thought the endless descriptions went on way too long. I think this book could safely be edited down to about 2/3rds of its length, and be better because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down. Up Island is Siddons best book .","review":"Anne Rivers Siddons' portrayal of an Atlanta woman whose life is changed forever by the treachery of her husband's midlife crisis is the best novel she's written so far. I picked the book up and couldn't put it down until I was finished in the early hours of the next morning.Siddons' description of a woman's emotions as her husband leaves her for a younger version of herself is absolutely accurate. The separation from her husband serves to highlight the problems in all the relationships she has with her family, especially her mother. Her mother's death turns out to be what causes Molly to face all her problems and begin her life again.Unlike her earlier novels, Siddons leaves Molly Redwine in the midst of her divorce with her situation with her estranged husband not resolved. I think Molly Redwine deserves another book to go on with her story."},{"rating":"1","title":"A less than stellar book by Anne Rivers Siddons.","review":"I enjoyed her other books more. I was intrigued by the first half of the book and the struggle that Molly had undertaken, but the last half of the book fell flat. It seemed like the odd characters introduced in that half undermined Molly's eventual realization of herself as a strong woman. I loved the background on Martha's Vineyard but I felt it was also lost in the muddle of the characters' traumas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay read w/interesting characters, but not her best.","review":"Ever since Colony I have read all of ARS books. While I enjoyed getting to know Molly Redwine & her family, I couldn't help but shake my head at her choices. The prospect of caring for herself frightens her so that she feels she must take care of something else. Swans, okay. But two crazy, manipulative women and a nasty, withdrawn, bitter man? Sorry Anne, you missed it this time. Therapy may not be the socially acceptable way for Southern women, but Molly may have benefitted more from 6 months of sessions with a compassionate caring therapist than this bunch of people. For ARS at her best try Colony, Kings Oak or even Heartbreak Hotel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Up Island is down for the count","review":"The book starts off with some interesting characters, one of the best of which is the witch-y, grasping mother, who (unfortunately for the plot and the readers) croaks right when she gets to being nastiest. It reads like the poorest of formulaic shmoozing---you've got your sultry South, you've got your sleepy New England village, you've got your Wuthering \\"Heathcliffe\\" thinly disguised as a dying creep, who could have been interesting if only he'd done more than WHINE. And you've got your gratuitous, graphic, unemotional sex. Plus, the heroine NEVER SOLVES HER OWN PROBLEMS. Time and again she is rescued by some bystander who plays a minimal role and just comes along with a blast of cavalry bugles.The writing deserved a better story. The story deserved, well, maybe to be drenched in brandy and flambee'd. The only cliche missed was to throw in a Crown Prince of somewhere. Miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story set up unwinds like a paperback romance.","review":"I was very dissapointed in this book, especially after reading Siddons first few chapters, which expertly depicted a middle aged woman scorned. The portrayal of the \\"Eel woman\\" is one dimensional and unrealistic. The husband is a pathetic wimp. Molly's life is so boring when she gets to Martha's Vineyard, that I hardly recognized the MV that I know. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen after the first 60 pages, and I am still waiting. Typical of the thought put into this book, Siddons describes her mother as having been both 19 and 22 when she gave birth to Molly; both pregnant when she married and not, and all within 20 pages. Who edited this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"My mother gave me this book because I enjoyed reading \\"Downtown,\\" but this one just didn't work for me. I didn't really care about the characters, and frankly thought that they just got loaded down with every problem possible, to the point of ridiculous. But the settings were well described.Wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrific beginning...","review":"that just goes down hill from slow to bad to worse. i really loved the authors style of writing in the beginning, actually feeling the emotions of molly, and i guess that could have been because of all the detail that was put into thoughts, sights, feelings, etc. as the book moved along, the very thing that captured my interest began to lose it. a perfect example of this happens when she brings her dog to the cabin and it takes three pages to describe how the dog went from one area, smelling, inspecting only to move on to the next. i believe it was at that point of the book that i stopped reading all the discription and just moved along to the interaction between her and other characters. wish i had enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author needs a better editor","review":"It has all been said here already. This is \\"literature lite,\\" but doesn't pretend to be otherwise. I have been listening to this book on tape in my 100 mile commute back and forth to work, and I noticed the constant use of two word that jar: literal (or literally), which the author uses inappropriately, and flame, as in cheeks flame. Come on, Siddons, you can do better than that. Use a thesaurus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rediculous","review":"I thought that this book was so boring and so hard to believe. There are so many better southern authors with a much greater and more compelling story to tell. As a New Englander, the Vineyard was not captured as she should be.

I was very disappointed in the novel and can be sure not to waste my time on any others by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!","review":"No plot, boring characters.

I enjoyed the descriptions of \\"Eel woman\\" and could picture her and Tee in their bicylce shorts. Unfortunately I did not see much change in Molly. She just traded waiting on her immediate family in the south to waiting on a substitute family in the north. Can't she find anything else that would bring her fulfillment?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great summer read","review":"A perfect summer/beach book! My first by this author and I loved it.

Lovely book to get lost in.I would have liked alittle more closure in the ending.Highly recommended!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel disappointed me as Molly seems unreal/","review":"To someone who has enjoyed Colony and others by Siddons, this book disappointed although it began well. The character seems sympathetic and strong, but somehow her husband's indiscretion totally destroys her good sense. From someone admirable, she turns into a weak person who uses a friend and wants to lean on others, including a distraught father. The characters of Martha's Vineyard , drawn poorly do not excite interest and the book goes downhill. At points, Siddons does show the inner thoughts of Molly, and that provides some impetus to hope she will wake up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up Island","review":"This is the first book I've read from Ms. Siddons. I got the recommendation off of Oprah's Book Club site after reading Elizabeth Berg's \\"Open House\\". I was not disappointed at all. I love when a book captivates me so I can't even put it down. I just bought Fault Lines and ordered Colony. I'm anxious to read those as well. I like the main character of Molly and how she comes through so much with such strength. An inspiring story with beautiful descriptive detail especially about Martha's Vineyard. I'm glad I finally found this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the worst book I've listened to in a long time.","review":"The more I got into this audio, the more I began to dislike the characters, especially Molly.

I totally agree with the reader from Oxford concerning the credibility of the author as well as the President. I was digusted with the account of Ouko's murder. The fact that Moi felt that it should be included in his biography already implicates some guilt. It is interesting how he lays blame on subjects who were very close to him, but have now passed away and cannot defend themselvs against such accusations."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Absurd Nonsence","review":"This biography is a Five Star Lie, perhaps the lie of the century in Africa! That Andrew Morton is now on a mission to cash big bucks from notoriuos Dictators is utterly disgusting from a British author. Moi and Morton should not be mistaken that this biography will change Moi's tyrannious record in Kenya, for it's already well written and preserved. Morton can now go ahead and write biographoes of other \\"Statesmen\\", like Serbian's Melosovic and Cuban's Castro. Next he can write Pinochet's biography and Cambonia's Pol Pot as well as North Korean's Kim Il Sung. After all he is a writer whose driving force is fame and money, nothing less!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mooi's gift to history","review":"I must disagree with rthe reader from Oxford that this is a valuable historical document.It is wholly biased , both in the details that it reveals and those that it leaves out.

The stories are humorous, and the book is a good one to pick up after a long day at the mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleasant stories targeting YA audience","review":"Having heard some positive words regarding Rash's writing, I delved into this volume with high hopes. The stories are pleasant and painless, scarcely a ripple of trouble that won't smooth away. The young adult audience targeted by these tales should find them easily palatable and instantly accessible. This work aims slightly South of the reader who feels that TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the height of American literature. Adults are advised to move on to Rash's later work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent photo array of Brooklyn trolleys","review":"Although there are some errata in this book, the picture quality is very good.

The author has a very soothing and calming voice which enhances the nice music accompanied on the CD. Being as stressed as I was, this CD has helped me to relax in my daily life, because whenever I feel stresses I remember the breathing exercises from the CD and it makes me relax. Thank you, Salle, for a fine experience, I would recommend this CD to others, I would also buy any new editions. Warm wishes, John"},{"rating":"2","title":"soothing meditation will help you relax or sleep","review":"I bought this as a cassette tape years ago at a time when I was having trouble sleeping, and just bought the cd. It works so well for me that I've never actually gotten to the end of it. Salle Merrill Redfield has such a soothing voice that even the introduction is relaxing. She takes you through a toe-to-head focus on relaxing your body, then takes you through four 15-minute meditations. The music is soft with out being too much or overly corny, and the sound effects (ocean waves are one) are equally subtle but effective. I haven't fit meditation into my life much but this tape I would highly recommend to anyone who wants to explore meditation, or who just needs a tool during stressful times to relax, reflect, or sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Big by Ryan Shupe and Rubberbands Single","review":"This is a totally awesome group.

Surrender to the bliss of \\"Weary Arms,\\" and then the power pop of \\"Call to Love.\\" Crank up the soaring \\"Andalucia\\" or the barrelling \\"Coldways.\\" And do not miss the exquisite \\"Sleep All Summer,\\" an bittersweet duet that will seem all too familiar to anyone who's ever loved and lost.If you're new to Bachmann's post-Loaf work, \\"Twilight Creeps\\" and \\"You Must Build a Fire\\" epitomize both the up- and down-tempo strengths that are consistent through all the Crooked Fingers albums.

It kept me sane and organized. I liked it because it organized all the wedding elements that needed attention: budget, showers/rehearsal, bridal attire, formal wear, photographer, etc., and I didn't have to worry I was missing a piece. The worksheets helped me make sure I was asking the right questions and getting all necessary information from each vendor. I made extra copies of the worksheets and completed one for each vendor I consulted. The \\"to do\\" sheets helped me to remember to complete tasks in a timely manner. Once I started planning, this binder came everywhere with me. Because the pages are in a binder, I was able to add workorders, brochures and any related information and keep in one place.I've recommended this planner before and have dug in out again to recommend to a future bride. Any bride will not go wrong with this planner."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my new faves","review":"I have a lot of books on drawing and colored pencil and this is my new fave. While I do agree with another reviewer that this book isn't for beginners, on the other hand, most colored pencil books assume you already have some drawing skills to begin with. This is an excellent book for inspiration and has great examples of what one can acomplish with colored pencils. What I also like is the little history of colored pencils, and the fact that there are examples from several students and fellow artists. It's not all drawings by the author. I think that really adds to the overall inspiration that I have gotten from this book. It may not be one to start to learn with but it is one you should eventually add to your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very instructive color pencil drawing book","review":"This is the most thorough color pencil drawing \\"how to\\" book I have seen and already had 2 that I thought were good....this one is great with detailed explanations of types of colored pencils, paper types to use, techniques for all sorts of effects...great buy!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharing colors","review":"It's a miracle how we can learn with a good book!Issues as simple as shadow and lighting are easier to understand with this book.Thank you very much, book..!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I gave this a try, since I wouldn't know just by reading others' reviews...

He was trained by a centaur, lived as a girl in a neighboring king's court, and then was tricked by Odysseus into joining Agamemnon's war band at Troy where he sat back fuming, because of Agamemnon's assault on his pride, until Hector killed his beloved Patroclus. Achilles, more heroic than any other mortal, suffered more, as well. Even in death, his wrath turns him against his friend Odysseus.This is the ancient story Cook recreates -- complete with divine intervention and a shape-shifting nymph -- drawing readers in with gripping emotional content.Pros * Fleshes out Homeric episodes with suffering and emotions.* Integrates and explains the gods' intervention in the Trojan War.* Tells the story of Thetis, Achilles' mother.Cons * Modern sensibilities and street language* For those not interested in John Keats, the ending is anticlimactic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing wrong with Keats","review":"The two reviewers of Achilles seem determined to blame it for not being what they want- a full account of the Trojan war written by someone who has no link with a university. I could imagine American readers objecting to British vocabulary and style, since Achilles works best read aloud, but it is churlish to object to the Keats section which closes the book. Keats is the Greekless reader whose proven empathy for Achilles makes him our ally and our model as we find resonance in 'the pain of others, far away on the plains of Troy.' I suggest to your reviewers that this is the crown of the book- the awareness of how remote Troy now is and how crucial it can be to those who can live in the souls of others. Given Keats' admiration of America, surely America can listen to Keats."},{"rating":"1","title":"alright, but not exactly what I was expecting","review":"It was OK.

So much could have been done to make this book dynamic and at least entertaining, and that would have only enhanced the so-called plot.

This book is only for those interested in Scott Adams as a philosopher, not as a cartoonist."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn... not worth a buy","review":"In all fairness to Scott Adams I have read onlythe first 1/3rd of the book and this is the firstDilbert book that I have trouble completing.Most of the pages do not speak of Office-roomstupidity which is Scott Adams's forte butis a rambling and incoherent account aboutnothing in particular.The book does not do much of what Scott Adamsis great at -- poke fun at Corporate America.Instead it is a high-priced, fairly thin bookthat recycles some old laughs and tacks on a lotof boring drivel.I somehow get the suspicion that it is morean attempt to cash in on the Dilbert name andfame than an attempt to write a halfway decentbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok, but does not hold the audience like the Dilbert series","review":"I'm even being generous by giving this 2 stars. Scott Adams is very talented but he should just stick to Dilbert Comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most of it has come true","review":"When buying this book I thought it was only published recently but Scott Adams has nailed it with many of his 1997 predictions. Technology has moved along and I hope Scott has made a mint with patents on now common products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something seriously missing in the humour","review":"I enjoy Dilbert cartoons very much, but was quite disappointed with The Dilbert Future. Disagree with the other reviewers that this book is \\"laugh out loud\\" material. At times, I couldn't even bring myself to chuckle. I think the missing element here is the reader's empathy for the topic. Unlike other books such as The Dilbert Principle which deplicts familiar real life situations in an irreverent and hilarious manner that gets the reader nodding in agreement as he laughs, The Dilbert Future is basically a wild conjecture of the future. Without some degree of familiarity, readers won't be able relate to the gags. If you think sex with aliens, microchips embedded in your body, gadgets that enable you not to hear other people speak, is funny, then I suppose this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully Hysterical","review":"This book is incredibly funny! A must read for any true Dilbert fan. Adams has produced another gem, and I can't wait to read his next book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking of other people that are stupider than you","review":"I thought this book brought up a lot of questions that should be answered in a very seious manner. However Scott Adams brought these social idiosincrecies to life by making fun of people stupider than he is. He also takls about my favorite section \\"Why life will not be like Star Trek.\\" It includes everything from the holodeck to teleporeters. Incredably hilarious with a touch of seriousness added in for flavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly as funny as the cartoon","review":"Anybody looking for more of Adams's typical office humor probably isn't going to be very satisfied with this book. But his predictions for the future are often hilarious (especially the Star Trek part), so it's worthwhile, definitely. The last chapter, humorlessly discussing his scientific beliefs, should probably be skipped due to lots of misleading information, but the rest of the book is very funny and should be picked up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny read in the style of Dave Barry!","review":"This is the only Scott Adams book I have, and I found it absolutely hilarious! It took me a long time to read because I kept laughing so hard. I've read a lot of funny books by Dave Barry, Ellen Degeneres, Paul Reiser, and many, many others, and this is right up there with the best of them. And his ideas about how to control your fate are very similiar to the visualization techniques used by athletes today."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish i could rate this book 10 stars!","review":"At first harry potter was my favorite book it was so asalm! I thought nothing could be better until I read avalon web of magic book 1. These books are the best! I dont se who couln't like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not exactly a long or thoughtfully wrote book.","review":"This book was very short and not really a book for my age group.( I'm 11) I also read the first avolon book in paper, and its more fun because you get to see the really cool anima drawings in the middle of the chapter instead of at the end when you read it on a kindle/kindle fire.I first bout this book at a scholastic book fair held at my school. At the time I was 9 and the cover was pretty inviting. SO BEWARE OF THE REALLY GIRLY BOOK WITH PINK GLITTERS ALL OVER!!!!!Ratchel Roberts doesn't really write very good books in general so I'm not really shore why I bought this book. I think what if been trying to say is..... wait for it...... DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the story!!","review":"All that glittes is such a cool book! At the begining Kara was such a jerk, but then she gets nicer. The unicorn jewel is so cool. And her hair was so trippy! I am collecting all the books! I recommend this book/series to anyone who loves magical books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Book Lover","review":"My daughter has struggled with learning how to read. She is 11 and reads at about a fifth grade level. She has consistently been at least one grade level behind and would become very frustrated when asked to read. This is the first book series she has ever read completely on her own! She loves the first three and has been begging to get the rest. I have placed a pre-order on the last three. I can't comment on the story much beyond the fact that she raves about it, but any book that helps my daughter discover a love for reading deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad....","review":"Well it was ok but... well Kara sorta acts all the Queen of the world and stuff which I think is a little ennoying but it was still an excellent book to read and caught my attention. Kara meeets with a felione cat Lyra, gets a jewel.. not reallly but later on in the series, and the mages finally see the Dark Sorceress. Ohh ya I tried to go on Avlonclubhouse but what do you know it didn't work which bis really odd. Instead it showed this Go Daddy thing! Figures anyways buy this book people that depends if you like Kara but if you don't then you may not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Amazing Author!","review":"Dr. Bobko is a brilliant man who wrote a wonderful book to help students learn about statistics. Because I know Bobko, while reading his text I could hear his voice in it. This book is more than a text book, it has personality. I learned so much from reading just a few chapters. He does a great job at \\"dumbing it down\\" for all of us students. I find that many books are too confusing and over the heads of students taking statistics for the first time. I recommend this book to any teachers or students looking to learn about correlation and regression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Hammerfall album till date","review":"If you have their other albums, keep away from this one. They mantained the lyrical subject, but the music quality dropped a LOT, I mean, A LOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh well, better luck next time","review":"I think this is the worse HF album ever. I hate the fact that the songs are mid-tempo and the ballad is just too sappy for my liking. However, Edge Of Honor rocks, Angel Of Mercy is great and Trailblazers is awesome! but that's it. Oh, and Hearts Of Fire is ok too, sounds too much like Renegade though... oh well, we still have the Glory To The Brave, Legacy Of Kings and Renegade. I pray that there next release won't suck as much as this album did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their worst album, for sure....","review":"I knew that was going to happen.... Sticking to such a rigid formula by four albums would end in a flop, sooner or later. This happened here with this Crimson Thunder, their fourth album, which sounds almos as pop metal, believe or not! Listen to \\"Hearts Of Fire\\", for example!RENEGADE was a strong album,e ven with the usual \\"templar lyrics\\". But CRIMSON THUNDER is a weak metal album, musically speaking. I hope their fifth album is better. Maybe they are taking their time to write more interesting stuff, since their next release was a double live compilation, ONE CRIMSON NIGHT."},{"rating":"2","title":"maximum metal","review":"This is another awesome album from one of the newer great heavy metal bands. If you are into the nwobhm, then you will probably love Hammerfall. This is a great album, I would say that it is their second best, the best being \\"Glory To The Brave\\". There really isn't a weak song on here, plus the bonus track of Kiss' \\"Detroit Rock City\\" which is decent. Give Hammerfall a listen......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This album is crap, the worst by Hammerfall till date. It's a classical \\"Spinal Tap\\", but with one worsening factor: it almost almost sounds as pop metal. IRgh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still singing about the Templars?","review":"Please, when will this Spinal Tap heavy metal band stop writing about the Templars, or the Crusaders or whatever? I have the first three albums and I got fed up with that and, also, with the double-kick drums that plagues all most of their songs.I also think it's funny when a reviewer says :\\"..if you like Iron Maiden or Judas Priest. you'll like this album...\\" Well, if I want to hear Maiden, I will listen to my Maiden records, not HammerFall!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"Time for some excellent silliness from the kings of Power Metal! Oh wait...that was the first album. The quality has seriously gone south on this one. More Europe than Manowar, Hammerfall are treading water badly here. Prepare to hold your head in your hands for some serious cringing at some of these tracks. \\"Dreams Come True\\" is the chief culprit here. This one would not be out of place in the Eurovision song contest or maybe it's a lost addition from the Karate Kid 3 soundtrack. In fact the last 6 tracks are all duds with only one ot two redeeming moments out of the rest of them. It is a listenable album but the songs just aren't up to scratch. Since when has True Metal been about love and mercy anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened Part 1","review":"I was very dissapointed in this release, especially compared to their past efforts. Not a single song stood out on this, nothing different than the 76432714 other power metal carbon copy bands out there. If you're a fan of \\"Glory to the Brave\\", \\"Legacy of Kings\\" or even the \\"Renagade\\" album just end it there, this is not worth ruining the vision of a once good band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hammerfall's Back!","review":"Well this is their latest release, and as always, they always come up with great stuff! Nothing spectacular, but it's always good. For sure, their better days were back then with Glory of the Brave and Legacy of Kings, but this one is a bit better than Renegade. Their music shows more maturity but it's still the same kinda medieval influenced stuff. Check out \\"Hearts on Fire\\", \\"Crimson Thunder\\" (one of the best song I heard), \\"On The Edge of Honor\\", \\"Dreams Come True\\", \\"Hero's Return\\" and \\"The Unforgiven Blade\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hammerfall going pop metal??!!!","review":"No doubt this is their worst effort. Nothing like their three other albums. IT lacks creativity, energy. Joacim Cans' vocals seems weary, uninspired. Also, there are some tunes that remind us A LOT of pop metal...This is the order of the best Hammerfall albums, in my opinion:1) LEGACY OF KINGS2) RENEGADE3) GLORY TO THE BRAVE4) CRIMSON THUNDER (well below the others!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hotter than Hell!","review":"If you like Iced Earth,Jag Panzer,Manowar,Iron Maiden then you can't go wrong with this CD. Soaring clear vocals, thundering guitars, great production, melodic songs. The best musical discovery I've made in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife loves this","review":"I purchased this for my wife who cannot stop raving about this book.

I've worked google over, to see if K&N sells a blocking plate or something else to plug the hole, with absolutely no success. I've even searched to find why the hole exists, with very little success (my best guess is that it's for vehicles with an intake air temperature sensor).

Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad but could have been better","review":"I've listened to The Kovenant since they were Covenant and I've alway liked the direction they have taken, but this albulm threw me off a little. The metal edge on the industrial rock has been dulled down a little. The rock feel watered as well, and the industrial element throw into the front line up but slowed down and a little disapointing. A good amount of the songs are done well but not if you were expecting to hear something a little more aggressive. Good on it's own but as a progression of albulms it's kind of a let down. Don't get me wrong the Kovenant is still one of my primary bands but let's just say I'm looking forward to the NEXT albulm."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Metal??","review":"I bought this cd a few days ago expecting a metal band. This is definetly NOT metal. Its packed with electronics and nu-metal like riffs. Most of the songs sound the same and the lyrics are somewhat robotic...literally. It sounds like a robot is singing. There is no screaming, growling or even yelling...just a robot voice. If you're looking for intense, fast, complex music this is definetly not for you.Best Song: Via NegativaOne Word Review: Odd"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked the fast stuff stay away from this","review":"Im a huge fan of animatronic and seti is.... well seti is pretty bad. They went completly industrial which I think is cool but their style has become that of [another group.] The music is very slow the voice is no distorted very much and the album in my eyes just isnt very good. If you like the slow songs off of animatronic you might like these songs but be prepared there are only two songs with any energy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im not quite sure this is the Kovenant?","review":"This album is nothing like Animatronic, or Nexus Polaris. This album is very techno industrial, not very metal at all. I was a big fan of there other work but this album sucks. Anyone wanna buy my S.E.T.I. from me?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.","review":"Normally I like change in a band. But this band changed EVERYTHING I liked about them. I LOVED his evil voice, and the fast, catchy riffs. They were like a combination of Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, and Rammstein all mixed in one. But with Seti they changed all of that. PLUS the copy I got didn't have the bonus tracks on it, which was the last straw. I took it back and got \\"Old Man's Child's - In Defiance of Existence\\" which is a much better album. I STRONGLY suggest getting that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound, Terrible Durability","review":"I've now gone through three of these Jabra headsets, and while the sound quality is fine (both earphone and microphone), every one of them has suffered from the same exact problem - they can't take even the slightest tug on the wire, for instance when I accidentally catch it on a doorknob or cabinet handle, without ceasing to function. Even when there isn't any visible damage, the wire inside the sheath is obviously broken, because the headset no longer works. Keep in mind that I'm not talking about \\"strong\\" pulls on the wire, just a momentary tug as I walk past a waist-high cabinet with my phone in my pocket and the headset on my ear. These things should be far more durable than they are; it's frankly pathetic. I'll be looking at other brands from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"listening was fine but terrible microphone","review":"I bought one of these knowing that Jabra is regularly a great company with fine products. However, this must be their bottom-rung of headsets because my wife, friends, customers could just not hear me lousy microphone!!!However, the earpiece worked just fine and I could hear them just fine.I have since thrown this away and hope Jabra stops making such a cheap piece of junk as it doesn't do honor to their normally good name."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of the Seventh Grade - this book rocks","review":"A boy named Victor goes to Hebrew School and hates it! He has a lot of tricks up his sleeve and hopes that he will get thrown out of Hebrew School for them. He doesn't get thrown out though. But one day he finds out that he's not Jewish. I would recommend this book and, if you read it, you will find out if he converts or not. You probably think he won't because he hates Hebrew School so much, but you might be surprised. I learned a lesson from this book which was: if you hate something, you might change your mind and like it later.

This is, by far, the best book on manifesting that I've read. Unfortunately, many modern folks lack the true meaning of Dr. Dyer's work and think it's either muddled New Age misconceptions or a contradiction of true spirituality. However, Dr. Dyer teaches that abundance is true to spirituality and God...And he shows you how to get anything and everything you have ever wanted. Excellent and one of his best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I know a lot of people have criticized Dr. Dyer for being a charlatan. Dealing with personal issues is a touchy subject for most people. Unless you are ready to make changes in your life it is best to stick with comic books. If you ARE ready to work on changing the way life goes, ready to change your perspective, then this book can be a great help. I didn't accept all of Dr. Dyer's concepts hook-line and sinker. I'm not a pawn. Most of us aren't. This book just helps identify some of the things that hold us back in life. Exercises and methods helpful in changing the way we look at the world and ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Success","review":"I haven't read the book but I listen to the tapes and I love it.

You can actually enjoy your life while being successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and condescending book","review":"Dyer thinks he's God. I'm tired of his constant criticism about everything and everyone. Now in this book if you want to look young or lose weight you're selfish and a bad person. Then in his lectures he says you can reverse time. He says whatever he wants to make money and I find him a hypocrite. Every principle is that he writes if from some great enlightenment in his life. Why didn't he pay the Catholic Church for stealing St. Francis' prayer. The catholic church is not happy with Wayne Dyer and that's something you can research on the net. He takes what he wants to make money off of innocent people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"As I always feel about Wayne D.

As the book progressed, however, the plot became more detailed as more and more characters were introduced. I would recommend the reader to definitely have a strong imagination to picture the intricate objects explained in this book, as well as the scenery. I found this book to be most enjoyable; I read it in only three days.

I finished it and was overcome by a sense of pointlessness in reading these books that must have begun with \\"Demons Don't Dream.\\" The older books are much better, when the author actually had a story to tell, it seems unfortunate that now Anthony spends his time with Xanth in attempts to fill it with what he thinks are clever puns to appease the fans who send in their ideas, when really in my opinion, the puns are just plain annoying. I suggest Anthony stops cranking out Xanth books so quickly, and instead tries to think of some interesting stories to tell, although I have to say, there are signs of improvment with the most recent books, \\"Faun and Games,\\" for example."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It was the best book I read in years\\"","review":"I think that Piers Anthony is a great writer.When my friend let me read the book I just had to start collecting.So the next day I went out and bought as many Piers Anthony books as I could afford.Now I am a devoted reader and will keep collecting as long as they're out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catalog of Fishes","review":"If anyone seriously thinks taxonomy is dead, let them review this masterly trio of tomes, each the size of a large city's phonebook. The authors have scanned the world literature to provide lists of all known scientific names for fishes--through about 1996--including synonomies, status, location of types, and other pertinent information. A labour of love that all ichthyologists will benefit from. Comes with a CD-ROM version that, alas, get 2 stars because its program code is too old to handle so much data without serious glitching. Indispensible to anyone doing systematics, biodiversity, or even legislation for fishes. Pricey, but well worth its cost in real, long-term value.

When that started to die on me, I thought I try this one based on the \\"filterless\\" design and flash.I can't compare the suction to the Dyson but this thing would barely pick up a clump of pet hair off hardwood. My old vacuum would suck that stuff up from a good 12 inches off. In other words, it didn't suck at all. You had to be right over stuff to pick anything up at all.Build quality was another issue. The \\"convienient\\" handle/hose attachment wouldn't lock in unless you slammed it down. I know mine wasn't the only one with this problem because there was a returned unit in the store when I bought mine that was on clearance because of a \\"broken handle\\". It's not broken, just poor design."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good","review":"I purchased this vac about a month ago, and so far it has performed as advertised. I, too, was considering the twice as expensive Dyson, but upon comparing features, I thought I would give the Infinity a try. A nice feature which the Dyson does not have is the headlight. It's really bright and useful in a shaded room. Cleaning is pretty easy, although claims of no filters to clog are a bit exaggerated. The cylindrical screen in the center of the filter compartment gets pretty dirty and does need cleaning regularly to maintain suction. Noise level is on par with the Dyson, and is fairly quiet considering the suction. I did notice that the plastic parts seem not as quality as the Dyson, but for half the price you know they had to economize somewhere. One last thing, the pull out handle and hose assembly is shorter than expected. If you need a longer reach hose, I'd recommend the red model, NV31.

And as far as for pet hair pickup, it was a joke. It missed so many things that my cheap upright bagged vacuum would normally pick up. It was cumbersome and not easy to use. I just want to vacuum my damn stairs. Why is it SO difficult to find something that works?? I packed up the damn thing and I'm going to return it tomorrow. I'm so disgusted. Because they advertised that it's great for pet hair pickup on the exterior of the box, I fell for it. Don't be an idiot like I was and buy it because of that. It's a joke.

This is where things get interesting. You'll need to pull out your stitch dictionaries, pencil and graph paper, because after you read this book, the urge to design your own shawls will be irresistable!A side note: if you've bought one of the later reprints, you don't have to worry about errata.

But the software that comes with it is awful, and won't seem to run properly on either XP machine I've tried to install it on. The software is the type that puts a gratuitous, useless skin on top of what ought to be dead simple functionality. Half of the buttons are missing or unclickable, the backup function doesn't seem to run, etc. To make things worse, the server also has a web interface, which has some of the same functions as the desktop software, but not all of them - and changing a setting in one place seems to have no effect on the other, leaving me totally in the dark as to what the actual settings now are. I'm now looking for an alternate backup solution - all I wanted was a simple drive that would do its simple job of backing up my files without fuss or complaint, and while the hardware seems to fit the bill, it's a shame they package it with a more or less worthless software interface."},{"rating":"1","title":"EasyManage Software Issues","review":"The drive itself works as designed and is easy to setup and manage.The EasyManage software has tons of bugs. When I contacted technical support they were no help. They told me the problems were with Vista. I installed v4.1.0.15 which according to the support site was specifically released for Vista. Also the backup software does not support backing up .pst files. This is one of the main reasons I bought the drive.

The documentation is poor, but largely unnecessary, as the drive is easy to manage. Both Wintel and MAC devices recognize and access it easily. Printer support is dicey; I tried hooking up two different printers to use it to drive printer access. It worked, but was very slow; I eventually gave up and reattached the printers back to a PC on my home network.

It is laden with cliches, like \\"Nursing is like a diamond.\\" And when not using cliches it is either defining common sense like \\"lifestyle behavior changes\\" or regurgitating common theories in life and describing how they pertain to nursing. It really just lacks insight or useful organization of theories.

Amazing. The author seems to think that the audience is either too unsophisticated or too dumb to read a nuanced discussion of the history or theory of the profession.The book emphasizes the need for professional conduct and independent thought, but I didn't really feel like the author is extending either to her readers. It reads more like a recital of academic thought from other fields. It is poorly organized and full of cliches.

Another case of ridiculous writing. Don't be fooled by the word heavy annotations either, it's mostly bs about what other people said and rarely relates to the theme of defense. I've read three books on defense, Andy Soltis \\"The Art of Defense in Chess\\" has been the best so far. I also read the one by POlugayevsky with the same title, not as good. This is the worst so far because like I said, there's hardly any talk about defensive themes and the featured defenders are rarely the ones defending!

I wish we had bought a bag in the store first and not wasted money on a case. The honey flavor is almost non-existant and worst of all, they smell and taste stale. I won't buy a case of anything again without trying it first. I haven't figured out what to do with these, hate to just throw them out. I'm going to try baking them with some different seasonings to see if I can salvage them, but if not they may become squirrel food! I don't usually write negative reviews but I don't want anyone else to be disappointed with these nuts for their family the way that we were. Perhaps Melissa's will read this and figure out how to fix the problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does its job!","review":"It's not the most comfortable thing I've ever worn, but it does keep my back straight and help with pain from sitting unsupported. As an art student, I spend hours hunched over projects, which is why I purchased this back brace.If you wear it under your clothes, be sure to wear a cami or thin tanktop under it, because it does start to chafe a bit if the brace is worn on bare skin. If you wear it over your shirt, be aware that loose shirts bunch up a bit when the brace is tight. It bothers me, but it might not bother everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"No support, non returnable","review":"Buyer beware! The ad for this back brace did not say that it is non returnable! I put it on for less than 5 minutes and it rode up by ribs. It does not support your back, nor does it improve your posture. I have a tall, thin frame, and it immediately pulled up around my ribs. They put a sticker on the box that says \\"IMPORTANT NOTICE: Due to health and sanitary issues, this item may not be returned, exchanged, or credited.\\" This should have been mentioned in their ad, as I would not have purchased it, for that reason alone! I suggest trying this on in a store before investing in it. It's been donated to the local thrift store! A huge waste of money! I only gave it one star because it is required when you rate it, otherwise it gets no star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky.

It is a heavy, bulky vest, that may support you while doing chores and such."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY, A BRACE THAT WORKS!!!","review":"I'd ordered this brace with much trepidation, as I've tried many other braces and nothing worked to at least take the edge off the constant back/torso pain. I have severe osteoporosis due to use of steroids (several heart attacks followed by cardiac dye studies; took steroids because I'm allergic to the dye) with resultant fractures of my thoracic spine. Though the fractures have healed, I have not been able to exercise and the muscles are weak and do not support me. Many other braces were tried but none before this brace has helped to relieve the pain and permit me to stand as upright as possible. This brace is the best I have used, and I plan to order another as soon as I'm financially able. And thank you for the speedy delivery! Another thing, the sizing is just as described; I wear size 10 (sometimes 12 in cheaper clothes) which is Medium in brace size, and it fits perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back, posture support","review":"i received the product but it is way too tight. I measured according to the directions before I bought it, and ordered a medium. When it arrived, I put it on, according to the directions, and wore it for 30 minutes. During that time, I could hardly breath and I got a sore above my left hipbone which later developed into a bruise about 3\\" across with a partial scab.I'm afraid I have to send it back to possibly get a larger size, or get my money back. This one was just too tight and uncomfortable. Do I send it back to Amazon or the manufacturer? What if the next one doesn't work, will I get my money back?I'm sorry, but I had great expectations, but the product made me feel as if I would have a heart attack and I had to take it off right away.

The movie features Parker Posey as Jackie-O and if you want to see this superbly written character come to life, then you should go out and rent the dvd as well. Wendy does an amazing job creating characters in a complex world of incest, murder, family disfunction, and insanity. You want all the characters to win even though you know they cannot. Beautifully comedic with crisp witty language and banter. Read it and I promise you will agree!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely Twisted","review":"I read this book and was completely thrown from my seat.

As I'm an ex-paralegal, I find the language of the contracts undertstandable; many of my artist friends seem to think that they are still too filled with legalese, but that's contract law and sometimes necessary. That's the only reason this book gets a 4-star and not a 5-star rating.I'm buying my own copy since I basically trashed the studio's copy -- it's helpful enough that you'll use it on an ongoing basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"good reference","review":"this book is a good starting place its is just not updated, but it is good to get overview then research based on what you read further, some things are still the same and still apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture is WRONG!!

He also analyzes his failures and the reason for why they failed. While Fuddruckers is arguably his most successful Romano's Macaroni grill has also prospered and even though both were sold off reading about their beginning was fascinating. His newest restaurant EatZi's is a great idea that combines upscale grocery store with eating experience. It will be interesting to see if this idea takes off outside of the large cities it is being tired in but overall this book will fascinate you and leave you wanting to start a restaurant of your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lively autobiography of Fuddruckers' innovator","review":"Philip J. Romano is \\"an idea man at heart.\\" The innovative restaurateur launched multiple successful U.S. franchises, including Fuddruckers and Romano's Macaroni Grill.

In this chatty, inside-flavored autobiography, he shares his creative processes and the principles that guide his business decisions.

Some may be looking for Robin Row's story, which has received little public space. But they won't find it here. The author was so careless in her research that some biographical details discussed in this book are not even attached to the right person!This book appears to be the product of some sort of subsidy or vanity press. Certainly it does not merit the attention of anything better. Or the time of a reader seeking anything than to be confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"A page-turner","review":"This book grabbed me from the moment I picked it up. Nancy Whitmore Poore definitely did her homework in depicting the chilling facts surrounding this tragic story, helping the reader get inside the mind of a sociopath and showing us the wreckage left behind for the trusting individuals that opened their hearts and homes to Robin Lee Row.

She was diagnosed with GERD as a newborn and we were told to switch her to a pillow when she turned one. I found this pillow and thought it would be great due to the fact she could feel something all around her like she had been used to with the Nap Nanny. Maybe as she ages she will use it, but as of now she will not. She moves to the opposite side of the crib from where it is.I also wish that the cover zipped on and off so that it was easier to wash.I do feel like I can reintroduce this pillow to her at a later time and she will use it- possibly when she's in her toddler bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my toddler","review":"My son loves it!

Be aware, though, that due to the compact nature of the book and the large number of languages covered, the dictionaries and phrase selections are much smaller than a dedicated language phrasebook.

Kenny Shopsin is a fascinating character and the director did a great job in getting a story that is heartfelt and genuine and honest. Sometimes sweet, gritty, poignant and occasionally dastardly. A once in a lifetime character and movie. Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hang with Kenny","review":"This is like hanging out with Kenny Shopsin for 90 minutes. If you find his personality and cooking style fun and engaging (as I do) you'll love it. If he gets on your nerves, you'll hate it. I found the raw, jumpy, intimate style a great match for Shopsin's own. I think a lot of bad reviews are due to a mismatch between people who think they're going to watch some kind of culinary savant when Shopsin's existence is mostly about family, love, life, and one neurotic's search for wholeness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Like Watching Interesting Documentaries","review":"The premise is promising: an avuncular, crotchety-but-lovable hash slinger (Kenny Shopsin) is being squeezed out of his beloved kitchen by greedy New York landlords and developers. And Kenny's musings on how New York's soul is being devoured by real-estate moguls are indeed interesting. Unfortunately, he has much more to say about a lot of other things, very little of which makes much sense except to him. The movie ends up being the worst thing a documentary can be: uninteresting.I've eaten at Shopsin's a couple of times, and there's nothing charming about it. The food's decent, but the family is boorish and rude, and not in some quaint, lovable way. Kenny Shopsin is repulsive. This film is a good example of how art can make reality look a million times more appetizing than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentary?","review":"This documentary sucks. Its like someone went into Shopsin, spent very little time there and stretched whatever shabby footage he got into a full length documentary. He reused the same shots over and over. He is a terrible shooter by the way. He had limited access to Shopsin and then stuck some kind of title card at the end to make the audience feel sorry for him because his wife passed away. The restaurant is over rated and this documentary is overrated. The title says it all, a real stretch to find meaning in this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effective Translation, Disappointing Scholarship","review":"Although Niyazi Berkes does bring to English significant works of the most prolific Young Turk, this work is disappointing. The dates and names of publications where Ziya Gokalp's essays were originally printed are not listed. This translation makes it impossible to compare the content of the Turkish nationist's ideas with the historical conditions at the time. Readers do not know when or where the essays were read or what may have prompted the writing. Much more scholarship of this kind needs to be done. Compared to other regions of the world, there is a dearth of translation from great Turkish authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of my time","review":"This was so slow, it took 20 chapters to get to the crime and the solving of that crime. This book wasted the first 20 chapters on the simpering feelings of poor Bay Tanner and her sad memories of her dead husband and having to leave her new special man, who is still recovering from his poor wounds but goes off in service to Interpol.

I read the reviews here and decided to order these, which seem like a steal. I knew something was wrong when I couldn't get them to snap very snugly onto my Mach 3, but I shrugged it off and attempted to shave. The shave is terrible! I don't have super thick hair, but I found it impossible to rinse the hair out of the blades using my normal techniques (hold it backwards under running water, or swish it back and forth in a cup of warm water). Further, it fell off my Mach 3 mid-shave. I threw these away, and out of the same wastebasket I retrieved an old, discarded -- but AUTHENTIC -- blade, and shaved with it instead.I don't know if those other reviews were written based on a different stock, but as of now (July 2009), these blades are a ripoff/knockoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull dull dull on arrival...","review":"Glad I found these at a better price than local stores.

I had read a lot of reviews warning about inconsistencies and the potentials of getting an item that was genuine.From my set of razors received, the first one I used was rough to shave with. You could feel it coarsely going as you tried to shave and the lubricating strips didn't seem to do a thing. For a 5-count, to have even just one blade shave rough is not great... The second blade I used was definitely better, yet still nowhere as smooth as store-bought replacements.I'm deciding that perhaps the safest thing to do is to buy replacements directly from the store.."},{"rating":"1","title":"fakes","review":"So dull that they are unusable and the green strip that supposed to have Aloe & Vit.

The other two were fine. My seller was probably disreputable, and doesn't appear to be listed under the used and new at the moment, but there's nothing to stop them re-appearing under a new name in the future.So, unfortunately for those reputable Amazon sellers trying to offer blades at a lower price, I've given up on buying blades online.I've also recently tried the Gillette Fusion razor, and it feels like a substantial improvement over the Mach3, which I had been happy with for years.

However, it might be interesting for the reader studying the ethnocentric views of the Victorian backbencher who wrote it.The book is peppered with allusions to \\"north versus south\\" and \\"west versus east\\", the former being always simple, frugal, booming, manly, while the latter being degenerate, decadent, jealous.In particular the Italians, according to the author, didn't produce a thing of value since classical Roman times, aside, of course, of those northern Italians of non-Mediterranean descent.My advice for those looking for an introductory text on Belisarius: read \\"the Count Bellisarius\\" novel by Robert Graves. Although some facts are inaccurate, it presents more information than this book, but in a more entertaining way and without the arrogance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belisarius","review":"I became intrigued with this little known historical figure after reading the massive Gibbons book. Although Lord Mahon wrote long ago i found his style easy to follow and, as this work is a straight historical piece, I believe he was impartial in his reporting and research. The Life of Belisarius itself would make a great movie. It has all the elements needed; a heroic and loyal figure, a decadent royalty, palace intrigue, adultrous relationships and warfare. All of this under crumbling empire and religion distorted by evil men.

Each island represents a specific lesson for living. Ms. Frawley-Holler's purpose is threefold. First she describes each island with a life's lesson; second, she explains how that lesson relates to our lives; and third, she provides simple (and inexpensive) suggestions of how to incorporate that lesson into our everyday lives. Ms. Frawley-Holler has a wonderful way with words; her descriptions are so vivid that you can visualize the colorful, tropical flowers of Taha'a (Tahiti), smell the spices and fresh ingredients of St. Lucia's \\"slow food\\", feel your hips move to the rhythms of Cuba, and yearn for the romance of Crete.

(There is aftermarket software that can help with this, but you shouldn't have to go there.)2) Connection drop after connection drop.

To be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect this one in the discount bin soon.","review":"This book is merely an anthology of tall-tales and tittle-tattle dressed up as a serious reference book. He recounts scandal after scandal and attributes them to something dark and nebulous called 'culture'. He makes curious comparisons with Western 'culture' (the headlight story above, and the 'do unto others' theory so eloquently and quickly debunked by Frank Ching in the Far Eastern Economic Review') without a single mention of thousands of western business scandals, not least in Backman's own country, where, during the 1980s, there was a string of scandals involving businessmen like Christopher Skase and Alan Bond. They weren't Asian, but quite readily scooted off with millions of dollars of other people's money. Backman has clearly researched and written this book with a set of conclusions already in mind, namely, Asians are innately devious and slippery. Save your money and your time. Give this book a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another western book keen on Asian Bashing.","review":"The author seemed to be more keen on bashing the Asians rather than really exposing the dark side. The book seemed to be focused on comparing Asian economic system with the Westerns' and let the reader know how much superior western people are. That seems to be the primary objective of the author.While the stories about the way they corrupt seem interesting, but continuos comparisons with the west just don't help make the story more intersting.It's just plainly annoying to read. Why didn't the author just go ahead telling the stories on how they corrupt and stop comparing Asia with the Westerners? Those are all the information I need. We don't need a writer to glorify us in this way.Since he is from Australia, and that Australian are known to be anti-Asians, one piece of advice for Mr. Backman: Get to know them(Asians), don't be so engulfed with your racial bias. Maybe you can write a better book next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Discussion of Difficult Topic","review":"Although Osmer bases his conclusions on his theological presuppositions, he is honest enough to admit this upfront and clearly spell out his presuppositions. Working within this framework, Osmer draws out a threefold approach to Christian education, based on the teaching ministry of Paul. At times, Osmer is a bit technical, but overall this book is a helpful and practical guide for congregations serious about dialoguing on educational ministries. This book is most useful if read in conjunction with Osmer's earlier work: The Teaching Office of the Church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devilish Delight","review":"Reading the liner notes of \\"Devil's Food\\" I got to thinking Eddie is referring to people like me. People who have been collecting the vinyl and CD singles for years. Even though I already own most of the stuff on \\"Devil's Food\\" this CD is a worthy addition to my Supersuckers collection. For a child of the 70's like me the cover of \\"Eastbound and Down\\" is worth the cost of this CD alone. For children of this decade \\"Hey Ya\\" will grab their attention. Somehow the The Supersuckers manage to stay surprisingly true to both originals while maintaining the rock n roll nature of the band's traditional style.\\"Gato Negro\\" starts the CD off just right. \\"Shake it Off\\" has a chorus made for stadium rock and listening to \\"Kid's Got it Coming\\" makes you wonder why these guys aren't there yet.For a CD designed to be a holdover until the \\"real\\" album comes out, this is topnotch.

Then, a group of Jews (called the Necrophilites or something) took a Carnival Cruise all the way to Utah, and then after they wrote all that stuff down on gold tablets, they figured the best thing to do would be to go bury them in New York.

He writes most of what he sings and this are some of his best. I always thought of him as a blues singer with great depth of feelings and complete control of his guitar. Others may not agree with me because he is often tied to the folk genre.

It has convenient icon buttons on the top so you can simply press the \\"Rock\\" button and the programmed Rock radio station comes up. It also has an easily accessible MP3 player jack hanging off of the back, so you can directly hook this up. The speakers on this sounds surprisingly decent, and the CD player is capable. This was one of the best alarm clock radios I have ever used honestly. If you are looking for purely an alarm clock, the $80 price I have found on the web seems a bit steep, but if you are looking for a compact device that you can occasionally listen to music in your bedroom with, this surprisingly fits the bill quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I bought this alarm clock primarily for the cd player/alarm clock combo. The cd player has very poor sound quality. I wasn't expecting Bose quality, but the sound is muffled and the volume is difficult to adjust to an acceptable setting. The buttons on top that are used to identify the radio stations have kitschy stickers that are very difficult to apply. You must also remove the top of the clock to lock/unlock the alarm settings, and the top is very difficult to fit in place after removal (aligning the buttons and keeping them from falling off while you place the top back on is a nightmare).I would pass on this one and find another combination cd/alarm clock if that is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"It shouldnt be that hard to use an alarm clock!","review":"From the spec this clock seems impressive, but what isnt mentioned is just how darned difficult this thing is to use. Simple operations like turning off the alarm clock becuase its a holiday weekend require the use of the manual and much experimentation. The controls are hidden under the top and getting that on and off is tricky. Very disappointed, wouldnt recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting and Tragic","review":"The first half of the book is one of the best told stories I've read. The second half is complete ego of Bugliosi. Bruce Henderson, the co author and author of a great book Trace Evidence, probably wrote the first half. I almost felt like I was on the island or had met the murdered couple. I was disappointed in Bugliosi's blind faith in his client's innocence. It's as if he did not read the first half himself. All in all, one of my favorite true crime books."},{"rating":"1","title":"First half: 4-stars, 2nd half: 1-star","review":"In a nutshell, the book is a real page turner for the first half, which follows the actual events that took place on the island.THEN, we go into trial mode and the fun ends.

I could not finish the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-serving book","review":"I thought the first part of the book was a page-turner. But less that halfway through, I had to force myself to read it. I thought it was a self-serving book for Mr. Bugliosi. How he says \\"I just can't defend a client unless I know they are innocent\\" and I love how when the judge tells him he can only have a certian amount of time for his closing statement, he is sure to tell the judge (and us) how another judge thought his 13 hour closing statement was the best one he has ever heard. I'm not in the mood for an author who beefs himself up in a book. I couldn't even force myself to finish it-it was that boring! Perhaps lawyers will enjoy it since it's 99% courtroom & 1% true crime"},{"rating":"2","title":"True crime stories do not get better than this.","review":"This book is an absolutely superb true crime story. Bugliosi, as he did in \\"Helter Skelter\\", does not waste any words, despite his penchant for excruciating details. The book reads like a first rate novel, but it's true, and that's what makes it even better reading. The geographic setting of the Pacific Ocean and deserted islands, and the adventure of sailing, is icing on the cake"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"And the Sea Will Tell\\"","review":"Forgettable title, but what a fantastic true crime book. Sometimes the mini-series based on this excellent narrative by (former prosecutor turned defense attorney) Vincent Bugliosi, shows up on television (starring Rachel Ward, James Brolin, Richard Crenna) and it's also a real stunner.What really happened on the remote South Seas island of Palmyra? How did a young hippie couple who ditched their leaky boat end up sailing majestically back to Oahu on a fabulous yacht? And what happened to the yacht's owners, Matt and Muffie Graham?Bones wash up on the island six years after the couple's disappearance--and two young people are arrested for murder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Reading!!","review":"Vincent Bugliosi is not only a top-notch prosecutor & attorney, he's also a top-notch writer!

You never come close to finding out what actually happened, possibly because he is trying to convince us of the innocence of his client. he writes a lot from the standpoint of characters who are dead and could never have shared these thoughts with anyone. So basically it is a work of fiction. I skimmed the last three hundred pages because within fifty pages of it you already had all of the facts and the rest was reiteration. with no resolution. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"grand fiction","review":"The femme fatale in this yarn has convinced the author that she was just an innocent passenger in the cruise of the Iola to Palmyra, the murder of Mac and Muff Graham, the theft of the Seawind, the return to Hawaii in the pirated craft, and everything else that transpired.Why did she stop to get her dog and thereby get arrested? [Huh?].After her arrest, what did she flush down the toilet in the ladies' room of the Hawaii Yacht Club?Why did they paint the stolen boat's hull a new color (white with lavender trim) but leave the cabin its original blue?Real people did the crime to real victims in real places, but Bugliosi overlooked more opportunities to find facts than did the prosecutors.An exciting story, it should not be considered entirely factual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugliosi what were you thinking???","review":"I read this book hoping it would be as good as Helter Skelter, I was wrong. Although the story itself is very interesting the fact that Bugliosi would later write a book slamming other attorneys for defending their \\"guilty\\" client is laughable. He believes his client had no idea people were murdered on the tiny island she was on with only her boyfriend and the dead couple. Ridiculous! She may have not been guilty of murder but she sure knew what had happened. Bugliosi, I feel, prosecuted aCharles Manson and his \\"family\\" in the early 70's and has lived off the glory of one of the biggest trials of the 20th century since. He believes his own hype. He should be careful of whom he judges and attacks, no one will know for sure what happened in the case of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman just like no one will know if Bugliosi was played by Jennifer Jenkins."},{"rating":"1","title":"And the sea will tell","review":"The first part of the book was interesting,( I lived on the Island most of 1947), but there was too muchlegal stuff after the boat was discovered in Honolulu."},{"rating":"1","title":"And The Sea Will Tell","review":"My biggest problem with the book is the cause of death as related by the authors. It is difficult to believe someone, or possibly two individuals, killed and burned two people, then put them in a box or boxes, to sink them in the lagoon. Further this was all done to steal a boat worth maybe $100k. The murderers then sailed the boat back to the Hawaiian Islands where it had left approximately a month or so prior.I read the book during my personal sail down to Palmyra and spent a week investigating the atoll while trying to reconcile the story. I'm wondering what other readers have to say or think about this story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start, Slow Finish","review":"This is a fascinating story of murder on a deserted island. The first half of the book is a riveting, well-developed account of two couples seeking paradise and finding disaster. Descriptions are thorough, and character development is excellent. However the latter-half of the book dealing with the trial is long-winded and somewhat annoying. Bugliosi's entire 5-hour closing argument fills page after tedious page, and I found myself simply skimming over the latter 1/4 if the book. Legal buffs and lawyers will enjoy it, the rest of us will be content to indulge in the characters, the island and the crime, and then simply browse through the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"and the sea will tell","review":"very interesting as I know the characters involved.

I did lose much respect for him, however, as I do believe that \\"Jennifer\\" is just as guilty as her friend, and she found freedom she doesn't deserve only through the efforts of a very competent and wily attorney."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Murder Mystery Showing The Mechanics Of A Real Trial","review":"This story is very intreguing due to the opposing nature of the couples, the mystery of the accused, and the remoteness of the crime. I found the beginning of the book to be a little dry and difficult to get enthusiatic; however, after the crime, it became gripping, and I found my self unable to put it down. The trial and presentation of the evidence was astounding. However, the author's use of footnotes caused it to be disjointed and difficult to read. If he had written these facts into the story, I feel it would have been much more enjoyable. Still, I recommend this book and can't wait for the TV-miniseries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Vincent!","review":"This is a very good audio book, Vincent is an excellent writer. As a matter of fact I still have this book on cassette. The only reason I did not give \\"And the Sea Will Tell\\" a 10 is because the book is abridged. I could not find the unabridged version. I would like to hear the whole story. Excellent!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabs you from start to finish!","review":"When I began reading this book, I felt very little fondness or compassion for the \\"hippie\\" couple, Jennifer and Buck. However, the story never ceased to hold my interest and kept me wanting to know more about the two couples who unwittingly found each other on this desolute island. By the time Vince Bugliosi took on the case of Jennifer Jenkins, I was spellbound by his inexhaustible and brilliant pursuit of a \\"not guilty\\" verdict for this woman who seemed to be as guilty of murder as anyone could be. Yet, by the time he presented his summation at the trial, I was praying that Jennifer would be found innocent because Vincent Bugliosi proved to me, beyond a reasonable doubt, that she was, in fact, innocent. This is one book I will never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been as good in 400 pages, but good","review":"This book started off as a typical true crime book of the Ann Rule variety, and ended up being a transcript of hundreds of pages of trial; the latter was a bit dry. Bugliosi does a good job of convincing the reader that his client was completely innocent (so why did he give her a fictitious name in the book?), but I still have my doubts. All in all, it is more a book about his courtroom style than the crime itself. I thought that it could have been 30% shorter if he left out everything that was repeated. But, this was a book about Bugliosi, not Stephanie Stearns (alias Jennifer Jenkins)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't offend easily, but this book did it.","review":"The first half of the book is outstanding - a compelling and descriptive account of the circumstances leading up to the crime, and the investigation. Then, sadly, the book devolves into Bugliosi writing himself a love letter about how brilliantly he got an obviously guilty woman acquitted. I understand that as a defense attorney, that's his job. But what an insult to the family of the victims to then profit further and proclaim his genius in print. I found it offensive enough that I almost didn't finish, and out of thousands of books I've read, I can count the number I didn't finish on one hand. Okay, Vince, we know you're famous - you prosecuted the Manson family - a group of disorganized idiots that confessed. Not exactly a Clarence Darrow moment. At least he's trying to redeem himself by publicly accusing W of murder for lying to get us into the Iraq mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good first half, poor second half","review":"I found the first half of the book well written and fascinating. The second half is what I would expect from an egotistical defense attorney. Should have had someone like Anne Rule write an objective account.

At that time, they were recorded on 33.3 long-playing vinyl and over the years, deteriorated. Being very familiar with the nine symphonies, and being especially fond of the Szell-directed Cleveland Orchestra, I purchased the box set as described in the title. I was dismayed that during the ends of several movements, the recording suddenly shifted to the next without finishing the previous, thereby truncating my enjoyment of some of the most dramatic music ever composed and performed. I would not recommed this box set to anyone who would like to hear the complete nine symphonies, but gave it two stars because at this stage of my life, something is better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"While this compilation could have had some potential, the production quality of this DVD is poor at best.

However it lets itself down hugely with the code sections and at times the rather clunky way of explaining some algorithms. The code should of been pseudo code and most of the math functions that are used with the code are never ever explained despite a laughable introduction at the start which covers about 10% of what you actually need to know.I've rewritten most of the applications in java and found them to be far more straight forward than explained and laid out in the book. Which is a pity because his style is light and the information necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This book is class. Really great and the author is a gentleman.

I purchased this book to get a better idea of how to program game AI without the usage of massive switch statements and this is the holy grail. Every example he offers in the book is a real world, down to earth application of a game AI. It covers pathing graphics as well as Finite state machines, with a branch into Fuzzy state machines as well. I highly recommend this book.

A fusion of Western and African traditions in popular idioms, Highlife features interesting rhythms, distinctive guitar styles, and a surprisingly harmonious combination of guitar playing with brass and woodwinds.

It makes an ideal background music during prayerful meditation or during relaxation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of the Glittering Metaphor","review":"I have to agree with reviewer Merrick. Dickson certainly has a way with words. His mastery of the metaphor is superb. Mr. Merrick cited some of the best ones. But how about \\"flashed their katanas in the air like blades of wind-blown silver glass\\"? That was certainly my favorite. Little poetic gems like this are sprinkled throughout \\"The Golden Crane\\". It amazes me that this author is self-publishing, too. There is so much garbage put out by the publishing industry, you'd think they would pick up a talented author like this. Or perhaps Dickson just doesn't want to deal with them. Who knows. In any case, I hope he continues his writing. I look forward to enjoying his future works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced, beautifully written historical fiction","review":"I read a lot of fiction, especially historical fiction; and stumbled upon this little gem of a book while surfing Amazon.com.It's only a little over two hundred pages, but Dickson crams a lot of vibrant action and original plotting into those pages.

It would just spin and spin inside and read NO DISC... one time I couldn't even get it to open again to get the movie out!

After a brief phone call to Magnavox, it was very easy for them to politely tell me to take a hike - their interest in their product was over after 90 days, and it was now the 105th day.

This one actually has less features than my cheaper DVD player, with inexplicable gaps. For example, you can select what time in the movie you want to jump to, but you cannot view the time in the movie that you are at. Not to mention there is no way to see how much time is left in the movie. It's hard to understand how the designers could leave such a fundamental function out of the player. Even old VHS players can do this. Magnavox: Stupid. Very stupid.Another problem is the lack of a 2nd video out, which my cheaper DVD player had. Not to mention 2nd audio outs.

The author not only gives her take on the issue by providing painful details of her own abortion at the age of fourteen following a horrible experience with sexual abuse but also defines many of the nuts and bolts that allows abortion to actually thrive in this country.Just touching on issues, she is able to allow the reader to see many more of the ugly realities surrounding the subject than most books almost forcing the reader to further investigate to better acquaint themselves with the truth. She doesn't miss much at all.

Here, he's just too old and had been through too much in real life (the war and the earlier death of his wife Carole Lomabard) to cavort around like he does in the movie, and with Greer Garson no less!

I would suggest this book as a learning tool for people interested in opening their own small business. It will give you insight to yourself and the way you manage a company depending on outside influences and internal problems. The book was really easy to follow and gave you a clear idea of what was to be expected. The book is merely a guide to a mock simulation of a small company challenged by similiar companies in the same industry. The program was not as user friendly as it could be and made it burdensome to look at necessary reports at one time. Several run time errors were encountered along the way. Overall the book opened my eyes to the experience of competition in a dog eat dog world of survival."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare and practically impossible to find...but strictly DOPE!!!","review":"I bought this CD from a guy a while back who told me that O.Z. recorded this CD but there was some kind of problem with the label and it never got officially released. If that's true, it's a tragedy because this CD is amazing. Of the 14 tracks on this CD, there are about 5 absolute classics, 7 great songs that you would never skip, and 2 that you might skip.I don't understand why O.Z. didn't blow up like a lot of the other Bay Area rappers during his time (Mac Mall, Mac Dre, Dubee, etc.). His first CD is also extremely hard to find but that CD was a classic too. My advice is not to sleep on O.Z. and get this CD and his first one, which is self titled.

Outdoor mounting tape solved the problem, but i think i spent close to the same amount on the tape as I did on the extender. Another issue that would not affect everyone buying this product is that my corolla's one and only 12v socket is under one of the cup holders and the extender plug sticks out and blocks the space where a cup could otherwise be placed.

We had a GPS, phone charger, and FM transmitter that we often use at the same time, but our car only has two built-in outlets. On long trips, we'd have to always be keeping an eye on what was charged and what was weak so we could switch the cords around when necessary. This resulted in mess, confusion, and a snarl of wires.With this, I was able to plug in all our devices permanently, drop the adapter in a little enclosed niche under our dashboard, plug it in, and forget about it. I routed the wires where they made sense in the vehicle, and now we can just enjoy our trip, knowing we have power where we need it. Plus, we now have two outlets still available for anything else that comes along!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressed!","review":"I have purchased about 10 socket extenders during the past year ranging from $7 - $35.

They are all cheap junk made in China. Why doesn't some manufacturer offer a competitive item that isn't junk? I've had a different brand of one of these in my 99 Camry for years and years with heavy use and never an issue.

This firm requires all Partners and Associate Partners to take a course on relationship selling based upon Mahan Khalsa's priciples. What i personnely found most intesting, being a decision sciece practitioner by education, is the mix between biology, psychology and practical selling process.I'd recommend this to anyone who sells multi-millon dollar dealso of any sort (products or services), or anyone who sells mission critical business products/services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shortened our sales cycle and gave sales process credibilty","review":"This book has shortened our sales cycle from a 6 month average to a 2.5 month average. No longer are we wasting money and time with customers that we can't help or don't really want help. I have always despised the hard sell, and the persuasive selling technics of so many experts in the field. Through mutual exploration we now find solutions with our clients that exactly meet thier needs or we don't do business, and we part friends - instead of trying to fulfil unknown expectations and losing the relationship forever. Using the ORDER model has given our sales process direction and is helping us develop true intent to helping our customers suceed. We are committed to this win - win philosophy.Sales Director, Interwest Consulting Group"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Real advice, but a bit too Playful","review":"This informal book is good if you do sales in a service/consulting related industry where the client may not quite know what they are looking for (or why). I really liked his ideas about trying to make presentations in person (because people don't really read proposals). There are some great tips on how to ask the right questions to find out what a potential client is really thinking. Seasoned sales professionals may find some of this advice old hat, but it's never bad to be reminded of some good basic ideas. Khalsa does have a weakness for having silly charts, acronyms and rambles a bit too long - by the end of the book I found myself wanting the author to get more to the point. But if you are new to sales or wouldn't mind a good refresher course this book is pretty useful, but by no means the definitive text on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This is a review of the CD collection.

Unfortunately,there is little correlation between what he proposes is a \\"process\\" (it's not) and the concepts articulated in the book.

In essence, they chart a path that helps avoid the endless, counter-productive (and often adversarial) relationships between client and professional services firms.They start at the right point: by showing that consultants are often guilty of arrogantly not listening. However, they also take clients to task for demanding endless RFP and proposals from consultants from whom the client has no intention of purchasing.The solution is a mindset that fully accepts that not every client wants a true partnership-based relationship, and choosing only to work with those who do. It is a gutsy book, but also an important one for anyone selling (or buying) professional services."},{"rating":"2","title":"Major breakthrough in How to SELL !","review":"I have worked with Mahan for many years and funded some of his early work in teaching others the magic of his process.

Chris left behind her gentle pop style for something more urban with a little bit of attitude. The switch suited her well. The beats are all nice and the club beats are real system bangers. There are some midtempo joints thrown in to help create a balance. Chris has some really good lyrics on this album as well and the collaborations were done perfectly. My fav song would be, \\"Whos Gonna Ride\\". The beat is super sick and Christina's take no mess attitude and lyrics really make the song pop. 3 6 Mafia's appearance is an added bonus to the track.

Though at first I found these books rather difficult to read, I have come to absolutely love them. The two volume Book of Lost Tales gives much information on the creation of Middle Earth and some of the important events that happened in the first age. In the Book of Lost Tales 2, a page has been included from Tolkien's original manuscripts. Seeing that made me appreciate all the work that Christopher Tolkien went to even more. I am very grateful to him for making all these stories available to Tolkien fans. Probably the thing I like best about reading these books is that I now understand the vague references to history that are included in The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Tis good for people who like the Olde Englysshe epic style","review":"These are the earliest versions of the legends which were posthumously compiled as The Silmarillion. Most of the stories are MUCH more detailed than they later became, and Tolkien's style is very dense, more imitative of Old English than it later became. It is remarkable how fully Tolkien had already conceived of these legends at a very early age. Although lacking its later refinement, Tolkien's mastery of modern English as a medium for expressing the epic style of Old English works is very evident and quite enjoyable. The Fall of Gondolin and the legend of Turin Turambar are more compellingly told in their full, earlier versions. Christopher Tolkien (son of J.R.R.) deserves credit for very comprehensive annotations. I loved it, as I love all Tolkien's works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Version of The Silmarillion as told by Tolkien's son","review":"\\"The Book of Lost Tales 2\\" includes several tales which will be a classic part of \\"The Silmarillion\\", yet all of these are in a cruder, more rudimentary form, than what readers have seen in the latter work. Among the most important changes is depicted in the early version of the tale of Beren and Luthien, here entitled \\"The Tale of Tinuviel\\", where Beren was conceived first by Tolkien as a gnome, not a man. There is also an extensive recounting of \\"The Fall of Gondolin\\", the Elvish refuge from Morgoth, not seen in \\"The Silmarillion\\". This is an important book for both scholars and fans of Tolkien, since his son Christopher provides excellent commentary and related material (e. g. poetry) in which he compares and contrasts the stories in this volume with their later versions in \\"The Silmarillion\\". So if you not read \\"The Silmarillion\\", I strongly recommend doing so before reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lexico Tabacalero","review":"This book offers not only a complete guide for the cuban cigar aficionado but many interesting cultural insights on the tobacco growers in the island.

The best thing about the Dr. Jekyll is Mr. Hyde who isn't seen nearly enough. He had the most dramatic potential. Instead we have to suffer through dithering Baltimorean-Brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition.

I finally understand who I am, and that there are others out there like me. I don't feel so bad anymore knowing that being a nerd is ok.

People who got into the guts of the machine to truly understand (or \\"grok\\") how it works and why. From the Tech Model Railroad Club to Apple, these are the people who we can thank for the Internet, for personal computers and for just about any automated system we take for granted today.Taken another way, this book demonstrates an often-overlooked way of teaching and learning. The Hackers have one thing in common: An innate desire to learn. Sometimes all it takes is putting a person in a room with something interesting, and letting them explore. That person will learn more than any book or lecture could have taught.Finally, this book is can be a great gift for a student of computers. Just the thing to inspire someone to greater things."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BORING!","review":"I could barely stand reading this book... it leads to nowhere.

Other reviews go into much greater detail of the time periods and the technology so I wont repeat it here. I'm more echoing what others have said.

However, the only thing that compelled me to keep reading past the remarkable setting was the intriguing ambiguity about whether the main character was Seraphita or Seraphitus.Unfortunately, the main point of the whole story was religious awakening. There was extensive discussion of Swedenborg, who apparently founded yet another Christian sect.

Why is there zero research out there valdiating a procedure that has been around for over 40 years? Before you spend a penny on AIT, make an appointment, that your insurance WILL cover, to talk to an Ear, Nose, and Throat physician or audiologist about it.

The pictures aren't clear, pre-point & shoot digital. I don't collect bugs so I don't know if the suggestions for collecting are spot on or not. A book that I bought later, Field Guide to Insects of North America, by Eric R. Eaton & Kenn Kaufman, has worked well for me. As I live in New England, Mary Holland's book, Naturally Curious, is amazing. She lists month by month what's happening outside and bugs are included. Her photography is incredible. She also has diagrams. If she uses scientific words, she explains their meaning in context rather than a glossary at the end. Using both of these books has helped me begin to understand entomology."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I needed","review":"A while back, I found the corpse of an insect and wondered what it might have been, which led me to noticing bugs more than ever before.

Subsequent events such as Kargil war have shown how dangerous these weapons are in hands of emotional and fragile south asian leaders. The fact that it took Clinton's personal attention to avoid a potential nuclear conflict is an eye opener. Both India and Pakistan should focus on their economies and improve the life of their people, instead of using nuclear weapons to do jingositic posturing and to win elections. Pakistan's subsequent establishment of a nuclear shopping mall, in which various countries shopped for nuclear technology shows how dangerous the nuclear game is.

I didn't get to finish the story, so have ordered my own copy of the book. I liked what I heard, I found it somewhat ironic to be slapping mosquitos while listening to the people in the story being tormented by them, as well. Kafka does a great job of creating characters so three-dimensional that their personalities pop out of the story even through the voice of Dick Estell.

In the first 18 pages she talks about being a hermit, her dog disappearing (for which she doesn't seem upset) not wanting to talk to people (interesting for a bush pilot) has 3 flashbacks and tells you she basically doesn't want human contact..... If you want a good Alaskan mystery try Christopher Lane or Sue Henry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well for 6 months","review":"We bought the Hamilton Beach model 22559 toaster, and it worked well for about 6 months. The price was reasonable, the toaster itself looked good on our counter and produced good toast. The features that we used, such as toasting bagels on one side, performed appropriately. We were happy with our purchase for 6 months until that 'made in China' quality, with which we are all much too familiar, manifested itself. The darkness control stopped functioning, and all toast was uniformly burned to a crisp.Perhaps I am living too much in the past, but six months seems a short life span for a toaster - consequently the one star review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased as punch","review":"I purchased this car as a Christmas gift for my husband.

Although Harpy Thyme was well conceived, Geis of the Gargoyle put him back in the slump that Demons Don't Dream left him in. This one is worse. The puns are getting old, which is bad, because Xanth is made out of puns. Metria's character is represented well, but that's about the only interesting part of this book. The rest of it is all inane drivel. It seems like he typed this book with a really bad hangover. He is also forgetting a lot of what made his older books, from Spell for Chameleon to Isle of View, so enchanting; thier realism. There were real relationships and tragedies and all that, and in this book, everything is so plastic and perfect. There are a lot of loose plot ends.

The sounds of birds and water is relaxing and soothing. It kind of makes you feel like your at a private beach and you're lying down in the chair listening to the natural sounds around you.

Some of it isn't bad, Anthony Michael Hall's \\"Hallelujah\\" has some good to it, but most is better for the 18 yr. old crowd, not me.

The table itself is made of cheap plastic and bends very easily. If it hangs off the side of your table even a little bit, you'll have problems with people bending it when they reach accross or rest their arms on it. When folded out, there was a significant gap between the two pieces that made moving cards across the table a pain because they would catch in the gap. The \\"felt\\" is more like a thin industrial carpet. It's very rough to the touch and cards will not slide across it at all. The chip holders are made from the thinnest platic possible. It's so thin that you can cut your finger on the corner if you're not careful. They are glued down poorly and actually started curling up on the corners during my first play session.

[\\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\" with Julia Roberts is one example]. \\"Lady In A Cage\\" exploits an invalid which is hardly a laughing matter. True...Olivia's performance is a bit over-the-top, but imagine yourself trapped in a confined area watching goons invade your house. James Caan is convincing, but I found myself getting a little twichy after the first 30 minutes. Ann Sothern's appearance as \\"The Goodyear Blimp\\" made me wish she was doing her own TV shows instead of this mess!Perhaps the definition of a good actor is his or her ability to make a thin plotline look better than it actually is?

White male gang leader's arrogance gets gang in trouble.6. Gang runs afoul of adult mobsters from fence's store.7. Campos tries unsuccessfully to escape with girl.8. Campos is actually smarter than the gang leader and is thereader and speller of the group.These elements appear to be found in many stories about juvenile criminality.

Her cries for help are answered by 3 brutal killers who torment her like a caged animal. The story is a fascinating character study of a spoiled woman transforming into a savage in ten sweltering hours. It is also an open social commentary on the increasing violence and carelessness of the early sixties. Like \\"Whatever Happened To Baby Jane,\\" \\"Lady In A Cage\\" has a unique story, a fantastic, tortured leading lady, and an ensemble of side villains that meet surprising fates.

Over time, the iron build up gives my hair orange and gold tones. This shampoo (formerly known as \\"Simply Silver\\") removes those unwanted tones and leaves my hair shiny and soft.I can't keep up with the business decision Nexxus makes. Simply Silver was taken off of the market, then put back on only to be removed again shortly thereafter. Now, the shampoo has been rebranded and only available in salons and online. No salons in my area stock Nexxus products, so it's either order online or travel 100 miles to purchase it.

What was strong on this disc hardly merits the price of the CD.Disc 2 is rap oriented, but provides little that is special. In addition, the only version of this CD available is edited, and that is one of my number one pet peeves with any disc. I don't care about profanity, but I detest censoring what's already there in a song, and this disc does it. The upside to the second disc is that it is longer, but most of the rap on here is mainstream, poppy, dreggy, and B-O-R-I-N-G.

This movie is not marketed to a certain crowd, what it does is brilliant, it tries to bring rock and rap into the same culture. As a person that DJ's and listens to all kinds of music, I would recomend this album for the rap listener or the rock listener, for the ones who dont think this is a good rock album.

Two discs of songs and only totalling 20 tracks first of all is sort of a ploy by the music industry I don't really like..I want more than 10 tracks per disc. Also, spliting the rock and rap discs seems a little ridiculous to me. But to the music, two stars is still generous since out of 20 tracks, I found only three noteworthy ones and even they are stretches. The remix of \\"Bodies\\" butchers the song in my opinion compared to the the original track found on Drowning Pool's Sinner album. Noteworthy songs were Orbital's Technologique and Fermin IV...the \\"Bush\\" song \\"Adernaline\\" is pretty weak in comparision to other Bush tracks. As for the second disc, I found nothing I enjoyed there at all, just a bunch of tracks that sound the same.

The reading comprehension content, both fictional and nonfictional, was good.

This book's greatest strength is the additional skills review section it includes - it reviews context questions, outlining, bibliographies, and research skills.

This is an excellent text. Although quite challenging in places for an introductory text, the author organizes material in such a way that students can cover the basics and then extend/apply them. For students who want to go beyond the basics, the book provides additional material and illustrations. Particularly helpful are: the many sections throughout the book where concepts are listed in summary form; and the definitions of key terms printed at the bottom of each page. I use this in an International Baccalaureate (Higher Level) economics class with IB Diploma high school seniors in their second year of economics study. Since the book is written primarily for students in the U.K., it allows U.S. students to apply concepts using examples beyond their own country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shuts down during utility \\"brownouts\\"","review":"This would be a 5-star product if it didn't shut down during the most extreme utility brownouts on hot summer days. This happened to me twice this summer in the New York City area (ConEdison). It's the only electronic product I own that doesn't operate normally at all times with ConEdison power. When the voltage drops below a certain point, the lights go out and can't be turned on, although the LEDs on the dimmer switches continue to glow. When the voltage increases above the dimmers' threshold, the lights come on at full strength. If you have these switches in bedrooms, as I do, it's imperative to turn them off with the tiny push-pull switch before going to bed during a brownout that has caused the lights to go out. Otherwise you will wake up in the middle of the night to maximum light when the voltage comes back to within Leviton's acceptable range. The old-style Leviton touch dimmers with left-right on-off switches are not affected by brownouts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointing Von Marburg Book","review":"The layout and design of the book are great.

For this, he hires two local youths, brothers who are close enough in image and attitude they could be twins. But all is not as it seems amongst the natives.Demonstrating once again his prowess for taking a small community, injecting it with an external gay influence and making the results sing like a high-tension wire in a windstorm, Paul Russell does an excellent job in his newest novel, \\"War Against the Animals.\\" Rich with metaphor and symbolism, \\"...Animals\\" is a subtle, poignant, and wonderful novel.

Nobody writes a review with that much insight and worded so well unless it was a professional.Secondly, this book is awful. It's not badly written (compared to a lot of the drek out there!) but the story is forced and the characters are shallow. Each character is defined by just one atribute -- not a single one is a fully-developed, well-rounded person.

Does this author have the ability to write characters with any dignity? Do all of his gay characters need to live in a rarified world where the hunt of sex justifies any action no matter how deplorable?Beyond the distastefulness of the subject matter, an even larger issue is the author's inability to give his characters (gay or straight!) any depth. They are merely cardboard cutouts acting without any genuine motivation. Max, Perry, Kyle, Donna, Leanne, Elliot are all one-note characters that act simply as plot devices to move along a laggard storyline, rather than showing any kind of complex thought or emotion.There are some wonderful gay novels out there that don't whitewash the gay experience, yet don't debase it either. And there are some wonderful gay authors who take the time and have the ability to put the human experience in deeper, fuller context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Emotional Read","review":"The book was not predictable like other stories, but Russell crafted the novel so well that I didn't feel lost or confused.
