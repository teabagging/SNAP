The book does share a good insight at the origins of Yes but falls short in a few areas. Mr Welch tries to convey the emotion of the music too much at times. It is very difficult to describe Yes Music since it involves pure feeling. We learn more about Yes's love affair with Vegetarian store than with the band. I had the distinct impression that Chris was trying to protect the bandmembers by not bringing up enough of their personal lives. There was also not enough work devoted to Yes in the studio. What we need is to have each bandmember right an biography of the band, then we can piece it together. David Carlin, Phila.

But Chris dropped the ball big-time.Most of the book deals with 70s Yes - in fact some of it reads like Hedges' book. But once we get into the 90125-era the author resorts solely to interviews for his material. The story drops any pretense at narrative and becomes a transcript of his interview tapes.And the period from 90125 to the present is merely glossed over; there is no depth in his writing. The reader comes away with the impression that this period is unimportant to the author, and maybe even to the band itself. Maybe that's why live Yes consists in large part of music from three 70s albums and rarely of music post-90125.Overall a lukewarm offering.Whatever happened to the book BEYOND AND BEFORE that was promised in the Yes boxed set of 1991?"},{"rating":"2","title":"what is all about","review":"I saw them in concert many years ago, it was their first tour.

The subjects are religion and beauty / self image. The story is told in the first person and is set in the recent past (the narrator being adult) in, I think, Finland, as well as in the narrator's adolescence (around 13 years, I would say) in Britain. Page really creates a sense of place for both periods and parallel story lines that hold on to you.

Strangely, the author does mention the use of \\"myself\\" in place of \\"me\\" (thus, \\"Jane played golf with Fred and myself\\") but seems to think people say \\"myself\\" because they feel it pretentious to say \\"me\\".

I appreciate some of the ideas for ways to incorporate Reiki into everyday life, such as charging household appliances with Reiki or using Reiki to separate two glasses that are stuck together. For the most part, though, it seems the authors are determined to attach a lot of rules and technical instructions to the beautifully simple practice of Reiki. For those who are into a lot of ceremony or who rely on studious planning and precise execution to strengthen their own focus, the book might be a fun or even helpful addition to a Reiki library. But it seems almost insulting to Reiki to imply that all the extra attention makes Reiki better or changes the effect that it may have.

That must be Solti's, because he set the standard, which stands to this day. Then, if you're hooked, you can start with the historic performances such as this one, the Kna '56, the Furt '53 and '50.

It is an okay story, but not really fully developed, has clunky dialogue, and is a little cliched. Better to stick to her later romantic offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music worth your while","review":"Henry Lee provides some terrific music to snap those fingers and tap those toes to, while mixing in some heart-wrenching ballads that make you remember the good ol' days. \\"I'll Hurt for You\\", \\"Just Another Day\\" and \\"I Know How You Feel\\" catch my heart in my throat with their impassioned lyrics and soul-wrenching music. This album is a delicious fore-taste of exceptional music to come in later CDs. If you like blues and rock and a touch of pop, this is a sure hit and a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toe-tapping, finger-snapping, grooving fun!","review":"His earlier nationally-released album, this is full of grooving beats, heart-wrenching ballads, and loaded with fun. If possible, also check out Henry Lee's later incredible albums, \\"Way Past Midnight\\" and \\"Slamdunk\\".

Hands on the Radio sums about a whole lot of my life. Three of the songs (Danielle Don't, I'll Wait for You, and oh, geez, I can't recall the name of the other one) are some of the greatest break-up songs of all time. I remember when I Wish I Had A Girl was on continuous play on MTV. But that's not even the best song on the album. They're all great. Wing Tip Shoes? My theme song for every job I ever had! It's like this guy crawled inside my head and wrote songs for every emotion! Great artist. Great album. Must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Henry Lee at his best! (almost)!","review":"This is the Henry Lee album all of his others will be measured by. \\"Wish I had a Girl\\" , \\"Wing Tip Shoes\\" , & \\"Got no Money\\" are all Henry Lee Classics. One of the keys to enjoying Henry Lee's music is to see one of his live performances. His work is so much more enjoyable once you've had a taste of his incredible charisma, energy level & stage presence.

The instructor only shows you how to do the moves, she doesn't spend any time at all doing them. You have to stop the video if you want to spend any time at all practicing the moves and stretches. But, if you don't mind having to stop the video after each demonstration, it is a good workout. The moves are very easy, basic and good for beginners. I don't think this tape is worth twenty dollars, but then again, the only other options are, in my opinion, outrageously priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The poor quality of the video itself has made it impossible for me to enjoy the video, the sound quality and visual quality are simply atrocious.

I got the sensual art of belly dance with Neena and Veena, and the two Ancient Art of Oriental Belly dancing.I found it difficult to follow along. Being new to belly dance I have a hard enough time learning the moves and what was harder was that she had finger cymbals, so I got thrown off beat and a bit confused.I hurt my muscles in one of the knee bend exercises, and there hadn't been a warning or anything, so be advised the warm ups aren't all easy... let alone safe.I believe it would probably be better had I known some belly dancing before this video. It seemed like something for intermediate, not beginner like me... or perhaps it just wasn't explained properly. Take into account the bellydancing looks great, but it is difficult to folow with the movie, so you may have to rewind several times before you get the moves... at least I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I just love this video!

And it's nice exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect a whole lot...","review":"This video is not terrible, however the videography, editing, sound, and tape quality is so bad that it interferes with the entire experience. (Analog VHS) Though it is dated in the late 80s, I would guess that it was made somewhat earlier. The exercises appear good (haven't tried them yet) however the instruction is somewhat minimal. It is not really an excerise tape in that it doesn't lead you through a routine. The instructor only gives you directions on HOW to DO the excercises. I must say that I was fairly amused by the ineptitude (as another reviewer mentioned)of the whole performance/filming. The excercise costumes are quite bizarre as well. The one good thing I can say is that Alexandra puts the moves into little mini dances that are helpful in seeing how everything can fit together. However, I personally will be shopping around for another tape..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A challenge for the beginning dancer.","review":"This is a nice beginning bellydance tape for the price. Some of the warm-ups are very challenging for the beginner and should be attempted carefully but she does clearly state this when she demonstrates the more difficult moves. The technical production is not great but she can be clearly heard and seen. The moves taught are fairly comprehensive for beginning level. Although better teaching tapes are offered through specialty websites at considerably higher prices, among the readily available commercial bellydance tapes, this is a good one and a good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The book was long and boring.

It helped me understand macrobiotics and the whole yin/yang foods thing. This book explains in a simple and warm tone about expansive and contractive foods, cravings, and the accumulation of toxins from extreme, or high stress foods.

With a good balance of philosophy and recipes, author Christina Turner explains why we feel the way we do when we eat certain foods. Her explainations of yin and yang foods corresponding to yin and yang moods and conditions are the best I've seen. Other topics include: eating in season; losing weight; gaining weight; using sea vegetables; using certain foods to alleviate specific symptoms; time saving ideas; salt, fat, and dairy; suggested shopping list; dietary guidelines.In my opinion the book is best suited as a transitional book into the macrobiotic lifestyle; it's not a stopping point, but excellent a starting point.

Besides claiming Baudelaire is a Spanish poet(!), Smith practically ignores Patchen's energetic, highly individual work in favor of detailing the poet's politics and undeniably painful medical history, which is not how any poet of Pathcen's talents would want to be remembered. What's more unfortunate than Patchen's record of ill health is that his poetry and novels and art continue to be overlooked after his death - just as they were during his difficult life. If ever an American poet deserved critical reconsideration, it's Mr. Kenneth Patchen. Before you spend your good money on this self-published socio-political diatribe, please purchase every Patchen book that remains in print. Then buy second copies to give as gifts. Fans of e.e. cummings, one of Patchen's many writerly pals, should really enjoy Patchen's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just GREAT!","review":"I think the Itsy Bitsy spider is just a fantastic movie.

Full of warm-hearted sketches of peasant life in New York and Boston, Messud takes us on a whirlwind tour of borrowed literary devices. There's not one laugh in the book, either. That would detract from the delicate mood. Messud makes sensuous love to her characters as sweet aromas gently waft across the pages. She is a true artisan of the well-made nothing. This book may not appeal to men or women, but others will rejoice."},{"rating":"1","title":"metonymic overkill","review":"I suppose there is some dramatic action to this novel -- we do have the obligatory scandal and ensuing suicide. And yet the writing feels static, as if it can't move forward. Perhaps that sense is due to the writer's belabored prose. There's an inappropriate metaphor or simile every other sentence. (I can't believe she uses the adjective metonymic twice. Obviously she spent too much time in graduate school.) And also is due to the long and often repeated authorial lectures on the pains of adolescence, exile, and the hopes of Camus and Augustine for a free Algeria. For her, Algeria is a pretext, a prop, which she gets to use without really doing anything. It's all a bit much in this contrived paint-by-the-numbers literary product that appears to have been written primarily to further a career. At this, Messud, judging by her current bestsellerdom, has apparently succeeded brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read.","review":"This is one of the best books I have read.

This book has no narrative pulse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I won't comment on the writer's perfect prose but rather on how she perfectly managed to write about feelings which are so characteristic to French Algerians.Their wistfulness, their exuberant but aloof manners, the sentiment that they had not yet completed their journey from Algeria to France and somehow got lost in between - probably into the depths of their beloved Mediterranean sea. This is a story of a shipwreck and its stranded victims, people who were sent away from Algeria and proved incapable to integrate in the new haven provided by their motherland. In this way, this book is a not only a feat of storytelling but a profound description of a collective malaise. Anyone who - as an individual or a member of a minority - has experienced estrangement could read and learn from the Sagesse's experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight to read!","review":"What a beautifully written, perfectly executed book! I loved how Messud intertwined each generation's family history into the present history of the teen girl narrator, Sagesse. The sins of the father will visit upon the son, indeed....or in this case, the granddaughter. Messud's command of language is impressive and her prose is so lyrical and magical---perhaps a bit too lyrical for a 15-year old Algerian girl---but that is a minor point. The book itself is perfectly paced and exquisite. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it were all in Algeria","review":"Everything outside of the Algerian flashbacks were overwritten and pretentious. I'm deeply disturbed by the praise here; it spells dooms for the future of literature, I'm afraid. I suppose all one has to do is write unnecessarily wordy sentences and throw Camus' name around forty or so times, and a genius is born.I didn't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super story, difficult prose","review":"This is a super story. I was so moved by the characters, especially the narrator and her damaged brother. The scope is massive -- like Faulkner set in the south of France. Very romantic, very atmospheric, but intellectual, too. The problem is sometimes the prose is pretty tough going. But hey, that is a small price to pay for such a book -- it's the same in Faulkner, isn't it?

I have a couple of problems however. It doesn't dissolve great (I use a handheld stirrer that mixes whey/flax etc. in seconds but this stuff won't fully dissolve in water even after 30 secs of mixing); it's certainly more easily dissolved than 'regular' creatine however. The other problem is far worse: the Artic Berry Blast tastes very bad -- extremely sweet and tangy and just unpleasant. I will try another flavor next time because this flavor has led to me consuming the product only on workout days and skipping rest days (the instructions say to take it every day then cycle after a number of weeks). Perhaps a flavorless variety would be a good idea so it can be added to a shake (although the instructions recommend taking it on an empty stomach).Bottom line: works very well, dissolves 'ok', tastes terrible. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid product.","review":"CELLMASS is a good creatine supplement. I recommend the Arctic Berry Blast flavor. After a few weeks of using Cell Mass you are either stronger from it or just stronger from the working out for three more weeks. Either way, it tastes good, and if it gives you that extra 10 or 20% on your reps, then it's probably worth it. After going off of a cycle you don't feel weaker, which begs the question of what it's actually doing, but nevertheless, if you like creatine, this is a good choice. Besides, even placebo does *something*."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientifically proven to NOT WORK","review":"Yes, the taste/texture is good, and it will help with recovery, but if you're looking to gain mass, use a different creatine powder. Beyond the hordes of those who have used Cellmass and swear they gained zero mass, studies have shown that it is an ineffective creatine and does very little for you beyond recovery. After 2 months, I switched to a different creatine and saw mass gain results instantly.

But as the book progressed it became so good I forgave the author of every cliche that he put in the book, mostly about the Kitty/Nathanial thing.Everything from the first two books is cleared up nicely here, leaving no holes, but still enough vaguyness to make you read it twice, which I have done. Several times.I would normally tell you the unbelievable, really perfectly awesome, magnifecent, wraps up the trilogy excellently ending, but then people would get mad at me, mainly because they probably won't agree. I guess the ending is sorta sad...Always remember you're unique, just like everyone else.-This quote came from an email i got."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I won't say to much, because I don't want to spoil anything, but this book is beatiful. Mr. Stroud's amazing description of things just makes me want to weep with joy. The amulet of Samarkand was good, and the next one was a wee bit creepy, but all were blown out of the water by this one!!Bartimaeus is a lovely* character, and it is usually with him I read all the others fast so I can get ot his chapter. By the way, a lot of the other reviews are spoilers, and I would like to remind amazon.com that spoilers are not alowed. Please, nobody spoil any of this, the thing I hate the most is to know the end of the book before I'm finished with the Prolouge.It's great material, and if you are bored, you will be no longer!!LONG LIVE BARTIMAEUS!!*Perhaps I should rephrase that, he is not lovely, but funny and witty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bartimaeus lives up to his promise","review":"The Bartimaeus books are great fun, very funny, and overall a pleasure to read. But: they are much deeper than just light fantasy, with character development, interesting history, and fun mysticism. Worth reading on every level from simple fun, to interesting questions of character, to the nature and connectedness of all things. Overall a wonderful series."},{"rating":"2","title":"At the Gate","review":"In reading this last book in the trilogy, one must keep in mind that it the \\"Bartimaeus\\" Trilogy. So long as that is not forgotten, the outcome of the story would not be hard to accept.There are to many trilogies on the market today and many of these stories don't merit three books to tell. While this particular one could have been shorter, it would not have been so interesting if it had been told through the eyes of more than one protagonist.It is an ideal set of books for middle school readers to read and talk about how the story could have been approached ways other than the original path Shroud took."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpected finale","review":"Another excellent edition - with plenty of our favorite Demon, er, Genie. This one is a bit darker than the first two, but a nice tying together of all the threads. I'll listen again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious Plot Twists","review":"Summoning a djinn is a complicated feat that only magicians dared to attempt... that is, until Kitty JonesThe third book of the Bartimaeus Trilogy, Ptolomy's gate, takes twists and turns as it tells the story of three main characters: Bartimaeus,a forth level djinn with contempt for magicians; John Mandrake, a magician in a high place with a soft spot for his lowly servants; and Kitty Jones a supposedly dead commoner with a not so common ability to do magic.The characters struggle to uncover (and foil) a plot by demons to destroy Great Brittain.An interesting fantasy plot with action,adventure,and a sarcastic djinn makes this book a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start but gets really good near the end","review":"Another outing with Nathaniel but slow to start and overwritten in places. This time he's the the Information Minister, and spends his time making up propaganda pamphlets. Three years have passed since the last book and the characters feel more jaded than ever and you almost feel sorry for the way Nathaniel treats Bartimaeus.He does this by not allowing Bartimaeus to return to the Other Place until his essence is severely weakened. Mandrake is totally absorbed in his work and things aren't going well for the government as the commoners revolt. Kitty is back and through her the reader learns the secret behind Ptolemy and gets a look into Bartimaeus' domain. When a sinister plot unleashes an old evil, Mandrake, Kitty and Bartimaeus team up to defend the human race.The last hundred pages or so is where it gets really good. Otherwise, it kind of moves slowly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book really well read","review":"The three books of Jonathan Stroud are marvellous in themselves but the performance of Simon Jones is simply great. The only audiobook I know that rivals Jim Dale's performance of the Harry Potter series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy sequel","review":"I enjoyed this addition to the Bartimaeus canon - they all read oddly but interestingly -- I particularly enjoy the demon Bartimaeus's commentary, full of humor and footnotes.A fun romp though London in the past/future when magicians are the ruling class."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book!","review":"An avid fan of the Batimaeus Trilogy, I can honestly say that this, the final chapter of the trilogy, was the best. It was suspensful, terrifying and exciting. In this book, Kitty, Nathanial and Bartimaeus have to join together once more to stop catastrophe from being unleashed on the world. Even though they all used to be enemies, the have to learn to help one another. This book is full of fantastical sequences that dazzle the imagination. It is a great read; I could hardly put it down. The only flaw was the tragic ending. It was horribly sad, but necessary for the series to end. If you are a fan of the trilogy, be prepared for a sad ending but a wonderful book. If you haven't yet read the trilogy, what are you waiting for? Read them! I loved this book and if you appreciate great fantasy, you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is awesome. It starts out a little slow but like all of his books, picks up in the middle and then has an explosive ending. If you have read the first two you have to read this. It explains everything. What happens at the end will blow your mind!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's no (or not much) decency in publishing","review":"We need a moratorium on sequels. Publishers are obviously not inclined towards such decency, but perhaps retailers like Amazon could make this happen by refusing to carry sequels. Another misguided hope.The author himself appears tired of his characters, the endless footnoting just seems a gimmick that the author cannot escape from. Everyone sees the light and everything turns out right, of course.The real world and the one where Bartimaeus ordinarily lives are supposed to be symmetric, but making things completely symmetric wouldn't serve the author's cliched purposes, so its only symmetric whenever it suits.Save your money. Borrow it from your public library if you feel you must read the last part."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"This is the last in a wonderful trilogy by Jonathan Stroud.

I got it to try and converse with spanish speaking people. After using this thing for a month I was unable to say much. I went out and even bought the Univeral Translator 2000 that the same company makes. Big mistake for me. all this thing does is translate my money into their pocket, other than that it was not useful at all. It did not work like it is claims to on their box. I could not get this thing to translate 1 simple sentence. I uninstalled it and returned it. After having to fix my copy of Microsoft Word 97 that the language translator messed up on me. It claims to work fine with Word 97, my copy of Word was so messed up I had to uninstall it, and reinstall it twice. I did not find either program helpful to me in learning spainsh, I bought a great dictionary and spanish for idots books and I am learning so much more than with this software. The books are better. Much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memories","review":"This studio album came out in my college years, and it was frequently played at frat parties. 20 years later, it still stands up. The band is in tight form; every song is performed with gusto.Like a previous reviewer I wish they'd played these songs more live because it's the best of their repertoire. IMO, this was their peak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written","review":"This book is a poorly organized collection of information, and reminds me of a mediocre thesis that might have been written by a college student. It doesn't flow chronologically and it is dull, boring, tedious, somewhat repetitive, and mind-numbing. It's best to avoid history books written by university professors who have little or no experience in life outside the classroom.A good contrast, for example, are the biographies of Patton and Eisenhower written by Carlo d'Este, a retired Army Lieutenant Colonel. They are superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only thing better than Yngwie is live Yngwie.","review":"If you like extremly intense, super fast guitar work, this is for you! The Dr.Sin bonus is pretty good, but Yngwie's playing is right on the money. This CD covers a fiarly broad amount of his material, so there is a little something for everyone. One of my favorites is \\"Rising Force\\". This track is especially impressive bescause of all the long arpeggiated runs he does. Another highlight is his true \\"Guitar Solo\\". He incorporates a lot of bits and pieces from his songs and some classical improvisational stuff to really set things on fire. This is a must have! My advice though, is to save yourself a lot of cash and buy the recently released \\"DOUBLE LIVE\\" set. It does not have the Dr.Sin opening act bonus, but all of Yngwies stuff is the same. And to top it all off, the mix is even pretty good. Happy shredding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For serious students and balletomanes only","review":"I have no disagreement with Ms. Lin's thoughtful review, but would add that not only is this important document in black-and-white, but both video and audio are seriously degraded; it can be quite painful to try to watch. You would certainly not want to have this as your only version of Sleeping Beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"the sleeping beauty","review":"In spite of what other people may think, in my oppinion, this is a very good dvd.It is very old,andtechnology wansn't then what it is now.Leaving that apart, where else can you see Margot Fonteyn dancing her most famous role?.Nobody has equal let alone surpass her in that role.Forget the technology and concentrate in the beauty of her dancing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry Camera Work Unacceptable in Costly DVD","review":"My partner and I purchased this DVD because she was curious about Margot Fonteyn's dancing. We understood that this performance had been produced for television and were prepared for modifications for that medium. What we weren't prepared for was the disgracefully blurred camera work that predominates throughout the entire performance. Only a few solo performances seem to be in focus -- the rest of the performance is extremely difficult to watch. The trick photography introduced into the scene where the Lilac Fairy leads the Prince to the sleeping castle is also annoying. We paid over thirty dollars for this DVD, and it is very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, awful, awful","review":"I checked out this DVD from our library to see if there was anything on it I could use for a class I was teaching about bones and the human body. I was anticipating something along the lines of how skeletons worked, joints, what bones were made of, perhaps some close-up images of bone marrow, spongy bone, etc. What I got was a bunch of voodoo history, all sorts of info on superstitions and stories about what cultures present and past do/did with bones. This included a story about a culture that ceremonially drank from skulls and a husband who stuffed his unfaithful wife's bones in a closet. Very morbid and freaky. I don't recommend this DVD to anyone and I certainly wouldn't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally creapy.","review":"This is supposed to be an educational movie on the skeleton. However, it's more of a history of how people throughout time have been scared of the skeleton. It talks about Tarot cards, and is spooky from beginning to end. I'm actually throwing it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed chance","review":"Having read the book first I really looked forward to the movie as a chance to dispel some of the strange ideas we have about Soviet sailors and to shed a little light on a very shadowy place in the worlds militaries.This chance was missed however by skimming over the cause of the events and failing to show the almost superhuman efforts the Rissian captain and crew went through to save the situation. Rutger Hauers performance as a consumate submariner and commanding officer are as close to reality as this movie comes. Surely a missed chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it or leave it","review":"This movie wasn't bad, but it was by no means great. I found it quite difficult to follow the storyline, and the special effects were less than convincing (is it just me, or did they use the exact same shot of the Russian submarine, like, 5 times?) Some of the acting, Sheen and Hauer included, seemed forced.The first 45 minutes of the movie were nearly unbearable, but towards the end, the pace picked up and it became more interesting. I even enjoyed the ending.(Note: If you are buying this movie for the performance of Dominic Monaghan [as I admit I did], don't waste your money on it. He is hardly shown and has ONE line. Just a heads-up)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Serviceable","review":"Little more than a serviceable introduction to the historical proceedings. Wooden acting all round. In fact, Sheen looks like he's sleepwalking (or punchdrunk) through the thing. Still, Hauer does manage to conjure some sympathy as the Russian captain who does his best to save all his men, though, regardless of what he does, he can't win back home with the Soviet officials. Otherwise, there are handful of interesting insights into submarine culture--if what we're seeing is an accurate portrayal.Overall, Hostile Waters the feel of a mediocre (to bad) TV movie (which I'm assuming it isn't), including some particularly unconvincing special effects--to the extent that, though this was made in 1997, I would've guessed '87. It just looks that dated. Only Hauer and Sheen's haggard appearances are any clue that it was made later."},{"rating":"1","title":"A missed chance","review":"Having read the book first I really looked forward to the movie as a chance to dispel some of the strange ideas we have about Soviet sailors and to shed a little light on a very shadowy place in the worlds militaries.This chance was missed however by skimming over the cause of the events and failing to show the almost superhuman efforts the Russian captain and crew went through to save the situation.

The original was fine and this movie has very little to do with the original. An assassin starts training a kid. That's about all they have in common. That's what I don't get, why even bother calling it a remake. Just make a new movie.The original seemed to focus more on the details of the hit while this movie just focused on the death scene for the most part. And god forbid that every movie not end with a happy ending. Sometimes the good guy/main character dies, it keeps things interesting. Which is one of the things that made the original better.It's worth the $1 rent but not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bronson he is not","review":"The special effects were better than the origional, but there were some slow spots.

I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MY FRIENDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"We were looking for a standard Statham action thriller for a Saturday night popcorn movie. Left us a bit dissatisfied. As expected, Statham provided an excellent imitation of a tree - wooden looks, monotonic voice and zero emotion. But, unlike other Statham fare, the action sequences in this one were pretty run-of-the-mill and ho-hum. Maybe he's set the bar high enough that what would have been cool 5 years ago is now boring. No \\"wow\\" scene. The plot was so transparent I can only assume the screenwriters worked for free. Donald Sutherland had a few lines and exited early. No one else could act. There was only one attractive woman in the whole movie - and she was on for 2 scenes.None of this would matter if the action had been jaw-dropping. But it wasn't. So 2 stars. Should have got something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Implausible","review":"By \\"implausible\\" I don't mean the over-the-top action that has become part of these types of movies. What actually made the original work was Jan Michael Vincent's cool and that you could see Bronson, in his usual flat style, wanting to mentor him. I thought Statham's character was the equal to Bronson's, updated for our time, but given how he begins the film, there's no way he would take a guy like Ben Foster's character on. Once that happened, and Sutherland left, all the \\"class\\" went out of the movie and it became the usual shoot 'em up. Since this is a remake of a good movie, I think the comparison is fair and again, the flaw is in the Foster character. I also, like some reviewers here, would have liked to see some training without the jump to the student taking out a room of guys shooting left-handed, scaling buildings, etc. So. Lose yourself in the action but there is no story and Statham is ill-used, Foster mis-cast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cmon man, you can do better","review":"I really like Jason as an actor but he is cranking out \\"C\\" movies like Van Damme did.

As you can see it costs more time to correct the mistakes than to just translate it manually. It can't even be used to understand a foreign text correctly because the syntax and tenses are jumbled seemingly randomly. Very poor program, but at least a brave attempt at a very complex problem.

The characters I spent time with were heartbreakingly real to me -- I knew those women. She captures a time and a place in our culture that is long gone -- hence the title. 1965 was not 1969, not even 1967, in terms of political consciousness. The women in this book came of age before the great social upheaval, as their stories so poignantly underscore. That makes them no less interesting, instead, their world feels like unexplored territory to me. How anyone could read about Charlotte's memories on the riverbank with her brother, digging in the mud, and dismiss her as \\"cardboard\\"? This book is full of great small moments, movingly rendered.

It's a relief to learn I'm not the only one who looked forward to the enlightenment of adulthood only to come to the conclusion it never happens.Character-driven.

Unfortunately, in this case, he's just gone too far with his mythological basis. I'd estimate that more than half of this book consists of nothing but his interpretation of snippets from Navajo mythology stuck smack in the middle of a story. There IS a decent action-packed plot buried in there, but it's just overwhelmed by the mythology. By the end, the whole thing becomes a psychological \\"experience\\" as Zelazny basically drops the plot so the protagonist can confront himself. Even worse, the very last pages leave me unsure about whether or not he succeeds. With a tighter linkage between mythology and plot, this could have been an excellent book.

The concept of chasing water is unique enough but his style of writing is like a personal letter. I could smell the rain before it fell, I felt drenched, could smell the spices, feel crammed in buses, felt scared in the 'plane, was elated at the climax. Alexander Frater conveys images in such an open, frank manner that I believe him. He's like a traveller reporting in letters of experiences, sights and smells.

Unfold the auger and lever, screw it in, and leverage the cork out in two stages. It requires no physical strength at all, I've removed some of the TOUGHEST corks with ease.

I bought two a couple months ago. I specifically ordered cheap corkscrews because I'm a bartender, and frankly I lose them fairly quickly. I also refuse to use anything other than the two-stage (or double-hinged, whatever) types because they work best for me. However, both of mine broke well before I was able to lose them. In one case, the screw was bent to a point that it was unusable. In the other case, the screw came off completely.Yes, they're cheap, but for a reason - they break.

It works great, and the two-step design works much better than a typical waiter's corkscrew. The foil cutter works well, although not the best I've ever used (but good enough). The price on this, being generic, is great, less than some of the name brands. I highly recommend it.

I've put up with it for about a month, but I'm trying to find a new one. The main problem is: the way the second (lower) hinge is shaped means that it digs into the cork as you're trying to pull it out. I have to reposition it 2-3 times each time I'm opening a bottle so that it doesn't gouge out large chunks of cork.If you're just opening an occassional bottle at home, this will be fine.

I don't believe this is an actual Pulltex Pulltap's corkscrew (as indicated in the title). More importantly it is also not a double level corkscrew. I have two double level Pulltap corkscrews (both of which feel significantly more substantial than this one) and both those have Pulltap's engraved on the metal rather than Pulltex (which is what is engraved on this one). Before I even opened the corkscrew I knew it was not genuine (given the cheap packaging). If you are specifically looking for a double lever corkscrew (which this one definitely is not) and the Pulltap's brand name (which I am fairly confident this one is not), then I would suggest you keep looking.

It's more stable, in my opinion, and the quality of this corkscrew is amazing for the price. I'm not a wine connoisseur or claim to be a corkscrew aficionado, but it does what it's made to do-- open wine bottles. It has weight in the palm of my hand, indicating durability and quality and it comes with a little de-foiling switchblade which is a nice touch. I'm sure there are some even nicer, high end models with a larger price tag, but this corkscrew does everything I need it to do and I doubt I'll be replacing any time soon.

It worked on the first two bottles, but took some time to figure out. On the second bottle, the cork was cut in half. The corkscrew on this thing is a little tricky to use, and you are more likely to destroy the cork. Right now, the corkscrew is stuck in the cork of the third bottle.

This corkscrew is not that great. My main complaint with this item is that the screw is actually pretty dull especially once the black coating is put on it. Because of this, the corkscrew mostly mangles the cork and leaves it a mess once you're done opening the bottle. It is nice that the part that catches the lip of the bottle is semi hinged but the indented portion is pretty flimsy at actually catching the lip. My final grievance with this item is the knife on it. The serration is nice but the catches on the knife make it hard to fold out and the fact that the knife is placed at the top just really annoy me. Just a personal preference but it doesn't interfere that much with the functionality of the knife.

Why anyone would want to subject themselves to this after seeing it once is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Only to \\"Schindler's List\\"","review":"Of the wide-release, narrative, political films made in the second half of the 20th century, surely \\"Reds\\" ranks as one of the best. \\"The Manchurian Candidate,\\" \\"All the President's Men,\\" \\"The Candidate,\\" and \\"Sweet Bird of Youth\\" are all interesting mixtures of fact and fiction that actually pale next to Beatty's gutsy work. Even Oliver Stone's work on historical situations and figures, \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Salvador,\\" \\"JFK,\\" and \\"Nixon,\\" seems--as fine as it is--too slick and slightly impersonal compared to the political vigor and sexual dynamics explored in this bio-pic of Jack Reed, Eugene O'Neill and Louise Bryant. The depths of feeling and intelligence in this film, despite your feelings about Communism, can make you glad to be alive. Thank you, Warren Beatty, for giving this story to the world in such a powerful and even-handed way. I can't wait until this movie is available on DVD. Hopefully, Warren will add a commentary track or two w/Jack and Diane, of course."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a great movie","review":"I enjoyed so much seeing this movie again.

And Warren Beatty needed to justify John Reed's (clearly Beatty's alter ego) attachment to it. So he gave Reed something to hate - namely his parents.Communism was as much about hatred as it was about ideology. This movie unintentionally shows that. The movie treats Reed's parents in a gratuitously ugly manner. I guess Beatty thinks that if you mock the people you hate - they somehow deserve it.I'm glad this movie was made, because this imaginary autobiography by Warren Beatty's could have been written by a whole class of people in the baby boom generation. It does not hide the hatred at its core. That's a good thing to have as part of the historical record.If he matures well, Warren Beatty will one day be embarrassed by this movie he made."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIBERAL LOVE FOR ANTI-SEMITIC USSR","review":"Stoopid Hollywood liberals making a three hour love fest to the anti-semitic soviet union!?!Has clips of american old geezers with one foot in the grave gushing about a soviet union they never even visited!Lots of talking in this movie; talk, talk, talk; 3 hours of talking----this movie is all talk and no action.Annie Hall is in this movie---diane keaton is terrible in this post-LOVE AND DEATH movie.Warren Beatty looking more like George Hamilton's twin every day.By 2010, the average Russian in love with american junk food----and Warren Beatty, according to the tabloids, being reactionary by disapproving of his own kid's sex change operation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware 25 years old does not mean it is tame for kids","review":"I purchased this movie as it was labeled an epic film and someone even compared it to the best love story since Gone with the Wind.

It is certainly has a more mature theme than what you would think.The plot is lame and I am sorry I spent the money on it. I plan to get rid of the movie and exchange it as used somewhere where I can get something that is entertaining, this certainly was not.

Due to its (necessary) length and the unwieldy subject matter, there are inevitable flaws; yet the strength of the performances (especially Nicholson's, arguably his finest) make it moving and always interesting.

I enjoyed everything from the clever and sometimes bitter characters to the historically correct events. The on-again-off-again relationship between the two main characters is represented by the movie's theme song \\"I Don't Want to Play in Your Yard.\\" It is definitely the movie of an era not so long ago, and can captivate the hearts and emotions of moviegoers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensible first hand witness testimony to what really happened.","review":"As America edges closer to a split between factions, this movie is a must see. It describes a true story with eloquence using first hand witness accounts of the Russian revolution. We learn what really happened in the early 20th century to cause the revolt. In addition, we can see the interim period of democratic rule under Alexander Kerensky, before the oligarchy led by Lenin came to power. Plus, it is a noteworthy love story. After seeing it I read everything I could find written by the participants. This movie is absolutely faithful to the truth. By intermission you want to go out and find a revolution to join. This is history at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Long Last: in DVD! Cheer and Cry Your Eyes Out","review":"Twenty-five years ago, while in law school, I saw this three-hour-long movie six times. It was worth every ticket and minute. If you like history, politics, writers, romance, adventure, and cycles of idealism, cynicism, disillusionment and hope, this movie is for you. It's a true, panoramic story about the American left (who splinter and implode among themselves)and the Russian Revolution, taking place on two continents. Conservatives living in Red States probably will hate it, unless they are willing to look beyond ideology to more basic, human, tragic themes. In this movie, Reds are the good guys, but the good guys don't win.

Sure, the beats are strong, but where are the freakin' vocals? Time after time, remixers seem to think their mix is the star of the show and not the artist (unless, of course, they're the artist to begin with! :-P). Please, DJs, leave in the vocals. This remix is nothing but a long instrumental. Not totally uninteresting, but not great, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down and Cheated","review":"I ordered this book three weeks prior to needing it and six weeks later still no book.

This book is nowhere near being a beginning accounting textbook. The authors take for granted that the reader understands accounting terms as clear explanations are few and far between or missing completely. Perhaps the authors are far too advanced to be able to explain the basics of their business. The content is very confusing as are the multi-colored, multi-boxed, multi-fonted, multi-faceted, CNN/USA Today-style pages. I would definitely NOT recommend this book to anyone wanting to understand accounting to any degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't wait to re-sell this book","review":"This book is not for beginners!

It serves up excellent examples, has a modern, graphic and splashy style that made it easy to follow along and refer back to key terms, and I liked the tie-ins to business in the general commentary. It's a great text for a self-paced course like an online accounting course offered at Berkeley. I felt like I learned a lot from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A GOOD BOOK FOR INTRO TO FINANCIAL ACCT !","review":"The book's preface indicates \\"We assume the students has had no prior exposure to accounting and financial statements, and has had little exposure to the business world\\".

Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorest text ever written","review":"If your school uses this book, not only don't take this class, drop out of the school. If I could rate this with negative numbers I would. This is the worst textbook ever devised by man OR woman.

However, it is worthwhile to read Uriel Weinreich's 1953 Languages in Contact first, which is not outdated despite its date. Thomason & Kaufman are at times simplistic in their discussion of social factors as the primary determinant of language change outcomes, and the linguistic factors they accept as important in determining the outcome of language-contact should not be taken without a grain of salt. For example, 'universal markedness' is a concept which should be booed at every time it is used.On the whole, however, this book is a clear, insightful and complex discussion of the mechanics of language-contact (incidentally, it is much better than Thomason's later book on the same subject, Language Contact: An Introduction)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is the most important book about language contact and historical linguistics ever.

Giving this product one star is too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Track Selection.","review":"There was a great track selection on this album, using Yardbird covers, Fleetwood Mac covers, BB King covers, and of course Led Zeppelin songs. The music is great. Jimmy Page plays sloppy, but I've heard he has always done that while playing live. None-the-less, he still amazes me on this recording. I could sit down for two hours a day and listen to this album, everyday, and still find something new to amaze me. Even though Chris Robinson (lead singer of the Black Crowes) strains his voice like Plant, he doesn't do a good job of replicating Plant. Is that bad? No. This is Jimmy Page & The Black Crowes, not Jimmy Page & Robert Plant. Everytime I buy a new album with Jimmy Page on it, it turns me on to a new artist or a new type of music. That is one of the many reasons I recommend this CD. Four out of five stars because of the sloppy guitar playing. Everything else couldn't be much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Years Gone?","review":"'Live at the Greek' is a very cool CD and Jimmy Page and the Black Crowes get high marks for going for it! The music is far from perfect, even giving it the benefit of the doubt of being a live recording. But the Crowes multiple guitarists complement Pagey quite well and they pull off some complicated Zep tracks (like \\"Ten Years Gone\\") that Jimmy could never do in concert on his own (even with the triple-neck guitar). Chris Robinson puts in a strong performance on vocals. Robinson's does not have the vocal power of Robert Plant (especially in Zep's hey day), but Robinson has the soul and the balls to sing these tunes. Listening to Jimmy and the Crowes power through \\"Sick Again\\" will certainly put a smile on the face of any true Led Zeppelin fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't go wrong with black crowes or jimmy page","review":"Either black crowes or jimmy page alone would make this album worth buying. Both together - it's a no-brainer. Great reviews of classic Zep and blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Live Album!","review":"I did not think it could be done but Jimmy Page has delivered the best live Zeppelin album to date. The BBC sessions is good but it contains all older material. The Song Remains The Same was good but patchy and Unledded missed the mark. This album brings us right up to date with a selection of later Zepp material. Page and the Crows concentrate on the blues and hard rock side of Zepp and they bring it off superbly. The sound is bone crunching and in your face, the drumming is amazing and the massed guitar sound is just how it should be. Jimmy shows off his brilliant guitar skills and reasserts himself as the premier rock guitarist that he always was. This album is a must-buy for Zepp fans and will do quite nicely until Knebworth or the like is released. You can easily forget that that is not Plant up there handling the vocals- well done Mr. Robinson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than a Led Zeppelin Reunion","review":"Simply put if you are a Zeppelin fan or a Black Crowes fan you must have this double CD! Most of the songs are Led Zeppelin covers with a few great blues songs thrown in. Jimmy Page sounds in perfect form, and this collaboration is about enough to make you forgive that whole Puffy Daddy thing. Chris Robinson adds more to these songs than Robert Plant ever could at this point in his career. The sound quality is great and the set list is fantastic. There are well known favorites like \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" along side less exposed (and thus less tired) songs such as \\"Out on the Tiles\\" and \\"In My Time of Dying\\" My personal favorite is \\"What Is And What Should Never Be.\\" All this and great packaging like an old Filmore concert poster and an enhanced CD. A must have!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best since Zepp!","review":"For those hungering for a Zep reunion (considering Robert Plant has his head someplace else) needs to own this CD. Page with the Crowes are as good as its going to get. Chirs can sing better than Plant can now anyway. The band is tight and Page simply enhances the effort. Even the Foo Fighters with Page & Jones at Wembly couldnt come close to this performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"JIMMY + CROWES = MAGIC","review":"Ever wonder what Led Zeppelin would have sounded like if Jimmy had gotten Steve Marriott of Humble Pie(Pie's manager threatened to break Jimmy's fingers)? In the early days of the Crowes,they were compared to Lynyrd Skynyrd, because of their Southern background. Ludicrous, to be sure. Few noticed Chris Robinson's eerie vocal resemblance to Marriott(who spent his last years in the Crowes' hometown of Atlanta,coincidentally). If you have doubts, listen, for instance, to Pie's classic \\"30 Days in the Hole\\". That being said, this is something of a historic musical \\"what if\\". Jimmy and the Crowes together are a rock'n'roll machine. If you are a Jimmy Page or Crowes fan, you owe it to yourself to own this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jimmy Page should of done this before","review":"Incredible, Jimmy Page is an amazing rock player. after doing just the soft side of zeppelin for years he back doing the songs that have not been played.

This album rocks the blues, crowes stuff and Zep. A must have for zep fans ! Robinson's voice sounds better than it has and the band shows a very good continuity together w/ page. Sound quality is great for this live show !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording spoils great potential","review":"I was so excited for this album to come out, being a longtime fan of the Crowes and Led Zeppelin. Unfortunately, all the good things that could have come out of this performance never materialized. The recording quality is substandard. Chris' fantastic vocals are largely drowned out by the music. There are no strong guitar solos highlighting Page. In short, I am surprised that they have actually published this recording. I would recommend listening to a friend's copy before you buy. Decide whether you can deal with the lousy sound quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Studio music.","review":"Sounds cluttered. It's hard to get the feeling of a live performance accross without distortion. Much of Page's skill was his perfection in the studio. Maybe he could have cleaned this one up but then it wouldn't have been \\"live\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAGE + CROWES=OVERBLOWN","review":"What a blatant attempt for Page to yet again cash in on the Led Zeppelin name. It was bad enough when he did \\"Kashmir\\" rap-style, but this is much worse. As for the Black Crowes, I was never big on them, but my opinions have changed in two ways after hearing this. First of all, they are better musicians than I thought. However, the singer of the Crowes sounds horrible live. I never thought he was much of a vocalist, but I didn't think he was this bad. Most fans will like this simply because it's Jimmy Page and it's Led Zeppelin, but not me. I will stick to the original Zep cd's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my!","review":"I just found this album by a complete fluke. I didn't even know it existed.

Definitely worth the money for both Zeppelin and Crowes fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, Zep sung properly","review":"It's almost as if this HAD to happen at some point: some of the highlights of the Led Zeppelin catalog sung by a real blues vocalist. Although I will always appreciate the density of the original material's production values (and John Bonham's smack-down style), poor Bobby Plant appeared to be cursed with an inability to sing on key for longer than a few bars. That's why it is a BLESSING to have Chris Robinson tackle some of these hot chestnuts; by flexing a REAL set of pipes, he succeeds in putting some cojones back into the material. The band is super-tight and Page is right in the pocket. Outstanding stuff, and crucial for any self-respecting Led Zeppelin fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD","review":"I HAVE ONE WORD FOR THIS CD.GREAT,GREAT,GREAT.I ALMOST DIDN\`T BUY THIS CD BECAUSE I DIDN\`T WANT TO HERE A BUNCH OF REGRINDED ZEPPELIN NUMBERS.BUT AFTER HEARING IN MY TIME OF DYING ON THE RADIO,I WANTED TO BUY THIS.I\`M VERY GLAD I DID.EVERY SONG ON THIS IS GOOD,PLUS MOST OF THESE SONGS YOU COULDN\`T GET LIVE FROM LED ZEPPELIN.THE WAY THEY DID TEN YEARS GONE WAS EXCELLANT.GREAT VERSION OF WOKE UP THIS MORNING.I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT THE BLACK CROWES WOULD DO A GOOD JOB WITH ZEPPELIN SONGS BUT THEY DID.HELPS HAVING JIMMY PAGE IN THE BAND.THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY BLACK CROWES OR LED ZEPPELIN FAN.GREAT CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish","review":"Jimmy Page's brilliant guitar talents can't overcome the completely lame singing and a sluggish rhythm section (not to mention a badly recorded, poorly mixed tech-job).Forget this one and get a real Led Zeppelin CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAS THIS REALLY NECESSARY","review":"No doubt that this will attract negative votes. Attacking sacred cows is never easy. PAGE was always an excellent studio muso who could never produce the same quality work live. This live CD proves his mediocrity yet again. The solo in the BB KING cover is emberrassing and wouldn't win a pub gig audition. The ZEP covers are as good as any other ZEP tribute band, but totally unneccessary as the originals can not be improved upon. If PAGE doesn't need the money, he should keep his legacy intakt by refusing any further live shows and the BLACK CROWS are better off sticking to their 80's stadium rock rip-offs."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Good!","review":"I was at the Greek for the second performance. What a show. It was so good to hear Jimmy's songs live with all the guitar layers that he did on the original albums. I already owned a copy that I created online at MusicMaker.com soon after the show in '99, but this CD's sound mixing is much better. My only disappointment is that several Crowes songs they did -- Horsehead, Remedy, and No Speak No Slave -- were not included. I guess they wanted to focus on Jimmy. And just to say it again, the sound is incredible. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"crowes can do Zep","review":"Jimmy Page got a great backing band to do some Led Zep hits! they nailed it.Black Crowes are amazing and led zep is well one of the greatest bands ever!! 2 of my favs together!

Page gives you the fireworks and a lot of tasteful wah-wah without going overboard, and Chris Robinson handles the vocals without the banshee hysterics. One quibble: No acoutstic numbers like \\"Going to California\\" or \\"Bron Y'Aur.\\" Still, very, very solid and most welcome, considering we don't have a lot of live Zeppelin or Page solo to choose from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Electric Magic","review":"This 2CD set gives of the power of Led Zeppelin in the studio in a live concert setting. The songs really shine thanks to the use of three guitars instead of one. Jimmy Page is my favorite guitar player of all time but he could only do so much with one guitar even if that guitar was a double-neck. The Crowes give their special blend of southern hard rock to Zeppelin's classic songs. Page's playing is quite good as usual with some mistakes but he plays with emotion not technique... Finally for the record, Chris Robinson makes a fine Chris Robinson. He has a distinctive voice of his own and his singing on the album is great compared to the endless shrieking morons who have been clonning Robert Plant the last 30 years... If your a Zeppelin fan or just a fan of good old fasioned guitar rock then it's well worth getting in an age defined by bublegum boy bands and artists who have little of the creativity which made the music on this set so great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just excellent!!!","review":"This is undoubtless Jimmy Page\`s best post- Zeppelin era album. Although Robert Plant insulted the Black Crowes some time ago, he should realice that they are actually a much better company for Jimmy than HE was in the No Quarter album. No weak tracks on this double Cd; Zeppelin covers and Rock and Roll classics (B.B. King, Fleetwood Mac) are equally spectacular. Chris Robinson squeezes the lemon almost like Plant did, Sven Pipien plays a superb bass solo on \\"The Lemon Song\\", Rich Robinson and Audley Freed are an incredible guitar duet, and Steve Gorman (although not as good as Bonham, of course) is a unique drummer. What can I say about Jimmy? The only thing I know is that his time as guitar player hasn\`t come yet. This album deserves 5 stars for it\`s play, sound and production, and is much better than \\"The Song Remains The Same\\". All of this plus an enhanced program featuring live footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad sound quality","review":"The sound quality is really poor.

Why would Jimmy Page tour with the Black Crowes, not long after he tours with PLant? Sounds like a little animostity between Page and Plant. Page did that rap version of Kashmir and his solo album with David \\"Coverplant\\", JImmy has made a second career out of some of the \\"many\\" Zeppitators. It's not a bad cd, but why would you want the immitation instead of the real thing. The canceling of this tour consequently was the end of the Black Crowes. Chris Robinson does a good job , but he certainly proves he is no Robert Plant. One of the highlights was a cover of Fleetmac's \\"oh well\\" (peter green era).I just understand why this was released, other than to upset Robert PLant."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HAPPY WITH AMAZON","review":"WAS NOT THE ITEM ADVERTISED.

I feel my hesitation was justified. \\"Lost Army\\" did not feel like a Hellboy story at all - from the fairly unoriginal and frankly boring lost army in the desert premise to the superfluous lake monster to the weak anticlimatic ending (the mysterious glow is...? ). It was like a simplistic Hardy Boys mystery. But just when you are feeling like you are in PG action horror territory complete with zombie warriors and Krull-like giant spider web scenes, Golden throws in a disturbing and out-of-nowhere attempted rape just to make things more \\"adult\\" (or something). This uneven tone is fairly consistent and although the relationship between Hellboy and his ex-flame is fun to read - the best thing about this book are the illustrations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinky toy","review":"Four little party poppersFor just under five bucksThe packaging looks really greatAlas, the product sucksShove the car onto the tubeThen bash the launcher's topThe car shoots off about a footAnd then comes to a stopAccording to the packagingIt hasn't any wheelsSo when you're filling goody bagsGo find some better dealsI know favors are dinkyAnd this one fits that specBut I just thought I'd fill you inBefore you write that checkAmanda Richards, February 27, 2007"},{"rating":"2","title":"God is Faithful","review":"I first heard this song at the Bring Back the Joy conference...No song has ever touched me like this one!

And as I ploughed through it I kept asking...when will I learn that the only people these books help are the authors not to mention their pocketbooks? I have always admired Joan Borysenko for her work with the mind/body connection and have read several of her books over the years. Because of my present state of mind, this one looked promising...but I guess I've come farther than I thought because all it did was prove to me that the only way to find your own path is to find it. Voluminous words, (no matter how intelligent and well intentioned the author,) preached on a page cannot lead you to your path to whatever...God included. This book like too many others is nothing more than the author's expiation.....how she found her way, about her experiences and epiphanies. It made me realize how tired I am of reading about other people's journeys....No more self help books ....I'm cured."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find your faith first","review":"In previous books, Ms Borysenko has expressed her insight on how to help women with body/mind healing. Her books were timely and helpful to many people. In this latest book she attempts to speak to the spirituality of her Christian women friends, encouraging them to find spirituality in purely \\"female\\" everyday moments. While she does offer some information and history on God and spirituality, I am now more inclined to go back and read the bible and the writings of Mahatma Gandhi to support my own faith and spirituality.

Most of the styles are dated as there are a lot of shags and bobs from the 90's.

We've had ours for five or six years, use it at least daily, and have been quite satisified with its performance. It generally toasts the bread evenly, and is consistent from batch to batch and from one day to the next. It doesn't seem that slow to me, but my expectations may differ from yours. I agree the 2/4 slice switch is confusing, but we just leave it on the four-slice setting. I also agree it is a bit pricey, but most of our previous toasters only lasted a couple of years and did not perform as consistently. Perhaps Cuisinart has a quality control problem, but we wouldn't hesitate to buy another one. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous! & more dependable than most","review":"I've had this CPT-90 for nearly 2 years. I love it's widened \\"Brave Little Toaster\\" appearance. This appliance does take getting use to though. For one, I have never toasted anything above setting 4...it will burn. The dryer the bread, the lighter the setting level you need to go. For a basic white or wheat bread, I set it at level 3 & my toast is perfectly toasted...inside & out! I love it!...it taste like I'm eating my toast at a restaraunt! I love dark rye & use the setting at 2.I also enjoy the reheat setting (button)...this is great for when you get sidetracked & you still want hot toast. The defrost button is handy too, for when you have frozen bread.For those with very young ones...a word of caution: the outside chrome does get HOT & it can cause a burn on little hands or fingers...or curious doggies noses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We have been disappointed with this toaster. It does not toast even and usually burns one part of the bread, while the other part is barely toasted. I called the company about it thinking it may be just this toaster but they offered no help. I got the feeling of \\"Oh well, too bad\\". Also, the numbers to choose how many slices to toast are VERY hard to read as they are just imprinted into the metal with no color difference. We have been using it unhappily for a year and I am thinking of buying a new one already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great--poor quality","review":"Loved the fact that this toaster takes long slices and chrome styling--too few around. Knob came off after a couple of months and the mechanism no longer works to keep the bread down after less than a year.

Still looking for a 4-slice, long slot, chrome toaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looking . . . Poor Working . . .","review":"There are numerous problems with this toaster. The toast is always uneven -- generally 1/2 or 3/4 of one side of the bread slice. The lever broke after 3 months of use. The defrost light turns on without pressing the button and stays on randomly for days at a time regardless of the reset button. The crumb tray does not catch all of the crumbs. The toaster sparks both when the toast goes down and when it pops up. I am going to throw it away.

More often than not, the toast came out unevenly toasted--with a good half or more at times not toasted whatsoever--even though the proper switch was set for the number of slices. Most recently, the toaster has become totally worthless, when, even set at the lowest setting of 1, it consistently burns toast to a crisp! Nice fire hazard with smoking and all if one doesnt watch the thing religiously. Pretty scary!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mechanics are faulty","review":"We have had this toaster for approximately 3 yrs. It has had mimimal use as wevacation away from home in the winter ( 4 months at least). There are just twopeople using this toaster and on an average only use it twice a week. The toaster isa part time toaster, sometimes it will toast both sides sometimes not. It hasnow become a total pain as the mechanism to hold the bread down has stoppedworking. I thought that a Cuisinart would last for ever. I owned a very cheaptoaster for over 35 years, gave it to my sons to use in college. That toaster stillfunctions properly but is small and a 2 slicer.

I received it as a wedding gift three years ago and only keep it because I have felt too guilty to buy a new one. The reason I gave it two stars is that it looks pretty good, has space for four slices, and hasn't broken down on me. But... since the day I unwrapped it, it has toasted slowly and unevenly. My husband finally said, \\"when will you stop complaining and just buy a new one?\\" So here I am.

The major complaint concerning this DVD concerns the camera work. For the first four or five songs of the Denmark show, the director must have been tripping. When Blackmore launches into a solo, the camera lingers on Gillan, then catches a bit of Glover, then back to Gillan, etc. Later on there is great footage of Blackmore and Lord soloing, and the camera work during Ian Paice's drum solo is superb - as is the solo itself.

I wanted to see it to compare with the 1978 version with Helen Mirren (just about impossible to find - try Ambrose Video and sit down for the price). The setting is forcefully lush, but feels plastic. My general view is that Shakespeare needs to be \\"slowed down\\", performance-wise and most old movies (40-50 years) seem rushed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-fashioned, but fun","review":"This version of \\"As You Like It\\" has not aged well. The modern approach to Shakespeare, with more natural dialog and realistic costuming, has left the tight-wearing overly theatrical players of old looking a bit foolish. They strut around the stage with obvious gusto and verve, but they just never connect.With that in mind, \\"As You Like It\\" can be fun. The play itself is a bit silly, and the actors even sillier. The director made no attempt to disguise the feminine status of Elizabeth Bergener. She remains a pretty girl in boys clothes with a screeching soprano voice. To his credit, Olivier plays it as straight as an oak, and never for a minute doubts her ill-conceived charade. Jacques is in full motley, making his presence in Arden forest even more absurd.Lacking any other version on DVD, \\"As You Like It\\" contains a certain charm. Just be prepared. Your \\"willful suspension of disbelief\\" has never been so sorely tested."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD IMAGE RELEASE!!!!!","review":"The Image release is the only one worth getting.

His mastery of language and plot is always (so far) a joy. When I bought this, I had just seen my son as Amiens, Lord Attending Exiled Duke, and the character of Rosalind played by a very pretty, perky and sassy young actress. After that performance, this DVD version was painful to watch and I never got through it. Sir Laurence is good, if not entirely believable as Orlando, but the film appears to be cast as a vehicle for Elisabeth Bergner though for the life of me I can't imagine why. Born in the Ukraine, and having first appeared in the Berlin silent film \\"Der Evangelimann\\" in 1923, Elisabeth Bergner acts like a silent actress, and \\"As You Like It\\" appears to be her first English-speaking role. Still, as Shakespeare goes, this is a funny and thoroughly enjoyable story with several clever twists. It's a Shakespeare play that cries out for Kenneth Branagh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fairly Good Study Guide even for the new test!","review":"This study guide provides the basics it takes to pass the test.

While utterly relaxing, it doesn't invoke the stuporous/semi-amorphous state that some easy-listen recordings can, but instead rather remarkably invigorates while calming as well. I live on a river; this music generates a sense of flow that I get while watching a current. There's an upbeat quality of clarity & buoyancy to the music which tells you relax it's ok things are going to be well. Very natural.

W. Lund, have combined to make up a book that is both textbook and work of art- an unusual combination to say the least! The photos are clear and detailed. It is hard to find any major fault with this book because it is essentially unique. I have seen nothing quite like it on fresh water microscopic organisms.The price ... and the difficulty of getting it in the United States probably precludes it from being generally read, but to the professional or amateur fresh water biologist this book is a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great location...awful plot","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer who thought this show was not worth watching - I could hardly make it to the tedious end. It is theatre of the absurd at its worst. Yes, the scenery is breathtaking, the locations are wonderful [I know the area well] but the story line is so badly written, the dialogue so mundane, the plot so absolutely ridiculous that I wondered what was wrong with these people that they were behaving as mindless idiots. Yes, the 'idiot factor' is indeed strong here - it might make the story progress but it renders it all just plain daft. It lacks credibility.There must have been some desire to present the west of Ireland in some 'reality' light but it fails at this because the writer decided to just throw prostitution, drugs, corruption all against the wall and see how it looked. It looked awful - the characters and the story line don't make sense but I don't want to render a spoiler here. I could only give it one star - and that's for the location."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rip-off","review":"Acorn was deceptive in issuing and packaging this DVD. It's a repitition one first season episodes I've seen. It was deceptively advertised by (1) calling it Set 2 (2) there were no episode numbers or titles (3) the description of the episode content picked one of several story lines and carefully selected it so it was so incomplete as to be misleading. Apparently this is a hit for them and until they develop new episodes they will repackage the old in this fashion. Shame on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP Henrietta","review":"RIP poor Henrietta.

The interesting parts were fun to do, but the green solid part was pretty aggravating (my husband called it a \\"unique challenge\\") -- often there would be up to half a dozen similar pieces that could fit in one spot, but only one of them would allow the neighboring pieces to fit together properly. I kept putting them together in a way that looked right but wasn't. (I think he probably did too, although I couldn't ever be sure --it's hard to tell which little green piece was the one I put in.) There were no missing pieces -- we would have been devastated if there had been after all that work! The painting is quite beautiful, with fine detail that was rewarding to put together.

I remember my classmates and I being spellbound by this story. Every child can identify with being lost and afraid even if they've never been in as dangerous a situation as being alone on a mountain top.I also learned some valuable survival lessons even at that young age. Last year I was hiking with some friends. They wanted to take a shortcut through the woods, but I insisted on staying on the trail. A lesson I learned from this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, and not just for kids","review":"It's a little misleading to have this billed as for \\"Ages 9 to 12\\": it's worth reading by people of any age. I'd heard the book recommended by several people that I'd hiked with in Maine, and it lived up to the recommendations, and more so. A simple story, but surprisingly moving. Read it if you plan to climb Katahdin (or climb anywhere above treeline, in the Whites, for example): beware, this could happen to you! My only reservation, at the risk of sounding like an grump, is that the writing style leaves a bit to be desired: I thought I'd scream if the author used the word \\"fellow\\" once more!

It even refers people to the Attachment Center at Evergreen (renamed Institute for Attachment and Child Development after the death of Candace Newmaker at the hands of their previous clinical supervisor). This bogus practice has been responsible for numerous criminal child abuse and death cases, many involving Russian adoptees.The author either approves of this practice or he hasn't done his homework. Either way, that should be a BIG RED FLAG to readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps the Best Foreign Adoption Guide Ever Written","review":"This book is extremely comprehensive and should be read early in the process. Through no fault of the author's, some material is out of date because the Russian Laws have changed since the book was written (i.e. two trips are now required). Outside of that, my wife and I found the book to be the best resource we could have possibly found. It contains helpful information and lists of questions to ask medical professionals, children's home directors, and adoption agency guides. The best thing about the book is that the material is broken down into simple sections and is presented in an easy to understand manner. I don't have enough room to write all the good things about this book, but it should be required reading for anyone considering adopting from Russia or other countries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more complete perspective on EVERYTHING involved Russian a","review":"My husband and I are begining our adoption journey and have just signed with an agency. I found that this book contained much more practical, usable information than I have read elsewhere. They even tell you how to fill out all of the forms, when to call the INS, and what types of payments different government agencies will accept in different states. It also includes reviews of hotels in Moscow and how they are toward adoptive parents. This book has prepared me for much more than I expected. A 5 star must read if you are adopting or plan to adopt from Russia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nuts and bolts","review":"Covers every aspect of Russian adoption, from INS forms to selecting an agency to travel in Russia.

Includes discussions on travel, hotels, and paperwork overall. Also has a section on regions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview","review":"This book provides the best overview I have seen of all aspects of the adoption process with particulars that are relevant just to adopting from Russia. Having said that, it must also be acknowledged that it is difficult to be all things to all people. The book is often too general about some topics that could, in themselves, constitute an entire book. This is not really a criticism though; this is an excellent resource that can be supplemented with other titles as needed. Except for one irritating feature--a large number of typographical and formatting errors which diminishe the credibility of the author--the book is well worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nick Carter battles a madman and his underwater empire","review":"Rip-snortin' Nick Carter adventure as he does battle with a madman and his army of killers and 'clones'. Plenty of saucy babes drapped all over Carter, lots of modern gadgets and narrow escapes as Carter gives his best to save mankind from atomic blackmail. Blend in this novel, add touchs of 'Thunderball' and its clone 'The Spy Who Loved Me' and add some wild thrashings and you have this novel. Once again, the authors goof on firearms when they have a Navy F15 firing 50mm rounds? No such caliber. And again, the 9mm Luger is considered a man-stopping cartridge by said authors. Carter should have been packing a 9mm Browning at that time, 14 rounds vs the Luger's 9 rounds.Go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"This book is a must have for any person who is really serious about their faith in Christ and is curious about his teachings and to have a deeper understanding of the bible"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Introduction","review":"This is a great place to begin for the seeker who wishes to learn about the path of Gnosticism. The problem is that Gnosticism is largely an umbrella term for a wide body of sometimes conflicting beliefs and traditions, which pre-date even Christianity. Much of the books available, while scholarly, are often long-winded and confusing. Perhaps this is due to the nature of the Gnostic path itself, being heavily based on myth and symbol, unique to each individual. Dr. Stephan A. Hoeller, whose contributions to the 20th century Gnostic revival are immeasurable, has done a fine job of assembling some of the basic tenets, influences, and history of Gnosticism, in this introductory book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I do not believe i have read a book written in a worse manner. Firstly, there are constant references to Jung and depth psychology, as if either had any importance to the history of gnosticism, and this detracts very much from the readability of the book. Secondly, the author makes almost as many references to ideas shared between gnosticism and \\"esoteric\\" spirituality without expounding on them, leaving the reader confused about some of the more troublesome beliefs of gnosticism. thirdly, the writing is almost intolerably lax (a chapter subtitled \\"will the real gnostic please stand up?\\" comes to mind), and the author seems to make assumptions about the level of familiarity of the reader with gnosticism. fourthly, and perhaps most importantly, it feels as though there is very little information about historical gnosticism.for another review that i felt was honest, though a bit harsh, see the other one star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"This book was painful to read, full of psychological and metaphysical mumbo jumbo.

My three boys did not enjoy it at all. This book does not flow. Sometimes it seems to try to copy the style of Dr. Seuss without success and at other times it seems to be trying to go in its own direction.

The level it was written for seemed to be for very young adults, and things were over explained. The dialogue was unrealistic and way to 'wordy' , and the bride wasn't even introduced until well into the book, after a rather pointless, and seemingly never ending part about the man's life as a young boy. I understand the concept of introducing Christ as a main theme...but it was done in an annoying way, a way that would in my opinion, push people away, as to bringing them to Him.

These early songs whisper fleet reflections of a lost era that became or already was the psychedelic revolution - a glimpse into the 4th dimension @.@To hear them being performed 'live in the studio' is a real treat, and they are fine performances even if that pompous announcer has to step in after every song. Even for those of us who weren't around for the Summer of Love, these songs reflect the essence of what brought that era into being... LSD?

I was @ the concert, and in fact assisted David Bowie and his son Duncan (Zowie) with the filming and let me say it is a truly wonderful composition!

But when we took them to the woods to use them, we were constantly asking each other to repeat what was last said. Compared to all other FRS and GMRS radios of various brands I have tried, these have got to have the poorest sound quality of all. It's like listening through a wall. The problem is at the transmitting radio. It is not a defect, because we purchased a set in each of two different States with the same results. Another negative is that they call themselves when you want to call another radio. Why? I already know where I am. And the originating radio's call tone level cannot be adjusted with the volume control. So if you are looking for the other radio, you cannot possibly find it. The radio also tips over backwards when you set in on a table.

Furthermore, this book was poorly edited with grammar and punctuation errors.If you're simply travelling for business, a good guide book will provide much of the same information. If you're trying to open a business or office, then you will likely need a more in-depth introduction than this book provides. In addition, the authors add several personal ancedotes, which I didn't find to be particularly insightful or instructive.The bottom line is browse through this book in a bookstore first.

Unfortunately, I was not as lucky fortunate. The first unit had a defective on/off switch, and would not turn on. We exchanged it for another unit. This one turned on, but the parts wouldn't seat properly. I thought I had solved the problem, but later discovered that the freezer bowl was canted and rubbing against the interior of the clear plastic cover, scattering plastic shavings everywhere.

I will be looking for an ice cream maker from some other company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Maker","review":"This thing took forever to make anything; if you want to make something in a moments notice you must keep the rotating bowl in the freezer at all times.

I leave the freezer bowl in the freezer all the time and pay outrageous electical bills just to make sure the freezer really is at 0 degrees.

Any liquid sound and you're going to get a liguid product. I made the mistake of trying the first time using an elaborate frozen yogurt recipe where you drain the yogurt, etc. Way too much trouble. The recipes in the book are simpler. Also, my first ice cream I used all half and half for the cream and milk. It was not as creamy as commercial ice cream but certainly lower fat.My machine also came with a second bowl, which is essential I think.

Bravo Cuisinart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours. I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours. At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture. Obviously it was not frozen enough. At 12 hours, I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen. This may not be an issue for everyone, but with our freezer and our bowl it takes a good 20 to 24 hours of the bowl being in the freezer to get the icecream just right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for 2-4 people","review":"This machine will make ice cream (soft serve style) out of just about anything, and everything: frozen strawberries thrown in a blender with milk, fat free half and half with rose water, milk and chocolate syrup, etc, etc. You could get fancy and cook up a batch of custard style with cream and egg yolks...if you can afford the calories; but the low cal stuff tastes pretty darn good.

I remember as a child taking turns with my brother hand-cranking an ice cream maker using salt,ice and about an hour or so worth of time. Our dad was the supervisor. Our reward for sore arms was some awesome ice cream. Well now 35 years later, my family gets great ice cream in less time and without the pain. It works well IF the bowl is completely frozen. The owners manual reccomends setting your freezer at 0*F and allowing at 6-22 hours for the bowl to freeze. I have found that 10-12 hours works fine with our freezer. I got carried away and made a second batch too soon after the first and the ice cream was a little soft. I just placed it in the freezer for a spell and no harm was done. The unit is fairly quiet. It is a great little ice cream maker. Homemade ice cream tastes so much better than store bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"milk-based products OK, but doesn't work for sorbet","review":"I bought this from a local retailer since it was the only one in stock, and was so disappointed I returned it. It made sherbet (milk-based) with no problem at all, but I've really been craving sorbet, and the freezer bucket simply wasn't cold enough to do the job--it chilled my mix, but didn't even turn it to slush before it had warmed... at which point I had no choice but to put the bucket back in the freezer for another 9 hours, only to repeat the cycle several times before giving up."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I ordered this ice cream maker about a week ago and got it yesterday. I immediately put the bowl in the freezer - I'm not a patient person. Then this afternoon I made the simplest recipe from the manuals that comes with the ice cream maker (the Ben & Jerry's cookbook I ordered hasn't arrived yet). It was for cookies n'cream (vanilla ice cream with crumbled oreos added during the last 5 minutes. It worked out quite well. The ice cream was soft when finished, of course, but hardened up after a few hours in the freezer. It tastes & has the exact same texture of Dreyer's cookies n'cream ice cream. All the Ben & Jerry ice creams seem to ask for eggs, and I imagine that's where they get their denser consistency. All in all, I was quite pleased.I think that they key is having a very cold freezer. Mine is at the coldest it goes and I imagine that's why I didn't need to freeze the bowl for a whole 24 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!! Do not waste your money!!","review":"I bought this because my mother owns an automatic ice cream maker (KRUPS). Hers works wonderfully. This one however, SUCKS!!!! It makes the ice cream fine and all, but it makes this 1/2 inch wall of rock hard ice around the outer edge of the bowl. I even called the manufacturer and the lady I talked to said that this was normal and that hers did it also. Well, my mother's doesn't do this. Also, after putting it in the freezer, it is so HARD that you have to let it sit out for 30 minutes before you can even think about putting a spoon in it (and I like my ice cream hard). Do not waste your money or time on this. Unfortunately, I had to leave one star for this since there was no option for ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of garbage","review":"A surprise from Cuisinart.

It ranked top three in Cook's Illustrated recommendations and highest for ice cream that would be stored for a few days, which tipped us this way (Krups ranked highest for immediately served ice cream). Stored up to a week, the ice cream tastes great, after a week, you can detect hints of iciness with some flavors, but it's still very good ice cream for a couple weeks. It is a little loud as others mention, but not a problem if you can isolate to a different room during a party. For social occassions, you might consider two inserts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what an ice cream-lover wants","review":"No ifs, ands, or buts: this one's a winner. As long as you've got the bowl in the freezer, you can pretty much whip up ice cream in about a half-hour. The ice cream won't quite freeze up as rock-solid as what you buy in the store, but it tastes wonderful nonetheless. (And for whatever reason it's tastier than the ice cream I used to make with my hand-turned Donvier machine-- somehow the motor just plain does a better job.)A tip: pick up the book \\"Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream, Sorbetti & Granite\\" (type 1580081975 into the Kitchen search box.)

So far she's made strawberry and moose tracks; and we've only had it for 3 days. Tomorrow she's planning on making peppermint. All this with her bedtime protein shake! The machine is great. The trick is to start it, pour your liquid in slowly so it doesn't splash. She also puts a piece of aluminum foil on top of the opening to keep the cold in. Our ice cream is done in 20 minutes! Some of the reviews here say it is loud but we don't find it loud at all. Also some of the reviews say that the bowl doesn't freeze well.

After reading all the reviews, I decided to go with this one and am very happy with my decision. It is relatively quiet, convienent, easy, and well worth the money. The only problem is that there is no cover to go with the freezer bowl. I didnt realize this at the time and so I bought an additional freezer bowl, so I would always have an extra in the freezer ready to go. Because there is no lid, you cannot store the ice cream in the freezer bowl, which is inconvienent, and also eliminates the need for an additional bowl (unless you are making more than one flavor at a time, or need a large quantity of ice cream). It is a great product, but know that you will have to store the ice cream in another container, such as a tupperware."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke 1st time used","review":"the plastic unit that is used to spin the ice cream broke the first time I used it tring to reach someone for a replacment is impossible and I now have a great paper weight.Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product!","review":"This product is excellent!!

It certainly wasn't what I thought I would get. The paddle doesn't scrape the sides during the freezing process and it ends up leaving more than an entire serving frozen to the sides while the rest of the ice cream rotates in the center and never quite gets to the frozen consistency. Once the majority of the contents gets frozen it has a hard time churning and the stuff stuck to the sides gets colder while the center portion doesn't. What a waste!!! And dont even try and pry the stuff off the sides, it wont come off until it thaws or you rinse it down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I've never made ice cream before so I really don't have anything to compare this machine to, but, nonetheless, I think it's a great product.

However, mine is going to the landfill, where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like cold soup, this unit is for you.","review":"We just bought one of these things. Actually got one with two bowls. Both bowls went into the deep freeze. After 7 hours we tried using the first bowl. It was frozen solid. We made the simple vanilla recipe in the book. All we got was vanilla flavored cold soup after 30 minutes. We put the liquid into the freezer in an ice cream container. Ended up with a rather large vanilla ice cube. The second bowl stayed in over 24 hours and we tried the vanilla recipe again. Same results after 30 minutes.What a waste of money. It's going back and I'm getting down my old Rival ice and salt style ice cream maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, small and never cold enough","review":"This is the worst Cuisinart product ever. So loud that I cannot hear anything in the same room. What comes out is a cold mushy mess- not a solid ice cream or even a softer sorbet. Even the mushy mess takes at least double the time suggested. It says 1.5 quarts, but if you put 1 quart in, it overflows over the sides. I keep the cold bowl in my deep freeze at all times, so I know that it is frozen enough, but it still does not work. We have tried to use it multiple times, for both ice cream and sorbet, and it is always a bummer. You are better off sticking a smoothy in the freezer than trying to use this machine. Very disappointed with this product. Throwing it away, and buying something else.

I left it in the freezer overnight with a bag of ice in the pot. I also chilled the ice-cream mixture before putting it in the machine. It did a great job of churning the ice cream, however, I did not think it was firm enough to be eaten right away. I left it in the freezer overnight and the next day we had great, tasty ice cream.

I think if you want really good ice cream you need to invest in machine with a built in compressor-freezer."},{"rating":"1","title":"lesson learned","review":"The lesson learned from this purchase, is to open the box immediately, and give the equipment a try. Unfortunately, this ice cream maker did not get a trial run until well after it was bought. We got exactly one batch of ice cream, and that batch was finished not by the machine, but by stirring the last bit by hand. Don't know if I got the one lemon in the bunch, or if the machine is bad, but this was a bust as far as purchases go."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this thing!","review":"This is a great little machine. Without the hassle of using ice or salt, you're always ready to whip up some homemade ice cream! I've made variations of vanilla, eggnog, lemon, cinnamon, dulce de leche, and others in this. This machine makes ice-cream making SO much fun. I highly recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"It seems that the stars need to line up correctly to get this ice cream maker to function properly. When it does work, it is great. But getting the freezer bowl to freeze is not always easy. If your freezer is too full, too empty, too old, etc, you may have some difficulty.When I bought this, I planned to just leave my freezer bowl in the freezer all the time so I could make ice cream whenever I wanted it. But about half the time, my freezer bowl was not completely frozen. I would have to move it somewhere else in the freezer and wait another day and if I was lucky, it would be frozen. Maybe it was just my freezer causing the problem, but it was a pain.If it is too warm outside and your freezer bowl defrosts too quickly, you don't get ice cream, just slightly frozen mush. I reccommend going with the regular ice and rock salt machines. If you need to add more ice, you can. You aren't stuck with a freezer bowl that might not be frozen enough or defrosts to quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Around the Bowl","review":"I really wanted to love this ice cream maker. I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet. I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl. However, all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it. The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim, it was a substantial amount. Sadly, this has spent more time hidden in the depths of my cabinets than being used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisanart ice crema maker","review":"this was a huge hit my family! We ended up using this throughout the weeks and I can't say how happy I am with this purchase! The only downside to this is that the icecream seems to always come out very soft no matter what I do. Another thing is that it isn't as quiet as I had hoped but its certainly tolerable. In my Opinion, every household should have one of these in their kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"glad we purchased this","review":"we have been toying with the idea of replacing our old wooden ice cream maker for some time...wanted to get into this slowly..without spending too much money. We made the perfect choice..this ice cream maker is perfect for our family of four! it is a little noisy, that doesn't bother us but might bother some people...our 12-year old has taken over the ice cream making role and has no trouble using this product. I would recommend purchasing a second freezer barrel...the insert has to freeze completely between uses ...and sometimes we want to make two kinds of ice cream at one sitting...this product is perfect for anyone just getting into ice cream making...I would give it as a wedding gift...we love it...glad we bought it...I do recommend removing the ice cream immediately to a freezer useable container in order to keep from scratching the inside of the insert as you serve the ice cream..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not Freeze Properly","review":"I received my ice cream maker about a week ago. No matter how long the bowl is put in the freezer (over 24 hours)(There is no problem with the freezer, as it freezes ice, meat, etc. just fine), it does not get cold enough to make ice cream thick enough. Even when the ingredients are put in the freezer to begin freezing before putting in the ice cream bowl, it does not get solid enough, but stays very soupy with just a few ice crystals throughout. Would not buy it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...","review":"I tried many times to make ice cream with this thing, and every time it just wouldn't freeze enough. I would try keeping it going, hoping it would freeze, and it never worked. I would then put it in the freezer to continue the freeze, and it always, ALWAYS resulted in ice crystals (which led to grainy, non-smooth ice cream). I was so excited when I bought this, bought all sorts of cream and mix-ins, and the Ben & Jerry's recipe book. The ice cream was the complete opposite of the smooth ice cream Ben & Jerry's makes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little machine... Get a good recipe","review":"I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far. 3 were from the manual that came with the machine, and one was from the internet. All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture. The ice cream was not creamy and melty, it was either icy or fudgy. I like the machine, it is easy to use, but also quite loud. We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned. I think the recipes in the manual could use some improvement so that people don't blame the machine for the ice cream not coming out very well. The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream, but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this ice cream machine!","review":"I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts. It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean. The only thing you have to remember is to keep the freezer inserts in the freezer and that the ice cream will be soft when finished churning. I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours. I wasn't all that happy with the recipes I found in the booklet (didn't want to use heavy cream or cook the base) but there are skazillions of recipes on line and after some trial and error I made up my own. I saw some people complained of the noise, but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes. Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested. [...] I am very happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Idea!","review":"I saw the use of a similar (bigger more costly) machine on an episode of Martha Stewart.

I plan on giving 3 more of these are wedding, birthday and Christmas gifts in the next few months.We keep the bowl in the freezer and chill the mixture before we put in the machine. We have made some incredible strawberry sorbet several times. Easy to use, clean and is not very loud at all.Anyone who hates fooling with ice and rock salt will love this ice cream maker!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing but good","review":"I was a little hesitant because some reviewers talked about the freezing tub being fragile or the sorbet being too soft or it being too slow. I strongly disagree. I have used this beauty for dessert 4 or 5 nights a week since getting it over a month ago. I mix up the ingredients and put them in the refrigerator to thoroughly cool, then put the freezer together and pour it in. 10 to 20 minutes later, it's ready (depends on exact mix). If you think it's too soft, you're not used to home-made ice cream! The outside of the freezer tub is not metal, but I don't think it could be with the material inside it which has to expand. Obviously you have to be aware of that. The interior of the tub is stronger and I use my plastic ice cream scooper and hard plastic spatula to get every drop of the goodies every time. This is a champ. We've probably made enough homemade goodies already to pay for it if you think about how much we would have paid for that much ice cream or frozen dessert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh ICE-Cream in 30 Min. or Less!","review":"I received the Cuisinart machine as a gift about a month ago. I love to cook, I immediately pulled out a raspberry sorbet recipe, made the fruit base, waited 24 hours for the Cuisinart bowl to freeze and whipped up the BEST Smooth Creamy Homemade Sorbet. Since then, I have made several other recipes. Other reviews here have talked about the freezer bowl lasting only about 30 min. I suggest placing a kitchen hand towel over the top opening for that last 15 minutes. This will keep the bowl and the mixture cooler and your Ice Cream, Yogurt and Sorbet will be much firmer.A few tips:(1.) Chill your ingredients in an ice bath for 30 min. or keep in the refrigerator overnight.(2.) When ready to start, get your chilled ingredients right into the bowl and flip the switch.I do wish the Cuisinart had an auto-off timer. It's a great buy, more powerful than others in the price range and its very easy to clean. I love this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the return policy and keep your receipt","review":"I bought this unit based on the positive reviews on this site. I don't question the experience of those who gave it a positive review. Unfortunately, I was not as fortunate.The first unit had a defective on/off switch, and would not turn on. We exchanged it for another unit. This one turned on, but the parts wouldn't seat properly. I thought I had solved the problem, but later discovered that the freezer bowl was canted and rubbing against the interior of the clear plastic cover, scattering plastic shavings everywhere. I had to discard the ice cream (since I wasn't sure how far the plastic shavings had dispersed) and return the second unit. I will be looking for an ice cream maker from some other company.If you want to try this machine, go ahead and take your chances. Maybe your luck will be better than mine. I suggest buying from a local vendor with a liberal return policy. And, by all means, make sure you keep the receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy!","review":"The biggest problem is the noise. And the hassle. There's pre-prep required, then noise for 30- minutes (so you can't make it while you're in the kitchen), then freezing again for a couple hours....

My wife and I received this as a wedding present this past summer and we were very excited. But, when we tried to make the ice cream, we could never get it to solidify. We would freeze the base and then chill the \\"batter\\" and let it spin for an hour and still no ice cream. Other problems were finding enough room in the freezer for this thing to sit in, and, if you wanted to make more than once the recipe, you would have to wait hours for the base to refreeze. Anyway, after trying a number of times, we just returned it to the place it was purchased. We took the money, and spent half of it on a cheep version from Wal-Mart which works great and uses ice cubes to freeze the ice cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't EVER fudge a recipe or it may overflow and seize up next time you use it","review":"Surely I am not the only messy ice cream chef. I tossed in a few extra berries and as the mix froze, it slopped over the bowl a bit. It must have leaked into and gummed up the motor because now it won't turn at all even though there is power. What a stupid design. I for sure would not have been able to let my kids use this, as the same thing would have happened, and what fun is making ice cream if the kids can't help?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I had soft serve ice cream in about 25 min's after following the easy instructions.

Also, you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine. My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been. Other than that, its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream. If you really like ice cream or have a large family, you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl. The ice cream will go fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was I thinking?","review":"Who actually buys an ice cream maker?I used this once since I purchased it, with the results mediocre at best, and haven't used it since.

The only reason I didn't give it five stars was that it is noisy - it makes almost a grating noise. The first time I tried to make ice cream it didn't work. What I learned was you have to put the extract in during the last five minutes. Extract has alcohol in it, and will prevent your ice cream from hardening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"This made ice cream fast, but not impressed with the recipe or how the ice cream froze on the sides of the bowl while making it.

The best I can get is some crystals forming in cold cream.

I wanted an icecream maker that didn't need ice and salt and purchased the Cuisinart ICE-20. It was a huge mistake. This machine has a bowl that needs to be kept in the freezer before it can be used. So for sure don't buy the machine and plan to use it the same day. I have tried 3 times to use it after having kept the bowl in the freezer (wrapped in plastic) for weeks at a time. The bowl warms up before the icecream thickens into the icecream texture. Each time I have to freeze the icecream mixture first let it thaw a little bit and then use it in the machine. What a pain!!

Later I found out, freezing the bowl 24 hours isn't enough. First you have to make sure you whip the heavy cream, milk and sugar into a smooth texture. Than you have to put the batter of cream into a tight container and put it in the frig for a 2-3 hours. Make sure it not in there for you long that it gets frozen, afterward transfer the batter into the machine and around 10 mins the ice cream will turn to a med firm consistency. I recommend freeze your ice cream for another hour, or else it will still melt pretty fast.And wa-la you get store brought ice cream quality or even better.happy eating"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL JUNK","review":"The top always gets stuck and requires force to remove, the blade is very hard to position.

However, it's always been a lot of work and time consuming to make it from scratch. Not with the Cuisnart! I couldn't get over that the very first time I used it, I had delicious ice cream in 20 minutes. In fact, it was not soft and/or runny...the consistency was just perfect! And, it kept that way in my freezer until the last of it was had. So, now I make sure to keep the bowl in my freezer at all times so that I am ready for making delicious ice cream at a moment's notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the whole family!","review":"This is so nice to have with kids because we all love ice cream!

We made chocolate our first try. Wow was it good! You can taste the chocolate and the cream.This ice cream maker is so simple. And it is very easy to clean up. Just make sure you wait long enough for the bowl to freeze. Like everyone else says, give it enough time to freeze solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Sweet!","review":"Overall, I've really enjoyed this ice cream maker. It works fast and makes really good ice cream, however, for best results I would say the ice cream needs to sit in the bowl, in the freezer over night, otherwise it is slightly too soft and starts to melt fast. Also, I like how the machine comes with a book of tons of recipes. No need to buy a separate recipe book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great investment!","review":"I bought this because I love ice cream and can't have many of the \\"preservatives\\" in store brands and I can't afford the price of high end natural ice creams. Thinking worse case scenario the grandkids would love it I made my first batch of ice cream using fat free half and half, it was amazing!As for the noise it makes, I discovered that setting it on a folded towel on the counter cuts down on the noise alot. My husbands plan is setting it up in the laundry room, closing the door and setting a time, lol that works too.I usually only have to place container in the frezer for 6 hours before using it so I think freezing time depends on type of freezer and settings.What I like teh most is how easy it is to make ice cream and the clean up is also fast and easy.I'm getting each of my adult children one for Christmas gifts this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice cream maker gets 5 gold stars,Awesome unit.","review":"Hello there,I had the privledge of buying this ice cream maker for my girlfriend and it was a INSTANT HIT !!!!

The third time I used it, the motor cut out because the mixture got too hard. Once it cools down, it will start up again, but by that time it's too late. And even now, when I'm making sugar-full ice cream for the family, the motor dies after about 10 minutes of churning. So now I'm fairly unhappy with the Cuisinart brand and am hesitant to get the upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lil' ice cream maker","review":"This is the best small ice cream maker I have ever used. I have made frozen yogurt, ice cream and frozen custard with this machine. All have had the perfect consistency and flavor.

Plus there will be extra ice cream to share with friends. :)It's easy to use, easy to clean and not having to use ice and salt makes it very convenient. The only thing that the manufacturer should improve upon is on the feel of the plastic cover and plastic mixing arm ; they feel flimsy, not sturdy enough to withstand years of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"mmmmm Ice Cream!","review":"This is a great ice cream maker. Ice Cream is \\"soft serve\\" ready in 30 minutes. If you want more traditional firm ice cream you need to put in another container in the freezer for a couple of hours (like you do with the makers that use ice). I keep the freezing container in the freezer and stick frozen veggies inside (both to help it freeze and for space!). You MUST use cold ingredients. With the makers that use ice, you can cheat because eventually the ice will chill it enough but with this one the container defrosts so if the ingredients aren't cold enough to begin with,they never will be. If you use cold ingredients, a frozen container, and put the ice cream in the freezer for a couple of hours after freezing, the ice cream is fabulous and easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a keeper","review":"I bought this for my elderly mother and she loves it!

The first time I used the machine it worked great. I can freeze sorbet's which I mainly use this machine. But for guests I have tried to make different types of ice cream. But the vanilla will not freeze. I thought maybe it had to do with the alcohol in the vanilla extract but then I tried the imitation w/ no alcohol but still won't freeze. I still have the box so maybe I will take it back. But it does make great sorbets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a great job for little effort","review":"I greatly enjoyed a Donvier back when they were popular...this product is similar, but with the nice extra feature of doing the stirring for you! Like other reviewers have said, you need to be sure the freezer bowl is frozen solid before starting...I would put it in a freezer on a very cold setting for at least 24 hours. Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours. I usually run the ice cream maker until the ice cream is too hard for it to easily stir, and then take the freezer bowl out, cover it with foil and put it back in the freezer to get extra hard before serving. It comes out great, I have very little problem with ice crystals forming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice cream maker","review":"Its good but small love that I don't have to have the ice and slit to the mix it does take two days to be frozen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy little ice cream maker","review":"Great ice cream maker.

I have one of those Rival brand ice cream makers that requires the salt and ice. What a mess! and loud!! This Cuisinart ice cream maker is wonderful! It is quiet compared to my old Rival and very easy to use. You keep the bowl in the freezer at all times, and when you make up a batch of ice cream, you just pour the cream in the frozen bowl and turn the button to ON. In 20 minutes or less, you have ice cream. I am very glad I bought this. I also purchased Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream & Dessert book and a Farberware Millennium ice cream scoop along with this maker and I would highly recommend those also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to make ice cream fast.","review":"This is a great item to make good ice cream while eating dinner.

We use it at least twice a week. You can make all-natural healthy ice-cream in 20-30 minutes! We only use 1/2 the sugar and it still tastes amazing. Really creamy with the home-made texture and flavor. Great recipes inside too! We gives these as gifts all the time and everyone ends up loving them. It is a bit noisy, but it's only 25 minutes!

We keep the freezing bowl in the freezer and store popcicles and the like in the middle. Note on the bowl: its possible to make two batches before refreezing, just add some time to the second batch.It does make some noise, but for us its not too much. Just position it properly and the noise factor can be mitigated quite a bit.Cleans up easy (mostly dishwasher) except for the tendency of water and washclothes to freeze to the bowl... use hot water and do it quick.We got the red one - what a nice looking unit. Sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"why isn't plastic bag for preventing freezer burn provided","review":"My first reaction is very negative. If the bowl is to be stored in the freezer in a plastic bag, why doesn't the bowl come in such a bag??My old automatic freezer, pre 1999, came with a very heavy duty bag for such storage.Maybe a gallon ziplock will work???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and liquid","review":"This machine is loud. It is louder than my dishwasher. And my dishwasher is not a quiet one. You must chill the container prior to each use. So you can only make one quart-1/2 quarts a day. Not really enough if you have a family.Additionally, the resulting product is too soft and must be frozen after churned. We attempted to eat some immediately after churning, it melted faster than it could be eaten resulting in a bowl of cream.It was disappointing. After using this machine, which I have returned. I will be looking for a machine that uses ice and salt, the old fashioned way, the way that actually works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice Cream maker","review":"I tried 4 times to make an ice cream, but it nerver solidify while going through the process.

When I scoop it out the texture wasn't creamy at all.. like a popsicle with the fruit at the bottom and heavy cream on top. I am pretty good in baking & cooking. But this machine failed and will never recommend it to any consumer.Please let cuisinart be aware of this and forward this remarks over to them and ask them if they can reply to me.I am thinking of returning them back, but I threw away the mailing box.Sincerely,Got stuck (Eva)"},{"rating":"1","title":"VENDOR SWITCH","review":"I bought this item from Amazon, realizing that another vendor would be the one shipping it.

This has happened the last 3 times it has been used. Should I return the product or throw it away? I'll refrain from posting reviews until I hear from you.In addition, we bought a Cuisinart toaster a few years ago.

The first batch I put in the freezer and it managed to come out a reasonable (although not perfect) consitency after several hours. However, the second batch ended up quite freezer burned and I am now trying to figure out whether I can return it, as I am not at all inclined to make any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Noisy!","review":"This ice cream machine makes me sad, only further complicating my relationship to the delightful treats that come out of it. Occasionally I take it out of the cupboard, only to hide it in my bedroom of my one bed apartment. Wrapping it in layers of towels, the machine can comfortably turn a wall away while I am not driven to the brink of insanity listening to a miniature lawnmower chug away not ten feet away from me.The bummer of this is that I don't mind Cuisinart as a brand overall. That's why I thought this was a good buy.... But for an extra ten or twenty dollars, a stronger, QUIETER ice cream maker would be the way to go.And I could get into design issues with the free-floating, plastic churning non-attachment, but why bother. Don't buy this. Spring for a model that will work without the racket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only person who DOESN'T like this machine?","review":"Sorry, but the Cuisinart ice cream maker that I purchased just doesn't work! I'm so bummed about it because I gave it to my roommate as a gift - now it serves as a constant reminder of my failed present. Specifically, the ice cream just never freezes. I've tried changing the recipes (from those in the manual), new recipes...it truly just never freezes. The best I get is a milk shake. (And, yes, I completely freeze the bucket).

After all, it's a Cuisinart, so it has to be good, right? Wrong. It doesn't work at all. I've followed the directions in the manual and tried at least 15 different recipes, but each time the machine stops working within 10 minutes of turning it on. The edges freeze so hard that the motor can't keep running. I turn the machine off and wait, then on again, but to no avail. Not once have I produced ice cream with this machine.

I followed the instructions and tried to make frozen strawberry yogurt. We chilled the bowl for 16 hours, made a very cold preparation of yogurt, frozen berries, and milk (per Cusinart's recipe booklet). At the end of the cycle, we ended up with a very runny strawberry mess. We put this into the freezer and after 2 hours it was still soft in the middle of the container.Also, this ice cream maker is Made in China and seemed very flimsy to me! I have since returned this item and don't feel that it was worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Combine this product with the book from Ben and Jerry's, and you have a recipe for the ultimate success. Trust me, you will make great ice cream, and any talk that the dasher is cheap or that it doesn't freeze well is nonsense from people that don't know how to use it. I live in Honolulu, where it is always 80F, and I have never had any problems. This is a great product, and I recommend that you get one.

Now I find that this machine is Jeni Britton Bauer's favorite. As she explains inJeni's Splendid Ice Creams at Home, when the ice cream is done, it will . . . still be soft, but the ice crystal structure is intact and stable. Finish the freezing by . . . hardening it in the freezer.\\" My only complaint is that this machine is a bit noisy, but it takes just 25 minutes or so to freeze a batch--not too long to vacate the kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to make and clean up. Much cheaper at Costco","review":"I have wanted one of these for a long time but the price was too high. Costco finally started carrying them for around $30, so I decided I wasn't out much if I didn't like it.Works great. I love homemade ice cream but it is such a pain to make, especially since I am single. The ice cream freezes great if you use an airtight bowl and still tastes freshly made. Stays pretty soft as well, almost like having tasty soft serve ice cream. I make the basic vanilla and cut the recipe in half and cut the time down in the machine to about 20 minutes and it works out great for a single person. You have ice cream to eat on the spot and leftovers for a couple more bowls.One thing I don't like about the recipes in the book is they are all high calorie. They call for whole milk and heavy cream. I am going to try the one suggestion next time and use half and half instead of cream and see if that works to cut down on the calories"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go to COSTCO","review":"Just saw this at Costco in Chicago for about 1/2 this price.

As the user of this product you are also able to control the quality of ice cream produced.I've been using mine for about 2 years. I can say, without a doubt, if you get \\"crappy\\" ice cream from this machine you better look in the mirror. I have made from crappy, to seriously THE MOST AMAZING ice cream I've ever had in my life in this machine. It's all about using the right ingredients, letting it churn just the right amount of time, and freezing it properly. It takes some time, but once you get that figured out you'll slap yourself every time you try and buy ice cream at the grocery store.Anyways, I'm a novice. This machine is pretty straight forward, easy to clean and maintain and I highly suggest it to anyone wanting to make home made ice cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love our ice cream maker!","review":"This is the first ice cream maker I've ever owned.

For example, the motor in the ice-cream make stops after 5-10 minutes of operation for no reason leaving you with unfinished ice-cream sludge. Apparently this is common problem with this model.I have been told by the customer care that this happens because the ice-cream maker is running a heavy duty motor. Thats odd ! I have other appliances running in my house that use a lot more power and voltage and I dont have the same problem. In summary, it might be worth spending a bit more and buying something that is more reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you have a super freezer....","review":"I've had the freezing bowl in the freezer at home for 3 straight days and the liquid inside is still \\"liquid\\".I then put it inside another freezer elsewhere where the door isn't opened so often as in the one I have at home. Voila! It worked, usually in less than 24 hours (freezing time recommended by instruction manual) it was ready for use.One time I was preparing an important dinner for guests and I had my ice cream base ready but the bowls (which had been placed to freeze 2 days before) were still liquid inside. Lucky for me, there was an ice cream place nearby and I asked them to prepare my ice cream in their machine. They saved me.So bottom line is, unless your freezer door is not opened frequently, the freezer bowl will be ready in a wiz, otherwise, prepare to wait at least a few days before you can make your ice cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars, if possible","review":"Bought this ice cream maker at Macy's.

It became a cold, barely slushy, mixture. I've tried making it on several occasions. In other reviews, I've read that it helps to \\"freeze\\" the milk/cream before putting it in the ice cream maker.

No salt or ice needed. Made fabulous \\"ice cream\\" from soy milk. You could make a frozen treat in about 20 minutes with almost any ingredients. As vegan/raw foodists, we have been stuck, but with this machine we can once again enjoy a creamy frozen treat. Use your imagination to concoct treats, or try the recipe book Vice Cream by Jeff Rodgers. This book is great for vegans, but honestly anyone would enjoy the recipes in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome appliance","review":"We got this as a wedding gift and absolutely love it! We were amazed at how fast and easy it is to make ice cream or sorbet, which (if you have a good recipe) tastes better than the store-bought stuff and even better than many of our local ice cream shops. We just keep the bowl in the freezer, wrapped in a plastic grocery bag (to prevent frost build-up or freezer burn), and when we are in the mood for ice cream we just pull it out and make some. The dessert attains a soft serve consistency within 20-30 minutes, and a harder consistency after another hour in the freezer.The bowl has a liquid core that allows it to stay cold while the ice cream is being made. It also overcomes a major hassle of some more old-fashioned ice cream makers, which require ice cubes and rock salt to chill the bowl.We didn't know what we were missing out on. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE ITEM!","review":"I love to cook and bake, and i LOVE ice cream. I always wanted an ice cream maker and this year for my birthday i recieved one! The ice cream maker came with a book of recipes of which I tried the vanill and added chocolate chips, it was out of this world! And the best part is it takes 5 minutes to make and then you just throw it into the ice cream maker for 25 minutes. I simply keep the bowl in my freezer and whenever i want to make ice cream i just pull it out and it's as easy as 1,2,3... and ten times easier than baking a cake. I just made strawberry ice cream and the taste is trully AMAZING! What's to lose this is the best thing I've ever recieved, and I would reccomend it to ANY ice cream lover!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well in the beginning","review":"I enjoyed this machine for several months and it is ok for the money. ... couldn't wait to use it. It was great after I got over the initial, \\"bowl wouldn't freeze until two days late\\" problem. After we figured out that it needed to be in the Freezer longer then they stated on the manual, we kept making ice cream.Some of the problems we have came after about two months time. The ice cream will freeze to the inside of the bowl about 1/4\\" thick. The scraper is plastic and is not very durable and has stopped doing the job of scraping the ice cream off the sides.The only way now is to sit over the ice cream maker with a plastic spoon and scrape the walls myself. Sometimes the ice cream will get stuck and not move at all.This is all by following the instructions on the manual, or following instructions from Ice Cream recipe books.I am still using it, but to me, it's not as good as I would have liked it to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easiest ice cream maker to date","review":"I can't believe how easy this ice cream maker is to use. Once the ice cream mixture is poured into the machine, it only takes about 20 minutes to freeze and is absolutely delicious. The only thing to remember is to make sure the bowl has been frozen for at least 24 hours in order to freeze the ice cream to a good consistancy. It is such a relief not to worry about having ice or rock salt available.The Ben and Jerry's ice cream recipe book is perfect with this maker because of the simplicity and tastiness of the recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart ICE-20 1 1/2-Quart Automatic Ice Cream Maker","review":"I purchased this item approximately 2 years ago. It is a nice size and design; however, all I ever get out of it is SLOP. The container never seems to get cold enough to make a even a semi-solid product. This is not due to lack of sufficient time in the freezer because I keep the container low in a deep freezer. I have followed several of the recipes from the recipe book included in the box with NO SUCCESS. It always ends up going to the cats. Therefore, I definitely advise not wasting your time and money on this item.I have several other kitchen appliances made by Cuisinart that I have been extremely satisfied with, but this purchase did not hold up to my previous high expectations of Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"The motor died the fourth time I used it","review":"The ICE-20 worked as advertised for the first 3 timesit was used.

However, after only a month of using the ice cream maker, following manufacturer instructions, the inner gel that is supposed to freeze solid to make the ice cream cold, ceased to freeze. It could never freeze solidly.I called to get a replacement bowl and was told that not only would I have to pay to ship the old bowl back, but I would also have to pay for them to ship me a replacement bowl. This is absolutely ridiculous.Considering the CSR explained to me that it was company policy, I guaranteed them I would never purchase a Cuisinart/Conair product again. It is unfortunate, as I have often heard good things about their brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent deal!","review":"This machine was very easy to use, the recipes are quick and easy and the ice cream tastes great.

It is simplicity itself to use. The bowl doesn't take much room in the freezer where it stays between uses. The machine IS a little noisy. It makes soft ice cream - just put it in the freezer for hard ice cream. The plastic \\"churn\\" couldn't handle anything too firm. I think children would love having this machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PRODUCT","review":"I love the Ice cream maker, it works great, is so simple to use, even prepares coctels.

After spending all day preparing the custard, cutting my strawberries, etc., at the end of the running time, I still have slightly chilled goo (I can't even call it slush, which would imply that it actually froze something). Each time that I have attempted ice cream, I have increased all the estimated times. This time the core was in the freezer for 2 days, ice placed inside. Ingrediants were as cold as they could be without starting to freeze. You get the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dasher Broke After 20 Uses","review":"Once I got the hang of it (there is a bit of a learning curve, but it's not terribly steep), I loved the frozen treats that I could make - especially frozen yogurt.A few weeks ago, while it was mid way thru churning, the upper, cylindrical part of the dasher snapped away from the vertical, scraping arm. Because the machine is out of warranty, I had to order the part's replacement at my own expense. While it's not going to break the bank, Cuisinart informed me that it would take 8 weeks (!) to fill my order.I'd considered ordering the dasher that was introduced in the newer model, since it's supposed to be more efficient, but I wasn't sure that it would fit in the ICE-20.Bottom Line: Great concept, lousy parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 icecream maker!","review":"I bought one as a wedding gift and couldn't resist getting myself one too.

If you like ice cream definitely get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Product","review":"After years of wanting and looking, trying the hand cranks and ice, I've found the perfect machine. So simple to use. Almost doesn't need a manual.The most fantastic ice creams in minutes. Just make sure the empty bowl is stored in the freezer, and ingredients are cold. (for lighter, creamier ice cream, I lightly beat the cream before adding to any receipe.)Easy to experiment with. All our friends look forward to my ice cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, never soupy","review":"All of you people who have trouble with the ingredients not freezing, check the temperature of your freezer.

Be aware that key plastic parts (the lid and mixing arm) are not dishwasher safe. In our case, they warped in the dishwasher and rendered the entire machine unusable. Cuisinart should have used dishwasher-safe plastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm VERY disappointed","review":"I'm amazed at how poorly this appliance works; I expect more from a product made by Cuisinart. The cannister took 3 days to freeze, and the ice cream it produced was grainy & had gummy, unpleasant lumps in it. We thought that perhaps since the canister was still half frozen it wouldn't take so long to freeze for the next use; this is, apparently, wrong. And the last two batches attempted wouldn't freeze.

This machine is convenient, easy, and it's not as loud as my old Rival which requires ice and salt, but that's where the pros end. For one, this thing only makes 1.5 quarts at most! Because it freezes so quickly, the texture of the ice cream isn't nearly as creamy as my old Rival's ice cream. When ice cream freezes too fast you get ice crystals, so the texture is icy rather than creamy. Also, because the bucket is itself frozen, you get nearly a cup of your ice cream frozen solid against the sides of the bucket and you can't get it off until the bucket thaws. So, by the time you get to scoop out your homemade ice cream all you get is a little over one quart of icy ice cream, since the rest is frozen against the sides of the bucket, and that's a LOT of work for that little amount of ice cream. I want my old, noisy Rival back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ice Cream Maker!","review":"I decided to get this ice cream maker just for fun, mostly to use with friends when it gets hot. It had great reviews already so I felt pretty good about this model. I'll list the pros and cons below:===Pros===*Really easy to make good ice cream*Recipe book included (and recipes taste great)*Easy to clean/maintain*1.5 quarts is perfect for 3-4 people===Cons===*Takes a long time to freeze the mixing bowl (20+ hours to be safe) - along with that, you can't really make 2 batches (if you want different flavors) in a row unless you buy another bowl separately.While it would be nice to be able to make different flavor batches consecutively, I don't have enough of a need to do that to take away any stars. This really is a great product and has been very reliable so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Lactose Free Ice-cream","review":"I've used this ice-cream maker a couple of times and love it! I'm lactose intolerant, so I make frozen custard with lactose free milk. So far, my favorite is mint frozen custard with dark chocolate chips. My son has a list of what we will make next... maybe Cookie and Cream...CON: It is a little small if you are planning on adding chocolate chips and stuff, so you might want to adjust accordingly or just mix the add-in by hand at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something must be wrong with the machine","review":"I followed the directions to a T. However, it didn't seem to work. I tried making two batches. It was disappointing since I was looking forward to it.

It's easy to clean as well. I bought an ice cream maker so I could use organic ingredients, and everything has turned out fantastic so far. I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"best for the price","review":"Best for the price, by far. I do recommend purchasing a second freezer bowl so you can make a second quart right away (w/o waiting several hours for the bowl to refreeze.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"I purchased 2 of these Cuisinart Ice Cream makers as gifts. Both parties reported they thoroughly enjoy the item and indicated how easy it is to prepare and make various ice creams and other frozen desserts.

Mr. Dershowitz relies heavily on quotations from his previous books (sometimes quoting sections twice) and at times dispenses trivial advice. For those (like me) who have read some of his other books, Letters is repetitive and the non-repetitive portions are insubstantial. Ironically Mr. Derschowitz includes a chapter on how professors should publish without peer review and not be reluctant to get less-than-perfect writing out to the public. He followed his own advice a little too literally with this hastily drafted book.

He even leaves us with his address and email to encourage interactive conversations and discussions which is indeed a privilege to us all.Any reader will benefit from Dershowitz's great wealth of experiences, the passion of his beliefs and tried and true advice as well as exploring the fundamental question of whether a good lawyer can be a good person.

I look forward to other titles by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book only gets you to first base.","review":"This book does fairly well (but not wonderfully) to describe the basic concepts to the beginner, and it gives you some code to get started on. After reading this book and completing the examples, I only barely know enough to get started with ATL. If you buy this book you will soon need to read another just to feel competent in ATL.The first 75 pages are a very basic overview of templates and COM. The book then introduces ATL's implementation of IUnknown, IDL, Aggregation, IDispatch and Dual Interfaces, Connection Points, and Active X controls in the middle of the book. This content is covered in no real detail. The section (paragraph?) on marshalling is so thin that no useful information could be gained from it. Tacked on to the end are sections on Asynchronous Download, COM threading, MFC, and COM +. Without a detailed understanding of the core concepts of ATL, these sections are useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but lacking details","review":"The book is better than other ATL titles. I found the book to be lacking in technical details - the author was obviously rushed. I had to read a lot of the ATL code to figure out how aggregation worked, for example. I appreciated the excellent detail-rich coverage of connection points. Unfortunately, there is little to no coverage of non-MFC lightweight windowing classes. Not a book for beginners as a lot of the technical details are left for the reader to discover on his/her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best explanation of COM I've read","review":"This is the best tutorial book I've read on COM and ATL.

The only drawback is that the book is becoming a bit dated with the advent of ATL 3.0 in VC++ 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ATL Beginners Book","review":"This book is excellent for those unfamiliar with ATL. It provides a good overview of COM basics, template basics, and how ATL works and how to use it.

Featuring some -wicced- traccs from Mr. Doctor, his partna Foe Loco (a complete undiscovered talent still..) and others in the Odysea clicc, this CD basically marks the end of the era when Sacramento rap -really- was at the top of its game. After this, it would be left to only Lynch, C-Bo, X-Raided, First Degree, and Luni Coleone to try to hold together the Sacramento reputation, when once there were almost 20 rappers in their prime coming from Sacramento, who were virtually taking over the California rap scene.If you don't like this for some reason, then go grab \\"Foe Loco - Foecus\\" (or Re-Foecussed, they're basically the same CD). THAT album is guaranteed to knocc your soccs off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why the LDS church wouldn't publish it.","review":"I have always admired BH Robert's contributions to history. What I failed to realize was that he should have stuck to history and keep his private theories private. Why wouldn't the LDS church sponser his book? I had hoped for some interesting tidbits gleaned from his years of access to church records and journals. Maybe something the church didn't want to get out.Naaa,, They just didn't want to be associated with some of his really stupid and undoctrinal theories.

Fossum and 4 colleagues wrote a comprehensive book on Small Animal Surgery. I have not seen it but I have heard excellent comments about its illustrations and descriptions. For this reason, I bought the Manual thinking that it was a summary of the larger text. Great disappointment! It is a summary but without pictures! Paraphasing Alice: \\"What good is a surgery book without pictures?\\" There is nothing wrong with the Manual, except the absence of pictures; I don't feel secure trying to image operating procedures guided only by text, regardless how good it is. The Manual costs $ 50 against $ 150 de original; I should have sprung the full price and bought the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why!?","review":"Why release a dvd with 4-5 videos, most of which are already on Kiss Exposed and Kiss Extreme close-up, official Kiss videos.

Zzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the fan","review":"I enjoyed the Vid for I LOVE IT LOUD, but the rest are just a waste of space. Nice to have as a small collection, but really not worth it in the KISS universe. I bought it because I am a KISS fan.The concept of the MILLENIUM MASTERS is basically a small sample of either CD material, or in this case Video material is put out as an example of the artists work. So, its meant for someone who is not a fan. That way, they can get a collection of artists across a broad spectrum. So, the purpose of this very repetitive collection is not for the fan to buy it, but for the non fan to shell out a small amount and see what any particular artist is like. The amount of small sample discs, video and cd, is getting very large. I suspect it is very much a marketing ploy."},{"rating":"2","title":"jazz violinist,","review":"i,ts an excellent cd, i love it, i always like jon lou pontys music and this cd it got jazz fusion,electronic overtones in it, i,ll reconmmend anybody to give it a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"pricing","review":"I have a brush just like this one that I really like but it only cost $5.00. $120?! - is that a mistake?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO THIN","review":"I cannot wear this alone.

Some things in it are useful and I saved about five pages that I refer to now and then. If lacks usable forms on a cd that would make it more helpful. It is not written for either a novice or an expert. I find it lacks specific detail and a easy to use format for novices. However, it does not offer enough depth for experts.

Great debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"best album this year","review":"Melanie c always had the best voice out of all of the spice girls and it stands out on her first solo album Northern Star. The opening track Go sets the pace for the whole of the album, its full of radio friendly songs such as Never be the same and I turn to you. Going down is the only song that seems out of place on this album as the rest of the songs seem more chilled out. Going down shows what a vocal range mel has, and shows what an all round performer she is and that she is not afraid to use her own influences rather than folowing the trend. if all the other spice girls produce an album as ranged and altogether as complete as this it will be a pleasant suprise but i some how doubt it. this album wil appeal to all people even to those who cant stand the spice girls as she has progressed so much that she almost shoves the girl band label right off and puts it firmly in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CD!","review":"I love this CD!

Highlights include \\"Go!', \\"Northern Star\\", \\"Goin' Down\\", \\"I Turn To You\\", \\"Why\\", \\"Gaga\\" and \\"Closer\\".

I was in High School when this album came out and it provided theme music for the phases I went through. Walking around in the Bronx then you could here any of the songs on this album playing out of people's cars, out of their windows, on radios, in the clubs, etc. Back then I went out and bought two copies of the album on audiotape, which I still have in my possession and do play.

At least the writers made money by this song selling so well to moronic imbeciles who wouldn't know good music if it bit them in the arse... speaking of which... this song/group sucks arse in epic proportions and magnitude.

Like previous seasons, this one has a mix of good and bad stuff, with a lot more good than bad. There are tight, smart pieces like the prenatal beauty pageant and the life-raft talk show, but then there are dragging, corny sketches like the \\"Date with the Queen\\". It's evident from the commentary that even Bob, David, and the rest of the cast feel that there are some real clunkers that just didn't work. On the other hand, Bob is is often critical of sketches that work just fine, so maybe he's just on crack.There's a nice expansion of the cast in this season. Tom Kenny doesn't show up much, but B.J. Porter and Scott Aukerman have some hilarious roles. Jay Johnston is also more prominent, and he's always funny.If you liked the previous three seasons, this is definitely worth picking up. The writing, performing, and production values are the best of all Mr. Show seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the whole collection!","review":"Chances are if you watch one season of Mr. Show you will immediately become addicted and want to see the others. If you can get the whole collection for under $60 or better yet under $50, then you will most likely save money than if you buy one season at a time for 20-30 dollars. As for season four specifically, I can't really pick out a favorite as I believe every season has had it's absolute golden moments. To each his own, but get the whole collection.

He tells of his experiences as a POW and other war stories. I am not a fan of political books, but this is more than that.

Overall I enjoyed it, and got through the book in a matter of days (which is more than I can say for \\"Audacity of hope\\"). Despite what people might say here, I came away with the impression of McCain as a main who has his flaws but has come to understand his flaws. I believe intellectual Honesty is one of the most important characteristic a person can develop. I believe he edited out most of the gratuitous aspect of his imprisonment, but one cannot leave without thanking the powers that it was me that was subjected to the punishment that McCain suffered, and for those naysayers and critics, I wonder how we would have performed in those circumstances. The Book is a little choppy in parts and drags a little in parts, but I had no problem with it, and am glad I read it before McCain's Political destiny is fulfilled, and we have to plow through the revisionist versions of his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor and Heroism Personified","review":"If Sen.

John McCain is a real American hero, a man who has gone through so much and seems destined to go even further. Reading this book has certainly had an effect on me- this Democrat is voting for Senator McCain next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true tale of an American Hero","review":"John McCain reflects on his father and grandfather before talking about his gut wrenching trials as a prisoner of war who would not use his fathers power to get freed from a Vietnamese prison camp.

What a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't understand McCain's Maverickness until I read this book.","review":"There are many interesting things about John McCain I was unaware of before I read this excellent book. It's great that McCain has come clean about his many extramarital affairs. That was a tough thing to do! The chapter \\"Why I abandoned Carol and the kids,\\" in which McCain outlined his decision to leave his first wife and three small children, is both heartbreaking and inspiring. I especially liked the chapter in which McCain chronicles the many fistfights he has gotten into while serving in the U.S. Senate. And while I was skeptical at first, I now understand that McCain's plan to tax health benefits, raise social security taxes and increase FICA 75% will untimately pay for the bailout plan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith of my Fathers","review":"Excellent book by John McCain.

My dad is retired Air Force, so I could relate to this lifestyle so well. I was 15 and at Hickam when the POW's returned and we would stay late at night or get up early to meet each flight coming in. I (along with many, many people) shook his hand along with all the other POW's returning, they are memories I have often shared with my children as they study that time. My father was an escort for a POW so he had spent alot of time at Clark during the release as his POW was one of the last bunch to come home. We had been stationed at Clark before we moved to Hickam so this book stirred up alot of old memories. So glad to hear he is doing well, I often wondered how they all readjusted.

McCain fails this test, as he was born in Panama, which is a different country.He fails the test in lots of other ways too. His recent failed attempt to get the Congress to vote for the $700 billion bankers' bail-out bill shows that: 1) he favours the rich against the majority of the American people; and 2) he can't even persuade his fellow-Republicans to support the bill.And his party, and its policy of backing the bankers whatever, has been mainly responsible for the current economic crisis.And if he were to die in office (after all, cancer-sufferers do often suffer relapses), Sarah Palin would become President."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-aggrandizing, irrelevant","review":"The real shame in \\"Faith of My Fathers\\" is that McCain was involved at all; Salter's efforts clearly demonstrate the ghostwriter's skill, whereas J.M. has merely phoned in his oft-championed 'trials and tribulations.' It's flat, for one, and so overtly self-congratulatory that one cannot help but think that McCain might as well taken the little time he spent on this and just petitioned to have his face carved on Mt. Rushmore. A waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"John McCain's Faith of My Fathers defines values and heroism","review":"Don't read this book for its literary qualities; Read it for the story. McCain hales from a line of military figures who knew the meaning of honor, faith, and valor. He followed the family example and his recollections of Vietnam as a POW are extremely moving. At a time when so many despised America, he grew to love it - in the squalor of prison camps. Suffering may not make people heroes but it unquestionably enobled John McCain. The book is an inspiration. Its faults are minor although the loose ends about McCain's personal life are a distraction.

This book, if closely read, shows exactly how poor a credential his POW experience and conduct is. Two examples (there are more): Within four days of being captured, he specifically admits that he first offered and then provided valid military information so that he could get treatment other POWs in his position didn't get. He details at last two propaganda broadcasts/interviews he gave. Both of those are in direct violation of the Military Code of Conduct that he swore to uphold (and he was not being either tortured or coerced when he did those things -- he did them of his own free will and for his own purposes).McCain is not the hero he portrays himself as being -- at most he is just a survivor, who survived in a less-than-honorable way. The American public really needs to learn the truth about this McCain. This book, if closely read, is a good starting point. I recommend it for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this one from the Library, don't buy it.","review":"Like many parent's, I would like to think that my children will someday read the books that had an impact on my life, Faith of my Fathers however will not be on the short list. Let me say up front that I am an unabashed supporter of every soldier that ever wore an American uniform in battle. I respect and appreciate what John McCain did. As an American I am in his debt. His book however lacked punch. In my opinion too much time was spent lauding the accomplishments of his father and grandfather. The description of his experiences as a POW were unpleasent, but they paled in comparison to Henri Charriere's description of the conditions on Devil's Island which included the infamous prisoner Papillon."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Ok But about A GREAT American","review":"John McCain is a great man. A true American Hero. His story is one of courage and faith. I think he will make a great President. However, this book is dull. Some of the parts where he describes life in a Vietnamese POW camp are interesting and must reading. However, as a whole the book is just not as exciting as it should be. McCain is a great man, so hopefully next time around his story will be told in a better way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Memoir","review":"I don't particullary care for Senator McCain's political views. But after reading his family memoir, I think McCain has had a very interesting life. His experiences in VietNam seem so gruesome. It was also interesting to get to learn about McCain's father and grandfather. If you are wanting to learn about a admirable politician and at the same time learn about the Viet Nam war, you should definitely give this book a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legendary Family","review":"A painfully honest family story. Much of this book focuses on John McCain's father and grandfather, both of whom had significantly more successful military careers.McCain clearly admired his father/grandfather and wanted to follow in their footsteps. He seemed to be cut from a different cloth and fate delivered a very different set of life experiences. The stories regarding his treatment in North Vietnam showed him to be a person who could endure great hardship and still retain his faith and sanity.Reading this book gave me a much better understanding of him as a candidate and politician. The traits which allowed him to survive as a POW and a career in the military do not always serve him well in politics. I have no doubt that he is an honorable man who puts love of country above all else. Unfortunately, those same traits are what keep him from being a successful national candidate.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"very moving story","review":"I often wonder how the being a POW would shake your resolve and faith for the country, and wonder if I could do it. After reading this book I am no closer to the dicision that I could survive it, but it makes you proud to know that there are americans like John Mccain out there. This book doesn't just cover the time in prision though, but rather his life up until he was released as well as the lives of his father and grandfather. A must read for anyone interested in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"McCain demonstrates real moral stature!","review":"McCain has a witty, understated, and self-deprecatory way of relating the earlier years of his \\"misspent youth.\\" One can see how he grew during his trials in Vietnam, and how his father and grandfather have always stood as icons to him, to help guide him through difficult times, and help him shape his values.

I found the advanced vocabulary outstanding. The way the book is put together is very hitorically orientated. He starts with his Grandpa and the impacts he made on John's life, then about his own father and the sacrafices that helped shape his faith. How he did in the navy and being shot down. Finally he tells you about His struggles in 'nam and how his hardships there helped make him a better man. A really good biography and tribute, John McCain for President.

This is a man that loved his country so much he suffered many years of physical, medical, and psychological torture at the hands of the enemy, even when they asked him if he wanted to be released. He put his fellow POW's first as well as his country. Certainly a better fit for commander-in-chief than any other candidate. Slow moving at first, but interesting just the same. He is a genuine patriot!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith of our fathers by John McCain","review":"It is one of the finest, most honest & noble books I have ever read. There is heroism & love of country from start to finish. McCain does not consider himself a hero, although, the descriptions of his tortures as well as that of other patriots certainly would make him so. I am proud to be a citizen of my beloved USA after reading of the sacrifices made by our wonderful military men who were POW's in N.Korea. This is a book meant to be read over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A toast to...toast","review":"I was skeptical of this toaster based on the prior reviews. But when we saw it at Costco for $39.99, we had to give it a try. And so far it's been a very good buy.We wanted a toaster that could make 4 slices of regular toast, but also toast slices of specialty breads that won't fit in a regular toaster without flipping the slice over, and then burning the middle. This definitely does that.So far it has been very consistent. I like mine medium, my wife likes hers barely toasted, and we haven't had any problems yet. As far as we're concerned, that is all we care about. The score of 4 stars is only due to the fact that we haven't had it very long, and almost no product is perfect. For the price, I recommend giving it a shot!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Wide Slot Toaster","review":"I have gone through several toasters, and found this one to be the best. The slot is wide and easily fits our New York sized bagels without deforming them. Also, unlike many toasters out there, it is easy to remove toast - even smaller sized breads, because it lifts them up higher when the toaster pops up. Another great feature is the ability to digitally control the settings for brown-ness and types of bread. It is easy to clean (with a full-length pull-out drawer), and because of it's slim design, doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter. Cuisinart is well known for it's high quality products - and this is definitly one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed toastlover","review":"Despite the high price ,i bought this toaster because I had \\"blind faith \\" in the Cuisinart name.

The minute the bread pops out, it resets to the default - \\"4\\".

Never found that the defrost feature was worth a hoot. Now it will only badly toast 2 slices and than refuses the work again for 20 minutes. I have resurrected to old 60's appliance.

It can handle two bagel halves easily, a super long sour dough, or two pieces of regular sandwhich bread. It has was appears to be useful setting buttons. But in the end, it toasts unevenly. VERY unevenly. As a rule, it burns the top and fails entirely to tast the bottom. So unless you plan to hover over you toast and flip it, I'm afraid this isn't the unit for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Toaster Experience!!!!!","review":"After years of good toast, but a broken, ugly toaster, my husband finally bought us this new toaster. The first time I used it filled our home with a very strong burned plastic smell. I couldn't find any plastic in the unit at all, so I figured maybe it was just because it was the first use of the toaster (although that still didn't seem right). I gave it two more tries, and STILL get a bunt-plastic smell (though not as strong as the first time). Anyone else experience this??? The toast burned also! It has a fancy-sounding \\"custom control\\" feature. Well, this only works if the toaster remains plugged in. Once the toaster is unplugged,you lose all of your settings. Here's the caveat--the instruction manual tells you top unplug the toaster when not in use!! Huh???? I called the custumer service #, and after 3 tries finally got a nice lady who told me to return to to the store and get something else. It is boxed up and ready to go! No more cuisinart for us!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Reviewers seem to either love or hate their toaster - I hate mine. It takes forever to toast a slice of bread, toasts it unevenly, makes a horrible popup sound and makes the next slices darker. The one-slice feature makes no difference I can see, I have to hit cancel instead of manually popping toast up when smoke begins to roll from the toaster and we are down to 2 lights for regular toast as the toast continues to get darker for the same setting over time.

While these stories are fascinating as a product of their time, don't expect them to read as anything other than very dated.Matheson does include an element of horror in each story and that is generally the least dated, most successful aspect. If you don't mind the seriously lame 50's B movie sci fi trappings and the humorously outdated mores that appear in this collection, you can really see why Matheson would come to be a well regarded horror writer in later days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book unless you like dated science fiction!!","review":"The title of this book is intentionally misleading. What it should be is \\"Duel: DATED SCIENCE FICTION Stories by Richard Matheson\\". With only a couple exceptions, the stories in this book are not \\"Terror Stories\\", but in fact a bunch of old science fiction stories that Matheson wrote in the 1950's.When I discovered this I was extremely annoyed, because I love Horror, but hate Science Fiction. I had read I AM LEGEND by Matheson, and enjoyed this story immensely. I was looking forward to reading other \\"horror\\" stories by Matheson. What I got was a lot of dated sci-fi.This was a shameless attempt by the publisher to market some very old (and very good) science fiction as a new Horror short story collection. By the misleading title, the publisher is trying to deceive Horror fans, like myself, into purchasing a recyled Sci-Fi book. The publisher should be ashamed for this unethical marketing attempt."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can Get Duel in a Better Matheson Anthology Collection called The Incredible Shrinking Man","review":"My rating of this collection does not reflect the senstational story Duel but that story is also available in another anthology collection calledThe Incredible Shrinking Man. That collection in my opinion is a much better buy as it also has Matheson's brilliant story The Shrinking Man. You can buy that story on its own as a stand alone story if you have already purchased this book by dropping the word incredible in the Amazon search engine or just clicking on this linkThe Shrinking Man (Sf Masterworks). The shrinking man is a great story of a normal guy who keeps shrinking and makes the ultimate enemy of a black widow spider.So buy this collection Duel: Terror Stories if it is cheaper if you just want Duel but the other stories within this anthology to be honest with you are extremely average. If you want two good stories however, buy The Incredible Shrinking Man titled anthology instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"knight rider season 4","review":"I think it would be great if I could only get the product. the first one grew legs and walked off. the replacement should be here Mon or Tues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitt vs Karr","review":"I agree!!

The third season was by far the best of the series, but the fourth was the worst.

(3 are computers)I've had better luck with DVD sets from Amazon than with those purchased through local retailers. I've only had problems with Universal Studios.The first two part season opener is one of my favorites. Devon is impersonated while kit is rebuilt in Chicago. Super persuit mode is a bit corny, but RC3 and Bonnie are actually rather interesting at the beginning of the season. The last episode with the vodoo plot is very bad.

I've owned this album for a year, and discounted it mostly because it was too unevenly paced to keep my interest. However, after spending a few quiet evenings listening through the album (the only way to listen to downtempo), I have to say... wow.

I found this to be very irritating the first time I listened to the album on earphones. Another thing I was disappointed with was the lack of instrumental or vocal performances. There was no musicianship in this album, only background beats, chord structure, and decorative samples.

I have read all but one of the books and was very excited about Lives of the Writers, since writing is my area of expertise. The illustrations were lovely, as always, but the writing (of all things!) lacked vigour, droning on with archaic facts about the authors. Towards the end I had trouble identifying the authors or the books they are most famous for. Krull would have been better served to write about familiar, yet interesting authors, such as J.R.R. Tolkien or Lucy Maud Montgomery, as opposed to Zora Neale Hurston and Isaac Bashevis Singer.Nevertheless, this is a good, witty, and light book, and it is a welcome addition to Krull's series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Like Being a Voyeur!","review":"LIVES OF THE WRITERS: COMEDIES, TRAGEDIES (WHAT THE NEIGHBORS THOUGHT) is a long title for such a little book!

This little book of little-known facts is witty and interesting.

Krull presented basic biographical information for up to nineteen well-known authors from the past and more resent times. Along with this standard information, Krull also offered not-so-common facts about the life, personalities, and actions of the authors. While reading the book, I found myself feeling as if I had came to know some the authors as a person rather than simply an author from the past. Also, I enjoyed the illustrators' drawings of the each author. The illustrations seemed to add a bit of humor and light-heartedness to the information.

I would say that perhaps I have used it on average two times a month for the past 3 years. About 2 months ago, I go to put on the food processor top and it makes this horrible high pitched squealing sound. I think I may have lost some hearing from how horrible it was. Two people within my household came running out of their respective rooms to see what the \\"horrible noise\\" was. I picked up the base, and sure enough like many others on here - the drive had stripped the gripping teeth practically flat.

I suppose if you were to be able to tighten the collar enough it might stress it to the point of breaking.Perhaps we just got a lemon, but based on the other reviews here the chances are that it's not a good design to begin with.We returned ours for a refund and are re-thinking our selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clutch broken","review":"My roommate has the earlier model (SmartPower 5 spd; CB-9).

I chose the throw-away option. This part could not possibly have been designed for any other purpose than to outlast a one-year warranty assuming light-to-moderate usage. Apparently after reading other complaints here, I'm not the only person who has been screwed. I would guess this part is used on most or all Cuisanart blenders. My best advice to Cuisanart users is to use your blender as a decorative item. If you want to use it to blend something, you'll get best results if you use another blender to pre-blend your smoothies, and then you can maybe stir up the drink a little bit in your cuisanart without straining this plastic part."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may blend but it doesn't chop or puree.","review":"I don't make smoothies but instead use my blender to make soups, sauces and purees.

Anyhow, I compared my blender to my parents' (Oster brand), and they have a much durable design. I'll make sure I inspect any small appliance before I make a purchase! In this case, it was a gift so I can't complain. I'm going to purchase the clutch assembly as recommended by one of the viewers.

Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I had only used this blender about 5 times (to make smoothies, mostly using frozen fruit pieces, milk and ice cream). One day as I was making one of my smoothies, I noticed that nothing was happening--I had the power on and could hear it, but my stuff wasn't mixing and chopping. I discovered that the plastic gear mechanism that turns the blade had cracked, therefore the matching gear on the base was just spinning and not turning the blade. AFTER FIVE USES!!!!! Wow--I never expected such lousy craftmanship from Cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Indeed!","review":"After 60 days of occasional (once a week) use to make smoothies, the all-plastic gears shattered!

It seems strong, but fill it half way or more and the only thing that gets blended is the stuff at the bottom, with the upper stuff just sitting still. Here is where you must stop the thing, pry off the top, make a mess, and stir it yourself. I have never had a neat experience. The best part is that the parts are dishwasher safe, so clean up is not that hard. My black plastic gear has not broken in the 2 years I have owned this, but I do not use this machine too much since it is lousy at what it is supposed to do. The blade is cracked slightly (not the metal blade but the plastic shell in which the blade is encased). I hate this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap blender","review":"have several Cuisinart products, so when I saw this blender,I was sure I was getting a great product.

But after less than a year it stopped again, but this time the reset didn't work. It goes on, but no matter what function you choose, it works for a second and then goes off again.

This blender is garbage. We loved the solid build but when we tried to crush ice or make a frozen drink, the blender runs for about half the time needed, about 20 seconds, then the SmartPower protection kicks in and shuts it down.

Even if all we through in there is frozen berries, frozen yogurt and OJ. It simply is not strong enough for smoothies- hence why I only give it one star. It also failed to blend baby food to super smooth and also failed to finely chop slices of bread into breadcrumbs.

Today, I was making a smoothie and the smell got extremely bad. When I opened up the lid, puffs of smoke were coming out of the unit. I had to throw the smoothie out (which was only milk and banana) because the smoke \\"traveled\\" through the liquid to escape.

When I first used it, it gave off an odd smell, like burning plastic. I thought that simply might be a factor of the newness and expected it to go away with time. Months later, it still smelled every time I used it. Not only that, it was LOUD. With every use, I had to tolerate the loud whining sound of the motor. One day, it simply stopped rotating the blade. It turned out that the black plastic wheel on the base (the one that couples with the wheel on the bottom of the blender pitcher to spin the blade) just broke in two, thus rendering the base useless. I was very disappointed. After reading the trouble people have had with customer service at Cuisinart, I decided it was too much trouble to seek a repair/replacement from them. I simply bought another brand that I hope will provide better, more reliable service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Looks and Worked Decent...

I found out the hard way that it costs $30 plus to replace the glass jar as I accidentally tapped the bottom on the counter while cleaning it and up the side a crack went. Finally, after about 1-1/2 years of very occasional use making smoothies and soups, the motor is pouring out smoke and leaving bits of plastic on the countertop. I seriously don't believe I've been hard on the blender, but after maybe only 20 uses, I've concluded this was a mistake to buy. Also, the white plastic fades to a milky yellow if you leave it on the countertop and your kitchen gets sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"No blender is perfect","review":"I have had my blender for two years without a problem. I have just spent the past hour reading blender reveiws, and my conclusion is that this blender is comparable to any other good blender at any price point. If I am making smoothies and the fruit is ice solid and I have placed a lot of fruit in the belnder, I will have to stir it. But, no blender, save an industrial version, such as the kind they use at Jamba Juice, is going to do better. It crushes ice well and has never leaked. All of the speeds work properly and it is easy to clean. The lid, however is vinyl, so if you are going to place it in the dishwaher, please be aware of the food remains in the washer with it. White will stain regardless of the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible for ice crushing","review":"A piece of trash for ice crushing. Motor sounds like it's about to explode.

I thought I was taking care not to overheat the motor, always processing small amounts for short periods of time, but in less than 2 years of very light use (at a house I only visit on summer weekends) the SmartPower Blender quit working right in the middle of a job. No smoke, no smell, no grinding noises, no signs of trouble... I let it rest as usual between pulses and it simply never started again. I've repaired numerous gadgets in my life, but this one goes directly into the trash. Meanwhile my old Waring works like a horse!Probably fine for stirring Kool-Aid, otherwise not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blender great; Processor not so great","review":"I love the blender portion. It works great at crushing ice and other items. The food processor is another story. Works to chop up and blend items, but the motor noise alone has forced me to stop using it. With each use, the noise is louder and so irritating. I am extremely disappointed that I can't use the processor portion of it. As much as I love the blender, I can't recommend the purchase because you won't be able to use the processor without ear plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS!","review":"This blender sucks!

It suddenly stopped working altogether after a few months- no power. I paid the shipping on a replacement, same model. The second Cuisinart leaks out the bottom just like the first. The base is poorly designed to tightly hold the rubber ring/gasket in proper position and in my two cases, impossible to tighten enough to prevent a leaking blender. I put it in my garage sale with a big \\"Warning- Leaks\\" sign and price of $1.00. (It isn't too bad for thick drinks like milk shakes if you pour them out quickly before the ice cream melts). I now use a $19.00 Wal-Mart blender that works great and doesn't leak- no more sticky drink juice on the counter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Blender / Bad Warranty","review":"This blender is unreliable and does not work well for smoothies (our main use for a blender). When the cutter assembly broke (after ~20 uses) I contacted Cuisinart about a warranty replacement.

This time with a proof of purchase in hand I called cuisinart customer \\"service\\" again only to learn they do not warranty items bought at the webstore (i.e. the replacement part had no warranty).If we could rate a company / brand here as well I would give one star to Cuisinart (i.e. Conair) for their shoddy product quality and poor customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Blender That Can't Blend","review":"I concur with the other bad reviews here. It can be used as a stirrer (but then again, so can a spoon and that's a bit cheaper), but beyond that, it can't actually blend anything--the blades just carve out a spot at the bottom and whir around while the food sits on top motionless (unless you spend 20 minutes shoving the food down and stirring and adjusting, etc.) And ever since the first use, I've smelled a burning motor smell every time I use it. The lack of a decent pour spout assures major spillage at every pour. Who makes a blender without a pour spout? Save your money and please don't buy this. Cuisinart should do a recall and the reason should be \\"atrocious design.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for smoothies","review":"I am a huge smoothie addict. Love making them in the morning for breakfast and after a workout. So I was excited when I received this blender as a Christmas present. It looks beautiful and is from a great brand name.

No matter how much liquid I add, how long I run the blender, or what speed I run it at, there are always chunks of un-blended fruit waiting for me to bite. It doesn't work nearly as well as the cheap Oster blender I bought years ago at Walgreens (which finally burned out)."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of the same... got parts?","review":"Had this blender for a few years.

I asked if the plastic wheel that all these reviews are talking about could be replaced with a better part that would not break on me again (it has happened twice).I mentioned that I realized it was a universal problem when I saw the reviews on Amazon.com. I was told that they do not care what 25+ reviewers on Amazon.com have to say nor will they make any design changes because they sell enough of these blenders to make up for any problems people might be experiencing.

I really had no idea how common the problem with the black impeller disk was, but I went ahead and got an Oster beehive instead; it's built like a tank. So yesterday I was in Macy's and saw someone looking at the Cuisinart. \\"Listen,\\" I told him, \\"I've heard this thing breaks a lot. This piece here.\\" And I removed the jar and pointed. \\"It's already broken,\\" he said, and sure enough, the disk had cracked into 3 pieces.

Upon contacting Cuisinart customer service, I received a \\"blanket\\" type response stating that the blender needed a new clutch and I could purchase one and install it myself. I reiterated the fact that this was the second blender where the same issue had taken place and pressed upon the fact that it was obviously a common design flaw.

I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors.

Hamlet and Othello are WAY too advanced for most people to get excited about the game. I'm going to gift the game to an actor friend in Europe who has been in a 100's of Shakespeare plays, but I am terribly disappointed by this game and the seller. The game is complicated too.

I've played the set through 3-4 times and haven't ever raced to pick up the remote and skip a track.

The book's character Tim was kind of a jerk in one part why *SPOILER* when Tim and Sam's father was being harassed by a militia while Sam was at home visiting, Tim took Sam's gun to give to the militia (which is what they wanted), Sam chased him down and Tim threatened to shoot Sam, but when Sam was captured Tim runs away, come on, really what kind of brother is he, so as you can see this book sounds so exciting. But thats about it it's actually really boring and mainly about how he works with his parents and is really boring"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Brother Sam Is Dead","review":"I enjoyed this book alot. It was easy to get into the story and the characters were very defined. I learned quite a bit about the revolution and i liked the story line.

But seriously, it's quite obvious that the point of this book is to teach kids that the revolutionaries were bad too. That may be true, but kids should be learning the rules, not the exceptions. Let them learn the nuances and the exceptions later. On the other hand, if you are of the crowd that thinks that bad Americans was, and is, the rule (e.g. the NEA), than you will love this book. If you want your kids to think the American cause was basically good and noble, let them read this book when they're older."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Brother Sam Is Dead: Picking Sides","review":"Tim is just a boy with a very bright future depending on his decisions right now in his life.

It's about a little boy named Timothy Meeker, and his hardships and adventures during the Revolutionary War. This book has accurate information on who was there, and if that place was there. The book is focused around the small town of Redding, Connecticut. It including the names of real Continental Officers, and even some real people of lesser significance.

It showed what time was like back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"My Brother Sam Is Dead\\" is 1 of the greatest books ever.","review":"This book is a book that teaches young readers a little bit about the revolutionary war. It is a book that teaches young children the history of how our country became separate from England. It is also a great piece of literature that should not be banned because of a few bad pieces. Children need to learn about the war and even if people die it is still a great book for children. The death is not a problem in this book because even a child knows people die in wars. The trial which resulted in Sam's death was a bit to graphic and descriptive but it is only one small part. When in books like star wars deaths are a lot mor descriptive than that small part of the book \\"My Brother Sam Is Dead\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entire plot is a hole.","review":"This book is terrible. The main plot (that is the brother's death) consists of nothing but a giant plot hole.Sam gets executed for stealing cattle. Which he not only didn't do, there is no way anyone could have thought he actually did, since, due to his father's disappearance and presumed death, the cattle in question were actually Sam's property anyway. It is legally impossible to steal something you own. The idea that someone supposedly excellent at rhetoric as Sam was claimed to be would fail to mention this when he's up for execution is ridiculous."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book was great","review":"This book was great! It is filled with true and real facts but it is also a great plot and a page turner. My only problem with this book is that the chapters are really long. This story is so detailed and descriptive. It teaches you all about life during the revoultion. You learn to know the characters and the family so well that when the chapter is over, and the chapters always leave you thinking, you have to read on. I would defently recomend this book for reading with a group or by yourself. I think that you will enjoy it more with a group because it has a lot of things to talk about and discus. Read this book if you want plot, conflict, information, and a great story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A family in the Cival War","review":"I had to read this book because we were learning about the Civil War at school. I will tell you two things about why I liked about the book and two things about what I didn't like about the book.I liked this book because it made me understand that a lot of people died in the Cival War just to make America a free country. I liked the book because it teaches you the importance of forgiveness. Tim is a boy in the book who forgave his brother, Sam for running away and left Tim doing all the work in the family tavern. Tim forgave his brother because he knew he was doing the right thing.The parts of the book I didn't like were the ending and that Sam had to fight in the army for three years and he was acused of stealing cattle. He did not do it but was found guilty and was executed. I didn't like the ending because he just died and the book was over. I would have liked if Tim would have gone back home to see how his mother would have reacted to the news."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book was about the Revolutionary war.","review":"I read the book My Brother Sam is Dead in my 7/8 English class. The story was about the Revolutionary War. The setting was right for the story because the book told me so much about what the war was like and when it took place. There is a boy telling the story named Tim. Tim was undecided whether he was a Loyalist or a Patriot. His dad is a Loyalist but his older brother Sam fought for the Patriots. I liked the book because it told me so much about the war and how it came up. The book told me what a Cowboy was back then, and what the different sides were. I like history of wars and what the colonies were like. The ending was unexpected but made the book a surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Brother Sam is Dead","review":"If you are looking for a good adventure the James Lincoln and Christopher Collier's book My Brother Sam is Dead would be a great choice. It would a great choice if you liked action and war stories because it is about the Revolutionary War. In the book there is a lot of blood.

I would recommend this book because it is a fantastic book."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Brother Sam is Dead","review":"My Brother Sam is Dead is a book that I probably would not have read out of the classroom, It is an okay book if you are interested in learning about some events of the Revolutionary War, but sometimes the story can drag a little bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Book","review":"This book was very well-written. The action was, though graphic, very descriptive. The accuracy and description of how they would have actually lived in Colonial times was amazing. The author's use of true facts and historical characters helped me with my History class. I liked how the Collier brothers worded the story modernly, so that you could understand what they were saying. I overall liked the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than a History Textbook","review":"This is a book that is pretty good but could used a little more combat action. I didn't think Sam was going to die in the way that he did. I liked learning about the way everything happened during a normal day in the war, like no food and sleep.Overall it was not the best book I have read, but it wasn't all bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Brother Sam Is Dead Review","review":"This book was very sad, and was filled with dying and bloodshed. Tim Meeker lived an ordinary life until war came to his town. His family suffered great losses from the Revolutionary War, and his family is caught in the middle of the war. I disliked this book. It was too gory. If you like action books you may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!!","review":"I had to read this book for a college class, and what a powerful book! This story revolves Tim Meeker, who's brother Sam goes to fight the Revoutionary War. This is also a story on a family and a town torn apart. Some want to fight aganist the King, and others on the town (and the Meeker family) are aganist the King. What makes this story so powerful, is that it's focus isn't on the war itself, but the families that are left behind. WHen a someone fights in a war, they put their life on the line for their country. Then a death has some honor. Well for Sam, this was not so. I won't say how and why Sam had to die, but it was void of honor. This powerful novel will also show the reader what happens to the innocent people. My Brother Sam is Dead also shows what our soilders did, who were considered the \\"good guys\\". This is a powerful read and I highly suggest this book. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Brother Sam is Dead-An 8th grader's veiw","review":"This novel was a pretty good read. I would recommend it for readers 11 and above. Mild language is spread throughout the book. I was upset after reading about the horrors and brutality of the war, and so i believe thatit should not be read by children of a delicate age.Teenagers are most likely to enjoy this novel because of their relation to the character. I know that I could relate to Tim Meeker when he grumbled about his parents, brother, and chores.The plot is very attention-grabbing. It was definently a page turner. The novel's plot focuses mainly on Tim Meeker struggling to adapt to his life. He begins to mature after losing his father, and after his brother leaves for the war against his father's wishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignores the Reason for the Revolution","review":"The authors fail to understand the reasons for the American Revolution. They illustrate some of the conflicting views of the times and the hardships and tragedies of war, but ignore the fundamental issue of the colonists being denied the \\"Rights of Englishmen.\\"The colonists thought of themselves as Englishmen, and many in England agreed, but the king and parliament refused to grant them a voice in laws governing them from England - even though they had local governments for many things.At some point people must stand up and fight for their freedoms.

I have heard about this book since I was a child, and I finally read it as an adult. I wanted desperatly to give this book a 5-star rating; however, in places, I found it predictable and just a little contrived. The 4-star rating I gave the book is certainly enough that I would without hesitation recommend it to other readers; it is still an excellent story of this turbulent time, and provides some disturbing food for thought about the effects the war had on individual people.

There are sign-ups for joining the war. Sam signs up without asking his folks and tells them later at dinner. James Lincoln Collier writes are always to teach a lesson. In My Brother Sam is Dead the author teaches Sam a lesson to join the army. When the Lobsterbacks found him in a tent they shot him.

It becomes an action flick when Australia is invaded and the characters have to fight to survive.It is a satisfying coming of age story but spends too much time developing characters (done well) to be a great action flick.I am also a fan of Red Dawn, but thought this movie was much better.If you are a fan of the young adult series Tomorrow When the War Began know that this movie fits the first book quite well and thoroughly sets the scene for a sequel (or nine).

It's the story of seven teenagers who go camping in the Australian outback and come out to find their town and the country itself have been taken over by an invading foreign army. After overcoming their initial shock they decide to fight back. The acting was well done with a few stand-outs, and the story which follows the books fairly well, is strong with emotion and action.

But I'm also immersed in the subject, having spent the last four years of my life bringing George White's story to readers. George White was a fascinating man, but one about whom little is known today: the first African American to serve in Congress in the 20th century (retiring in 1901) and the last of 22 to serve from the South after the Civil War until the 1970s. He was a stalwart Republican, and served alone in the Congress for four years. But he was more than a token--an accomplished teacher, lawyer, prosecutor, developer and banker. He deserves to be studied in depth; my attempt is the baseline, a painstakingly drawn outline, based on a careful study of limited evidence. Judge for yourself--and then place him in his rightful position in our history, as the intriguing, honest, flawed but eminently admirable individual he was. I recommend him--and this book--highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic book on a widely unknown great in US history","review":"This book was a fantastic beginning to research on a man largely ignored by American history.

If you are new to the subject matter its a quick way to see \\"what there is out there\\", for the expert the detail is there in full.But this is no tutorial, examples are minimal - so if you are learning HTML this is the book for you but NOT the only book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference!","review":"This book is a great reference! I've been looking for some time for a book where I can flip through the pages, find the tag I need, and get its attributes, w/o having to dig through tutorials, looking up basic in one part of the book, and advanced items in another part. I will definitely get a lot of use out of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book I use","review":"I wanted an HTML handbook, not a textbook, something to give me the format and options for each command. This is it.The organization couldn't be clearer: the bulk of the book is the complete list of HTML directives, in alphabetical order. It also includes indices of names for special characters and colors. There's a lot of compatibility information, too, regarding both HTML versions and browser incompatibilities.The \\"Examples\\" section is weak, and seems to assume a knowledge of SGML beyond what HTML really requires. It's also vague about specifics of style directives, and the relationship of HTML to CSS or embedded scripts. Other books fill those gaps, though. This book works as just one in a more complete library for web-page writers, and that's just fine.There are better books to learn from, but this is the best I've seen for supporting experienced HTML users."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a book to learn HTML, but an every day reference","review":"This isn't absolutely a book to learn HTML. It's not very useful at that. But when you know HTML and you need a place where to get quickly precise and complete information on every HTML tag, this is the best. Differently from many huge trash books (like the xyz bible...), it's small, simple, complete, easy to read, ant it will leave some free space on your desk. I'm using it every time I need to make an HTML page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Read","review":"This book was poorly written. There was no real plot, just one crazy story after another.What a complete waste of time. When I was finished with the book, I left it on the train I was taking. I didn't want anything to do with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"Bronson doesn't seem to have much of a desire to penetrate the multiple layers of hype and expose what's underneath. Instead, he seems quite content to lap up whatever his favored VC buddies dish out to him, and is just grateful for the opportunity to be part of the scene. His writing has that annoying Wired hipsterish feel to it. It's a good thing he got this book out when he did, because the new Michael Lewis book totally blows it away. If you thought Po had any depth at all, reading Lewis's book will cure you of that misconception."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dissapointing","review":"I knew that Po did not truly understand silicon valley when he tried to say that San Francisco is part of the valley.According to Po, everyone in the valley is on mega doses of coffee, have no friends and have no life outside of work.I live in the valley, and work in a former start-up company and I will admit some of the things in the book are worth reading, but most of the stories are over-cliched.I was on a 10 hour flight and I found it was better to watch the clouds than continue with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall feel of the Valley is captured","review":"Having read several reviews complaining about lack of accuracy in a few small areas, I felt compelled to write this review. Granted I have only recently moved to the Valley, but reading The Nudist on the Late Shift primed me for what was in store. The main focus book, like that of the Valley, was on the technology industry. Since that is my chosen field this book had particular relevance to me. The story detailing the lives of several new migrants to the Bay Area and that of the experienced software consultants were not only accurate reflections of the way things can be here, but also managed to be truly entertaining. I would heartily recommend this book for anyone in the technology industry or those who are thinking of moving to the Valley. Well done, Po."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent reflections of silicon valley cyberdomainia!","review":"From personal tales of idea driven IPO startups to the polished,cured,and embedded technoentrepreneurs, Po Bronson takes the garland he deserves: the poets crown. His marvelous writing style is both spontaneously funny and enduring. The denouements are emotional body slams, but what sweet victory to the winners. I was truly sad that I finished the last page. Please write a sequel Po. Do it again \\"Po\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep it on your desk and read it often","review":"I am a avid reader of the articles of Po Bronson and a regular visitor to Whether you are in Silicon Valley or outside, it is a great tale and fun to read. I am sure it will affect more people and increase even more, the magic and charm of \\"The Silicon Valley\\".It is a collection of stories and my favorities are 1(The newcomers), 3(The entrepreneur) and 8 (Is the revolution! over?) You might find these over the net or on various magazine, but this books expands the audiences these stories can reach and is also a very good collection.Buy it, read it and then keep it on your desk and read it often."},{"rating":"2","title":"This reader is waiting for the next novel - fiction, please!","review":"Po Bronson is a very good (young) writer. I saw him once speak in a library with Kara Swisher (AOL.com) and Gary Rivlin (The Plot to Get Bill Gates)on their July 1999 Bleeding Edge Tour and he talked about the pains he takes to write and re-write chapters and even sentences (he revealed this information along with a description that he does his writing locked in a small closet at his cubicle in some writer's collective where he works).This care and effort comes through in this book, however, and I for one will support his artistic effort by buying his book(s) and looking for his name in Wired and otherwise following his career, at least until some other writer grabs my attention. If Bronson wants to transcend the \\"hunk-appeal\\" label mentioned by the reviewer above, however, (and he does have that appeal), my humble opinion is that he should eventually go back to fiction in the tradition of the great novelists. Keep On!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny and fresh look of Silicon Valley","review":"The book is very entertaining to read and has a \\"fiction\\" tone throughout the book. Po did a great job to portrait variety of characters in Silicon Valley, successors and failures alike. I was laughing out loud (created a few funny looks from fellow passengers) and could not put it down.The book is also very edcucational revealing behind the scenes from startups to IPO, though I would not use the book for my businees practice. Highly recommend it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to move back to Silicon Valley","review":"I lived in SV before the boom, in the mid 1980's and after reading this book, I am ready to go back!!!I really enjoyed Bronson's writing style. His descriptions and stories of the people who make up the book seemed pretty believable to me. I currently work in IT field in the midwest, but ground zero of the IT world is the SF pennisula. It is the computer geek's Mecca - our holy land. (at least for me it is - it's the center of the computer universe - but I'm biased).I think that this book is pretty accurate and will inspire a lot of people to take that risk, and try to hit it big. I know that after I finished the book I started brainstorming and writing down my ideas! - I am ready to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WIRED subscribers stay away","review":"Nearly 2/3 of this book has already appeared in article form on the pages of WIRED over the last 18 months. Some of these articles/chapters feel force-fit into the book just to fatten it up. Give the four stars if it's not your 2nd time around. Po, you owe me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Available used & new from $0.69\\"","review":"That's what [Amazon.com] tells me when I pull up this book. And that's pretty much all you need to know. Bronson's book (which, in fact, is not a book but rather simply a bound copy of articles you've probably already read before) is like a rapidly-decaying museum piece. More than any other, Bronson is symptomatic of the superficial, stargazing writer who glommed on to the Silicon Valley late-90s, Internet-fueled craze as a way of elevating himself from his former persona. [In this case, 'bond salesman.']Read Michael Lewis' \\"The New New Thing\\" instead for a definitive account of the same era. Compared to Lewis, Bronson is typing with boxing gloves on. It's been all downhill since 'Bombardiers.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not intersting at all","review":"I thought it will be a great one. that's the problem with buying books from Internet. I may never again buy unknown books from Net. If I had browsed in a store, i certainly would not have purchased this book. Interesting characters, the book is very dull.Should have pictures and be catchy. You have wade through all junk to get to the interesteing facts. Seems he wanted to increase the number of pages with less facts/ Read in a library only/"},{"rating":"2","title":"A snapshot of the valley","review":"This book contains many wonderful anecdotes and odd characters. Definitely worth reading, but I'd say Po Bronson should have included more analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I've greatly enjoyed Bronson's other books; which made reading this book an even greater disappointment.He attempts to provide you with a real feel of what goes on within Sillicon Valley. In my opinion; he only suceeded in giving you the same shallow techie-hype that you can find in a few token magazine articles. Nothing revealing here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not terribly interesting","review":"The first few chapters were compelling, humorous and downright thoughtful. After that, the format became a bit tired. The characters portrayed here are homogenized to the point that you find the same story repeating itself, over and over. It just became boring after a while. Read the first two or three chapters and enjoy. From there, proceed with caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precious and Pretentious","review":"Po Bronson is capable of top-quality work. His novel, \\"The First $20 Million...\\" showed that. \\"Nudist on the Late Shift\\" is well-written enough. But it is so full of boosterism about the Silicon Valley and so lacking in skepticism that this book amounts to a 300-page press release. As for the book's comparisons of Mr. Bronson to Tom Wolfe and Ken Kesey, I can only say that it is wishful thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original Battlestar Galactica Starbuck","review":"The articulation on the action figure is clear and well done; Joyride Studios didn't shirk on the details. As a new school Battlestar Galactica fan, I wanted to get my old school on with the original series and this Lieutenant Starbuck action figure is the perfect sized display for a desk.I recommend this product for adult collectors and fans for either the original or 2004-2009 new series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endurance","review":"The harrowing story of the ill-fated Endurance, now in paperback.In August 1914, Ernest Shackleton and 27 men sailed from England in an attempt to become the first team of explorers to cross Antarctica from one side to the other. Five months later and still 100 miles from land, their ship, Endurance, became trapped in ice. The expedition survived another five months camping on ice floes, followed by a perilous journey through stormy seas to remote and unvisited Elephant Island. In a dramatic climax to this amazing survival story, Shackleton and five others navigated 800 miles of treacherous open ocean in a 20-foot boat to fetch a rescue ship.Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World vividly re-creates one of the most extraordinary adventure stories in history. Jennifer Armstrong narrates this unbelievable story with vigor, an eye for detail, and an appreciation of the marvelous leadership of Shackleton, who brought home every one of his men alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story! I couldn't stop reading it!","review":"I began reading this book while quite tired one evening, but found I couldn't put it down! Shackleton and his crew find themselves in one horrible predicament after another, yet all 28 men manage to miraculously survive! The photographs from the original voyage are incredible! A definite must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World","review":"Shipwreck at the bottom of the world was a very interesting book. I learned a lot about how it is hard to be part of a ships crew. I also learned about how cold the world really is and how to survive.

I would strongly recomend this book and give it a four out of five rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad book","review":"This book was not as indicated on the description. It has been used for a college class and was written in on multiple pages. Seller did offer to have me return it but at my cost. I kept it but it is worthless to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING:BORING","review":"My grandfather's friend's sister's husband's cousin was part of the crew on the Endurance and I think that this book is mocking the journey to Antarctica. He cried every night thinking about his trip, and I know he would have been disappointed and offended when this book came out. First of all, the writer acts as though he/she was actually there. Second, it makes the tough journey seem boring, and third of all, Mrs. Chippy was not shot for his own good--he was murdered in cold blood! I sincerely hope you find my review helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World","review":"This story was one of the worst books I have ever read.

If I could get my $1.50 back, I would. For starters, the grammar is terrible. The commas are either misplaced or non existent, which I guess could be excused due to artistic license. But the editors didn't even bother to catch elementary spelling mistakes.As for the story, I was bored. The author seemed to fall in love with every man she came into contact with in that decade. I was rather disgusted with reading about her repeated attempts to please men who practically raped her. I recommend burning any copies of this book you find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Yet another book full of whining, navel-gazing, self-centered Boomer pap...when are publishers going to quit churning this stuff out?

This book has been so much fun because I can easily start to make adorable gifts for my nephew, friends, and family with just these basic skills. The instructions are easy to follow, and the pictures are wonderful and very colorful. The patterns are also flexible- you can double the dimensions to make larger animals or halve them to make tinier ones. You can also stuff the animals with whatever you want- some ideas I have include potpurri to make sachet animals or catnip to make cat toys. I've only just begun working with this book but can't wait to make a whole knitting menagerie! I really enjoy this book because it is very easy to follow and other craft books I have seen can be complicated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love the toys!","review":"I made the snake in lime green with maroon rings between the pieces as requested by my six year old grandson. It was about seven feet long. It turned out very good. I put small beads between two plastic spoons (the cup part) taped together in the tail to make it rattle. He loved it.I found the instructions were very good. I didn't worry about needle size or gauge. It's a toy snake. It doesn't matter.I purchased the yarn to make the monkey and now have lost my book.

It doesn't get much better on cd either. Save your $15.One important note; Baboon nut-job drummer Steven Barnett used to post several reviews here on Amazon. Full of anti-female commentary, anger at anyone with 'intellectual' aspirations and chock full of outbursts that speak of serious impulse control problems [see his explosion of anger over Scorsese's The Band DVD wide-screen issue].Unfortunately, in a fit of rage [apparently not uncommon], he demanded Amazon pull his reviews after a reviewer hilariously shadowed his 'work' with humorous commentary on his penchant for filipina mail order brides.Steven Barnett's Amazon.com reviews were a horrible window into the hate-filled rantings of an anti-feminist, right-wing mysoginistic pseudo-intellect ranting against anyone aspiring to intellectualism and 'lurning' of any kind.

Crying at 3 in the morning, nibbling on my shoes, screaming all the time. It all has changed after I got this book! Now she cries whenever I get up (around 8) instead of 3 am, very minimal nibbling, and she even learned how to sit! Definitely a must have book for first timers like me!

What a fantastic concert!! A consummate performer, she is all about the music. Audio is excellent as is video. Lighting is superb. I agree with the reviewer who said: 'demo disc quality'. It is evident that some guiding hand controlled a whole lot in this concert to this smallest detail from the small subdued audience to the outdoor lighting behind the strings. I think it could have benefitted from more audience spontaneity, or are Brits just that much more reserved than we?Why only 4 stars? Not possible to give 4.5. I take .5 point off for what has been missing in many concert BDs. Nowhere in the case is there a listing of songs! One has to click the 'pop up menu' and scan the list up a menu line or two. Also, nowhere on the disc that I can find is there information about the song (e.g the writer, or which CD it appeared on).

Gigantic sound stage, especially when string section joins in. Vocal recording is dry with incredible nuance. You could literally hear her whisper above the full band & orchestra. Demo disc quality. Video is a little soft compared to, say, a nature documentary, but is basically crystal clear. Performance features stunning vocals & a very talented band. You probably either hate or love KD Lang but even home theater enthusiasts who are not into her music should consider owning this disc. This is a new standard for blu-ray concerts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purely enjoyable","review":"You need to be a fan of kd Lang's voice, and if you are. YOU MUST OWN THIS. The music is wonderful, her performance flawless, the visuals relaxing and as close as you could be to actually joining the gang at the church in London where this was filmed. It shows off her incredible talents and will also show off the talents of your blu-ray and sound system.

Pour some wine, turn off the phone and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfection","review":"k.d. Lang's performance is just perfect and the orchestration beautifully compliments her voice and the band. There isn't a more expressive,clear,pitch perfect voice in pop music today. She effortlessly eases through songs from all stages of her career but her Canadian compatriots' compositions are some the concert highlights. Helpless by N. Young and L. Cohen's - Hallelujah are so moving her performance will bring tears to your eyes. Whatever type of music you listen to you would be hard pressed to find a more wonderful way to spend 90 minutes.

Yes, I'm referring to the dreaded \\"Home From The Sea\\".Magnum is a guy show and most of us watch it for the action, fun, a few laughs and the occasional good looking chick... guy stuff. Home From The Sea (HFTS) is none of these. Higgins would describe it as \\"a dragged out, tear jerking exercise in boredom that should only be used as a treatment for insomnia\\". Maybe you like that kind of stuff and there is nothing wrong with that. If you're the kind of guy that enjoys \\"The Lifetime Channel\\" then HFTS will probably fit the bill for you.

Magnum may be the best show around, but ripping people off by selling low-grade DVDs is totally unacceptable. This 4th season DVd is even worse than the previous ones I bought, with numerous defects appearing. Luckily, I have a special CD/DVD Repairer kit which can eliminate defects in most cases, but I have to use the equipment at least once or twice a month for really shoddy DVDs like this season of Magnum.All in all, I'm disgusted by the owners/producers for betraying TV fans in this way. It's ridiculous that a smaller TV show like \\"I Dream Of Jeannie\\" or \\"Tropical Heat\\" can actually provide better-quality 1-sided DVDs whereas a big studio can't even provide special features and interviews let alone good-quality DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"Nostalgic value and great scenery.

The cast and crew in my opinion set the bar pretty high, with superb writing, directing and acting. Each day that I'm allowed to return to Hawaii and crack the hot case with Tom, it takes me back to a time where you knew who the good guys were, black was still black and white was white, none of this grey business.

If you try to use it before the grinder is dry, it gets clogged.The only GOOD thing Cuisinart makes is their food processor, which has been essentially unchanged for years.

Yesterday, all of the lights went on, but it would not start until I unplugged it and plugged it back in. Today, it won't start at all, no matter what I do to it.

Within 8 months the clock stopped functioning, so it no longer turned the pot on at preset times; within 10 months the spout started dripping coffee whenever I poured a cup.

Cleaning is complicated, and it is difficult keeping the water reservoir clean. However, the biggest problem is that there are NO REPLACEMENT parts available. I dropped the grinder/basket and the spring loaded mechanism broke. Cuisinart will not replace that part; therefore, I can't fix the coffee pot and I have lost my $$$ investment. What a shame. I'll not purchase Quisinart products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your time!!","review":"I purchased this piece of equipement as a Christmas gift. Mistake! While it does make a good cup of coffee the clean up far out-weighs the enjoyment of a cup of coffee.There are five pieces to remove and clean after every use! Who needs it. After a month of ownership we no longer wanted to use it due to the agrevation of the inevitable mess. Our neighbor has a Melita MEMB1B where the basket and mill are one unit and it's great. The Cuisinart's parts are very week as well. Our lid latch broke which meant we now had an elastic band holding our $100.00+ coffee maker together in order for it to brew. Needless to say this product was returned to the store a month and a half after purchase.I'm now giong to purchase the Melita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger is not always better","review":"You're much better off purchasing a simple coffee pot and a separate grinder. You have no choice of grinds and it is a wet mess when finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cuisinart DBG300 Automatic Grind and Brew 10-Cup Coffeemaker","review":"I didn't like how much space it took up on my counter. People always told me how good my coffee is. I bought this because I liked the concept of grinding, brewing, automatic timer, etc. Didn't like the coffee taste, it tasted like plastic. Even after awhile, it still tasted like plastic. I went back to my Farberware pot (makes a wonderful cup of coffee). P.S. They sell it on Amazon.com. The grinder was very noisy, especially when the kids were sleeping in the morning. I also didn't like the beans that didn't grind up in the coffee water reservoir. Also, even if you put a coffee filter in the gold basket, the cleanup was grinds everywhere inside. I sold mine used on Amazon.com. I am glad I sold it before I got stuck with it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great So Far","review":"I just received this coffee maker about a week ago. Six pots of coffee later I have no complaints. The clean up is a bit different, but not really a pain. The resulting coffee is far better than my previous coffee maker. Best of all, the price was right. I received it free as part of a Gevalia promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and doesn't last long","review":"We've had ours for a couple of years. It brews good coffee, but the grinder is very loud. It didn't come with a permanent filter, we had to buy our own. And it has broken twice on us: the latch on the cover broke within a couple of months the first time, and now after another 2 years is broken again. (Without the latch to click it in place, it refuses to brew, so it is an important part.) The carafe cover also broke off on us (little tabs broke), and the part that allows placing the brewing on hold also broke on us. I recommend against buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak coffee, hard to clean, not durable","review":"The design is such that you do not get maximum taste from the coffee beans.

I got a Melitta coffeemaker to replace it and the coffee tastes much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems with Grind & Brew!","review":"I have replaced it twice....1st one stopped working after a month; Macy's took it back & replaced it. The second one the same thing after 3 months; but Macys said I had to contact Cuisinart I packed it up & mailed it back for a replacement. Two weeks ago the grinder basket broke & leaked coffee all over the counter. Emailed Cuisinart & they sent me a new grinder/basket. Now the digital clock is going out (only can see part of the numbers) It makes GREAT coffee but should last LONGER than a few months!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made","review":"I have purchased 2 and will not buy a third.

This is the most annoying coffee maker I've ever owned. Not only was the chute constantly gummed up with damp coffee grounds, it was maddening trying to pull out the MANY parts to clean it. I felt like I needed a pair of pliers to pull it apart. Nothing was easy. Boo. Hiss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suddenly, it died!!!","review":"I bought this coffeemaker in January 2000.

We also grind the beans ourselves each night. It looks nice sitting in its special place on the kitchen counter. After awhile, we noticed that our formica countertop bubbled up underneath it caused by the heat generated from the coffeemaker. No problem, we set it on a platform. The grinder quit after 6 months. No problem, we bought a coffee grinder and continued. After 1 year the handle came off of the coffee pot. No problem, we bought a replacement coffee pot. Now after 2 years and 2 months the programmable timer quit, meaning that not only did we miss out on coffee when we awoke but, it would not even brew at all. No problem, we bought a Mr. Coffee. Problems solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to Clean","review":"The oversize lid is not detachable making the interior of the machine nearly impossible to clean. The coffee grinder not only sounds like a space shuttle take-off, but gets coffee grounds everywhere, including the water reservoir, which is inaccessible because the lid can't come off, until it broke off. There are four separate parts that have to be cleaned after every use and wet coffee grounds just go everywhere - even get stuck in the tiny spaces in the lid. Whole coffee beans get stuck in the too small to clean spaces around the grinding mechanism. Big Mistake - Definite DO NOT BUY."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I purchased this Cuisinart coffee maker with the idea that I could save time having a machine that could both grind and brew. I followed the directions enclosed with this machine and found that it produced a weak, pallid cup of coffee. Ok, so no problem I just added more coffee beans and less water and so on and so on. What I noticed when I faithfully cleaned the parts of the machine daily is that there was quite a bit of coffee left in the grinder and the screen and that a cup of coffee was now costing me 60% more because of this design/operational flaw. In other words I was having to use 60% more beans in order to produce a strong cup of coffee because much of the bean grind was wasted. So figure it out. With coffee beans costing approx $10-$12 a pound [where I'm at] this coffee maker is nothing but a BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY! I would definitely not recommend this machine to anyone. In fact I'm going to repack it and give it to my hateful brother for Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!","review":"Yesterday, the heating plate started to smoke and probably would have caught on fire if I had not been in the kitchen to pull the plug. It took an additional 5 minutes for the smoking to stop. We've only had this machine 1 1/2 years. Very disappointed! And it is very dangerous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it claims to be","review":"Although this product claims to make coffee equal to what you can buy in coffee houses, I found the coffee to be less than that. In fact, not as good as I make with my old fashioned grinder. It required I use more coffee beans and less water to get even a decent (not great) cup of coffee. The clean up is another story! If you are used to really great coffee at home, steer clear of this product as you will be very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to remove interior parts for cleaning.","review":"Our Cusisinart is about 1 year old. The grind/filter basket is nearly impossible to remove for cleaning (and must be cleaned after every brewing). It appears to get stuck to the grinder motor arm. If the coffee filter is not perfectly placed, many coffee grounds leak into the pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed!","review":"I've had three of these in three years. The first time I had to replace it was my own fault because I didn't realize I'd forgotten to put the filter in until I heard the coffee overflowing and flooding the base, which basically burned out the inner workings. But on all three the grinder cap had scratches from the grinding blade and the small extension that drops down to let the \\"control\\" know it's on there develops cracks to the point that on the last two it nearly broke off. That meant the \\"control\\" would not let the coffee maker turn on. It would just beep as though it didn't have all its parts in place. I did call Cuisinart and they replaced the second one, but why bother with replacing the third when the design and materials are still the same! And on the last one, after a few hours the clock would start blinking to be reset, and I could no longer adjust the temperature setting at all. For the price one pays, it's a piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ease Up Everybody","review":"I'm on my second one in 4 years. I just bought one for my in-laws (I like them, this isn't some cruel punishment!). Yeah, it's kinda loud. Yeah, it's a pain to clean. Yeah, the carafe could be better. No, I don't think i'm using more coffee (just make sure the bean holder is dry). I'm only sorry that Sam's no longer has them for ....It makes a GREAT cup of coffee, and I'm sure the ... models are good, but in my opinion, this thing is a VALUE for what you get for ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll stick with the old faithful Melita Manual Drip","review":"The coffee is too weak, period. The coffee maker is a pain to clean. You cannot adjust the fineness of the grind. Not everyone has the same coffee preferences so the machine should allow for that and it doesn't. I use the machine when relatives come who prefer their coffee on the weak side (watery!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"great coffee but a pain to clean","review":"I bought this coffee maker (reconditioned)six months ago and although it makes very tasty coffee there are some serious design flaws. First, the programming never worked, or I'm too dense to figure it out. Second, the whole contraption--water, grind, brew--is under one lid so the steam gets into the grinder and clogs the thing up each time. Also, there is no way to clean the water container, which gets all kinds of coffee debris in it from the grinder. It says it has a self-clean function but this does nothing as far as I can tell. Also, if you don't have all the parts in perfectly it beeps at you incessantly until you unplug it! Now it won't even make coffee--it just beeps and beeps and beeps and I can't figure out why. So find another grind-and-brew that separates the grinding and brewing functions. I definitely don't recommend this one and I really want some coffee. Reconditioned warranty is only 90 days, alas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it breaks","review":"I've owned the Cuisinart DGB-300 for about two years now.

The grounds would get caked in on all three removal parts and each part needed to be cleaned before using again. I had the product three months and it quit working. The good thing is that when we call Cuisinart's 800 number, they told us to just return the item to the store that we purchased it at and we got our money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad for a warrantee","review":"Unreliable and hard to clean.I took full advantage of the warrantee on this coffeemaker. With a only 6 months of service, the grind mechanism bound and couldn't be removed. Cuisinart replaced under the warrantee (I did have to pay shipping charges!) Less than a year later a repeat performance. Again, I paid shipping and Cuisinart replaced the machine. Well you know what happened! The third one just went in the trash as the warrantee expired two months ago.The machine was always difficult to clean - so know I am online to look at Melita's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great coffee but a huge pain to clean!","review":"We have had this model for over a year and, while it does make good coffee, it is SUCH a pain to clean. You have to remove the entire grinding/ filter mechanism each and every time coffee is made. Also, the grounds somehow wind up going everywhere and the water reservoir must be cleaned at least every 2 or 3 pots in order to keep the grounds out of your water. If I had it to do over again I'd spend the extra money and buy the Capresso machine. My mother has the Capresso and it's much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-par grind & brew","review":"Bought this unit to replace a 12 year old grind & brew that finally died and is no longer available, \\"My Cafe\\" by Toshiba. Disappointed in (a) complicated design, and the large number of parts, and (b) flimsy mechanism of those parts. Have had to have several parts replaced due to breakage during normal cleaning. Additionally, the machine is poorly engineered - the most visible result is a coating of coffee grinds within the interior of the lid area, which requires more cleaning than is necessary. Longing for a well made product like the old Toshiba to replace this one. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certianly Not The Best!","review":"If you are looking for the grinder/brewer, this isn't it! A couple of years ago I purchased another, more expensive, machine of this type for my home and immediately fell in love with the quality of the coffee that it produced. I became so accustomed to the flavor that I decided to purchase one for my office but didn't want to spend a great deal of money on a second machine. Well I guess you get what you pay for, because I have had numerous difficulties with this machine starting about 2 weeks after I began to use it. From a problem with the heating element, to the latch for the top cover, and subsequent erratic problems with the timer/clock display. I was encouraged at first with the quality of the coffee and the simplicity of the setup and operation of the machine. But it didn't last long.

Not bad for 7 years old. I knew that I had to find the same model again.It is so easy to operate and to clean. It brews a great pot of coffee.I also love the program feature.

Anybody who thinks it is hard to clean as never tried cleaning one that makes the coffee in the same spot that it grinds it in! You see, this unit grinds beans then it moves them into a paper filter. What does this mean? Well, when you clean it you are not trying to clean up wet coffee grinds that are not in a filter. My last unit (from QVC) would grind then the water would go over the grinds a make a mess! You could not use a filter b/c the grinder would eat it up. With this one, the grinder stays dry and the wet part is contained in the filter. It's a breeze! If it last a year I will be very happy. We paid $40 for it! Well worth more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Coffeemaker","review":"I bought this coffeemaker for the grind and brew feature. I have always had great luck with Cuisinart until this. Within one week, two of the pieces broke off of the grinding assembly. A tube of crazy glue later it was working again. Cleaning it is another problem. I have the white model which is always requiring a spray down with kitchen cleaner. I put all those little pieces in the dishwasher, but if you need to make 2 pots in a row, you are out of luck unless you want to hand wash and dry them. Next the front latch broke (where the top closes). Nothing a little duct tape didn't take care of! Today was the last straw. The top of the coffeemaker (where you pour the water in) broke off when I opened it. I threw the whole mess in the garbage and was happy to see it go. I would NEVER recommend this machine to anyone. Very, very cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble squared!","review":"The idea of a machine that ground & brewed coffee was too good to resist, and for a while it was fine (althought it's noise scared the heck out of my dog); within the first year the heating element croaked.

First thing to die was the grinder. It's locked up; luckily, you press a button that allows you to make a pot without the grinding.Now, the unit shuts down as soon as the coffee is brewed. It won't keep the warmer on. So, if we don't transfer the coffee to something insulated, it grows cold quickly.

The one we have now doesn't grind anymore, but we just fresh-grind at the store and it still makes great coffee. I think some of the reviewer's make too big of a deal about the cleaning. We make one pot in the morning, shut it off, rinse off parts and leave to air dry overnight. You don't need to wash with soap or dry by hand, etc. We have even brewed many pots right after we rinsed the parts with little drying. Using coffee that was recently ground is a major factor in great coffee. I would recommend this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like to clean???","review":"3 parts to clean, Fllter basket, pot and grinder.

Now to the bad: I found from the start that when you are using the grinder it makes a big mess in the coffee maker. I have to clean each part throughly when finished. The coffee maker of course has steam to build up in it causing the coffee grounds to stick to each and every part of the inside, and it takes awhile to clean all of them. I think when I buy another one that it will be a separate purchase. I will buy a grinder and a coffee maker. As a matter of fact my daughter was wanting both and I bought her two machines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suberb coffee maker","review":"I drink a lot of coffee, simply because I enjoy the flavor. This coffee maker makes excellent coffee, probably one of the best makers I have used. I'm writing this review because most of the other reviews don't tell the whole story. If I use this coffee maker as a regular standard type maker then cleaning is no different than any other. What everyone is talking about for cleaning, is when you use the system to grind beans and make coffee. As the hot water goes through the coffee grounds after it grinds, the steam condenses all through out the system making the residual ground in the grinder wet. So, after making coffee in this manner, it needs to be taken apart and rinsed (a very simple process). If you like coffee then this is a good system for the price. I've had mine for 6 years and I still use it a lot. I also own a Bunn and and a Braun coffee maker and I like this one the best. It's an excellent system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it","review":"Bought the machine 2 years ago now looking for a replacement.

Finally two days ago, it began to brew only appr. three or four cups at a time, desptite how much water you add. Talk about a mess!

To pour a cup of coffee, you MUST stand over the sink, as I have yet to pour from the carafe without spilling or burning myself with hot coffee. Also, I've found the \\"flavor system\\" feature is rather useless, as well. To top it all off, after one year the grinder has stopped working all together.

Very nice thought, but it's the worst coffee maker that we have ever owned.#1)Multiple parts must be cleaned well before each brew - not only the grinds in the basket, but the grinds in the grinder as well as two additional lid pieces. Pain!#2)The beans and grinds get wet with the steam from the hot water, so much so that 1/4 of the grinds remain in the grinder.#3)The grinder leaves whole beans unground, again due to the steam.#4)It's loud, even louder than our burr grinder.#5)It just broke! The little arm that the lid clicks onto to open and close broke. SO, in order to make anything, I have to have something heavy sitting on top of it to click close. Otherwise, it just keeps beeping.Why don't I just toss it? I would, but my son and his girlfriend bought it for us, probably spent a lot of $ that they don't have on it and they come over often enough that I just can't. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding CD","review":"This cd is outstanding.

It's not fair that only because Batman is the game they don't put any efforts to make a fun and interesting game. For example the old Batman & Robin the animated series for the SNES, remember?

I like the zippered area on the side that works well for the various cables that I carry. It has a nice padded area for the computer with a separate smaller case in which a 17\\" notebook computer just fits (I have to turn my HP Pavillion ZD 8000 with the back of the computer up or the pouch won't zip.) It also has a convenient area for stowing of paper, pads, notebooks, etc. On the side opposite where I store cables, there is a pouch designed for airline tickets and a pouch for pens, CD's, etc. The overall design is just what I wanted.

They just wrote songs and that is what it happened to sound like. The focus was on writing and performing original music not on capturing the sound of a genre. The effort came before the result. Citizen Cain are guilty of trying to sound \\"progressive\\" rather than trying to sound like themselves and it comes off as a poor imitation. The result came before the effort.To me \\"progressive\\" means \\"uncompromising originality\\". In trying to sound like Genesis these guys are not at all progressive.

There are a few gems such as E-Pro and Girl, but otherwise most of the songs seem to fall flat without the flair of Odelay or the emotion of Sea Change. Some songs, such as 'Go It Alone' just fall totally flat and leave you sonically underwhelmed.Beck is still a solid enough songcrafter that the album is still fun to listen to and more interesting than most of the stuff you'll see out there, but in this outing he lacks the experimentation and inspiration that made his previous outings so strong. There's nothing you can get from songs like Que Onda Guero and Scarecrow that you can't get from Odelay, but better, and there's nothing you can get from songs like Missing and Earthquake Weather that you can't get from Sea Change, but better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"[beck] saves the best for last , and after that?...","review":"...don't even ask [him.] CLAP HANDS.\\" One of my friends and I have a nearly mirrored appreciation for Beck's past material; yet Guero has us at odds on its strongest/weakest tracks, and a sign of good art at work is inspired debate.The new Odelay?

This is vastly different, not necissarily better than Seachange, but it is pretty much and Ode to Odelay.

If you haven't experienced Beck he is an eclectic genius and downright weird at times but his music reflects the great diversity of his musical influences.

I love every note and lyric from beginning to end. It harkens back to everything that has made Beck, well. . .Beck! It practically oozes Beck-ness. Some of it sounds like Odelay, but I loved Odelay. Some of it sounds like Midnite Vultures, but, again, I loved Midnight Vultures. Some even sounds (vocally) like very early (Police-days) Sting whom I also really like.

At first it didn't sound good but then I realized what a good song it is. I'm hoping to get this album at some point, and I sincerely apologize to any rock lovers for what I've previously said about hating it. I don't now that I've heard this guy. He's a genius.

I think the Dust Brothers did a huge disservice to Beck in even taking on the project; It sounds like the Dust Brothers simply put their sonic stamp on it, with no thought of exploring new directions. For me, the best thing about Beck is how each record is a new departure, but this one leaves me wondering if the Dust Brothers simply pieced together recycled material that didn't make the cut on previous records. Even if they wanted to bring back sounds from the past, that would be fine to some degree if the songs were strong. But they are weak. Very weak on the songwriting. I could only listen to the album about three times before I had to put it away from sheer boredom. Sorry to be so harsh, I know we all make mistakes. But c'mon Beck! Take us in a new diection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guano","review":"I hate to say it, because I love nearly all of Beck's recordings, but for someone who consistently puts out 5 star works this one stinks. After hearing the first track I thought, great another CD where I have to skip the first sing. However, the whole album sounds like one long muddy song so I'm telling you to skip the whole thing. The songs go nowhere, the whole time your wondering why this is being compared to Odelay. The only similarity between the two is in their over-production. In Odelay the production complements the fun attitude. The entire time you listen to Guero you are waiting, expecting the next song to be exciting, but it's not. The album is terribly uninspiring; the lyrics are more unrecognizable than usual, muffled behind a hodgepodge of competing sound. If Beck can no longer write songs that make you want to boogie, then he should stick to the blues. I suppose in his hopes of curbing his TRL fan loss due to Sea Change's melancholy and simplicity, he made an ambiguous bat turd."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ol' beck","review":"I love Beck, he's totally funky and always changing.this is one of his best albums, all of the songs are cool and worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"this is a must to your cd collection listen to it as many times as you want this is great music"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can this man make a bad album for a change?","review":"So it's got nothing new, but really, who cares?

But, upon listening to it, and growing tired of much of it, I've realized something is wrong.It's hard to place, I find myself not caring about the songs, they're not fun anymore. Hell Yes, for instance, reminds me of something that might have been cut from Midnite Vultures for not going anywhere. E-pro reminds me of something kicked out of Odelay for the same reason.

The whole album has a tired and dated, electronically informed sound that only reminds you he'd done all of this before years ago.I didn't find anything offensively miserable, as the whole album sort of grooves along absently. You actually sort of forget you were even listening in the first place after a while. (like the earlier reviewer said) I'm sure we'll begin to see any number of these lazy productions gracing the soundtrack of some car or hipster clothes commercial."},{"rating":"1","title":"one to the other","review":"This is Beck's \\"cruiseship\\" album... if he were relegated to be the stale act on a cruise ship with people wanting to hear Odelay resonate through his hollow Sea Change body...this would be the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with the DVD","review":"This is not about the content of the DVD because I can't access it. I'm on my second copy now and there are clearly problems with the disc. I couldn't get any sound from the DVD-A layer on either disc. The DVD layer would play for a short while on both copies and then all of sudden shut down (usually during the third song). These problems are not the type that are referenced on Beck's site. I have a Pioneer 563 player and have never had any problem with any other DVD-As, including Beck's Sea Change. Looking at the other comments it is obvious that they screwed up - the only question now is whether it is a batch of discs that is the problem or if my player simply can't play these discs. I wouldn't recommend buying this edition until more information is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Step backwards, intentionally","review":"A deliberate step backward, and a deliberate nod to the critical consensus that Odelay is his best work, Guero doesn't sound nearly as fresh as it needs to. Most of the songs sound like leftovers from Odelay, while \\"Broken Drum\\" seems left over from Sea Change. While there is something almost appealing in an iconoclast paddling to the middle of the road, this does not make the record good listening. While just flat derivitive, dull tracks (\\"E-Pro,\\" \\"Scarecrow\\") alternate with a few nice moments (notably the funky, catchy \\"Girl\\") and some perfectly passable, almost interesting songs (\\"Earthquake Weather,\\" \\"Black Tambourine,\\") the primary approach: sound collage, scratching, and grab-bag of styles has not only been done before, and better, but its been done before and better by Beck himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool. Lots of fun.","review":"Guero sounds pretty much like one would expect Beck to sound at this point in his career; in essence, it sounds like Odelay if Odelay had been made after Sea Change. This isn't a fault against the album; in fact, I appreciate how the maturity demonstrated here doesn't dull the fun. \\"Qu�� Onda Guero\\" is a definite highlight, as is the cheerful \\"Girl\\" and opener \\"E-Pro,\\" which sounds roughly like Beck channeling Joan Jett--which works much better than it sounds. This isn't the genre-defying masterpiece that was Odelay, nor is it on par with Beck's opus, Sea Change. But it's /good/ music, dammit, and that doesn't come around every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Beck Is Back","review":"I have heard all kinds of music in my 46 years.\\"Guero\\" reminds me of the music I would play over and over,when I first learned how to use a crummy little record player circa 1966.This new music from Beck is best loved by those of us with vivid imaginations.People who dream technicolor dreams.And people who have stepped on broken glass,just when they thought the day was perfect.The sounds are layered in such a wonderful way,this CD has never sounded the same twice to me.And,yes,I play it over and over.Each time I hear different sounds.Each time I love it a little more.Hey,Beck...it is good to see you smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As someone who has long been hoping for Beck to return to his trippy energetic sound of \\"Mellow Gold\\" and \\"Odelay,\\" I can only say that this CD makes me really appreciate the songwriting artistry of his more low-key releases like \\"Sea Change\\" and \\"Mutations.\\"Maybe he's too old for two turntables and a microphone now. Or maybe he just did such an outstanding job the first time around, it's almost impossible to mine something new from that particular quarry.I dunno. And in all fairness, \\"Guero\\" isn't really that *bad*. There are plenty of songs that are probably catchy enough, if they catch you in the right frame of mind. For me, the highlight is the closing track, \\"Emergency Exit\\". It almost feels like, whew, we've made it to the end of this (obligatory-throwback) album, now we can exhale and loosen up with some sweet slide guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge it by it's own merits...","review":"So many people are complaining about this album because it isn't another Odelay or Sea Change, or that it's just Beck stealing little bits from each of his previous albums. Each Beck album has it's own mood and style, but only a few of the tracks on Guero would really fit in on one of the earlier albums. I couldn't imagine E-pro anywhere else but here on Guero....In my opinion, there's barely a dud track on the album, (except maybe Rental Car, but it has its moments too :) Go It Alone has the coolest groove to it, and Girl is designed to get stuck in your head for days. Guero may not be as revolutionary as Odelay but its full of great songs (how many albums do that nowadays? lol)btw.. WE NEED A BECK B-SIDES COMPILATION!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding! Beck at his finest!","review":"When I first listened to this album I could tell it was a throw-back to his earlier style. Of course he has experimented with other styles and now that that's over it's back to his roots. The infectious grooves of \\"Black Tambourine\\" have played throughtout my mind on numerous occasions. His electronic beats and old school Nintendo-like video game sounds mixed with his mad lyrics are done in such a manner that only the man himself, Beck, could pull off successfully. If you like anything off of \\"Odelay\\" then you should definitely own this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD not compatible with many players","review":"I picked up a new model Sony DVD, SACD, Progressive Scan higher end model last year and it still won't play the disc. Seems like many other people are having issues if you search around the web. Maybe they should be a bit more honest about how incompatible this disc is considering that the Beck site only specifies that only a \\"small percentage\\" are not compatible. Seems more like only a small percentage are actually compatible. CD is pretty good, but paying extra for a defective DVD shadows the good music with anger..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck doing what he does best!","review":"Guero is by far the best Beck album. E-pro is the reason you buy this album, but you stay for the rest. Beck is a musical chef, his primary ingredients are mellow vocals (his wide range is already established), rap, acoustic blues, acoustic rock, and 'classic' rock elements. He throws in pinches of electronica, infectious loops, sampling, and what comes out of the oven is some of the best tasting music garnished with groove. Kick it up a notch, buy this album, and serve it to your friends...."},{"rating":"2","title":"from a long time fan","review":"I was a huge Beck fan back in the days of \\"Odelay\\" and \\"Mellow Gold\\" but had fallen out of the loop a bit with his more recent and mellower releases. When \\"Guero\\" came out, almost every review said how it was more like the earlier albums so I decided that I had to check it out. I do have to say I wasn't expecting too much, but, in the months since I bought this album, it has barely left my cd player! The songs are all really smooth and have amazing grooves. Some of my favorite songs are on the end of the album so make sure you listen past the singles and check out songs like \\"Go It Alone\\" which may very well be my favorite track on the disc. I would recommend this cd to even the most casual of Beck fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"All's well that ends well","review":"I've seen a pre-release screening of Palo Alto.

Each individual's story throughout the night is exciting to follow and I felt like I could really relate to the different characters.

Usually the hall effects makes the recording not to sound like the original cd but alas this is a unique cd in every way. I bought this cd a few months ago and it is the best live recording I have ever listened to. The songs are all very touching as they give you the real picture of Dolly's upbringing. Dolly's parents are in the crowd and she proudly introduces them and narrates some of her daddy's ordeals. Unfortunately I misplaced the cd and all I could find was the cover so I went back to buy it again and alas I found the old one again. In other words I have two of this cd and I will keep them.

Do not buy this book if you want to learn OSPF. It is obvious the Doctor is knowledgable about networking but got railroaded into calling a general text about networking OSPF Design and Implementation the title is VERY misleading.

In fact only 3 of the 13 chapters even focus on OSPF - the remaining 10 chapters discuss other routing protocols and the usual introductory stuff.If you're only trying to pass the CCIE, then this book will probably help.

I found myself keeping track of which I saw more of in each chapter: errors or pages.Oh, and for OSPF... Right off the bat the author launches into a bit-by-bit (literally) examination of all the different packets an OSPF process might generate.

While adults and kids alike will enjoy the stories, this book offers more than that. An introduction discusses what elements American writers changed or added to the traditionally-European genre of the fairy tale. Each story is also followed by a brief introduction to the story's author that mentions what particularly American elements readers can find in the story. I really enjoyed this book on two levels: the enjoyable \\"story-time\\" of listening to the tales, and the analytical thinking-time of the introduction.The only thing that detracts from the audio version of this book is the horrible synthesized music that plays just for a few seconds at the conclusion of each story to mark the end. Fortunately, the reader is excellent and the music goes away quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"VIVA PEPE CARVALHO!","review":"Once again Montalban builds a powerful story around the original figure of Pepe Carvalho, the gourmet, wine loving, eccentric and philosophizing private-eye from Barcelona, Spain. Montalban achieves, once again, a perfect blend of action, unforgettable characters, mystery, politics, sex and cuisine. There isn't anything quite like this in detective literature. A spy-story written by an intellectual for us to enjoy without the guilt. Montalban is a true poet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very solid and almost perfect album that misses somethin","review":"This is a perfectly executed album. There are some great tracks including BURMA, Deadwood, You F***ing Love It, and Bang Bang Your Dead. I recently saw the band twice. They were incredible shows, but predictibly the highlights of the concerts, both from a purely musical perspective and crowd response, were songs by The Libertines. This band really misses the creative edge of Pete Doherty. This band or Barat whichever you wish is incapable of writing a song that could ever approach the brilliance of the Libertines or Doherty's few gems like Albion. But if this album is any indication, there won't be any more Libertines albums and Doherty hasn't proven that he can finish a song that didn't have its roots with the Libertines, so we might as well enjoy this excellent effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's B.U.R.M.A.?","review":"This is my favorite album of the past 2 months. Unfortunatley, I can only say that half the songs are worth listening to and one of those didn't make it to the US version! Three songs into the UK version I was convinced I was listening to the album of the year, the next six bored me to tears. The US version spreads the wealth a bit by moving Doctors and Dealers to the middle of the album but that portion is still the weakest link.Essentials:DeadwoodDoctors+DealersBang BangYou F-ing Love It (not a great song but a welcome change of pace)WonderingB.U.R.M.A.Would have made a fine EP but I suppose it's almost priced like one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay","review":"A few months ago I first listened to the Libertines--and was hooked. I googled them and, to my dismay, found that they had broken up.A few days ago I first listened to Dirty Pretty Things--and was delighted. They sound just like the Libertines, which may be a bad thing for some people but not for me. Here we have the best of the Libertines without Pete Doherty's crackhead singing, and the actual music is much cleaner and well put-together than before. It sounds as if they actually put a little effort into the production and arrangements.I don't know about everyone else, but Dirty Pretty Things is a hell of a lot better than Babyshambles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for 2nd album","review":"I started listening to Brit neo-punk-pop a few years ago and stumbled across this CD in the process. Great all the way through. Beware of frequent f-bombs, hence the warning sticker. 'Bang Bang' is probably the most successful piece on here, but there is a lot more to draw you in. Fans of Libertines, Hard-Fi, Arctic Monkeys, Babyshambles, Franz Ferdinand - - here you go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirty Pretty Things","review":"From start to finish, this is a strong album. Deadwood is the perfect opener for a rock album. Songs like, \\"The Enemy, Gentry Cove and Gin and Milk\\" prove that Carl still has post-Libertine song writing skill. This is a great album for anyone looking to get their ears blown out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eagerly awaited album does not disappoint!","review":"All the hoopla caused by Pete Doherty serves as a distraction as Carl Barat comes up with a solid winner with the rest of the ex-Libertines members.

It is only good for pushing play and stop. The signal always breaks so you can't search. Also it is difficult to select a frame.

Furthermore, as if the responsiveness wasn't bad enough, it started affecting my PS2 controller that was going through the infrared sensor - it would cause the up button (on the D-pad and analog stick) to go up multiple times with every push, rather than just up once (this was very frustrating when trying to use menus on games).

It takes place in Bull Run America in the early 1860's during the civil war. The characters are 12 everyday people durning the civil war that have different stories. I feel the important message in this book is that depending on your role in the war you were treated differently,and you hade a different perspective of the war. Some exeamples of this are:Gidion Adams was a negro trying to hide his race so he could pertisipate in the war.Toby Boice was a 12 year old boy wanting to join the war but was to young so he joined a band playing at the war. My personal opinion on this book is that it is a great book. It was a good book because of the way it was written and the characters. I liked the way it was written because of the way it left you hanging. I liked the characters because you can see how every day people get involved in a war. I recomend this book to anyone who likes the civil war."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Bull Run by Paul Fleischman","review":"Bull run is a book that offers the reader a chance to see the Battle of Bull Run from a variety of perspectives. Paul Fleischman uses journal entries to describe the thoughts of a mother, a soldier, a journalist, a general, a child and many other fictional characters that would have, very likely, been a part of the Battle of Bull Run. The description of the characters and settings paints a picture of what it was like in Virginia during the 1860's. Anyone reading this book may gain an understanding of how ordinary people can be placed in extraordinary circumstances and how these ordinary characters reacted to their circumstances. The short journal entries from the various characters make the book a pleasure to read. This book provides an insight to the Battle of Bull Run in a very interesting, personal and thoughtful manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifth grade review","review":"I was reading a book called Bull Run. Here are some reasons I liked it and didn't like it. One reason why I liked it is because it creates a mental picture In your mind. That shows you how they used to live back then. One reason I did not like it is because I didn't like the blood in the story. A second reason why I liked it is because it's kind of like there telling you about real people. A second reason I don't like it is because I don't really like how they divided it up two pages by two. The last reason I like it is because it's surprising ! The last reason I don't like it is because it's kind of sad because some people die. Thats why you should definitely read this book!!!

I'm sure it is a very good book, but I've grown to loathe it! Looking past my feelings for it, I love the author. I also learned some very interesting facts about the Civil War. Unfortunetly it is written from so many points of view that it gets a little confusing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever","review":"To many characters and the book doesn't have true facts from the Civil War. The book also talks about generals that never existed in real life. It confuses your brain between the real civil war and the civil war in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bull Run After Thought","review":"BRANDON'S AFTER THOUGHT OF THE BOOK... BULL RUN!This is a very interesting novel about the Civil War because it shows different views of things, like war or politics, of the Union and the Confederates. Sometimes some of the entries become intertwined, like when Southern doctors are tending to the sick and they come across a Northern soldier and helps him out. Even when their sides are at war, they still went out of their way to help each other in a time of need. It feels like Paul Fleischman really tried to bring this characters to life with all the different voices. This is a very in depth book for the reason that it describes the action packed fighting where bold men from both sides would fight valiantly. But, after the fights there are gut wrenching details all told as if you are right there, in the field. I think if anyone who wants to read this book shouldn't just read it to themselves, but to someone else, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bull Run","review":"I think the book Bull Run is a great book for upper elementary. I enjoyed the book Bull Run beacause it shares the opinions of 12 different characters I also enjoyed it because it was a fight between the North and the SouthI think the book Bull Run compares a lot with Civil War books. Bull Run is different than other books because it has a persons perspectives from the north and the south. 12 people likea woman, a general and a african american. Bull Run takes place in 1860 in the Civil War days. One of my favorite characters was Toby Boyce because he is a brave drummer boy and a lot of courage. I think the important message was depending on what role you have. There were a lot of roles. All the roles showed that war is made of people each one with there own story. I think the noval by Paul Fleischam was a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent glass, no flares or artifacts","review":"I was using an Quantaray Pro Digital filter and getting green spots from flares even with a hood.

I'm a newbie DSLR guy and I'm really not sure what difference this makes in images; then again I am hard pressed to notice any difference when the IS on the lens itself is on or off.

I returned it for a refund. The original shipping was $7.95. The return shipping was $5.81. Had I bought it straight from Adorama, their shipping would have been $5.00. I'm out $13.76 for shipping on a defective product from a company that has a return policy stating, \\"Please wait 8 days from date we received the package for us to process your return.\\" Also, I question the legality of Amazon's practice of charging credit cards for third-party items when they're ordered and not waiting until they're shipped. The moral? Watch shipping and return policies when you buy a third-party item from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the best for lens protection!","review":"I bought this filter for my Canon Rebel T2i in the hopes of keeping the filter on all the time as a cheap way to protect my lens. I had done EXTENSIVE research into clear/UV filters and had decided that B+W seemed like one of the top filter makers. At first glance, the lens seemed to do the trick, though I thought it seemed a little flimsy. However, after doing many test pictures with and without the filter, I was disappointed at the faint flare (little green reflections or \\"ghosts\\" from lights) that occurred in several shots with the filter. Essentially about half the pictures were ruined by the flare. I ended up buyingHoya 58mm DMC PRO1 Digital Multi-Coated UV (Ultra Violet) Filter.and have ABSOLUTELY no complaints! If anyone is looking for a filter purely for lens protection, I would recommend a Hoya as a good economical filter that won't ruin every single picture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I use it as a protective filter.","review":"Filters.. You either use them or you don't. I personally don't use them unless I'm shooting video. I bought this filter for my 24-70F2.8L to be used as a protective filter and it does a great job.

It blinks when I turn the cap and blinks when I press the button to use the UV light, which is annoying. It does its job at picking up RF, although it stops blinking after a few seconds of picking up a legitimate listening bug. The manual states this only happens with cell phone interference, the light shouldn't stop when there is actual RF you are searching for. Then again the manual is full of misspellings and heavy grammar issues so I didn't pay too much attention to it. 2 stars because it does its job, it writes, if the light isn't blinking when the UV is on you can actually use it to check for counterfeit currency (but most the time its flashing and you cant concentrate), and the RF detection works, it just works poorly. If they got rid of all the extra battery's and brought the price down to $20 then I wouldn't complain.I would recommend this to anybody the ages of 9-12."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Book for Adolescents","review":"This fabulous, comprehensive book is a must see for high school students and their parents. Each chapter contains valuable information pertinent to the high school student's successful transition through adolescence.

In addition, a variety of key adolescent issues, including getting along with teachers, stress management, and other teenage traumas are discussed in an easily digested format.

It is beautifully illustrated, and the concept of telling some of the lesser known stories about our presidents is a good one. However, the authors take this too far by including frequent references to whether a president and his first lady shared a bedroom, affairs, out-of-wedlock children, and alleged homosexuality. These are subjects I don't feel are appropriate for a book aimed at elementary school age children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all true","review":"This book, as stated by a previous reviewer, is not really for younger children. Even worse, it presents rumors as fact . Warren Harding was rumored to have joined the KKK, even though most of the evidence comes from Klan members themselves.

It proved a positive learning experience about taking this stuff as is in the book, however, I wish I had not had to do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Engaging Book about Presidential Private Life","review":"Really good book about the presidents' personal lives, especially in the White House.

I purposely left a spot kind of bubbly just to see if it would dry smooth. It does NOT! (as I'm sure most of us suspected) You need to spend time smoothing it out. Even the spots that I worked at smoothing out dried a little \\"smeary\\", but from a distance you can't tell. You also need to work at getting it in the cracks.It dries quickly. The bottle says to wait about an hour for drying. It also recommends using the whole bottle within 12 months for best results, so it does last a decent amount of time.Overall, this is a decent puzzle conserver(coming from an amateur puzzle conserver)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good - but I might like glue more.","review":"With glue for puzzles I can at least see where I'm putting it. With this spray it was a bit harder to tell. It also has a bit of a strong odor to it (so you might want to make sure you are in a well ventilated room).

Ravensburger puzzles are high quality, therefore if you want to seal the pieces and display the finished product, you can do so with Ravensburger Puzzle conserver.The product is in a plastic bottle, creamy white color, and you can see where it is applied, how much and on what locations of the puzzle. Then, it dries clear. There is a foam applicator attached to the lid. The trick is to make sure you seal all the crevices within the puzzle pieces, otherwise you will have some pieces become loose. Do not apply too thick, spread it evenly. This strong adhesive will dry in good time, under an hour.Some people may tend to use the conserver as they go along with the puzzle, but I would rather not. This is a quality Ravensburger product.. Rizzo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"I wanted to try this because I have a Ravensburger puzzle (the New York Taxi puzzle) that I wanted to frame. It works well and does the job.To use this product you should first place something underneath the puzzle to protect the surface beneath from excess adhesive. You then shake the puzzle conserver and turn it upside down and the adhesive comes out though the sponge. It takes few moments to figure out how much adhesive to apply. The instructions say to make sure sure the crevices are covered. You then wait an hour for it to dry. Once done you need to run the sponge under cold water.This product allows you to lightly apply the adhesive. This is simple to use but like anything new it takes a little adjustment in knowing how much adhesive is enough. I did repeat the process the first time over a couple of spots on my puzzle.Once done I put the puzzle in a frame and hung it on my wall and it looks great."},{"rating":"1","title":"May have to buy something else.","review":"This is difficult to apply as I cannot tell what parts I have gone over.

It has a spongy top to help apply smoothly across the puzzle. It dries clear. I would recommend a couple of coats to make sure that it got completely covered. It does a nice job and dries clear. It allows you to keep and frame a puzzle. After doing all that work, it would be nice to enjoy it for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I love puzzles and anyone who wants to keep the puzzle will need some kind of glue.

Outdoors under cloud or bright indoors works well.Colour quality, grain, smear, etc are all acceptable. Stills are very good with some slight barrel distortion on wide angle.The big failing is the sound. The microphones are virtually useless and I have to almost shout to get any narration recorded while I am filming. Subjects talking to the camera at 1 metre are all but inaudible.

The illustrations are also very beautiful and inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"among most creative ,innovative and Master teachers today..","review":"Studio Techniques by Gary Priester has been the most inspirational corel draw book I have (and I have read many). His ability to teach many skills and techniques in just one of his tutorials is absolutely amazing....His ability to use colors and create truely \\"gem like\\" creations with them has left me with my mouth open more than once! All of this means nothing to me if the person with these abilities lacks teaching skills...and this is where Gary shines above most others.... When you combine \\"Creative Genious\\" with truely great teaching and writing skills you have \\"Studio Techniques..\\" by Gary Priester!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for Corel useres","review":"CorelDRAW is the most powerful illustration package available on the market today. When I teach CorelDRAW classes I am only able to teach the tools, how to use the program. My students frequently ask where do they go from there. I used to say it was limited by their imagination, but now I can direct them to this book. Here are the techniques you can use to go from beginner to power user. If you use DRAW or PHOTOPAINT, you need this book.

FANTASTIC!!!","review":"If you REALLY want to learn how to use the CorelDraw8 suite, this is the one book you MUST have! Gary and Dave have shown how to create complex projects in simple, clear steps that anyone should be able to complete with good results. I have several books on this program and although they are good reference sources, they don't even come close for actually getting in there and showing you how to get your job done. If you follow along with Gary and Dave you'll get results that look like they must have taken weeks instead of minutes to complete. Don't tell your boss! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for serious users","review":"As a certified CorelDRAW instructor, I teach the basics of how to use the tools. Given the power of the program, there are not enough hours in a one or even a two day class to teach what to do with the tools you have learned. This book is the next step. Step by step, the authors show you techniques to produce the images, Gary using DRAW and Dave using PhotoPaint. These well thought out and excellently illustrated exercises give you the next step in becoming an expert user of CorelDRAW. I recommend it to my students as a follow up to the classes I teach. If you are serious about using CorelDRAW as an illustration tool or CorelPHOTOPAINT as a bitmap manipulation tool, get this book. You will never regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but meager","review":"The main problem with this book is not a presentation or knowledge. The book is fine and shows nicely the amenities of Corel's software. The problem is the book costs too much. No CD, no comprehensive approach and still 50 bucks. I think that is too much. However, otherwise the book deserves recommendation. Faced with the meager choice on the book market I begin to understand why is Photoshop so much more popular though as a software it is not an inch better than Photo-Paint.

Also, the exercises are ambiguous, so the course instructor sometimes interprets the requirements differently. The CD contains the exact text of the book, plus audio. Part of the text is presented in sequence, other parts you see in a popup window only if you happen to click on a busy-bee icon. The only use I see for the CD is the search function, which would help to deal with the disorganized presentation of the material. Unfortunately the search returns nothing, or a list of unrelated items. You need to copy the CD to the hard drive to speed up access.

I could see the author put alot of work into it but is not a good instructor. I'm sure he understands C but as for teaching it that is another story. I was hoping it would be good beginner book but in my opinion it is not. It starts off with the basic stuff all right but the author expects you to jump from point a to point g without explaining b,c,d,e, and f. I mean ok sure the first few chapters get you interested and your thinking it's going to teach you the ground work on programming but it falls really short. Then it just jumps into more complicated stuff and the complicated stuff just isn't very good. There are not many examples and I think that is the heart of programming.

It did a very good job teaching me how to write C with very little knowledge of the language. However, there were some things that the author did (and skipped over) that are cleared up in \\"The C Programming Language\\", by Dennis Ritchie. I would definitely recommend this book to someone who doesn't have very much knowledge of C, because the writing style is clear and easy to follow. The author, for the most part, does a great job of explaining difficult concepts in an easy to understand manner; such as linked lists and trees. Once again, I would recommend another book as a follow up, such as \\"Expert C Programming\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe as an introduction, but worthless as a reference","review":"This book does a reasonable job introducing basic C concepts. However, the topics are interspersed with the author's opinions on programming style and process. This makes looking up answers difficult. Furthermore, major language concepts are either glossed over briefly, or left out entirely (e.g. I can find no mention of function pointers). I bought this book expecting something like other O'Reilly titles (a concise and thorough language reference), but I ended up fairly disappointed.

It just lacks subtlety. Not so on The Wire.The show is based to a very high degree on the experiences of police in Baltimore.

Do not mistake this for a typical crime show. You can't just pop in the disc and expect entertainment without investing your full attention. This has the depth and detail of a well-written novel and I find myself watching each episode multiple times to absorb the nuance of the storytelling. I cannot praise this show enough. David Simon has amde a commitment to not dumbing-down his content, but it's a two-way street and you can't expect to catch little snippets of the show and understand what's going on. However, some of those little snippets are worth the price of admission themselves. Also fun to watch considering that two of the leads, Dominic West and Idris Elba are Brits, but they speak Bawlmer-style without a hitch. I have loved the Sopranos from the very first episode, but \\"The Wire\\" may well be the best television ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all in the Game.","review":"Homicide is still the finest cop series of the last 15yrs, but The Wire has to be up there. It's a change from other HBO series like the Soprano's and Six Feet Under in that the story is the thing - The Wire is meticulously plot driven, rather than the obvious familial focus of Sops and SFU. Therein lies the shows appeal and its curse - the viewer needs to give 100% attention to actually follow the game and its players. That is not to say the characters are inconsequential, there are brilliantly flawed people on both sides who are crucial to the story - but not more important than the story. The Shield may be good entertainment and can tell a gritty story - but The Wire values persistance and smarts over pistol whipping and muscle. It is one of the few series to tell both sides of the crime story fairly evenly - hell Deangelo Barksdale is almost a sympathetic character, and poor Wallace - well you'll have to watch to understand - it's all in the Game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I find it hard to believe that this series had a 5 star rating based on the opinions of 252 people. We opened it last night to watch the first episode and basically all we heard was the F word, seriously used by practically every character in almost every other sentence, not to mention many other very crude references. If it has started this way, I have no hope of it improving. In the trash it goes. I wouldn't waste my money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal viewing","review":"Having heard enthusiatic reviews on NPR - usually an unimpeachable source - I looked forward eagerly to watching Series 1, episode 1. I tried it sober; perhaps I should have tried it drunk. Ham acting, cliched backdrops (pole-dancing was an idea already on its last legs before The Sopranos ran it into the ground)and dialogue which may possibly be realistic but certainly is dull. I labored manfully through the whole first episode. I shall not torment myself with a second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most Over Rated Show this side of Greys Anatomy...","review":"HBO has a history of quality programming... Six Feet Under, Deadwood, Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Carnivale to name a few. This is NOT one of those shows. Honestly, the characters in this show are horrid at best. Cliched to the point of sighing out loud while watching alone. I honestly felt like it was a chore to sit through these episodes... This show has the same Dexter-Post-Season 1 fanbase. The show is average at best, yet receives 5-Star reviews across the board. Avoid this and True Blood as well. Both unbelievably overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy anything else","review":"I really disliked this show, i watched the entire first season in two days, i only did so because i was waiting for it to become interesting. After so many glowing reviews, i could not belive how just plain awful this show turned out to be. I would rather watch reruns of Barney Miller, you get the same effect of watching the Wire except with slightly more enjoyment. I know it's not The Shield and it's not supposed to be but i implore you to purchase that series if you want to enjoy a television experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"crass and foul","review":"The language is crass, filthy, and foul. This may represent reality, but I prefer shows that are more uplifting and honorable. Some will find this appealing, but not me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for a friend","review":"I have only watched a couple episodes of The Wire, but my buddy absolutely loves it. He now has the complete first, second, and third seasons.He could probably give a much better review than me, but everything he has told me speaks volumes about this show, and DVD set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best show on television","review":"This is the best show in TV history. It proves that fiction can be the best format for journalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luv it","review":"I luv this show it is great. I thinking is a little expensive but I needed something to watc while away from home and with no wifi signal I had to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally surprised me...","review":"In all honesty, after the pilot, I wasn't too sure I was going to like this series. The pacing was slow and frankly I'm not a big fan of Dominic West. Where are my super cops? A Jack Bauer, a Vic Mackey? But by the third episode, I realize something remarkable. I'm probably watching the most \\"realistic\\" cop show since \\"Homicide\\". West still doesn't tickle any feathers with me, but the supporting cast successfully pulls me into \\"The Game\\"-and what a fascinating game it is. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TV Show!","review":"The show is captivating and very entertaining, the characters are very interesting and real, the plot is the best period. The show takes a hard stand on the social issues in the projects everyday life. The great balance between the good guys and the bad guys is phenomenal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding","review":"I had no interest but my husband convinced me to tune in--I'm so glad I did. It's a highly entertaining and meaningful series executed with spectacular finesse in all respects--the crackling, realistic dialogue, the seamless acting (who are these people?), and the whip-smart plot. I was so taken that I read the book that inspired it all--Homicide by David Simon. It's given me a much greater sense of inner city life and politics (I live in Hartford--apparently it's not so different from Baltimore)."},{"rating":"2","title":"What did the Pope say about \\"The Passion\\"?","review":"Oh, yeah. \\"It is as it was.\\"I live in Baltimore and have to work on the very same streets that the drug dealing takes place. You could move this DVD set to the documentary section. This is the best show on HBO since the first season of \\"The Sopranos\\".These people have done such a fine job with this series; our own \\"Boy Mayor\\" is pulling his hair out at the thought of seeing a 4th season produced.The characters are well rounded and given a depth that is lacking on nearly all television shows produced. And like all great shows and films, they always leave you wanting more.By the way, don't get lost in the Western."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands Down the Best TV show I've ever seen.","review":"This is hands down the best TV show Ive ever seen in my life. It's real, it's gritty, there is real character development, it's unpredictable, and it really makes you think and feel. I love this show. I really don't think anything I can type here will really do it justice. Watch this show or you're truly missing out on something great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Either you'll love it or hate it...","review":"My girlfriend hates this show because it is truthful and portrays a very sad reality of inner city drugs, crime, and politics. For the same reasons, and others, I think it's one of the best shows ever put on television. I agree with most of the other positive reviews, so I won't be repetitive here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing show.","review":"The Wire is a tautly written show that is acted well. This speaks volumes of the ability of the directors, writers as well as the rest of the cast and crew in brining the life of the baltimore police to the screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Study In Finance . . .","review":"Want to see how capitalism works? From the street-level \\"consumer\\" of crack and heroin to the halls of Congress and off-shore accounts, The Wire lays it out for us, through a range of well-developed characters whose lives are gripped by the mechanisms that control the market. A great study in sociology and finance in language we have to learn to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll say it too: the best show on television","review":"Last night, I watched the last episode of the last season of The Wire. I was truly sad that the show had ended. No more McNulty, Bunk, Prop Joe, Bubbles and, yes, even Marlo. After five seasons I feel like I know these people.Other reviewers have commented eloquently on how good this show is. I guess I'll just add that if you're into multi-character shows with long plot arcs, like Lost or Battlestar: Galactica, take a step up and try Season 1 of The Wire. I love those shows, but The Wire is in a different league. You have to be willing to pay attention and invest the time as the multiple, intertwined plots and realistic characterizations unfold, and you won't be spoon-fed a shocking plot twist and/or cliffhanger each week. But you will not see a better television show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice acting but not so exciting","review":"Wanted to like it but just another \\"who dunnit\\". Nothing special. Maybe I should watch a few more episodes but the pilot left me not wanting to see anymore. I felt like I already saw this show when I watched NCIS, CSI NY, CSI Las vegas, BONES, Mentalist, NYPD, Blue, Blood, Cold Case, etc. You see where I am going."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this it? What is all the hype about?","review":"I got the Wire because I thought I was missing the boat on 'the best show on TV'. Well...I must be missing something because after watching 5 episodes I don't get it. I kept thinking it was going to get better..not that it was bad...it just wasn't that interesting. The only reason I kept watching was to see Idris Elba who plays Stringer Bell cause he is a cutie! Other than that, I have no reason or intention of watching any more episodes of the Wire."},{"rating":"2","title":"WATCH THIS SHOW NOW!!","review":"I had seen a couple of episodes of season three and decided to buy season one, start out from the beginning and find out what this show was all about. What I quickly realized was that this one of the best shows I had ever seen. I watch the Shield and I've seen NYPD Blue and Law & Order the CSI's and what I'm saying is that this is easily the best cop show out there. I was unaware of this when I first started watching was that another great Baltimore cop show, Homicide: Life on the Streets, were both created and written by the same guy, David Simon. What is really cool is that they get a lot of fairly unknown actors or even amateurs to play big roles for this show, and that it works. Check this show out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST show on TV right now!!","review":"This is the only show I look forward to seeing every Sunday. If you haven't checked this show out but you have HBO, you're missing out BIG TIME!!! If you don't have HBO, you better get with it and spend that extra $10.00 or whatever it is to add it to your package. HBO has THEE best dramas on TV these days. Get hooked on this show...you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Show on Television","review":"I used to say that Homicide was the best show ever on television until I saw The Wire. Some of the same people are involved in making both shows and both are gritty police dramas set in Baltimore. I have to give the nod to The Wire because it is produced for HBO and the intensity and grittiness are definitely kicked up a few notches.Homicide is available on DVD too, you should watch both great shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I love the wire and enjoyed watching it again. This was one of the greatest shows ever on TV, especially the first season.."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wire","review":"Did we see Hill Street Blues many years ago? Gritty city and personal stories of the characters. When did this become new?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story overshadowed","review":"I was looking for another highly rated series to watch with my boyfriend & The Wire came up. In the past our favorites have been ALIAS, SIX FEET UNDER, DEXTER & THE SOPRANOS. We watched the first 3 or 4 episodes of Season One, hoping to find another \\"winner\\". UGH. For the life of me, I don't get the fascination with the F-WORD!!! What's the deal?? If you have good writers, why do they depend on this word at least 5 times in every sentence? Imagine this: filming a scene & the director calls \\"cut\\" & says \\"You left out 3 F-words\\". To me, this is a sickening word, shows a limited vocabulary & I don't want to hear it over & over & over & over. If that makes me a prude, SO BE IT. It's a sad commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"episode 3 incomplete","review":"The Wire is a great show. The copy I ordered was defective (one episode cut short). Then the next copy was shipped and part of the case was broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same wire i knew","review":"Greetings fellow amazonians I picked this up because I thought it was the documenry about a famous family tightrope walkers. Instead this is a gritty drama about everyday life in baltimore. Why do I care about that? Just because everybody there grows up to be a dope dealer or a pimp doesn't mean I should waste my time watching it. Quite honestly this show is no more inspiring than leave it to beaver was in the 1950's. Amazon please bring back the correct \\"wire\\" so I can enjoy the great tightrope action rather than this mindless drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"for anyone who doesn't like this show","review":"sorry to tarnish this rating with 1 star but people won't read a 5 star review. Anyone who believes this series is too rough around the edges with language or the reality of the situation has to just visit baltimore to find out. I've watched it get better over the last 20 years but there are still places I dont feel comfortable. You 1 star raters that hate this series spend some time down there and watch and listen to \\"actual\\" people living how it is portrayed in the series.... that is all"},{"rating":"1","title":"listen up!","review":"\\"The Wire\\" is why TV was invented. If you haven't seen this show, you haven't seen what real TV can do. Brilliantly written, this \\"novel for television\\" has no peers. Season One will blow you away, and Season Two will break your heart, what's left of it. It's not about cops and drug dealers; it's about America, it's about you and where you live. It's hilarious and deeply moving, unrelenting and uncompromising.Buy this DVD and catch up with \\"The Wire.\\" You'll never be the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just got abused by the language in the pilot. I need a shower.","review":"I purchased the Pilot for The Wire because it came so highly recommended. What a waste of a $1.99. I actually want my money back! I was looking for a new series to watch and I figured how bad could the language be? Bad! Filthy and vile are a few words that come to mind. If you want a great series to watch in the same genre without getting puked on check out LIFE or Breaking Bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely dull show","review":"I have watched 6 episodes of Season 1 and have desperately tried to get into The Wire. Despite the hype, and all the trendies saying what a mahhvellous show it is, actually it is pretty dull. Boring characters, little conflict, confusing scripts, same stuff repeated ad nauseam. Frankly, the lives of petty drug dealers in Baltimore don't do it for me, and not do the cops who are a pretty unattractive bunch with few dramatic qualities. I know that Prison Break was appallingly acted but at least it had a story line. The Wire is like an improvisation at one of those let it all hang out stage schools which never produces particularly great actors."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb show","review":"Probably the best written TV series ever created, with a great cast. Gritty, bleak story about drug trade in Baltimore, depicts the inability of law enforcement and government to stop crime because the egos, power plays, and selfish ambitions of bureaucrats directly hinder the work they are supposed to be doing. Shows crime as a systemic problem where the supposed solution just makes it worse. Interesting, believable dialogue and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instantly hooked","review":"Starts off a little slow, as it seems most HBO series do, but my friends and I were instantly hooked.

All I get are his highschool crushes and such. which aren't too interesting to me. Omarion potrays the break up as everyone going there seperate ways is I believe is far from the truth.It's more like a picture book, with pictures on almost every page. Omarion needs to go through a bit more in life and then consider writting a autobiography. Infact I know he didn't write this all by himself not with SCUM Chris Stokes involved. He's ruined so many artist, and Omarion is just his next target. Thank god the other three boys left because I know everyone has heard of the sexual harrasment issue with T.U.G.

The story should have been a good one - a man on a vengeance trail, roaming the West to kill 7 men who murdered his parents and sister. The author took this promising story line and completely butchered it. The book was total trash. I cannot believe the number of times the hero got shot or stabbed. Every time you turned around he was getting shot up. Not close to being realistic.The author has a most limited vocabulary. There are countless references to varmints, bushwhackers, owlhoots.

It reads like a serial professional wrestling story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thesaurus, the bad, and the ugly!","review":"This book reads like it was written by a high school dropout who posesses a very limited vocabulary.

Suddenly, luckily there just happens to be the info they need on the day they are looking for it! Horrible.) I would like to buy this author a thesaurus so he wouldn't have to use the same words/phrases over and over again until I got bored and stopped reading for the day.If you want bland \\"Saturday Afternoon Action Movie\\" story, dialog, and characters then this is your author, otherwords stick to the nonfiction of the real west, it is much more worthwhile and daring this trite piece of waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor title, but great primer or overview for IT manager","review":"My only substantive criticism of this book is its reluctance to define its audience, and correspondingly, using a title that misrepresents its content.This is a book for a party that has former hands-on experience with a similar technology (e.g., X.500, NDS, LDAP) and needs to manage a Microsoft implementation. Or for a hands-on technician who is new to the technology in general.The author is a former Novell employee and this is the third version of the book, so readers can expect some broad insights and no vendor bigotry. In many sections, one can tell that \\"Server 2003\\" was added to the text via \\"search and replace\\", but it matters little, and Server 2003 was directly addressed in areas where it matters (i.e., global catalog servers, etc.).Architects and implementers should pass on this one, but managers and consultants should pick it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Active Directory book on the market","review":"This is, with no doubt in my mind, the worst book on Active Directory I have seen.

I'm under impression that its author had no practical experience in dealing with any real Active Directory deployment. If you are serious about learning Active Directory from experts, check \\"Mission Critical Active Directory\\" by Jan De Clercq and Micky Balladelli (Digital Press) or \\"Windows 2000 Active Directory\\" by Alistair Lowe-Norris (O'Reilly)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't want a novel.

UNBELIEVABLE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much emphasis on theory, not enough hands on","review":"The beginning of the ninth chapter is over 200 pages into the book and it begins like this. \\"Many people who read reference manuals such as this one often want to start \\"doing\\" right away, rather than read through the explanations until a complete understanding is in place beforetaking any action.\\" Anyone who reads through the first 8 chapters will have become more than just a little impatient at the repetitive and long winded theoretical concepts that could have been scaled down to 2 chapters. Building on a theoritcal foundation is essential. However, way too much time and energy is focused in this area IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Too Conceptual","review":"I bought the book because of the word \\"Mastering\\" in the title. The first five chapters are on X.500, NDS, and NT Domain background. A few hundred more pages guide you with pictures through simple configurations within the mmc. I was expecting more in the way of sysvol, registry, and AD integration into NT Server. I was also hoping for a more detailed guide to AD design and migration... which is probabaly what 98% of Active Directory book buyers want.Next time I'll start with the Windows 2000 Resource Kit first. Most of the answers are there.-=Chris"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to Master...","review":"In my opinon this book is simply theory and it references to often to things you have read ten pages earlier over and over again.

I have been a police officer for 30 years in a midwest college town and through grants I have given this book to about 50 victims of stalking. Those who read it and got back to me thanked me, because the book was a great help to them. I have also encouraged all the police officers I work with to read it. This is an great book to purchase for children who are about to go off to college. This gets my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puts the mind at ease.

I wish I read it a long time ago, and i could have spared me a lot of frustration in my relationships with people. Especially the abusive and controlling relationship I left. It is also helpful to know some red flags to look for to keep me from making the same mistake again. Don't ignore your suspicions of someone.

Information that could save your life.","review":"I think just the fact that this book has over 325 high reviews by a wide of variety of people including law enforcement, psychologists, etc., speaks more loudly than anything I could write here. However, I would like to add my two cents that it is a book with information that could literally save your life. It is interesting, engaging and full of real life stories. A complimentary book for those that are dating isSafe People: How to Find Relationships That Are Good for You and Avoid Those That Aren't. This book has broad-based appeal and something for everyone. In places it gets repetitious, but that is a minor point."},{"rating":"1","title":"deceipt","review":"I paid $21.98 for a paperbook tiny book with print I can't even read.

I have not had a chance to read it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gift of Greed","review":"This book is written by the same self-serving guy who developed a computer program to help profile kids at risk of going berserk in schools. Only problem is, he didn't do any scientific validation of his work. There are steps one needs to follow to prove the reliability and validity of such tools, and he skipped them.Now De Becker wants you to pay him to explain the obvious point that you should listen to your intuition when you think you aren't safe. My intuition tells me that no one's wallet is safe from this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"InStilling Fear is more like it","review":"I hated this book. It may be well written but this is not a gift. This book just makes you more scared to live in this world. If something is going to happen to you it will. If you read books like this you will just be paranoid and be looking around the corner all the time looking for something to happen and then you know what something will happen. Best to leave these kinds of books on the store shelf. Learn the Gift of love instead of fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT COMMENTARY ON HUMAN NATURE - NOT JUST FOR WOMEN","review":"I hesitated to read this book at first, thinking it was entirely about the victimization of women. A friend convinced me it was a good read and once I picked it up, I couldnt put it down. De Becker shows through a series of examples that people have come to ignore the basic human instict of survival. By ignoring fear, we open ourselves to those that would do us harm. Women and Men constantly put themselves in danger all in the name of manners. De Becker shows that it is better to appear rude on occassion that to be a target of violence.The subject matter is captivating. The writing style lends itself to a quick read. De Becker drives home his point with chilling examples rather than bore the reader to tears with meaningless psycho babble. It is an excellent commentary on human nature and the violence that is increasingly permeating into our society. Definately worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for your own protection","review":"Easy to understand, topics are well explained and everyone can relate to it.It reduces unnecessary fear and increases confidence to trust intuition.Depicting interesting stories this book almost reads like a thriller at times without the side effect of creating anxiety, but you certainly want to keep reading.

Information in here every woman should know and at an early age."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well-researched, must-read.","review":"Mr. de Becker does an exquisite job of educating while not forcing. This book grasps you from the moment you open the cover but keeps you reading because through it, you are learning about yourself.As a future FBI profiler this book taught me many skills I hope to use and reinforced the ones that I already knew but didn't have proof of. This book is not new news, it is just presented in a new context.You will be glad you read this book, but most of all you'll be relieved. Relieved that you are an animal and that you have natural instincts. Instincts that provide you with the ability to protect yourself and enable you to live a life free of fear or anxiety."},{"rating":"2","title":"When your safety is at stake, don't try to be nice!","review":"I've lost count of the number of times I've recommended this excellent book. The author's message is of value to everyone, but particularly women, who are still socialized to be \\"nice\\" all the time and are often afraid of being labeled a \\"b*tch.\\" I'm about to recommend this book yet again to my daughter's friend and coworker, who is being stalked by a former retail customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This book is not worth the paper it's written on. The author didn't teach me anything new. The whole book is basically about using your common sense to avoid dangerous encounters. You don't need a 300 page book to realize that. I even question the author's knowledge about today's terrorism threat based on the examples that were used in chapter 6 about suicide bombers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gift of Fear","review":"I found this book hard to read and hard to follow. It seems that it could have said alot more simply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much anti-gun rhetoric I hear...","review":"I'm so glad I've read the reviews here, as I almost bought this book; seems like it may have good thoughts on crime prevention, but...I don't care to read a liberal's rambling about guns causing crime. Guns are tools; if a bad person uses one for evil, it doesn't make the gun evil...the criminal is responsible for his/her actions. It should be noted that guns are the ultimate form of self protection...as the saying goes \\"God created man, Sam Colt made them equal\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The gift of stupidity","review":"This book is nothing more than random foolishness that plays to the insecurities of people, in particular women. Randomly fearing everything is more likely to make you a victim than keep you safe. Basically, provides no insight into how to avoid dangerous situations and people - just focuses on making the reader scared of everyone and every situation. I truly wonder if there is any truth in the stories and scenarios put forth. Mind you, there are lots of Ted Bundy types out there - but this book gave you no guidance on identifying the truly bad folks and providing any survival strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"MATRIARCH PURCHASE","review":"I MADE THIS PURCHASE FOR BOTH MY DAUGHTER AND MY GRAND-DAUGHTER TO AID IN THEIR PERSONAL SAFETY.

In a culture of senseless fear and ignorance of real danger, we all need to know what can TRULY hurt us and what is not likely to. This book is intelligent, sensible, well-documented and profound. It is written by a compassionate man who has advised many administrations on terrorism issues. Ever wondered why women stay with men who are cruel to them? This book explains the dynamic without turning women into ignorant bimbos, but better yet, it tells women what to look for and how to take charge of their safety. It is empowering and fair.It reads well, has excellent examples and statistics, and is going to help me recognize danger for the rest of my life and my daughter's as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saver.","review":"This book is wonderful. I just read a few pages on the explanation of the cause of fear and its given me the answer to a lingering fear I've carried for many (and I mean many!) years.

Thank you Mr. Gavin De Becker, Sir!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of important and useful information.","review":"When I read this type of book I have a habit of underscoring information I want to read again. When I finished the Gift of Fear, almost every page had something underscored. There is so much useful and important information I am sharing the book with my family and purchasing the taped copy for my busy daughter. The Gift of Fear is #1 in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the book","review":"I found this 2 tape set, narrated by the author, to be superior in many respects to the longer book. First, given the limited time available, the points made about crime avoidance are reduced to their essential elements. Second, the author is a convincing narrator, who brings passion and the abhorence of violent crime to his subject. In particular, the author's narration of the crime described in the opening pages of the book, and the victim's instinctive reliance on the \\"gift of fear\\" which saves her life, is riveting. While the book is worthy of a careful read, the taped version is an excellent condensation. Buy it, if not for yourself, for your sons, daughters, cousins, nieces, and nephews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book on understudied topic","review":"De Becker's book is an interesting introduction to a topic that we rarely give critical thought to, namely our survival instincts, fear, and ways of coping with dangerous situations that most Americans are likely to face. The dangers that De Becker talks about are more likely to affect women and celebrities (i.e. stalking, rape), but he also talks about robberies, teen suicides/murders, intra-family crimes of violence, etc. He repeatedly talks about how predictable crimes are based on people's past behavior, as well as the simple measures we can use to determine whether or not strangers likely mean us harm or have intentions other than those stated by them. My main critique of the book is that it sometimes came off like a big advertisement for his firm, which specializes in security services and consulting rather than as a guide for everyone. Nevertheless I recommend the book, especially for younger and middle aged women."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than any self defense class","review":"I've heard the principle behind karate is that ideally you should never have to use it. That's great, so the real question is, \\"If I don't want to get mugged, and I ideally I shouldn't use karate, what the heck should I use?!\\"The answer is in this book.Simply put: Learn to use your instincts, to sharpen your awareness of your own fear, to recognize real potential danger, and to avoid it.The book is easy to understand, it dives into the psychology of fear without swamping the reader with jargon, and it uses many anecdotes to explain the right and wrong ways people handle dangerous situations. There's more to it than simply avoiding all dark alleys or considering yourself entirely safe because you carry pepper spray. The book empowers the reader, it's better than any self-defense course, and it requires less of a time commitment."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for everyone - male or female","review":"Gavin de Becker's book is so informative, engaging and intense. After reading the book, you will be well equipped to deal with potentially dangerous situations. I feel so much safer now because I know how to read people better; rely on my intuition more and know how to avoid bad situations.This book is not meant to scare - its purpose is to empower- and you will feel empowered.

His research on \\"why\\" will leave you better prepared to avoid evil and recognize safety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Hitting","review":"This took some time to read, because it was hard hitting and challenged so many assumptions. I don't agree with everything the author postulates, but it's worth reading for what you will learn from the book.

We try to be open and friendly with strangers in the mistaken belief that this will strengthen our position within the circle of like-minded civilized people. We teach girls and women to not offend others, to act in a warm and loving manner, to be \\"nice.\\" We disarm ourselves and call it a virtue. We beat our swords into plowshares. We value \\"trust.\\"We are idiots.The Gift of Fear will open a few eyes--not enough, but a few. Buy it. But it now. Read it. Twice. Give it to your family and friends, anybody you care about.

The book is full of examples and insights, leaving the reader with a much better understanding of fear and the warning that real fear communicates.

It should be of interestto everyone, but especially to those who deal with others-- some of whom may be playingwith less than a full deck.The author extensively discusses what he calls pre - incident threat indicators andthreat evaluation.

Just a bunch of pompous drivel and advertisements for his 'security firm', and a bunch of political stuff that had little to do with the topic. A lame article on wikipedia has higher standards than the author and publisher of this book. I'm a little angry I paid for this. I'm usually good about avoiding most of what Oprah recommends as it's usually unscientific wishy washy crap. Hey ladies, don't trust creepy dudes.

I am presently reading it and have found it very interesting. The author gives specific examples, using the names and stories of real people, who were victimized because they did not listen to their \\"gut feelings\\".

I think that the author is great at relating statistics to an everyday person. He makes things a lot easier than a huge number of statistics that you can not relate to, instead he will say for example that A woman is being beat by her husband right now as you read this review, and another is being beat right now, and again now. That is a lot more understandable than a huge number that one hears by a statistical analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really useful book","review":"This book as been suggested to me by a friend of mine.

It's not something that I would normally read, but my sister's teacher talked about it in class, and was commenting on how good it was. When I started it I wasn't really sure what it was going to be about. I thought maybe the entire book was just going to be a story about this girl, and then it went on to explain how she saved herself from death.

I'm glad I decided to actually finish reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So reading","review":"This book was reccomended to me by a friend and I really looked forward to reading it. I found that the ideas of the author on being aware of our surroundings and using instincts and intuition to stay safe are very valid. I was hoping for more case studies and real-life examples of how people have either suceeded or failed regarding the use of, or not, these tactics. This book so far has read more like a text book than a book that holds my interest. I admit I have not finished it, but but it down. I will go back to it and hope to find what I am looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow your gut instincts","review":"A excellent book. He could have used more examples in the book from real life, rather than threats to celebrities and famous people. However the main focus of the book, telling people that they need to trust their instincts is true.

As I read the other reviews I noticed thet no one speaks of this pure and simple fact. If we change the way we treat our children we will reduce crime in our society. The stats on the amout of children murdered and abused are shocking! Have they gone ignored once again? The Gift of Fear is a wake up call. It's telling us to help our children.

Definitely a book everyone should read a few times to absorb all of the excellent information in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gift of Fear","review":"Every domestic violence shelter in America should have a few copies of this. These are cases the author personally worked on with the victims.People that commit violent crimes fit a profile that the author describes. He gives his expert advice for managers on the process of interviewing and personalities to avoid hiring. Also, some high profile cases of stalking and violence including the O.J. Simpson case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift of Fear","review":"Gavin De Becker's The Gift of Fear really sets itself apart from the typical book about crime.What I find interesting is that the contents in the book come from a man who is not only educated, but is also a real life victim to crime and violent behavior. When somebody can support thier books with real life experience, that is something worth reading. The Gift of Fear is an excellent example of how one has that \\"gut feeling or instinct \\" and how you can learn to utilize it to win the big game, the fight , or win back your very life...The Gift of Fear is a great book and now he has another titled Just 2 Seconds which I currently am reading. I encourage you to check them out !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"If you have always wondered why you get a certain feeling about someone or something, this book explains it all. Trust your instincts! Everyone young and old should read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much more than common sense","review":"If you're looking for practical advice, this is not the book for you. It's packed with repetitive, obvious stories. Let me summarize this book for you- Ladies, if a guy is weird, or abusive, or strikes fear in you, don't go out with him. Be alert, and call the cops if you see him anywhere he shouldn't be after that.If you want something you can really use, which can help you defuse bad situations, you might want to check out a booked called Verbal Judo, which while aimed at police use a bit too much, has a lot of practical advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"State Trooper has just had his eyes opened....","review":"I am a state trooper, and the usual response in my assigned area is not and has not been very successful when dealing with family violence.

I borrowed the book from our public library and halfway through knew I had to buy it. I now own it, and every member of my family will be sure to read it. The author is very well educated in the area of violence and gets his points and views across in an easy to understand fashion. If you are a potential victim (as we all are) this book is a must for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for everyone","review":"I can't say enough good about this book. Gavin de Becker delivers an amazingly down to earth and easy to read guide to navigating in a world where violence can and does happen with plenty of warnings.He demonstrated, even in the opening chapter, things that I had felt very clearly but never had words to explain. Seeing them put to terminology that I can use was so very helpful, and his willingness to be vulnerable and talk about his own history helps a reader to feel invested in the work he's doing. I can't honestly think of a person that couldn't benefit from reading this book - unless it's someone who already has."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for women, parents and men who give a ....","review":"Finally, someone has validated and verified what I've always known...and depended on.

And many of the statistics that the author recklessly spews are easy to look up and falsify! I guess that Mr. De Becker forgot that discerning, responsible readers could use a simple search engine to fact check his claims about the numbers of sexual assaults, rapes, murders, etc and find them to be very, very wrong. Mr. De Becker appears to have just made up the numbers induce \\"fear\\" in his readers.If you buy Mr. De Becker's book you will be the victim of crime, the crime of fraud!

I never could \\"get\\" what people were talking about when they said that to be safe, you should follow your instincts: Most people's instinct is to expect other people to behave as they would. Some people's instincts are racist and also people who have been in abusive situations often have a blurry view of what is normal and what is not. This is the first book that told me how to evaluate a situation and determine using my awareness and intuition to determine what I need to do. I had previously faced several situations that I thought were unpredictable or uncontrollable, and looking back with the insights of this book, I can see that there were clear warning signs. I have lent copies of this book to several people who needed it who in turn passed them on to someone else who needed it and I decided that was a good thing and started buying copies to give away. I have given away about 7 now."},{"rating":"1","title":"another disappointment","review":"De Becker has some valuable insight, but he is verbose, and his insight is buried under a mountain of words. This bood is at least twice as long as it needs to be. So far, the best book I've read in this genre is Rory Miller's Facing Violence. He says, or hints at, everything de Becker says, but he's clear, and concise.

The entire first half is especially dragging. The interviews with the various charachters were the parti liked least. They all seemed so one dimensional. It finally started to pick up in the last half when the interview segments ended and they had their meal together with the best part of the book being the comic relief provided by one of his \\"guests\\" who belives him to be god. The most grating charachter is his wife Edna with her constant refrain of \\"Oh My Spaceman.\\"The most disappointing thing about this book for me however was the ending. It is a complete cop out in my opinion. A spaceman is living in New Orleans and no one notices. I think someone might. But I wish I wouldn't have noticed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spaced Out","review":"The first strike against this book is the fact the jacket refers to it as 'humurous'. Do not be fooled! There are any number of funny situations in this book but the narration bleeds any and all humor out of them. It is almost as if two different people plotted and wrote the book. Now it IS very well written but a person approaching this book should expect a deadly serious peek into the minds of a wide variety of characters and nary a chuckle. Do not make the mistake I did and expect a 'humorous' book. The other problems I found were the bibical allegory near the end and the total cop out of an ending to the book.All in all I can reccommend this book but not if the reader wants some literary fun or will be operating heavy machinery soon after reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earth to Robert","review":"I started this book with the anticipation of one standing atop the Devil's Tower - a Pulitzer Prize-winning author (Robert Olen Butler), a Y2K millennial satire of the \\"ultimate message to mankind\\" and a commentary on the human penchant for dreaming of better things. As I read, the story literally died in my hands. The TV-speak used by Desi (Mr. Spaceman) became suffocatingly annoying. The examples of human yearning were poisoned by the inclusion of historically trivial events. The messiah metaphor was bludgeoned by a heavy-handed analogy to the Last Supper. And the final death throe was a one-page, O. Henry ending. This book is an \\"open-and-shut\\" case. Murder one. The Butler did it. Hang the author and let the book rest in peace. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and Puzzling","review":"Because the book is not humorous nor inventive nor literary nor even original, I can't imagine what its author was thinking except that this watered down ill-concieved e.t.-like construct, \\"Desi\\" ( if you think that's a clever name you'll love the book), will somehow offer a perspective on earthlings that's unique or enlightening.

Sure enough, you will get a close shave, but if all of your facial hair does not grow at a perfect 90 degree angle to your face, you will NEVER get a complete shave. I bought this thing hoping to save time in the morning shaving and cleaning the razor. In the past (and now present) I've always used the Norelco ROTARY electric shaver. Having curly hair, the rotary razor does a decent job, no more than three strokes to shave ALL the hair in any given area.The Braun \\"360 Complete\\" is pure marketing hype. It takes 3 x's longer, leaving my face sore and hot, and I would still have to touch up many visible hairs with my old Norelco! The auto cleaner is not smart. Cleaning cycle based on battery wear, not the condition of the razor. If you have curly facial hair, buy anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good razor, but will stop using Braun going forward...","review":"I have been using Braun razors for many years, each time upgrading to their newer and more expensive technology. After buying this razor, I will change brands and go with Panasonic for the future. The main reason is the HUGE and ridiculous 'Clean and Renew' system that comes with these shavers. The razor does not make good contact while in the cradle so the only way to charge it is to plug the cord directly into the razor and not the base. Also because the razor does not make proper contact, the cleaning system will start and then abruptly shut off leaving a dirty, alcohol-wet razor. The whole idea of having to buy cleaning cartridges is crazy as well. Give me a good quality razor that I can clean by rinsing under a faucet and I will be happy.

Talk about a big improvement - I find that where the Norelco always irritated the skin on my neck, the Braun is much more gentle. I can press down very firmly and still not get the red irritated spots that I used to get before. The razor feels very comfortable in my hand, and although the cleaning stand is somewhat bulky, I really like being able to just drop the shaver in and have it clean the next time I come back.

I've followed instructions to the letter, and haven't been pleased with the results.So, I hesitate to recommend this razor to anyone seeking a close, smooth shave...you'll be disappointed.

I have found that the Braun self-cleaning shaver is the best. It gives me the closest shave and also has that great self-cleaning unit which completely cleans and lubricates the shaver.

One way to make them last longer is to clean your shaver by every other use rather than everytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre uneven shave at best","review":"Cuts poorly.

I only have two complaints with it.1. The razor \\"feels\\" good and expensive like it should, but the base looks and feels cheap, almost like it belongs with some other product. While this is a minor issue, I paid about $140 for this thing, and the package together doesn't have that feeling.Overall the purchase was worthwhile and I'm glad I shelled out the extra money for it.2. The razor is pretty loud while operating, especially when you have the trimmer in use as well. While it cuts very, very well, this product is far louder than any razor I've used before.

The shave is as close as I think I can get to blade as possible. The difference for me between a blade razer and the Braun is almost unnoticable. The feel on my skin was good as well. Going from a rotary to this type of razer I was worried that my skin would burn and I would have troble getting used to it. That was not the case. The feel was smooth on the first use.

The first few weeks you will keep wanting to take out your blade razor but you have to allow your beard get accustomed to being shaved by an electric shaver.The self cleaning head system is awesome, it is nice to have a clean, fully charged, sanitary shaver every morning. The battery life is good. I like the option to use it cordless or by the cord if you wish.The alcohol reserve must be changed every two weeks and cleaned out. I would definately reccomend this shaver.This would have been a great gift from my wife who apparently never took the hints I was dropping like bombs, so I bought it for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the hype","review":"I had a Braun shaver, but I was in need of new head and blade. They are very expensive, so I decided to invest in the 360 Complete model since it had received lots of hype in other reviews. It's as good as other Brauns that I have had over the last several years, but perhaps no better. My unit is very noisy. The first few shaves produced longer hairs after a shave. I thought it must be the new Gillette blades. Indeed, the first few shaves did feel closer, but after a week or so, the length of the cut hairs was similar to my previous Braun and perhaps no better than getting a new head a blades. I liked the fact that the cleaner stand was the same as the last models and that the charger works for both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent transaction","review":"My husband actually order this product for his Father's Day gift.

Unfortunately the cleaning base is not. The cleaning base's metal contacts creep back into base and do not provide a secure charge! Even after taking base apart (which is risky, since the clean and renew base is constructed very flimsily and its' shoddy plastic components can easily break) the metal contacts will recede into base and you will not be able to charge or clean shaver without buying a new clean and renew base, which costs about sixty dollars. The shaver is excellent build quality, made in Germany, but the cleaning base was outsourced in Hungary and is very poor quality. I think Braun needs to really put more effort into constructing a quality clean and renew base for it's fine shaver. Otherwise, this shaver is definitely not worth its' expensive price tag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor shave an irritating","review":"I just got the Pansonic Vortex es-la63-s and it is much better than this piece of crap.

I did have a \\"break-in\\" period when I started to use it--you may notice some pulling before your beard acclimates. It cuts as well as other electric shavers. I had a 5700 model before this.

It's terrible at cutting hair and irritates my skin far worse then a manual razor. The instructions say to give your face 2 to 3 weeks to \\"get used to the razor\\"... omg.

The only plastic is the inline remote control and headphones. While most operational functions are duplicated on the backside of the player's case, you will want to keep the remote control handy since it contains the LCD status display.Sony's Digital Mega Bass does a great job elevating the very deep bass without adding appreciable distortion. A slight rise in the higher frequencies is also noticeable.I highly recommend this Sony MiniDisc player.

I wrote and attempted to compile both, to find out to my surprise that I was right, the code didn't compile (yes, the book said it should)! The second such snippet was test chapter 2, question 14, and the answer I gave was the code would not compile. They said it would. Such errors are simply not acceptable for a book like this.When I look at allegedly valid code in a book and think it won't compile, I want to be wrong everytime. That's how I learn when I'm wrong.

They are so pervasive that the reader quickly learns not to accept anything read in the book and to go to the compiler to verify everything.

The problem is the errors in the self tests. For example, 10% of the answers for the self test in chapter two are wrong (questions 14 and 18)! This is easily validated by checking the code with the compiler (something the authors should have done). However, if you treat this as an exercise to further validate your understanding, it is some compensation.

I have to admit that it not only served its purpose well in helping me passing the exam, but also filled me in on lots of Java language details that could easily fall through the cracks in day-to-day programming, and thus helped me gain a more thorough understanding of the language.The authors' ability of explaining complex topics (such as threading) in a clear straightforward way is the biggest strength of this book. The \\"Two Minute Drill\\" summarizes topics well and provides a concise reference. The examples could have presented more variations and tricky codes, because understanding the concepts is one thing, recognizing various code, specially those in format not so often seen, is a totally different thing.Overall, I highly recommend this book.

Very obvious choice, as this book is quite engaging and explains the concepts with a greater clarity and depth.The methodology used to present the concepts is excellent and ensure whatever you read goes through. I personally like the addressing with first person, as it gives me a feeling of some one is teaching in person. Moreover, the 2 minute drill and the tests are quite similar and very close to the real exam. I took the test last week and answered 56 out of 61 to score 91%.

It uses higher percentage for pass scoring. I don't know what the author is thinking. What are you really simulated for ? I don't know what will be in the actual exam, the small window drives me crazy. I have to scroll up/down repeatly for the question and the answer options.

The included software is detrimental to your success. This book doesn't even contain a section on File I/O which is on the test. The section on threads may be the worst explanation of threads I've ever seen.I ended up studying in a bookstore with their copy of the Sybex Java Cert. book, while it contained errors as well, it seems that the authors actually know something about the test.To be fair the section on Garbage Collection is great.

The cd that comes with the book merely contains questions in the book, and has several bugs and wrong answers. The book doesn't cover I/O, which is covered on the exam. Also, too much material that won't be tested is presented, making it a long and tedious book to read from cover to cover.On the plus side, this book is detailed and covers some topics well. There are about 20 questions at the end of each chapter, which help you develop your understanding of the material.I have also used ExamCram, by Bill Brogeden, and have found it to be much better. It is very efficient, with few errors, and has a web site that lists the known errors.

Many books of this kind, tend to put me to sleep. With this book however, I found my self laughing out loud throughout each chapter. Its really humorous, and not your typical \\"Geek Humor\\". It catches you off guard and is a very fun way to understanding the more serious and boring topics.I passed but could have done much better had I given more time to the practice exam on the CD. I spent more time on each chapter and sample questions, and only took the practice exam once and didn't spend very much time reviewing the questions after. My suggestion would be not to stress out on each chapter along the way (the sample questions are meant to be hard for a reason).

Anyway. Last year I bought this book. My motivation was to look into \\"Java Developer\\" part. Still I have not read it all. But even so I can tell the book has still its high value (though nowadays The Java Tiger 5.0 is out in the World).Sometimes I open the book, skim a few pages, shift a bookmarker and feel more educated, because I will always find interesting information about Java language.

I do not care how other examples are -- there can not simply be misleading examples!

It is clear, concise, and informative. It doesn't have the added tech fluff I have found in other books (like the Complete Java 2 Certification Study Guide). It has sample tests that are comparable to the REAL thing and gives useful details of the language that will benefit in more way than one. You will learn more about syntax, coding conventions in Java, run-time errors, threads, UI's, and more. As a programmer, the details I learned about Java is invaluable. It is easy to read (for a study guide) and a sure ticket to pass the test. If you are running out of time you may want to pick up Java 2 (exam cram) too."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, fluffy, worthless","review":"The cover is beautiful. The examples are cute, including \\"Madame Cthulu's Tarot Cards\\". The inside of the cover had some great Java tips. However, as a certification guide, it is completely unacceptable. Their self-tests are peppered with incorrect answers and I was unable to find any means to get official errata for the book. I strongly suspect that whoever put the thing together knew it was a hack job and that it is designed to sell well only, not to help anyone pass a certification. There is simply no ethical justification for not publishing errata. It is overpriced and you don't even get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not For Certification","review":"The number of errors is great enough to make one doubt about the integrity of the book. How could the errors go unnoticed? It is a pity that such books get off the press and claim to be helping people to pass certification exams.Anyone who is sharp enough would spot the numerous errors. I seriously doubt anyone who says the book is useful really knows what Java is about. The book confuses with its numerous errors rather than teaches.If you want to prepare for the certification exam, get a better book.

The graphics are absurd. The faces are detailed, but Brendan Fraser looks chunky in the cinemas and there is lots of polygon pop up. The control is a pain. Why does it take forever to walk backwards? And why does pressing the jump button take you so far? Some jumps seem impossible to make. The camera can be a problem too. Whenever I start shooting, the camera goes over my head making it difficult to see the enemy. I can't even beat the second level, so I'm not sure what the rest of the game is like. But with the problems I mentioned it will probably just get worse. The only things this game has to offer is the satisfaction of shooting or slicing mummies like Brendan Fraser.

But something are not so good about this book : 1. too many typos, wrong scripts, and results 2. some contexts should not appear over and over again (e.g., the \\"vendor\\") 3. some examples and lab exercises are used in all 3 shells, which are good for the beginners to learn the usages between difference shells. but they are not really very big differences between them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many errors. A nice effort but not proofed well enough.","review":"While this book is unique in its attempt to comprehensively cover all three shells, Awk, Sed, and Grep, the many errors don't leave one with confidence in what one reads. If one can get past the syntax errors, the book may be worthwhile. e.g. !#/bin/csh -f should read #!/bin/csh -f .

If a few typos are going to put you off, then shell programming in Unix may not be what you should be doing. The strength of this book is in its organization and presentation, which is uniform and clear throughout. This makes the book fatter than most, but if brevity and cryptic descriptions are what you seek, just use \\"man\\" and don't waste your money on a book at all.

So was I disappointed as usual? No. Maybe it was just one of those \\"right movie for the right mood\\" things, but this movie was actually, almost better than I thought it would be. Sure, the ending could have been a little more satisfying, but overall, this is definitely a five-star film. The acting was great, the plot (while reminiscent of \\"A Walk to Remember\\") was uniquely done. Very real, very believable. But don't be like me and get your expectations too high; watch it with an open mind and open heart and you are sure to love it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done","review":"I rented this movie because of Jesse McCartney being in it and I wanted to see if he would be any good. I fully expected that this movie would not be very well done and that the acting would be subpar. Thankfully I was very wrong.

She's a pretty good actor, but really I just think she just so beautiful. Jesse McCartney is a good match to play her co-star. I thought his acting was better than hers. This movie can be compared to \\"A Walk To Remember\\" and for the core story line, but the genders roles are reversed. If you really loved that movie, then you probably would like this as well. The thing about that movie I really liked was it had a great music and songs. This movie doesn't have that, but does have more story plots to it, where there is a 3 way love triangle.

It systematically categorizes a rational medical approach to children with autism. The clinical practice of the medical treatment of autism is an area of huge need, but has long been ignored by most specialists who normally would encounter young patients with autism. Designed for both a professional and lay (parent) audience, the book makes it clear that a systematic approach which includes diet, treatment of immune and gastrointestinal abnormalities, heavy metal removal, allergy problems, and more, makes rational sense, based on a thoughtful analysis of the individual patient.McCandless is one of the premier clinicians in the field, and has a personal passion for the topic.

This book is not for people making simple web graphics. It talks about utillizing photoshop to make things look more life like on paper. I would like to add that colors vary from press to press, so don't rely to much on the colors he specifies.

This series is perverted, but that usually doesn't bring a anime down, since ecchi is a cliche genre of the '00s.In this series I've seen absolutely nothing original. Everything is cliche. Many of the cliche elements are even repeated throughout the series. You see tenticle rape 3-4 times in this series. Tenticle rape at least once is unavoidable in an ecchi series, but repeated is unacceptable.All the characters fit common anime cliches. Loli Characters, powerful characters, weak minded male lead, cutesy creatures, memory loss endings, lack of plot, love harems, hot school nurses, hot spring episodes, sex and mainly more. This series has absolutely no appeal to it at all. The best episodes are the first 3, and the last 2.

No concrete examples that would enable the reader to cement his knowledge on solid ground.On ocassions the author explains VBA for an specific application, say Word, but then he changes to give general explanations for all applications at once, disorderly mentioning exceptions for Excel, Word, Project or PowerPoint, what makes the reading difficult.No, this book is not for me.

However, it was not as good as Messiah. If you have never read a Boris Starling book, I recommend you read Messiah first, then Storm. If you like good or should I say extremely captivating endings, then you'll love Boris Starling books. I can't wait for his next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excitement Galore!","review":"If you're in the mood for a book that will keep you glued to the edge of your seat from beginning to end, do yourself a favor and read Boris Starling's latest thriller, Storm. If possible, I would have awarded this book 4 1/2 stars.Only the fact that I felt the very end was a little weaker than the rest of the book kept me from giving it a 5 star rating. Putting this very minor detail aside, Storm has it all -- a slam-bang plot, lots of surprises,and very interesting characters. As good as Storm is, however, it's not as good as Starling's first book, Messiah; which I thought was great. If you haven't read Messiah, do so fast. As a matter of fact, you might want to read Messiah even before reading Storm. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"After reading Messiah, Storm is quite a Disappointment","review":"I waited patiently for Boris Starling's next novel, after reading Messiah. Messiah is probably the best novel of this genre that I have ever read. Storm on the other hand is somewhat unfocused and realy does not make a clear connection between the two main plotlines. The novel drags on and on trying to give us some insight into the mindset of DCI Beauchamp and is quite boring at times. Furthermore, the re-introduction of Redfern Metcalfe, the hero of Messiah, seems like a cheap take on the Hannibal Lecter character, except that the reader is never really given an insight into his situation other than the fact that at the end of Messiah, he decides that he has crossed over the line between good and evil. By giving Metcalfe a larger portion of this story, Storm could have been a much better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storm","review":"Needed this book for my collection of Boris Starlings books.

Arrived in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extensively padded","review":"This book probably could have been half its present thickness if the authors had cut out needless repetition and large graphics that illustrate simple points. For example, half of one page is taken up showing a web page with an alert box, just in order to tell you what an alert box is. Scripts are done piece by piece, and after each additional snippet of code, the entire script is reproduced. The index really shows how the publishers padded out the book - each page is two columns of very large text with huge borders on all sides and between the columns. The information contained in the book is fairly good, but I don't like to feel that I've been ripped off by paying for a 1000-page book that by rights should have been a 500-page book. I have found that I tend to reach for my Dynamic Web Publishing Unleashed book a lot more frequently - it covers basically the same topics, plus quite a few others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Simply put, the book lacks content. Not only are the words and paragraphs rather sparsely distributed throughout the pages, but little knowledge is actually shared with the reader.The authors appear to want to impart a lyric quality to the work, perhaps akin to poetry.

This makes the book easy to follow as it moves from one concept to the next. This book does a good job of presenting the Managing By Values system as an idea that makes sense for a company's bottom line. It's great to have a work force that enjoys their jobs, but those jobs won't last long if a company doesn't remain profitable. Managing By Values shows that you don't have to sacrifice profit to increase worker satisfaction and that you don't have to sacrifice worker satisfaction to increase profit. The MBV process shows that increased worker satisfaction leads to increased profit. This book is written for CEOs and people in senior leadership positions."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is the nadir of vanity publishing.","review":"I have never read a book so filled with bad grammar, misspellings, and cliches.

The only item of interest in the book is trying to figure out how a little electro-magnetic gadget spells out, 'Managing by Values'. The authors certainly couldn't. If you want to read a cartoon book about American management, read a 'Dilbert'. If you're seriously interested in shaping a value-driven corporation, read 'The Heart Aroused' by David Whyte."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly designed & written","review":"This book attempts to fit programmers in the same literary mold as end users of applications. Very poorly written, it seems to be aimed at simply showing off the Visual J++/WFC API, without giving readers a sense of the basic steps associated with the subjects it covers. Code examples are extremely confusing, because they don't follow Java coding conventions, and they don't contain the function or class wrappers. This leads the reader to wonder whether or not to include the code automatically generated by the Visual J++ environment.I use Visual J++ 6.0 at work every day. It's a great tool (even though it DOES bastardize the Java platform), and this book is simply a marketing tool designed to trumpet the product's features without giving much in the way of information. It's funny: Microsoft used to include this type of propaganda with its products. Now we have to pay for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No advantages at all from buying this book. Entirely Useless","review":"This book contains absolutely zero information beyond what is included in the on line help and product documentation. As Java matures as a language, you would think the books would as well. This one didn't.

Look for other VJ++ 6.0 books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for beginners except for non-MS databases","review":"As a beginning Java user(I have used VB a little in the past), I found this book to be very usefull.

The topics were intermediate but easy enough to work through. After completing it I got a solid understanding of many areas of developing for Windows using WFC and Visual J++. Part of the ease for me in bridging to VJ from VB was that the author explained all of the code that he presented in clear terms. This is refreshing! The book's code also uses 100% of WFC in its examples and they ALL work. This is something that I found not the case in other books on VJ 6. The only area that is lacking in the book is a chapter on DHTML. Currently the book states that it is geared towards intermediate readers geared towards people developing for Windows. After completing the book and its many examples, I felt the author met this goal. I look forward to future editions of this book with even more advanced material!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, not nearly in depth enough.","review":"I was very disappointed with this book, it is a very basic book, only for very green beginners.

This is due to their mature and growing musical tastes and influences. I would say that a 1/3 of the disc falls into this catagory. However, when Vader (!) plays the kind of ... death-metal groove that only they can, those songs stick in your brain and will not give you a moments peace. The import songs are both good. \\"As the fallen..\\" is short and brutally-sweet, but \\"Angel...\\" is an 6 minute memorable epic!

The only concept this book seems to illustrate is how pleased the author is with herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete disappointment","review":"It's tough to give this otherwise-just-mediocre book 1 star, but here's why: Storace's distaste for the modern Greek people is really obvious. She's a skilled writer, but the experiences she describes are unexciting and her \\"insights\\" on Greeks border on offensive. She obviously got nothing positive from the country where she spent a year. Too bad for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Read","review":"I enjoyed this book although there were times when I felt that the author was overwhelming me with a large amount of historical facts in each chapter. Sometimes I felt as if I had picked up a history book rather than a travel memoir. Unlike others, I didn't at all feel that she was condescending towards the Greeks...I think she was genuinly enamoured of the culture and country and was doing her best to explain why, in spite of all the internal problems prevalent in Greek society, she feels such an attraction for the place. I know I came away from the book with a new and deeper understanding of modern Greece and I look forward to seeing more prose by Patricia in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold, Unfinished Prose","review":"I am only half way through the book, but I find Ms. Storace's writing stilted and her thoughts often seem to be unfinished. She has little imagination and conjurs no images of this place for me. I have yet to find any of her encounters, or descriptions of them, to be even mildly amusing and she seems obsessed with the Nation's religious zeal. What about the food? Where is the scenery? What about the people and family life? None of these things are explored beyond the most superficial glance.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spoiling the ship","review":"Ms. Storace's writing is vivid, frequently excellent. Her opportunity to spend a significant length of time in Greece is to be envied. Her extensive travels reflect a serious attempt to look at the landscape. The recurring theme of the dream-book is imaginative and very useful in linking an episodic book. Unfortunately, she condescends towards the Greeks, and sees them as dysfunctional -- largely because they aren't American. This imperialist attitude is more common to British writers, and always a little galling. Perhaps taking her lead from Rebecca West, Ms. Storace sees every event, object, or person in relation to herself. For example, it may be true, as she suggests, that every man in Greece lusted after her, but it's extremely improbable and of no interest to the reader. Less of this self-centeredness and more of landscape (which she handles so much better than people) would have made this a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetic? Hardly. Judgmental and shrill.","review":"This is a tedious, pretentious book. It purports to describe a year in Greece (really, a year? it seems like ten) but succeeds only in revealing the shortcomings -literary and otherwise- of its protagonist. It fails as a narrative (too disjointed, too self-absorbed), and this despite a few good turns of phrase and a handful of intriguing insights. The main culprit is Ms. Storace's grating personality, which leaves the reader uninvolved in her exploits- this is one of the coldest, most cynical travel books I have ever read. Greece deserves better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought-provoking meditation on modern Greek life","review":"Poet and essayist Patricia Storace's meditations on a year spent living and traveling in Greece is simply fascinating. Dinner with Persephone can almost be read as a series of sketches of contemporary Greek life--a form that suits her instincts as a poet well.Other reviewers have referred to her as cynical; as a Greek-American woman, I think that she has, in many ways, captured some of the contradictions of the modern Greek \\"character,\\" and our continuing struggles to define ourselves to our satisfaction. Also to her great credit, Storace explores the Byzantine heritage of Greece. (How many writers have ignored Orthodoxy and the Byzantine legacy in favor of its classical history?)A must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Believe half of what you see, and none of what Storace wrote","review":"What an intriguing name, and what a huge disappointment this book actually was! Having lived in Greece for over 10 years, I would not presume to know how \\"the Greeks\\" think or live - and she has the audacity to think she understands this country and its people after \\"living\\" less than a year in Athens? Her trite comments based on surface meetings, conclusions drawn from heresay, negative views of \\"little\\" non-Americans, and incorrect specifics on the history of Greece make this the most absurd book I have ever read. Shame on Patricia Storace, Shame! I would be very interested to know who funded her stay and this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A TERRIBLE BOOK","review":"Storace's book is a vivid illustration of how even a richly educated individual can be vastly ignorant. She completely misses the mark on the true benevolence behind much of Greek hospitality, and her pitiable retellings of the overtures of Greek men reveal nothing but her own egotism. Despite a solid understanding of Greek language and history, Storace has extremely limited understanding of Greeks themselves, in large part because her own ethnocentrism -- which reveals itself repeatedly in the book -- prevents her from regarding Greeks as equal to Americans. To read her ridiculous \\"observations\\" regarding Greeks (All Greeks look alike, Greeks don't smile) is to know the real meaning of The Ugly American.Her year in Athens was clearly too brief a period for her to understand Greeks.If you want to know Greeks, spend time with Greeks. Or visit Greece. Do not read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as crazy about this books as others","review":"I was rather disappointed and underwhelmed by this book. Patricia Storadge writes more about her daily interaction with Greeks than about Greek life or culture, but her tone is often snide and condescending. There may be truths in her observations and even valid criticisms, yet I was disturbed by her attitude. The best part of the book was her description of the Benakis family history. A much more affectionate and refreshing look at Greek culture and life is a book published in Greece called \\"The Unwritten Places,\\" by Tim Salmon, an Englishman who lived and traveled with the Vlachs shepherds in the Pindos Mountains. Also Corelli's Mandolin, which, though a novel, really captures Greek culture with humor, love and enchantment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthy, honest, and insightful !!","review":"Storace is an excellent writer. I marvel at how much she picked up spending only one year in Greece. She writes with great detail, almost brutal honesty, and in so doing, produced an earthy and provocative look at Greece with a foreigner's insightful analysis.

She had to press with both hands while I held the shower head up. I wished I knew that before I bought it. So, after one use, it's in the closet. A plastic toy watering pail from the dollar store worked just as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it would have been done right...","review":"I know I shouldn't argue over an inexpensive title like this, but considering that this offers only 5 of the band's videos (Wildest Dreams, Other Side of Life, Running of Love, I Know You're Out There, and No More Lies), it dashes this fan's hopes that we will ever see a true, proper Video Collection by one of the greatest bands of all time. Most hardcore fans know that there are rare music videos for the songs Blue World and Sitting at the Wheel, and an even rarer, mostly unseen 1991 video for Say It With Love which is really sweet and SHOULD be included on this disc. All 5 of these videos are readily available on either the LEGEND OF A BAND DVD or the official Fan Club VHS that's been out for years. Someone missed the boat. What we really need is a full set of all the available videos, even at full price, which I have a good feeling Moody Blues fans would be willing to pay. This is a wasted effort..."},{"rating":"2","title":"No More Fries","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable. I have the Legend of a Band on VHS, so it was nice to pick up this DVD for a decent price. If you like the Moody Blues, you will like this nice, but short DVD.

Each of these videos is already available on other discs, and I was disappointed to find there were only five on this one. \\"Say It With Love\\" IS a great video, and ranks as my favorite.I have been a Moody Blues fan since 1967. I understand their desire to avoid the rock hype and all that goes with it, but they are truly one of the most undervalued groups of the past 40 years. I would pay ANY price to see a quality disc(s) with ALL their videos in one place, with a history of each but with no overdub commentary, no interruptions and premier sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes hanging shelving a breeze.","review":"We purchased the 40\\" horizontal track to hang the John Sterling standards on.

Not an unworthy goal, but this book is about as scientific as \\"Saved by an Angel\\". Throughout the book Wheatley continually attributes human values and metaphysical meanings to physical phenomena, resulting in a book that reads like a weird hybrid of Scientific American and L. Ron Hubbard's \\"Dianetics\\". The fundamental failure of the book lies in the fact that Wheatley never uses any sort of scientific metodology to assess her hypothesis. She is able to offer cogent arguments at various points of the book, but arguments that sound good do not constitute viable scientific proof of her assertions. While this book may be unfit for any scientific discussion, it does deserve a bonus point for being largely free of typographical errors.

Really waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor writing.","review":"Wheatley taps into an interesting view regarding the way organizations should be run. The ideas and concepts are interesting but the writing style is close to unbearable. It took days to read because I was constantly falling asleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb new direction in thinking about organizations","review":"I noticed that the other reviewers make much about Wheatley's comments about quantum mechanics vis-a-vis management, but little about her much more relevant comparisons to chaotic behavior. Chaos requires basically two things- at least three variables and a process of feedback. I guarantee that both conditions are met in business. She has hit the mark about why things go wrong in the way they do, despite (or perhaps because of) what managers do to try to prevent them.Some readers have stressed the lack of concrete directions in the book, but that is really much of the point- you CAN'T strategize directly for chaos. You can only set up organizations that are robust enough to grow and change and survive when the chaos comes.One of the most enlightening books I have read in years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the faint-of-heart. It could change your thinking.","review":"Read from a businessman's perspective, this book illuminates some of the basic issues that creative firms have with business organization.Anyone who runs their business on a \\"need to know\\" basis will have considerable difficulty getting their minds around the larger ideas that are discussed here. The author's parallels to our real-world experience gave me confidence that she was on the right track. These ideas could change the way you spawn creative thinking in your firm."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will challenge your Newtonian view of reality.","review":"Provocative and insightful, however the author perhaps puts too much confidence in evolution all the while pestering our Newtonian linear and clockwork view of the universe. Her grasp and application of quantum physics related to organizational systemic management is worth pondering. One would wish she had made more connections to leadership and organizational culture and behavior. But then, I will re-read this more than once to get the \\"picture\\" she is trying to paint. I am attempting to apply her work to pastoral and church ministry and have God in the equation. I think she has discovered God's quantum designs centered in relationships and order in the universe made by Himself, the clockmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing 'African Ark'","review":"I first saw this book in an Ethiopian restaurant in Amsterdam on vacation. I was on my own and the book was there, so while waiting for my delicious meal I thumbed through the lush photos and fell into a trance of wonder and delight. I am an artist, interested in design (former graphic artist) and pattern. It was incredibly inspiring. The photographs are very beautiful and the dignity of the people are not compromised in these images. When I returned from my holiday I quickly ordered the book and feel fortunate to own such a magnificent tribute to an incredible culture. It is something I will continue to pour over for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal","review":"Just to say anyone wants to deal with Irene Hena I can recommend the dealer unreservedly.

Anybody reading the review and noting the dates, it took that time to get to me by hand and for me to look through and check condition. The book was delivered to the California address as requested, very promptly.I would certainly deal with this seller again.I hope my late review does not in any way adverseley affect the seller.

After I received it I wasn't real impressed. It's OK, but not as good as I thought it would be. I looked through it several times thinking I must have missed something, but it was still just barely OK. I might try some of the patterns at some point, but I can find better patterns on the internet and they are free.

How the judges deemed fit to place her in the company of such writers as Tanizaki Junichiro and Kawabata Yasunari is beyond me. The stories start off interestingly enough but the style of writing soon dulls the impact. Whether this is the fault of the writer or the translater I'm not sure but it is certainly distracting. The reader will find themselves being trailed behind some wonderfully imaginative stories, only to be abruptly dumped with a half page ending. I was left with the impression the the author had built up these grandiose fairy tales and was at a loss as to how she was going the come up with an ending. Very unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was that about???","review":"I must confess that I have no idea where this books is heading, where it goes and what is being said.

At that time, I knew what ASP and IIS was, and how to use ASP and VBScript to do stupid things like manipulate dates and write to the browser window.

The tape, and I assume the book, has the quality of a harangue, with the reader constantly admonishing the listener. Much of the tape has the form, . . .\\"and if you don't understand this, you will never understand anything about Zen.\\" After a while, it grows tiring. Buddha didn't phrase his lectures as cryptic, snide criticisms of his audiences capacity for enlightenment, and that's how this tape comes across. In contrast, listen to \\"The Teachings of Zen: Master Dogen\\" for a deep and empathic description of Zen philosophy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Instant Zen too instant","review":"Stories and sutras were read rapidly one after the other.

As only a true page-turner can, I found myself spellbound as the book evokes self-analysis and social commentary. A true and sometimes haunting story which mirrors the surface and the underbelly of the 'good ole days' and the new millenium.

Secondly, it gave me a much better understanding of what homosexuals have to endure in life in particularly with the church. I try my best to keep an open mind. As I started reading, first I was sad, then I was hurt and then it turned into anger. I want to be as honest as I can with you. I was having some mixed feeling at first, but I have prayed and God gave me peace with it. I think the book will help many people understand and not be so judgmental once they read the book.

You don't have to be homosexual or abused to experience the emotions Mr. Sipp feels. Any person, dealing with any struggle can certainly relate to this story. We are ALL given hope that if Mr. Sipp can survive the struggles he has had to endure, then we can too.

Battery life is good and the sound quality is excellent. The player itself is lightweight, attractive and easy to use. The Remote is a great feature and means I don't have to keep getting it out of my bag when I want to change tracks or adjust the volume. There are a wide range of volume settings: I prefer my music fairly quiet and always keep the AVLS switched on. The headphones I swapped for some of my own: the originals were cheap looking, uncomfortable to wear and I prefer the small, in-ear design. However, this is a small drawback and the CD player's other features make it a product that is great value for money.

Nothing else was wrong with the player, only the fact that I could no longer secure the CD to be played. Since I wasn't in America I could not use its warranty which is only one year after the purchase date and this incident happened eleven months after anyway.

However, considering the lack of literature dealing with the subject, this is a really good book. We have to pay respect to McIver to have the guts to set some light on Extreme Metal.

I was dead wrong this book is just as bad as the CCNA. I called them and they admitted that there were a few mistakes and they would fix them. Trust me there are alot of mistake and this book only covers about 1/4 of what you need to know. Save your money and wait for other books to come out.

But guess what? this is a plain old dictionary with occasional pictures! oh dear oh dear. while trying to decided between the choices on amazon, i clicked between this one, the Macmillan, the DK Visual Dictionary and in my own little way decided this one sounded best.

I even used the notes book and it didn't help much. (300 pages of appendixes in the first book). This is the third book I bought on the CCNA and by far the best. It is 700 pages and packed cover to cover with detailed information. Great sections on TCP/IP, router setup and configuration and easy to understand chapters on access lists and routing protocols. This book covered the exam real well on each topic. I finally passed last week thanks to this one. If I had only one book to buy this would have been it. I used the Exam Preps for the MCSE and the Network+ and once again they got me through another exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"Now here is a book that rocks. I like this stuff and I couldn't put it down. It has lots of good information that the Microsoft MSCE training never touched. Now I'm sure Cisco is the next step for me. It's easy reading but the material is real in-depth so I've decided to read it again before I blow a hundred bucks on the exam. I also found I didn't need to spend the big bucks on a router either, all the command print outs and stuff are in here. Go for it with this one, it's a lot to learn but a great book to learn it from. BTW The CD is great too, works just like the sylvan exams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Delicious!","review":"With all due respect to Ms. Sidlow's grandmother, I disagree with the previous review. As the book clearly states, these are \\"Old Fashioned Jewish Recipes, not \\"Old Fasioned Kosher Recipes\\" so what's the big tsimmes about it not being Kosher? I grew up on many of the recipes found in this book and enjoyed it immensely. As the author explains in the introduction, the majority of these recipes come from a family delicatessen which catered to a largely immigrant neighborhood in the 1930s, and if kreplach, blintzes, borscht, gedempte fleish, chopped liver, kasha, latkes, corned beef and grebenes aren't Jewish, then I don't know what is. Personally, I'd rather have a piece of honey cake than mandel bread any day and while Ms. Sidlow is entitled to her opinion, its all a matter of taste, isn't it? This book reminds me of home and I loved every mouthwatering page of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Anyone looking to purchase a cookbook with recipes associated with traditional Jewish Eastern European cuisine will be disappointed with this book. I found the book title grossly misleading. Others may not care, but in my opinion a book that is associated with Jewish Grandmothers should be kosher. I am not sure if I was more offended by the brisket sandwich made with rye bread, swiss cheese and mayonnaise or a sandwich called the Jewish Hero with turkey and cheese. There are some traditional recipes in this collection, just be aware that many of the recipes in this book are not kosher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I've heard in ages","review":"I follow pretty much all the Global Underground stuff. I like House and Drum n Bass as well so I'm not a trance fanatic and find that some of the GU releases can fall flat with too much of the commercial [...] and [...] diva/synth lines. Sasha was my fav but soon he too fell into the commercial pit. How often have you heard Breeder's 'Tyrantanic'?Anyway, this album rocks. I could do without the chick having sex on the beach for an entire song or some guy crooning 'orgasm' in my ear for several minutes. Plus the answering machine bit wears thin pretty quick. But the other tracks on the album more than make up for these shortcomings.Deep, dark, punchy, celebratory, cathartic. The sort of primitive music you can completely lose yourself in. Contrary to some of the other reviewers I can dig this stuff at a large club, at a party or on my own. Probably worth 4 and a half stars becuase of the spak tracks but because I haven't heard anything better in a long time I gave it 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the one","review":"I was really looking forward to this cd like most global uderground cd's, and i am sorry to say that this was not worth the wait.

I don't want to get up and go to class (not that I would anyway)--I just want ot sit here and listen to this all day.

This is not one of those pseuedo-\\"tribal\\" things. \\"Deep\\" and \\"dark,\\" for a lack of better words (I'm in a hurry). I recommend this one for people who like Tenaglia but are a little wierded out by his more diverse influences (that real New Yorky garage sound, divas, etc.). This is awesome stuff. I really like the sample at the beginning of the first disc--it lends a sense of foreboding and uneasiness (my favorite emotion!) that you don't forget throughout the course of the disc. Rarely am I this affected by a cd at first listen. The groove will haunt me for the rest of the day, week, or longer--who knows with this kind of stuff? First-rate."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Lawler's intro to the first disk is one of the best attention getters, mood-setters I've heard. From there on out, however, both disks are a big disappointment. I hoped for \\"a trip down the Congo\\" -- something like an extended version of the first two track on Tenaglia's Athens2 CD. I didn't expect much melody; but I did expect it to take me on some sort of journey, however deep, dark, and nasty. Instead, Lawler soon loses the plot, drifting off into uninspired, percussion-orientated middle ground. This isn't sex, it's banging; neither deep enough to be challenging, nor accesible enough to be fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh...My...God...","review":"In the booklet, which comes in all GU releases having some text and a couple of pics, the writer labels Lawler's set as being akin to sex. He couldn't be farther from the truth. Lawler practally plays with you for two discs, 2+ hours of incredible aural foreplay. This set is a masta-piece. You really should get all the NuBreed releases. Don't tell the Boxed Boys, ... But, I dare say that this NuBreed side-project surpasses the standard series...

There have been highlights and tracks that my friends and I have discussed over and over, and then comes a Steve Lawler walking into the scene with a nuclear bomb! The first set of his that I picked up, and still treasure, was his home set. And that was it! I had Lawleritis! He IS the Danny Tenaglia of the UK!

Initially the graphics disappointed me but the game is heavy on mood and story and that is what makes a good RPG. RPGs are meant to have a certain length to them and this one delivers in spades. By the end you really feel as if you have taken an epic journey. It makes me wonder how much better games will be down the road when the technology catches up with the storylines and produces games that are as visually attractive as they are imaginative. This one is very imaginative but the graphics are primitive by todays gaming standards. That has generally been a problem with all RPGs.

You would think that for a game of this generation that many of the characters would at least talk to you, even if your response was text scripted. The fight scenes are distant and not that exciting once you've mastered the chain moves.I did like the story board and once in town the game was playable but, only until you have gotten your 50th or 60th quest (far too many).

In the beginning it was fun and I really didn't mind the now tedious load times. But after running back and forth from city to city and going between zones in the castle, I couldn't bear to play the game any more. The game needs to load: 1) when entering battle (from the world map), 2) when leaving a city and going to the world map, 3) when entering a city from the world map, and 4) sometimes in the cities and dungeons between zones. As I said, in the beginning it doesn't really bother you, but when you're looking for a certain person and can't remember which city they're in or which zone of the castle they're in, it gets frustrating watching the game load constantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Summonner- alrightbut yet bad","review":"This games graphics are awesome, but the one thing I hate about it is the way the dialogue is.

I bought it mainly for use on vacations or as something on which to audition tapes or discs when I don't feel like using my component system. Even for these limited uses, it is bad news.Despite its limited use, the CD player tends to skip on discs that play perfectly elsewhere. The tape player is even more unreliable. Sony puts sound mode settings on this unit, but they make absolutely no difference, regardless of the source. The sound quality at any setting is only fair at best. If you want \\"mega bass\\" (I don't particularly care), forget it. As with the sound modes, the button for mega bass is a fake.I hang on to it only because I don't use it enough to get sufficiently angry to smash it with an axe.

According to several reviewers, my enjoyment of that series will be curtailed by having read this prequel first. Oh, well. I still plan to read the rest of the books because I enjoyed this one so much. John Christopher makes a very interesting and effective choice when he chooses to tell his story entirely from the point of view of his adolescent protagonists. We know only what they know. Their lives go on fairly normally for a time, even after the Tripods have arrived on Earth. But things begin to go gradually wrong until, by the end of the book, the Tripods are firmly in control of the Earth and our protagonists are fleeing for their lives with every hand turned against them. Very good. And the Tripods' method of taking over is chilling."},{"rating":"2","title":"perhaps a little out-of-date, but still well-woven sci-fi for middle-grade boys","review":"I read the book _City of Lead and Gold_ and its sequels as a kid, and now I want to go back read them again. I really enjoyed this prequel. There's a lot of suspense and some though-provoking issues, not just in the sci-fi elements to the story (about the multi-stage invasion of earth by aliens), but also in the human relationships. Some young readers might find the book frightening, and others might find it insufficiently up-to-date (no mention of the internet or cell phones, for example). However, my son (a precocious 8 1/2) really, really liked _When the Tripods Came_, too. He even thanked me for giving it to him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Coming of Age\\" story used as prequel","review":"My children are aged 7-11, still to young to have discovered the wonders of science fiction. I am older, and am both a physicist, and an adherent of Gene Roddenberry's Prime Directive for dealing with alien cultures. Because of my background, I was predisposed to look for certain elements as I read the story to my kids. Instead, I was treated to a functional family operating in a completely disfunctional world. Laurie's father and his grandmother were unpredictably delightful in their realization of the situation and in their absurd actions. Minor characters such as the pilot, the policeman's wife, the member of the clergy, and the station policeman had much to say about today's society. The last third of the book was less exciting than their discovery of the Tripods or their first interactions with the Trippies, but may have been logically required as a prequel to the Trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eerie vision of Earth's first contact, reviewed by Dmitry","review":"John Christopher has done it again with his amazing prequel to his tripods trilogy. The main characters struggle to maintain normalcy in their lives when Earth is visited by mysterious alien visitors that come in the form of stoic and bizzare tripods. Soon the tripods take over the citizens of Earth using subliminal messages transmitted through television. Soon, the tripods land again, and the brainwashed humans flock to join them. Soon Earth is divided between caps and free, and the struggle is on. The heroes struggle to safety, and find refuge in the hills of Switzerland, leaving us with a tiny hope that the human race may yet save itself from the mysterious tripod invaders"},{"rating":"1","title":"my book revew","review":"I would recommend this book to someone who likes adventure, suspense, action, science fiction, and series. I liked this book because it keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's so exciting. I liked when the doctor hypnotized the main character's sister because he was a Trippy. He asked her what she needed to do and she said, \\"What ever the Tripod tells me.\\" She was totally brainwashed. Also, when his whole family had the hats on, they were trying to put one on him. They were saying, \\"Total happiness comes when you become one with the Tripod.\\" So, if you enjoy these kinds of books, this is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT EXLPLANTATIONS!","review":"I thought this book was well written. Perhaps not as well as the rest of the series, but it holds many good answers to the series that the rest do not answer. Very good description on how the world was taken over. Very interesting on how un-capped humans came to live in the White Mountains. I do have one suggestion: Read the first three books before reading this one. I think the magic in the series is NOT knowing how the Tripods and Masters took over the earth. This book was written as a prequal, a book made to explain things that were left out in the other books. If you read this one first, I do think the rest of the series: The White Mountains, The City of Gold and Lead, and The Pool of Fire, will not hold as much magic and imagination if you had read it last. Very good, very thorough, but meant to be the last read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cacofonix To The Rescue!","review":"This is one of the later Asterix adventures, and though not in the same league as the earlier ones, this still packs a punch.

This book was both written and illustrated by Uderzo. May be if Goscinny was there it might have turned out better. The drawings are drab and the jokes more stereo-typed than funny. It starts well, but after few pages the author doesn't know how to proceed. I am surprised that the author didn't do the usual research about the theme, here about India. Remember how the Asterix and Cleopatra turned out to be a master piece. Total lack of knowledge about India and its environments and relying solely on stereo-type based jokes ruined the storey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best blanket !!!","review":"This is the best, softest blanket out there..I know the price is pretty steep but it's wellworth it.

It is, however, completely joyless to read. The author complains time after time about poor and conflicting recordkeeping on the part of the builders and railroads about where the equipment actually went. Enough already-- a single disclaimer in the foreword or introduction (amply provided) would have sufficed! The author also takes a strong advocacy position in favor of the USRA designs, and completely dismisses the objections of the railroads. This may be justifiable in most cases, but what about the cases where the design really was flawed? And why must the reader be subjected to the author's defensive handwringing on this point so many times?Bottom line-- if you absolutely need a reference work on USRA equipment (but primarily in an accounting sense, and much less so in a technical sense), then buy the book.

Yu-i was born \\"in changing times\\" in China, so she made it her personal goal to be the first female in her family to break the cultural norms like foot-binding and women not being allowed to have an education. It covers many events, from Chinese foot binding and weddings, to the first divorce of China and how Chinese women are expected to wholly defer to their family's and husband's expectations. It is wonderful how the author blended historic and modern events into one story, and showed how difficult it is for one person to make such a leap between the times. Many of the events and issues in the book paved the way for today's modern society. This book would definately appeal to readers interested in history or different cultures."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent biography","review":"I learned about what it was like to be born a woman in China at the turn of the twentieth century when I was at high school. However, this book provides much in-depth information about the old Chinese customs-especially the role of Chinese women at the turn of the century. This book is filled with conflicts of traditional Chinese values vs. Western values. I admire Chang Yuyi's courage to tell her own story to her great-niece, Pang-Mei who took the time to write the story. Hsu Chi-Mo (Yu-i's ex-husband) was one of my famous writers since I was at junior high school. I read all poems, collected works, letters, essays, and diaries, etc. I was so fond of his romance with Luk Siu-Man. I learned that he had a \\"trouble marriage,\\" however, it is the first time I am able to read about the other side of his life through his ex-wife, Chang Yu-i.

Many of them are highly textured, but sadly, there are no charts. And since I'm a _very_ visual person, it just makes it that much harder to get the get-up and do one of these timeless designs. I'm working on my own charts so I'll actually know what I'm doing where on the cover sweater, but... I feel like I shouldn't have to.There are thirteen designs, and nine of them are highly textured, meaning to me, that I can't just put it down, go back later, look at it, and figure out where in the pattern I am. That, on more than a few sweaters, the design has no waist shaping, but it looks flattering on the models, showing curves nicely and disguising drop-shoulders. I don't go about with a clothespin in the middle of my back, and neither should the models. Gah."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pleasures of knitting","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Although the sweater on the outside cover is lovely, the rest of the sweaters were a disappointment. Most of the sweaters in the book had a boatneck top and lacked personality and shaping. I would have liked to see a larger variety of sweater styles. The instructions seem to be clearly written but who cares if the sweaters are not what you want. Sweater styles are not well suited for slightly heavier set women. You would probably need to be a size 8 or smaller for the sweaters to look good on you. Unless you like very simple boatneck style sweaters, I would pass on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"The patterns are boring, there are no charts and the sizing is for extra petite women only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The patterns are boring, unoriginal and uninspiring.

So today, I am ordering my second pair of these, and this time, I'll order them in a 9.5.Again, they are a great and comfortable boot, but if your normally worn size is at all tight on your toes, think about getting the next size up.

They are put through some extreme work environment conditions. One of them is on the highway, walking on asphalt. I suppose this is why the soles don't last as long as I would hope they would. Another is chemicals in the winter, such as brine, salt, calcium, & beet juice. Of course any of those chemicals are hard on all clothing products.For comfort I rate these top notch. Being this purchase was about my sixth pair of the 452's, I'm hesitant to even try anything else because there is literally no break in.

The author's use of obscure slang and 'clever' devices such as the 'book-within-a-book,' notes from the fictitious author and memos from his fictitious mentor combined to make a work of fiction so rambling and intensely annoying that I could not force myself to continue. If you love a good story, as I do, then you will probably find youself wondering, as I did, if the author will ever get to one.

Sure they wonder all over the place -- chapters jump from political topics to the draught to Indian yuppies, but for the casual reader, the essays are very entertaining and informatative. The effect is that of reading several short travelogues about India all in a row. Mehta writes well and makes some sharp observations about India's political development. I wanted to see more description of the various parts of India (the desert like areas versus the huge cities and vast fertile plains) because it is a land of such great contrasts. Most of the essays left me wanting to know more. I enjoyed the personal anecdotes from the author's childhood.

Going through this book allowed me to once again walk through the busy city streets and the quite village road.

Oddly reminiscent of the Star Wars theme, it is breezy, interesting, and beautiful. \\"Moon Dance,\\" the best track on the CD (perhaps tied with \\"The Secret, the Candle, and Love\\") follows and doesn't disappoint. At times odd, others sentimental, this is a compelling collection of New Age tracks that convey the mystery and beauty of the imagination. This music was a jumping off place for me; I can track my longstanding love affair with electronica and ambient back to DOWN TO THE MOON.If you really enjoyed this CD, I strongly recommend you also giveA Childhood Remembereda listen.

I love Morgan Freeman & Robert Redford's friendship throughout the film. It isn't the typical Blockbuster, but that's what makes it such a great film to watch. The way Redford's character bonds with his grand daughter was touching, and her concern for Freeman's character was a breath of fresh air! It was genuine, NOT contrived. Jennifer Lopez was lovely and Josh Lucas as the sheriff defending Lopez was wonderful! DEFINITELY worth the watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even the Bear Did a Great Job","review":"Wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much, but it was great. Jennifer Lopez as the victim of domestic violence, Morgan Freeman as the wise but bruised cowhand, and Robert Redford as the grumpy former father-in-law/unexpected grandpa were top notch. In the scene where Freeman's character meets the bear face to face, even the bear hams it up.This is a warm movie about forgiveness,companionship and the importance of family. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I picked it up only because it was filmed in and around the small town where I grew up: Ashcroft, B.C., Canada. (Sorry, people, but that's not really Wyoming.) It was actually a pleasant, thoughtful little film with some fine acting. Too bad the studio didn't try to market it when it was released in theatres."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated performances and a great story","review":"OK so a movie with Robert Redford and Jennifer Lopez and I'm thinking - ummmm.... not so much. Boy was I wrong.

Do yourself a favor and watch this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasse Hallstrom rules.","review":"He's simply the best film-maker ever for smart grown-ups. This fine film is yet another in a long series of knock-outs. He is an actor's director, with a particular knack for drawing fantastic performances out of kids.

Just a great experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made for TV kind of movie","review":"One would expect a lot from the film that is casting stars like: Robert Redford, Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Lopez. Alas, this film follows every possible formula that there can be in Hollywood. Rugged handsome rancher (Redford), hollier than thou ranchhand (Freeman) and floozy mom with pre-teen daughter (Lopez) have one thing in common: their lives were transformed by the death of young Griffin who was Lopez's husband, young Griff's father and son of the Redford's character. All characters have difficult time adjusting to each other since everyone's mere existance is a constant reminder of what could have been if the young Griffin was not killed in the car accident. But the plot is so predictive that this film falls into category of the made for TV movies. Quite a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film to generate discussion on forgiveness","review":"Saw this on cross-country flight and ended up buying a copy.

I am not usually impressed with J.Lo as an actress but she did a fine job here. The relationships are really strong in the story, well-defined, something for all ages.

I really didn't think I was going to like it as much as I did.It is about a woman who escapes from her abusive boyfriend and traveles to Wyoming to her dead husbands father who blames her for his sons death. The woman has a daughter named Griff. Now the father-in-law is taking care of a friend(Morgan Freeman) because he had an accident. So the more they stay there, the more the father-in-law starts getting attached to the little girl.

I recommend this movie to each who love family and realize just how important it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgiveness","review":"This is a movie about forgiveness. Redford blames Lopez for his son's death. Lopez shows up at his ranch needing a place to stay for a while with a granddaughter he never knew he had. As nature would have it, Redford falls for the little girl. Redford is getting old, but don't mess with his granddaughter. Lopez's abusive boyfriend finds this out the hard way. In the beginning, I thought the movie was going to drag, but then it took off. I ended up enjoying the movie and I think you will too. Redford continues enlightening us film after film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A under rated movie","review":"I have been quick to complain about movies I dont like that I forget to praise the ones I love.

Perhaps this letdown may explain the strange bimodal distribution of ratings Lives of the Monster Dogs earned on this page"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Like so many others, I \\"bit\\" the promotional brouhahaabout this book. As a lover of humans, dogs and New York, I expecteda lot more depth, and a lot more tying of loose ends. The ending was horrible, and the events leading up to it were never clearly resolved. It's almost as though Ms. Bakis got tired of writing, and wanted to finish quickly. Unfortunately, the glowing recommendations, and the disappointing reality make it difficult for me to hold great faith in other reviews. I guess I'll have to return to my old standby: The New York Times, and particularly Michiko Kakutani."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIZARRE","review":"This book begins with a good premise, however a good premise not well executed leaves much to be desired. The main character is not at all well developed and deserving of absolutely no sympathy. The plot meanders and eventually trails off into bits and pieces with an extremely unsatisfying ending. I did, however, think the author deserved two stars for her clear writing style. Perhaps one should approach a debut novel with a little less originality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy. Strange. Cool.","review":"\\"Lives of the Monster Dogs\\" is an easy read that somehow managed to creep me out. The prose flowed. The descriptions were beautiful. It felt...sad, for the most part.

If you like Twilight Zone-esque works of freaky fiction, sit down and have a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"A highly original debut novel","review":"For a first novel, Kirsten Bakis proves to be an assured craftsman. This is especially true considering how original her concept is. This is a hard novel to classify - it is not just a horror novel, or a science fiction novel, or an allegory. It is all those things and more, creating a truly unique dreamlike vision. The best parts of her novel is how well Bakis leads us into her world and how convincing she makes her talking dogs think and act. The opera libretto and the politics behind the dogs are quite good. The weakest part is the finale, where too much happens too fast (the fate of her friend Ludwig, the castle party, etc.) Still, this is a highly readable, thought provoking debut effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea: 5 stars; Implementation: 2 stars","review":"I agree with the many reviewers who were captivated by the author's creative idea.

Optimism dies hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...","review":"While the idea of dogs acting, feeling, thinking like humans is intriguing and certainly different, the level of writing in the book is unbearable. I have to say though, as a writer myself, it gave me hope. If this awful stuff can get published and get such unbelievable reviews, there's hope for all of us out there. We read it in my book group and the decision was unanimous -- DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bow Wow","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really did. But I couldn't. Perhaps Bakis should have started with something a little less ambitious.

Like my old English teacher used to say--learn the mundane before attempting the fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing","review":"I'm not the sort that logs on to websites to write bad reviews for the sake of slamming authors, but this novel is horribly written and among the worst I've read. As others have mentioned, the plot is full of holes and loose ends that are poorely accounted for. I agree with others who have said that New York's ability to accept rich, upright walking, talking dogs because New Yorkers are more hip is absurd and insulting. Equally insulting is the fact that this idiotic book won the Bram Stoker award. Go pick something, anything, else. For example, Harlan Ellison's \\"A Boy and his Dog.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"the work of an amateur","review":"I bought this book for the sake of the audacity of the concept. I (foolishly) thought that an idea this ridiculous must have something really exciting to redeem it in order to make it publishable, but simply stated, this is awful.Our suspension of disbelief wears off under the burden of implausibility never mitigated by any skillful artifice of the author, and soon there is just no getting past the perfectly dreadful prose. I found myself editing nearly every sentence, trying to shape those leaden and so often misaligned words into something a little more bearable. The plot(?) is just as amateurish as the prose, and the denouement is worse. No real need to go on about this monstrosity; I hated nearly everything about this in the end, and I found myself incredulous and angry that it had even been published."},{"rating":"1","title":"scary","review":"In reference to an earlier poster (the first one who gave it 1 star)- this woman is a creative writing professor.... scary, huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Odd, Interesting First Novel","review":"Kirsten Bakis has created an interesting fantasy with heavy doses of gothic about these dogs who talk and think and then party and die in her first novel, Lives of the Monster Dogs. It is ultimately a sad novel. It is written with the romanticism of past centuries in its truly Victorian sensibility, which is found in the writing. It could have gone a little farther in that direction, particulary in the Manhattan castle sequences which could have used a taste more of Mervyn Peake's neo-Gothic romanticism. The imagery would pull back a little just when it should have thrust forward but this is a minor quibble in an impressive first novel with a very original idea combined with a feel for the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"\\"Lives of The Monster Dogs\\" takes advantage of the best that creative novel writing has to offer...a truly unique idea which is well written and takes you to places you never expect to go.In short, the book is about a clan of half dog/half robot beings who move to New York after living in Canada since being invented by a young German boy in the 1800's. They become the toast of New York society life and live in opulance and grandeur.There. That is all you need to know. Now, read the book. \\"Lives of The Monster Dogs\\" is a terrific book, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting","review":"Being a dog lover, the title got me as did the book cover illustration. My first impression was \\"how is the writer going to make me believe in these talking dogs\\"--and I wasn't disappointed! The backstory was excellent as was the author's observation of humans, our society, our thoughts and those of the Monster Dogs. I fell in love with these creatures and by the end of the book, like the main character, I too, missed the monster dogs! This book is a great place to lose yourself at the end of a stressful day. I plan to read it again and highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, very poor execution...","review":"The idea of writing a novel about a race of soldier dogs perfected by a mad scientist should be enough for a decent science-fiction book... But in this title, the story comes together in a very poor manner... It is told from several points of view, and they all do not come together nicely at all... For instance, the man to whom the leader of the rebellion (Mops Hacker) is given a sa puppy, is chosen by Mops previous master because 'she had a strange fondness for Jedediah, whom she had several times caught in secret acts of kindness;' It turns out later that this Jedediah is a brute that is constantly beating Mops... Like these, the book is plagued with inconsistencies in its characters, and this reflects in the overall quality of this novel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"ARF","review":"Just the cover art and GREAT idea gave it 2 stars up front. And anything added to that would have been icing on the doggie biscuit... but the complete lack of doggie/person understanding that anyone who has ever enjoyed the company of ANY animal knows about is simply not there. Not in the least. Humans and animals communicate SO MUCH better than the fake dialogue here. And the sumptuous halls and limos and helicopters and panting (get it?) reporters just added to the lie. Such a fertile idea gone bad. BAD DOG!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a rich atmosphere isn't enough","review":"While the premise of this book is wonderfully original, and while the atmosphere is dark, rich and realistically crafted (yes, I accepted intelligent dogs in Prussian dress), I found the narrative weak and the characters dull. Nor could I find an underlying chemistry to support various relationships -- the deep friendship, for instance, between Cleo and Ludwig.For me, this was far from, as one reviewer said, \\"[a] dazzling, unforgettable meditation on what it means to be human.\\" Thematically, I saw nothing new, nothing \\"unforgettable.\\" The reviewer, I think, confuses appearance for substance: the atmosphere may have been impressive -- but impressive clothes do not the person make.The novel emerges, I think, as an original idea that at best, was mundanely crafted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don Imus would like this book.","review":"It's funny and edgy, and warm but not too sweet. It's adreamlike fairy tale without your typical fairy tale ending. Andthere's a photograph of Four-Legged Fred on the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"An intriguing premise leads to disappointment","review":"I bought this book after I heard it described on NPR; I thought any first novel with a title that good was worth a look. Unfortunately, the execution fails to live up to the premise. The writing is often thin, as in the frequent fictional excerpts from newspapers and magazine or journal entries in which the author's tentative voice never adapts to the tone of the purported source. The plot, which proceeds briskly, never really goes anywhere -- there are hints of sinister secrets that are simply left hanging, foreshadowing of malevolent intentions that either never surface or are frustrated too easily. The novel ends up feeling like a story that gets by on an eye-catching premise and nothing more.As a footnote, the premise never really adds up anyway. Why would anyone think that walking, talking, intelligent dogs would be the perfect super-soldier? Why not robots? Or gorillas? Or chimpanzees? Or, or, or... robots?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Distinctively unoriginal","review":"It is unfortunate that this book has received such wide publicity. There are too many good books out there and too little time to read them all. Hailed as original and inventive, it is a pale copycat of much finer works. For those seeking originality, read Patrick Suskind's Perfume, or anything by Philip K. Dick. But please do not waste your time on this predictable, ill-written drivel. Cujo is turning over in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"First, let me say that I really wanted to like this book. I liked the premise of it, and looked forward to reading it. However, I noticed a large plot hole in it and that spoiled the entire book for me. One of the author's premises was that the dogs were operated on to increase their intelligence, and had to be \\"re-fitted\\" with prosthetic hands as they grew up. But the rebel leader, Mops Hacker, was \\"thrown away\\" by the scientist who had worked on Mops' father. If Mops grew up in isolation, how did he gain intelligence? Who fitted him with his new prosthetic hands as he grew?? I had thought that, perhaps, the mating of the two \\"monster dogs\\" had produced a dog that did not need the operations. There was no indication of this in the book, however. I find it saddening that this was not noticed. I also found the ending to not be as good as the beginning of the book. It seemed almost \\"tacked on\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, poor ending.","review":"It's almost as if she gave up. I made the mistake of recommending this to some friends while I was still in the first hundred pages. For a while it's really a cool story. Theres some dark and original stuff going on, and the book moves at a strong pace. Around page 113 it started to seem like the author had run out of steam. The concept just wasn't enough to base a story around. She phoned the last half of the book in. I kept reading, hoping that the end would reveal some redeeming twist, only to be more and more dissapointed. Thank god none of my friends took my advice and bought this crappy book. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like dog hair stuck to your socks.","review":"Wow, what a mess. I was patient. I sat like a good girl and even rolled over a couple times. This book is a GREAT idea but was so poorly written. The first third was interesting. The second third was a yawn. Cleo doing this and that for one dog or another but trying to keep it a secret from another dog. Secrets and limos. The last third of the book seemed so rushed that I am speechless! The great cover and inside description are going to suck in a lot of readers. I saw it...tilted my head to the side, and snatched it (thank goodness for libraries). But beware. This is not a goose pimple book. The descriptions are not lyrical."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it haunting, unforgettable, and touching.","review":"The thing I love about Tolkien's Lord of the Rings is that he convinces me that he is not being whimsical, and that he is not making it up as he goes along. For me, \\"Lives of the Monster Dogs\\" has the same quality.I found it convincing. The city of Rankstadt, the dogs' opera, the genuinely horrifying depiction of the young Augustus Rank--I think these will stick in my mind forever.It does not surprise me at all that the book does not work for everybody. And, yes, I thought the ending was weak.Still, I wish Cleo and Lydia the best. I hope that Ludwig will meet \\"I, Claudius\\" in some literary Valhalla; I believe they would like each other. And I will certainly look for the ruins of Neuhundstein the next time I find myself in New York City after 2011.Is it just my imagination, or does something about the expression and bearing of the author, as shown on the back flap of the cover, resemble that of the monster dog on the front cover?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a dog","review":"I really wanted to like this book. A wonderfully creative concept serves as the story's skeleton, but the author's writing and plotting failed to bring the creation to life for me. Her prose style is occasionally luminous, but not often enough so to make up for gaping plot holes, a lackluster pace, and a weak-willed protagonist. Ultimately an unsatisfying read made all the more disappointing by the squandered potential of its high concept and an obviously talented writer unable to quite fit all the pieces together in this debut novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I NEED a sequel ;)","review":"I'm a huge dog lover and found this story of walking, talking, intelligent dogs very interesting. There is a sad undertone to the whole story and an underlying thread of darkness , cruelty and the grotesque (the cow, the cow!). Very original and imaginative. The only small complaint I have, and it is because of the way the story is being told (in journal entries and by several different points of view) I'm unable to become connected to any one character or know any of them on an intimate level.My only complaint? I do wish it hadn't ended with so many questions left unanswered."},{"rating":"2","title":"Monster Dogs - amazing","review":"This is one of the most amazing books I've read in a very long time.Well written story that is haunting, yet captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concept with enormous potential thwarted by amateur writing & lack of forethoughtf","review":"I was intrigued by the idea but it was so poorly written that I was frustrated, almost angry, that the author failed to deliver. The book felt like an under-worked high school creative writing project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Job!!!","review":"I am amazed by the polarity of the reviews for this book. Some reviewers find her prose noxious- I find Ms. Bakis to be a highly skilled writer- The story is brought forward using a series of diaries and letters, a news paper story, a Vanity Fair article, and the libretto of an Opera. All of these different documents rang true for me.Beyond the question of technical skill, the story actually impacted my dreams. As I was reading it, I was cognizant of reading one of the best books I have ever read. I loved the juxtoposition of the costumed Dogs (which have the potential to be sort of silly- like dogs do) and this stunning sense of tragedy- how fragile and beautiful things are- and what happens to them when time rolls on?I don't know if this review will help you- It seems you will either love Monster Dogs or absolutely hate it- but you won't be unmoved by it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Scientifically engineered dogs escape their mad maker and go to New York City. The writing is poor and the characters are weak. The way the story unfolds is cliched. What I'd thought a good premise degenerated into the banal and predictable.

Might have worked as a cheesy 50's sci-fi movie or comic book, but as a novel it doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"OK, so I bought the hype too. And then I bought the book. What I got was one completely undeveloped idea, careless writing, and a vague narrative voice that boldly apologizes for absolutely sophomoric plot twists (if a book without a plot can be said to have plot twists, that is). Maybe dogs would enjoy this book. I sure didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Awful","review":"Grossly underdeveloped characters. Ridiculously unresearched scientific ramifications necessary to make the dog-to-near-human transformations even remotely plausible.

I think the oval shape is so brilliant and I can think of so many other dishes I can make rather than just boiling pasta alone. The stews, chicken noodle soup etc come out so beautifully and I used this to substitute for a dutch oven to cook beef stew and it came out so perfect. It is so roomy as well and I can actually throw much more veggies in there to any type of dish than I normally would.I am by all means not a chef but this pot is only the beginning of many many more wonderful dishes to come. I highly recommend this great pot. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid little pot","review":"Yes, it is giid for pasta.

I think I might just add it to my collection sometime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good biography of a true genius","review":"John von Neumann was a prodigy's prodigy, the likes of whom rarely grace the earth. Norman McRae is one of the few intrepid biographers who have dared to take on von Neumann's phenomenally accomplished life. As was to be expected, McRae wasn't equal to his subject, but the book is still extremely worthwhile.I wished that McRae had put more effort into describing the science of von Neuman's work - Aspray did an excellent job in describing his contributions to computer science - and spared us some his thoughts on the Japanese economy. Nevertheless, this is a good, if imperfect book, and one of the best on John von Neumann."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Through Biography","review":"After reading two chapters it is obvious that the biography was very well researched. It does provide an in depth insight into John Von Neuman but fell short in detailing the positive effects of all his abilities.

Working with professional photographer Laurie Roberts, who captures images of these writers in their home settings, Kaminsky provides insights into the personal lives and inspirations of Sue Grafton, Donald Westlake, Faye Kellerman, Lisa Scottoline and other modern notable authors who have made major impacts on the genre.

Unless you want to know how Sara gardens or how brilliant Jonathan's children are, or how forgetful Tony is, there's not much to be had here.Maybe my expectations were wrong. I've been re-reading the masters of American noir: Hammett and Chandler to name two. I expected the authors to be more aware of that tradition, and for Kaminsky to spend more time exploring the authors' place in the mystery genre. My mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"amateur hour","review":"Considering its potential, this book is almost a total dud.

It's been offered twice before with different cover art. At least in the past both versions stated that it was the Musikladen TV series performances.I feel ripped off for buying something that I already own, when the package art ??intentionally?? makes no note of details of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imbalanced, inessential","review":"This book, Pynchon's earliest published short story, puts on display the traits that will make Pynchon one of the finest English-language writers ever: a free-wheeling imagination; a catholic, encyclopaediac store of knowledge; a troubled morality; and a capacity to be damn funny.If you've read _V_ or the short story \\"Entropy\\", you've seen this setup before: a college party and a protagonist operating within that system. There are very good reasons it was left out of _Slow Learner_: the humor is forced, the ideas aren't fully formed, and the whole thing is an exercise in imperfection. Which is not to say it's meritless -- the protagonist and the plot live in my brain still, two years since I first read it.It can be found online, however, and even if it couldn't, thirty dollars is a bit steep for a piece like this. If you must get it, get all of his other published fiction first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I waited a long time before i got this book and i was so disappointed.Given the title the least they could have done was have profiles of the immortals which because of the format of the show was often difficult to follow.A chronology would have saved this disaster ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete: A Keeper for EVERY Highlander fan!","review":"This book will be the MOST complete recording of all the Immortals.

It's a must have for Donna fans because there is nothing more to find on dvd than the 'Live And More Encore!' concert. That's the only reason. I know fans like me are waiting for a complete videoclip collection on dvd like 'Endless Summer' with the clips we're still missing everywhere like 'The Woman In Me' etc. Of course with clips 'Melody Of Love' and 'I Will Go With You' included. That would be the perfect collection! This is only a give-away, nothing special. Further it still sad not to have any visual stuff from Donna's supreme disco days.

In the preface of the book the authors explain how they learned a lot while writing the book and I just wish that they would have already had a good grasp of the whole concept before they began. The book tells you everything that you could possibly want to know about the program but it does not join it all together in a way that is easy to understand. If in fact you were to study the book really hard I have no doubt that you would master the program as the authors have, but you will have spent a lot of time doing it.

It is easy to understand. A great smattering of humor is used throughout (at least one of the authors I think may be a Peter Sellers fan).One bonus is the authors are very active and approachable in the forums and mailing lists dealing with Adobe GoLive and they have a web site devoted to the book and the program with updates, news, helpful hints and tons of resources."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful little book!","review":"the author is many times blessed to have such a creative, literary, and wise mother ... i can only imagine that these traits must be genetic! anyone who wants a glimpse into a magical childhood should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Raven","review":"I love the Cassie Edwards savage series.

The video is divided into sections based on muscle groups (abs, triceps, chest, shoulders) but each section features only one model. Since I wasn't enthused about most of the men, it was a grind to watch each very long section (except the shoulder portion).The lower body video is better in my opinion.

These are three great Ayumi Hamasaki songs and I was a little worried that they might be ruined... My fears were completely ungrounded.

Carreras and Te Kanawa are fine as Emil and Nellie and the great Sarah Vaughan (one of the greatest voices of ALL time) is a standout as Bloody Mary. It is worth the price of the CD just to hear Madame Vaughan sing \\"Bali Hai\\". The one piece of miscasting in this album, I feel, is Mandy Patinkin as Lt. Joe Cable. I feel that the role should be sung by someone with more of a Mario Lanza type sound. I'm not even remotely suggesting that Jerry Hadley is another Lanza, but he certainly would have delivered more of the appropriate sound for the role. Patinkin is great as Sancho Panza or Che in Evita, but Lt. Cable is, I feel, just a little too much for him. Carreras would have made a fine Cable, except for his accent. Madame Te Kanawa sounds absolutely fantastic as Nellie Frobish. I still prefer the sound of Ezio Pinza as Emil Du Beque, but this is still definitely an album worth having nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Hot","review":"Kiri Te Kanawa(with her British accent) as Nellie Forbush of Little Rock, Arkansas?!!!

The final note of that song is exquisite. I still prefer the movie version of \\"Bali Ha'i.\\" Sarah Vaughn's version of that song is interesting too, but it won't haunt me to my grave the way the movie version will.

But unfortunately something did not click with this book. I have to admit that the so called \\"New Interpretation\\" by the author has left an overall sense of confusion in me. I personally did not enjoy the translation, interpretation and presentation of the content. While reading this book I almost felt like eating at a fast food of philosophy where great content is thrown down your throat in small bites, just to appeal to a wider audience, maybe in a rush!?!I do not believe this book is worth recommending to anyone.

The use of phrases such as \\"strike it rich\\" do not so much give a contemporary feel as jar the reader.

He was born in a GREEK area of whatorigianlly was part of the Greek Byzantine empire, later underRoman rule and now known as Turkey. He spent time in Romebut was exiled to his Greek area where he lived theremainder of his life and died.If an \\"interpreter\\" omits out a full and accurate accountof the ethnic and geographic origins of an author, thereby\\"interpreting\\" what are known facts, I can not trust thecontents; they too are likely to be misleading, and unscholarly;with ommissions that amount to a misrepresentationand therefore, a lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"notification of typo in book description","review":"Sirs: In the Amazon provided title for this book, they spelt part of the title wrong, with: 'mannual', rather than the correct 'manual'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stoics: The people who don't care...","review":"I read some part of the book in the university library.

Serves me right, I suppose.I'm embarrassed to have bought this book. It is the very definition of glurge. I hate the idea of throwing a book in the trash, but on the other hand, passing it along to someone who might actually end up considering it a legitimate presentation of Epictetus feels like a crime as well. I guess I could hand it off to my sister-in-law who goes in for all that Chicken Soup crap--it's not like scholastic integrity particularly matters to her.Oh well. After I post this I'll do what I should have done in the first place: search Amazon and choose a decent edition of the Discourses and/or the Enchiridon.Again: I apologize to everyone I've ever respected for (inadvertently, I swear!) paying actual money for this pap. I feel like I have helped sponsor an act of academic terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthwhile purchase...look elsewhere","review":"The words of Epictetus are sound advice and valuable to any seeker of knowledge. However, Sharon Lebell manages to make his words sound like fridge magnet philosophies more than reasoned tracts. In the brevity and condensation much is lost. Of the 113 pages (not 144 as stated) many are only third of a page (or less) 'soundbites'. It is more of a pamphlet than a book and not worth the cover price. Lebell adds nothing to the words of Epictetus and manages somehow to make his philosophies less potent. Fortunately, if she is truly a student of Stoic philosophy, my review shouldn't bother her in the least. For a fantastic look at the Stoic philosophy and it's modern application I suggestA Guide to the Good Life: The Ancient Art of Stoic Joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I agree with the reviewer from Florida. This \\"interpretation\\" of the Enchiridion is a disappointment. Even if you don't mind the rather 'feel-good' editing job of S. Lebell, one still feels shortchanged as she has set up yet another layer of infidelity to the original text beyond simple translation. Not being able to read Greek or Latin, I like as little interference between myself and the original texts as possible. In general, this book was a waste of my money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Epictetus vs Sharon Lebell","review":"This book is the bad Hollywood remake of a classic film. I think previous reviews are split into two different categories - one set reviewing the thoughts and ideas of Epictetus (who deserves 5 stars), the other reviewing sham 'author' Sharon Lebell (who deserves 1 star). The source material being abused here is absolute genius. Sadly it gets butchered by a woman who by her own admission doesn't know Latin and had no idea who Epictetus was until the publisher approached her and asked her to 'write' this book. The translator is never revealed (bad sign), but previous reviews are correct that the actual text has been stretched, paraphrased, and regurgitated into lame self-help-isms. It's a testament to the power of the original work that some of the main the ideas still come through. Forget the terrible remake, go watch the original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise advice in a complex world","review":"As a parent,as a professional commodities trader, as a coach, I find this book extremely helpful in my daily life. I use it as a spritual excercise manual. Keep it simple; if the translation wavers from the actual writings, so be it. To find better parental advice, I wish you good luck. To be able to deal with what you have been dealt, read this manual. As a gift to all my players, I pass this little book to them. I give Sharon Lebell credit for what she has attempted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The epithets without the shalts and whatnots.","review":"I love reading the sayings of men and women from long ago. In this short volume, I got the gist without having to wade through pages of outdated langage. If you are a lazy reader like me, not prone to dig for \\"meat\\", this is the version for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Document or Self Help?","review":"I bought this book for a Roman History class, thinking I was buying a primary source document, in a translation true to Epictetus's writing. However, I quickly realized that this wasn't so. In a side by side comparison with a translation by W.J.Oates, Professor of Classics at Princeton U. in 1957, there are numerous additional passages, and some very different meanings, with several words of wisdom that are not to be found in Professor Oates translation. Whether these were found later, I can't testify to, but this translation would make a fine, politically correct, self help book, but as a piece of historical writing, it doesn't pass the historian's litmus test."},{"rating":"2","title":"It introduced me to Epictetus","review":"I liked this book but the criticisms by the other reviewers about the loose translation are well taken. After reading the reviews I was curious and searched for another translation to see for myself. I am currently reading the translation by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, and I find it easy to read and it seems to be a more thorough rendering of the thoughts of Epictetus which makes his philosophy better understood in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep this on your bedstand","review":"Some people rely on medication (alcohol, tranquilizers, sleeping pills), or mindless television programs, mystery novels, or meditation to escape the traumas of daily living. Anything that is outside our control can be quashed, submerged or forgotten if only we can get to sleep. But here is a tiny book that will change all that for you. Sharon Lebell's \\"updated\\" version of the philosophy of Epictetus offers that preferred closure of night with a reminder of our individual worthiness, of what we can and cannot control, how to encounter and embrace living with the feeling of the nuturing support of a mother, father, lover, friend, God, Buddha, etc. At times clumsy in verbiage, at equal times eloquent in simplicity of statement, Lebell allows us to re-enter the journey of life enriched with wisdom from a man of simple secrets. Guaranteed to help you turn out the light ......and to wake up refreshed in the morning. Just keep this little tome at bedside for daily/nightly doses."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're interested in Epictetus, this is NOT the book for you.","review":"If, on the other hand, you're interested in a handful of watered-down pithy sayings, \\"interpreted\\" (not translated) by a feel-good self-help maven who had never heard of Epictetus before her publisher approached her with this money-making idea, then jump right in!The author admits that she didn't even know of Epictetus before being asked to write this book and had reservations about what a \\"dead white guy\\" might have to offer her. She doesn't know ancient Greek, is unaware of the subtleties of his language, is ignorant of the historical events and schools of thought that shaped his thinking, regularly distorts his meaning and has produced nothing but a few little inspirational sayings.But hey, it sells.If you're not familiar with Epictetus, you will get a very distorted view of him through this book.If you are familiar with him, you will probably be horrified at the ways this book dumbs him down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"I was hoping for an accessible Epictetus and instead I get \\"Chicken Soup for the Stoic Soul\\". If you're interested in understanding Epictetus, or Stoic thought in general you'll be sorely disappointed with this book. What's presented here is far better suited for a page a day calendar than a book (though given how meager the contents are, I doubt it would make it much past mid-summer)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Play yard","review":"I just bought this play yard and I love it the bassinet feature is a life saver since I am brestfeeding and my 3 month old daughter sleeps in our room.

The author often has to stretch to tie her point to her examples but was keeping my interest. And then it happened! What so many of today's \\"accomplished\\" writers can't avoid.A completely useless and bombastic attack on the Bush administration stuck in the middle of the book. Whatever your political views, these pages are confused and embarassing. A nice 3-4 star book of criticism and advice destroyed because our author could not contain her hatred and bile. My reading group (2 conservatives, 2 moderates and 3 liberals) voted 7-0 to stop discussing this book after hitting this passage. Leave political commentary to the hundreds of hacks across the spectrum."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lterary tour","review":"A great tour of the novel landscape, with Smiley's typical insight and deft use of language.

Each time more pencil marks are added, particular passages are emphasized yet again. Smiley's essays are thoughtful and present views seldom discussed in other books on writing. I particularly enjoy the chapters titled Psychology and the Novel and Morality and the Novel. My copy sits on self reserved for my most frequented books on writing. Obviously, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive book on odds-line making","review":"Mark Cramer, The Odds on Your Side (Cynthia Publishing, 1990)Widely regarded as the definitive book on setting an odds line in your Thoroughbred handicapping, and for good reason. Cramer, who's authored a number of excellent handicapping tomes, spends a couple of hundred pages on the concept of value and how to achieve it. His greatest strength is his simple asserion, backed up with a number of examples, that there is no mechanical formula to be used; it's different for every race. He illustrates handicapping as art, rather than the handicapping-as-science approach used by many other books. Definitely a work that belongs in the bookshelf of every horseplayer, casual or serious. **** 1/2"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's favorite","review":"This is the best book I have ever purchased for my daughter. She brings it everywhere with her including the car and bed. We spend hours everyday quizzing each other on the animal's names and the noises they make. The pictures are life-like and colorful and the book is age appropriate even for the youngest children because there are no paper pages to be torn. Crayon also wipes off the pages nicely. I not only recommend this book, but the entire collection, which I am eager to get my hands on after the wonderful results I've had with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for a \\"First\\" Book","review":"The pictures are very nice.

The picture are always vivid, contrasting, colorful, and captivating. The quality and durability are always excellent. The pages are always easy to turn. The teaching/learning is always intuitive for parents/children. It's easy for a book to claim to be developmentally appropriate for children; this book really is. This line of books, as well as another line of tactile-learning touch-and-feel books, have always been hits in our household. Additionally, I've given them as baby-shower and first-birthday gifts several times, and I've seen friends list them on their new baby wishlists, so their fame and desirability appears to be widespread."},{"rating":"1","title":"This scale is a piece of garbage!","review":"I bought this scale to do small kitchen measurements.

It is definitely not floral, citrus-y, or woody. It's as if you just took a shower and have the fresh scent of laundered clothing on. And the great thing is that it is unisex, and my brother who does not like strong scents likes this.I would say this scent is great for people who like scents that are soothing and soft - versus ones that invoke energy (Clinique Happy or Ralph Lauren Blue or other Citrus-like scents) OR sophistication (Chanel).Try it before you buy it at Sephora."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(f,null,y(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(E,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-3baf7258"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/57.md","filePath":"guide/57.md"}'),j={name:"guide/57.md"},z=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{P as __pageData,z as default};
