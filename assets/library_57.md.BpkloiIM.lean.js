This collection is a good way to get most of their essential tracks without breaking the bank on rare or import albums. It collects the bulk of fine tracks from \\"Side Trips\\" and \\"Beacon From Mars\\" and some bits and pieces from their other albums. Many of the songs here are highly memorable and will stay with you forever (at least the music if not the lyrics). Raga, jugband folk and psychedelia and some of what you'll find integrated into these songs, the fact is nothing was considered taboo when the sounds of these songs were created. If you like pschedelia, be sure to grab this as it's well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five thumbs up","review":"When I first bought this book, years ago, I thought it would last me part of the way across the Pacific (12+ hours). I couldn't finish the Introduction, and before I gave up, had disgraced myself several times by laughing out loud, wiping tears from my eyes, doubling-up, and ensuring the seat next to me became vacant. Flight attendants kept a keen eye on me all the way from Sydney to LAX. I had no better success on the return trip (12+ hours). I have progressed no further on subsequent, very determined, attempts to read this book, in all sorts of conducive \\"I WILL read this\\" situations. It is dangerous if you have a) had an operation in the past several years, b) have bladder trouble or c) try to read it when your wife is trying to sleep. Be warned. It is light years beyond hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"How insulting","review":"I believe Dave Barry is trying to be funny, but I find this book completely insulting ... to guys, to women, and to his readers.

I'm quite surprised no one has reviewed this yet.. well this edition of the book anyway. This was the first Dave Barry book I ever read, I was snooping around the Paul Reiser(enough with the Paul Reiser!) area in the library hoping there'd be some more funny books and found this one. Well I was not disappointed. It is.. extremely funny. It caused me to pursue further Dave Barry books, although I must say this is probably funnier than the rest. I showed bits to friends and they could not stop laughing (especially the sex bit..whoo whoo). It is a pity that Dave Barry is not really known in Australia since few people borrowed this book. I would personally promote this book vigorously to other readers but I'd just end up annoying them again. Oh what do they know. This is one of those great books where the humour is not strained like some books where you know they're trying to be funny and frankly, they're not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys","review":"This book is horrible - not at all funny. Waste of money - good thing it was relatively cheap. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"From a big Dave Barry fan","review":"I love Dave Barry's writing. This one is short and sweet, the perfect size. He talks about the difference between men, boys, and the topic of the book: guys! He really puts down the male, and being one myself, I can not blame him. He discusses the simple-minded-ness of guys and their stupidity. For instance, he talks about a true story where a guy siphons off gasoline with a vacuum cleaner (just picture the result of such stupidity). Of course he picks the extremes of guys, but bashes the whole gender for acting like these few. It is absolutely hilarious. This was my second favorite Dave Barry book, right next to Dave Barry's Money Secrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-down funniest book I've read","review":"Dave Barry's Complete Guide to Guys is, hands-down, the funniest book I've ever read.I laughed myself silly reading excerpts at my sister's house six hours before leaving the country, and had to endure weeks of waiting to get my own copy after returning home overseas.I also got one for my best friend as a present - she didn't get too far before her husband took it (he wanted to know why she was laughing so hard) and wouldn't give it back till he's finished it himself. He kept saying, \\"Does this guy KNOW me?!\\"....Dave Barry's humor takes the nuggets of truth from ordinary life and expands them into something hilarious. It's one of the few humor books that I've been able laugh over multiple times - and, surprisingly, to learn from. His explanation of guys and relationships was a real eye-opener!Dave Barry at his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a book for every student","review":"I know I have a biased opinion of this book since I worked on the lab manual that accompanies this book. That said, I can't pass up the opportunity to recommend this book to my fellow biology teachers. This book is going to change the way kids learn biology. The intergrated nature of the web activities and the clean, uncluttered, focused writing of the textbook will make biology understandable to students who get lost in a sea of vocabulary. Campbell's vision for this program was to collaborate with a team of classroom teachers to create a textbook, website and lab program that are designed to work together in a dynamic, pracical way for real kids - well it worked.

The subwoofer only works in certain modes and does not function when you want it to most in the full surround sound mode. Philips must have some sort of quality control issue with these units, so buyer beware. I called Philips to inquire about this issue and their so-called toll free \\"help\\" line was little help at all. Until Philips get this bug resolved, I cannot recommend this unit. For me, the receiver was defective right out of the box. The remote control is terribly designed and not at all intuitive. You will probably want to throw the remote away after a few hours of scratching your head trying to make it work. Caveat emptor on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this DVD if you love New York","review":"This is a must-buy for anyone who loves New York, and particularly the vastly different city of the late 50's and early 60's. If you like NYPD Blue, you'll go crazy over this gritty but heartwarming TV series. For fans of Diahann Carroll who stars in one of the episodes, it is a memorable experience as she protrays a teacher of blind children, one of whom is lost during a field trip. He must rely on his instincts and fortitude to make it back to his home in Brooklyn from mid-town Manhattan.Another of the four memorable episodes in this single DVD stars a young Robert Duvall who finds that his naive kindness toward a young girl lands him in trouble with the police.When I was growing up, I watched Naked City on a snowy black and white TV. The clarity of this DVD is outstanding. The poignancy of the stories, the beauty of New York, and the excitement of city life caught by the cameras resulted in my moving to the city as fast as I could get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why no release of the entire series?","review":"Everything the other reviewers have said is correct: the acting and writing are memorable, and the street scenes of NYC c. 1960 could never be duplicated in studio. Plus, the series had one quality sorely lacking in movies and television in today's postmodern cynical world-heart.So why, when junk is released every week, hasn't Naked City been given a proper series-wide release?Perhaps twenty episodes have been made available, and those only in piecemeal distribution. Someone needs to release the entire series."},{"rating":"1","title":"cabellas big game hunter","review":"the games video and audio are not the best i've seen or heard. as for as the animal selection, it stinks. the guns and other equipment just don't cut it. personally i would not purchace it and i would not recomend anyone buy it. i wish i didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bead Molasses","review":"I have been using this product since I was first married.

The NY Times reviewer is wrong about this one; not even the \\"kitty porn\\" is sufficient to compensate for the lack of suspense, character development, and decent dialogue. The evildoers are evident in the first chapter, yet by the end nothing is revealed of the 'why' or 'how' of their crimes. Two people die in the book, for heaven's sake, and more exposition is given to the petty theft of a doll and other knickknacks. I'd recommend that cat lovers like myself look to authors such as Cleveland Amory for their feline fix, and seek their mysteries elsewhere"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware the Sharp Dressed Man","review":"Strange things are happening in Pickax.

Ms. Braun has a wonderful sense of pace, character, plot and subtle humor that is completely missing from this book. I am unable to read beyond the first chapter because the writing is pedestrian and feels to me like someone's notes for a novel, rather than the carefully crafted final version. Ms. Jackson has always drawn me in right away with her special tone and storytelling ability. This current volume completely lacks all of the qualities that have made me a faithful follower of Koko and his chosen person Qwilleran.

No, the elders of Zion are not taking over the government. 80% of Jews still vote Democratic despite the fact that the right is significantly more supportive of Israel that the left. But the main focus is not Israel but America. Unlike paleoconservatives, neoconservatives are typically ex-liberals who split with the left first over foreign policy (because the left viewed commies benignly as liberals in a hurry rather than the totalitarians they are) and then over domestic cultural issues. As a non-Jew, I can attest that this work will resonate deeply with those who have spent too much of their lives under the spell of the sixties counterculture.

Day sounds relaxed on such numbers as Love Me or Leave Me, and Ten Cents A Dance, and she sounds fine'n'groovey on Shakin' The Blues Away and Sam The Accordian Man. This could be called \\"Doris Day Sings Ruth Etting\\", and it is a classic, and may be one of day's classiest efforts. If you think Day did nothing jazzworthy since leaving Les Brown, think again, and pick thsi cd up, and then go find the cd's where dodo sings with the Page Cavanaugh Trio, and get the Young Man With A Horn cd, where ol' dodo sings with the Harry James trio!

The selections and performance are some of the finest in motion picture musicals. To hear Day sing SHAKING THE BLUES is surely worth the disc alone.

This cd will make you a fan of Ms. Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive Doris Day album","review":"This is probably Doris Day's best album, a collection of songs that reminds the listener why she was--and is--considered one of the very best of the popular singers.

The story was not engaging and I expected more from a sequel. The action animation was not riveting, at least not to Marvel Comics standards. The story didn't flow very well which leads me to blame the over-all direction. Hard to say what they could've done to make this one better.

I thought it would make a fine jumping off point for a franchise. With Avengers 2, a leap is taken, but backwards. I'm not sure who their audience is supposed to be. It's got way too many \\"relationship issues\\" for kids and the adults will be turned off by lazy continuity and average-at-best animation.I can appreciate the need to make a movie for the masses, but have a little respect for the history. The costumes we grew up with have all been streamlined,(removing Cap's wings? Please.) and the characters are all cliches. Not to mention the re-ethnicizing of Nick Fury and the Black Panther apparently raiding Batman's closet. All in all a real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than the First DVD.","review":"I guess the production team does learn from their mistakes.

I thought it was much too graphic for children. Furthermore the story resembles the pilot series of the \\"Justice League\\". I expected better from Marvel.I guest it's just the signs of the times. I mean kids are so accustomed to seeing blood and gore in their video games, why not their cartoon series, right? No wonder, some have no qualms about pulling guns on peers and shooting them in the head.I cannot in good conscience recommend this DVD to children.

I think it is great that marvel has finally started putting out some great cartoon movies to show us in motion what these heroes can do. The first Ultimate Avengers was cartoon-violent at times, but I thought that is was ok for my 5 year old daughter to watch. But the second Ultimate Avengers, I thought this one took it a little too far. There is a lot of hacking and slashing, a lot of really brutal fight scenes, and not alot of the Avengers. Usually hero violence is punching the badguy out, or throwing him through a wall, but in this film they are trying to kill, and that is hard to watch with a child in the room. I watched it once with my daughter, and ended up covering her eyes for portions of this film. For me, I kinda liked it, but I won't watch it very often. For my daughter, I wouldn't want her to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad ... and entertaining!","review":"I saw the first one so I know what to expect. It is not a surprise some of the darker storylines, particularly the part about Hank & Janet, were toned down since they probably need the kid market.Given that, the film is actually pretty entertaining. The animation is a bit better than the first one although still not up to par to the best JLU. I like the characters. They are a bit more edgy than the DC super heroes.The plot is ok and I like the addition of the Black Panther.

So disappointed and sad that he loved it but it wasn't as \\"new\\" as they claim it to be. Asked the seller for my $$ back and I did and they let me keep the book.

The author is primarily known as a fiction writer.

I didn't think the premise needed documentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"I had read Alain's earlier book on the Consolations of Philosophy and caught parts of the TV series concerning this book. It is a difficult book to describe but I believe thought provoking and comforting are probably best. Alain considers why we are drawn to certain styles of homes and the assumptions architects and engineers have made in constructing homes and cities. I would read sections of the book then put it aside to consider the matters he had raised. This book explained my unease in some houses and love of others. I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to write nothing about something","review":"This book is full of fluff.

It can be a bit pedantic at times, but it is also one of the only books w/o references to FLW, whose examples of architecture are full of ego and generally don't follow the first rule of architecture (for me) stated above. Very refreshing and a worthy read for those starting out or who wish to revisit their original precepts and principals."},{"rating":"2","title":"If a philospher had eyes","review":"I have given copies to a Zen priest and an award winning architect thinking they would both be exhilerated if not inspired.

This makes it very difficult to read because as you know, the mind gets ejected out of a passage each time it comes across something foreign to it. I love my Kindle but this seems to be a common problem with ebooks. The publishers seem to just paste the copy from the book to the ebook without looking at it, meaning artifacts that made sense on the fixed page such as hyphens still exist out of context on a reader that is much less static. If this were a printed book we'd demand our money back and I might just do that with the digital. $9 for a book that doesn't physically exist except as ones and zeros... well, I'll say that it better be perfect to command that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Architecture of Happiness","review":"De Botton is primarily an essayist.

I would recommend the book if you have any interest in architecture at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"archi student","review":"Although I would certainly agree that De Botton is a talented and captivating writer, I feel that \\"The Architecture of Happiness\\" falls well short of a serious examination of architecture and its ideals. This book is perfect for anyone who possesses a casual interest in architecture. The more serious architecture student or architecture aficionado, however, will find little valuable content in this book. Some of the conclusions that De Button reaches are not well thought out (and frankly a waste of time to consider critically) in that the book tends to focus upon superficial aspects of architecture. De Button should not be mistaken for a serious critic or architecture historian.

Forget labels. Ms. Angier's study debunks predetermination by gender. Her investigation blends scientific, medical studies, history and art into an eloquent and inspiring work.Representing another look into female biology, Five Minutes to Orgasm Every Time You Make Love - For Women Only debunks many of the proffered myths of our society, specifically that women are slower than men to reach orgasm. Why not? As Ms. Angier reveals, the clitoris contains 8,000 nerve fibers, effectively doubling the pleasure of the penis. Both books help change the image that women are in any way \\"less than\\" men.

It would be nice if the Neurotic folks could put together a volume 4. Certainly if you like Christmas music, you'll enjoy this.

I didn't test the equalizer function.I really like Behringer products, having experienced and being very impressed with 4 sharks, a mixer/amp headunit, two unpowered main speakers and a powered monitor, all of which far exceeded expectations.Amazon of course sent a prepaid return label, and promptly refunded my money, which is great for them as a company, but can't raise my rating of 1 star on this product.I've also had a Behringer C1 mic arrive dead on arrival. Sigh. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is worth it!","review":"I recieved this album as a gift, and from day one I have absolulty loved it.

It cheers me, calms me and makes my heart sing. There isn't a song I don't like on the CD, but my favorite is \\"If Ever You Were Mine\\", a lilting instrumental where the same refrain is played consecutively by violin, then guitar, then piano, with each instrument adding subtle nuances to the tune. For vocals, try \\"Theid Mi Dhachaigh\\", a beautiful and fitting last song to a true legacy of Celtic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listenable, but a mixed bag","review":"This collection showcases a wide range of music from the various Celtic countries. The quality of the selections varies considerably: 4 yn y Bar is a knockout (and I wish their albums were easier to find -- I've had no luck so far), the Poozies (love that name!) and Altan tracks are great, and \\"Culloden's Harvest\\" is beautifully done and heart-rending. Maire Breatnach's contribution is lovely, too, and I've subsequently bought both of her albums. The Milladoiro selection is pleasant but not typical of their style, which is lively to the point of being raucous at times. At the other end of the spectrum, \\"The Tree\\" puts me to sleep, \\"The Lone Harper\\" is only so-so, and the clarsach accompaniment on the final track is amazingly inept although the vocal is very sweet. This album is a great way to become acquainted with a variety of groups and musical styles, but it's definitely a mixed bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Buy this video if you need to watch 60 minutes of groin kicks followed with an elbow strike - That's it - sum total of this worthless DVD.

I am a fan of true crime books and Carlton Smith who is one of the better crime writers today. Anyway, the case is still unsolved after 10 years. Sadly, Patsy Ramsey died of cancer last year. The Grand Jury decided that there was not enough evidence to convict the Ramseys. That means, they were not involved in her murder in my opinion.

Gratuitious sex all over the place! I'm not a prud, but give me a break! The whole first half of the movie just shows them having sex.....I had enough once I saw the first sex scene. You could tell this movie had a male producer or director because the nudity was all over the place. I can't believe Anne Hathaway let the movie industry use her like that! Even though I'm not crazy about her, this movie completely exploited her by showing her nude so many times, it finally got real old! And the constant commercial for Pfizer and Viagra was just too much! I wish I had the last 2 hours of my life back after seeing this stupid movie.

I am very disappointed with your service and will not purchase any thing from you again until this is resolved."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to pin down but above average","review":"The first half of this plays like many other comedies. Funny, but with everything exaggerated. People spouting side effects and contra-indications, talking faster than the FedEx guy. When Jake has his exchange with the training lady at the Pfizer meeting, I said to my friends \\"they'll be in bed in the next scene\\" and sure enough. The second half turns serious, almost as if to atone for part one. This is quite well done and feels authentic so even though you know what will happen it doesn't spoil anything. No problem with the nudity, but you know, the physical beauty of the actors and how Jake never has a hair out of place was a real distraction. There's a great scene where Maggie goes to a meeting of people with Parkinson's and it's like Hollywood drops in on the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, no.","review":"Don't waste your time.

Jake and Anne are so talented they make you care about the characters they play. The storyline really makes you hate lawyers and the drug companies (they are the problem along with the current administration); but I digress. Jamie (Jake) is a self-centered hedonist who's only goal is to put another notch on his belt or even better...put a notch on the belt while making money. Maggie (Anne) is a former artist who can't bear to get close to any one because she's scared to death she'll be left alone so she believes if she just shuts off her feelings she never get hurt. Jamie falls hard for Maggie and Maggie finally opens her heart. We know that the \\"true\\" ending will not be happy but we, as an audience, are willing to watch the present fairytale and be happy for them in the moment.

So, as a consequence the viewers' now split personality is left wandering in a zone of \\"huh?\\", \\"What is this movie about?\\"The story was neither deep enough, believable enough or focused enough to believe in it's outcome, whatever it may be, because the movie was so scattered it just ran out of time. So the viewer is left guessing about the important issue of how our protagonists would resolve care and love within the most trying days of a disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Unexpected.

Don't get me wrong, there was sex and pretty hot too but I did not expect this to be a serious movie about love and commitment and everything that goes with it.

Not in a, \\"it was almost good\\" kind of way either. Whoever is reviewing this and giving it 5 stars either didn't watch it, or was too distracted by the low impact nudity to realize they were watching a terrible film. The first 5 minutes are solid, but the film takes a turn towards goofy comedy and never comes back from cheesy Viagra jokes and a laughable attempts at drama.

This basically lasted through the credits as he gets fired for being a little too charming with the boss's girlfriend in the stock room. His family has money and he gets a job as a Pfizer salesman, something the movie makes out to be an evil job. He uses his charm and ability to have casual sex to sell drugs. During this time he meets Anne Hathaway (multiple nude scenes, thank you Anne) and they have incredible casual sex. The movie was great up to this point. Then we find out Anne has Parkinson's disease which is why she is a free spirit.Jake falls in love, turning this into \\"Love Story\\", then the comedy simply dies.Some crude humor, sex, nudity, f-bomb."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will fully appreciate if you've been in love...","review":"The characters get to the truth of the situation within their conversations and that moves them from now to the next now with a clean slate.

Maybe my expectations were too high given that 2 of my favorite actors were in this movie. Either way, this movie failed on many levels. I found the chemistry between Gyllenhal and Hathaway forced and unconvincing. I found the portrayal of pharaceutical representatives an accurate and disturbing look into the mid to late 90's. But I also felt like this movie glorified Drug Reps in their hay day. For a movie with comedic potential, it took itself way too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"There are plenty of reviews on the specific plot points & acting so I'll just say it worked for me on pretty much every level.I especially liked that I felt like it did a very good job at pointing out that money does not equate to happiness whether somewhat by accident or on purpose.I almost don't know why I took 1 star off other than it's not generally my type of movie and I don't know how much replay value it has. I generally only give 5 stars to movies I want to see again & again which mostly means Sci-Fi/Comic action type of stuff.

It is comprised of a series of ever increasingly difficult high energy drills(thus the name drill max) that keep your heart pumping and give your body a great workout. The good thing, if you are not up to doing all of the drills just go to the menu and choose the ones you feel like doing. This feature offers great flexibility in how you approach your workout.

Very clever way of setting out the information, but nothing really beyond the content of many writing books out there. As an aspiring novelist who has a book case full of these, I would recommend the Fiction Writer's Brainstormer by James Smith and Write Faster, Write Better by David Fryxell. Much better and immediately useful material if you are serious about writing in a disciplined manner. But the Boot Camp title is certainly a grabber. Kudo's to the title master for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kick in the pants","review":"Broken into small units, this book breaks up the novel writing process into manageable chunks. While I'm glad I didn't read this book first (it assumes some knowledge about the process; it's not a \\"dummies\\" book), I'm very glad I read it. It made things clear to me that weren't before; things about character development, in particular.I think this book makes a fine, if not completely indispensable, addition to a writer's bookshelf.

Are you serious?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a fool I bought this one inspite of the reviews here...","review":"Like a fool, I bought this book in spite of the many negative reviews on this page. I was sorely disappointed. As the other reviewers have said, if you can read Visual Basic and you have MSDN, you don't need this book. The examples are beyond useless. The writing is disjoined and poor. Basically, this thing is nothing but a very expensive paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"A repeat of MSDN","review":"This book is no tome, unless 'tome' has come to mean a regurgitation of something someone else wrote. The examples are beyond bad. Many are lifted directly from the MSDN and Borland help (translated to Pascal, of course). Delphi Developer's Guide by Pancheco and Texeria is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant to a fault","review":"This book is redundant to a fault. It repeats what is already in the Win32 SDK documentation, merely \\"translating\\" it to Pascal on the way. I was expecting alot of \\"how-to\\" rather than a mere C-to-Pascal Win32 reference. Also, the writing is redundantly awful. This is very nearly the worst written technical book I've ever had the misfortune to come across."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic waste of print","review":"As the other reviewers have pointed out, this book is mostly a rehash of the Win32 help files and the stuff in Microsoft Developer Network. The examples listes are either so similar to MSDN as to be useless or too simplistic to be useful. Worse yet, the book focuses on showing things you'd never do in a real application (e.g., create a window using API calls rather than letting Delphi's VCL do it for you). And to add insult to injury, these guys do not write well. The prose is sophmoric and befuddled. Don't waste your time with this one. Get Cantu's book or Pancheco's book, they're much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or your money on this book","review":"All the info in this book can be found in the Win32 API help files and in MSDN. Many of the examples in this book are so similiar to their counterparts in MSDN that they add no value whatsoever. The topics presented herein are covered in very little depth at all -- the book is essentially a regurgitation of the API docs. Cannot recommend this one. Get Cantu's Mastering Delphi instead. It's much better and is actually written well, unlike this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good value","review":"I didn't think I really got my money's worth on this one. For the price paid I expected a lot more than a hackneyed translation of the graphics API. For one thing, all the examples use 8 bit graphics -- something that was passe when the book first came out and something that's certainly passe now. For another, there isn't much depth here. Many of the examples are overly simple. Last, there's too much repetition. Do we really need every graphics-related record structure repeated multiple times? I would return this one, but I've waited too long. Don't be like me -- don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent Windows developers do not need this book","review":"If you are already a reasonably competent Windows developer, you do not need this book. It only builds (slightly ) on what's already in MSDN and the online docs, as other reviewers have pointed out. To make matters worse, it's not written well. I found the narrative boring and bland - to a fault. Many of the examples are quite similar to those in MSDN, especially the Visual Basic examples in MSDN. If you have those examples, this book really doesn't offer much value to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks alot like MSDN to me","review":"Couldn't help but notice the obvious similarities between this book and the examples in MSDN and the Platform SDK. If you have either of these, I don't know why you'd need this book. I bought it thinking I'd get expert advice and insights. All it really is is a rehash of what's publicly available from MS anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the other tomes books, pretentious and uninformative","review":"I don't know many Delphi developers who can't at least read VB code. Obviously, the authors of this book can, because the examples are eerily similar to the VB Win32 examples in MSDN. So much so that I rather doubt a competent Delphi developer who has MSDN would really get much value from this book. If you can read VB, you don't need this book. I was expecting unique insights into the way that Delphi implements the API, particularly the graphics API, but instead got a lame VB-to-Pascal translation. Can't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satis-factory surprise!","review":"At the time this came out I was a certified factory records junkie, but was also starting to get into Philip Glass.

So I bought it..and soon after the album that followed. I still play it more often than most other DC recordings since it doesn't Vini doesn't sing on it (while I've been a long time fan, I do still cringe at some of his vocal work). As to the \\"remastering\\"...they really missed the mark. The remastered CD's, while including some hard to find material, are of poorer sound quality than the original CD releases. They've edited the silence in between tracks, but haven't improved upon the quality of sound (and sometimes the sound quality of the reissues is worse than the originals)."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke the minute I tried to use it.

But I'd really recommend not wasting your money - both times the way it broke was the plastic cracked without being dropped or anything.

The first one broke after about three uses due to the seams on the screw-on top splitting and thus not allowing pressure to maintained when pumped into the unit. (Could this have been my fault for attempting to screw on too tight? Possibly). The second one order came damaged (the top was shattered). The third on arrived with a split in the same seam on the screw-on top, rendering it useless. The unit's top is made in two pieces that are melded together with a weak seam on either side. The slightest tension or pressure causes them to split. Do not waste your money.

I can say hands down that if you're wavering between this one and the o2cool one, the mistymate is the way to go. While the electric fan feature is nice of the 02cool, the unit is much bigger, gets wet when you use it, and the 'mist' if you can call it that is the same as spraying any spray bottle through a fan..you get considerably more 'wet' than if you use the mistymate which is a really fine mist.I was also very surprised/impressed with how long the mistymate produces mist on the 4-6 pumps it asks you to do...You probably only need to pump it initially and one more time to evacuate the entire contents of the bottle..awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of junk","review":"This item is a piece of junk...1sr day we used it it got a hairline spilt up the side of body in which air could escape so pressurizing did not work...had item replaced and new mister came with a crack in the same exact spot while still packaged!!

It just sprays a little squirt of water (not really what you could call mist). Very poor design, construction - and I would not recommend this product to anyone. It appears that it is not an actual Misty Mate, but a knock-off. Let the buyer beware - and in this case, I didn't, so shame on me. If you are considering a mister, don't order this one.

The heroine, a physician, has been \\"away\\" for years, whereas the hero, a veterinarian, has been \\"home\\" in the small town where they grew up. This seems to leave out of consideration that the education needed to produce a veterinarian is just as long and strenuous as that needed to produce a physician, so that - logically - he must have been away himself a minimum of seven or eight years before returning home to open his practice and can't have been back for more than six years (given the ages assigned to them), no matter how a reader tries to stretch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Beginners Book","review":"This book is fantastic for the individual who wants to learn HTML quickly.

Suction is very strong; it has brushing mechanism that easily lifts cat hair. When compacted, it can be stored in a small closet. One nice design area was that, the controls are right at the handle of the unit; you can control the sucking with your thumb. One issue is that due to design, the front wheel and rear wheels are distanced, therefore, turning around the corners are not very easy.

Think the cord was just not properly attached as that's where the plume of smoke came from. Save your money and get a better product. I loved the small footprint but it was hard to maneuver, didn't go under most furniture, and was impossible in corners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, powerful, a bit heavy but fantastic for a small home","review":"We live in a 1800-1900 sq ft home, 2 stories, this vacuum packs great, small and fits on to our closet, not a problem there, a bit noisy but who cares it sucks everything on its path, works great with FLOR rugs and wooden floor, a bit heavy for moving it.. so its not a really light vacuum but my wife and myself can handle it pretty well, heard a lot of complains about the size of the bags but its been a couple of months and while we dont use it a lot we havent needed to replace bags often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very heavy to push around the carpet","review":"This vacuum folds up nicely and is very compact - but that's probably the best thing about it! It is extremely heavy to push around - even in just a straight line! If you want to turn corners, get a wrist brace as too much vacuuming with this cleaner will leave you with sore wrists! The bag doesn't last long either - it's annoying after just two or three vacuums to have to replace the whole bag every time. Forget the stairs! It's way to bulky and heavy to lift up the stairs. Needless to say, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great vacuum but I can't buy belts/bags,etc. in any of my local stores anymore.","review":"I would be very skeptical when buying this or any other Electrolux product. I bought mine from Lowe's. I didn't realize they were going to stop selling it. They did within months of my purchase and stopped selling the belts and bags within six months. I went to other stores and I haven't had any luck. I also went to the Electrolux vacuum sales/service center. I was told Eureka owned the small vacuum business(the cheap vacuums). So now if I buy these then I must buy them off of Amazon and pay shipping every time. Who knows how long I'll be able to buy them here? Don't buy this vacuum!!!! I will never even buy a Electrolux appliance now. I don't trust them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrolux Intensity - good suction, bad wheels","review":"The Electrolux Intensity is an impressive design with incredible suction power. It was perfect for what we wanted and did a phenomenal job of cleaning for one day. Then both wheels broke and fell off on day two. Doing a search on \\"Intensity\\" and \\"broken wheels\\" showed this was a common problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead on arrival","review":"Vacuum arrived unable to power-on. Called Electrolux customer service and although they were very nice, they came to the conclusion that I got a dud. Clearly Electrolux has some quality control problems. Very disappointing because at the current price, this vacuum seems like a great bargain. Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum did not perform as expected","review":"I should have googled wheel in conjunction with this model. One of the wheels fell off after about ten uses! Good suction, but roller clogs up with pet hair and you have to manually pull it out. Small bag. Short cord. Do not recommend. I could have dealt with some of the dysfunction until the wheel fell off. Not the Electrolux I anticipated."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"ordered this item 7-21-10 stop working 8-21-10, great while it worked but did not last long"},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelieveable!","review":"I've had this vac for 4 months now and I have never owned a vaccume that picks up pet hair so well. I have 4 cats (3 long haired), and LOVE this vac. The suction works great to get all the pet hair out of the rugs. This is the reason I bought this vaccume. I still use my old canister vac for the floors, and hard to reach places. The only complaint I have is the size of the bags. I can only vaccume my large living room and one bedroom before the bag is full, but I have found a way to empty the bags and reuse them.Great vac for the price, and perfect for deep cleaning carpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would do!","review":"I purchasesd the Electrolux EL5020A Upright because I don't have a lot of space, and I didn't want a heavy machine. Oooops, not the easiest to use. I have 95% wood floors and one area rug. It didn't glide across the floors. First clue to send it back. It did not fit under my setee which is high off the floor. Did not fit under my sleigh bed either -- not a good thing. There is a handle to use when carrying it up steps, that is why it doesn't fit under furniture. The bags do not hold very much. So even two stars may be too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great suction, but heavy & awkward","review":"We ended up returning this vacuum as it definitely has great suction, but the trade off is the small bag (it's bag is smaller than my hand held vacuum!). Plus, it was difficult to turn and get into small areas. Can't beat the price, so if you had a large area that didn't need much navigating and you were only vacuuming occasionally, it may be just what you need. Otherwise, it may be worth the few extra bucks to get something more user friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Electrolux","review":"Pro: great for carpet!, not for wood floor.Con: It leave a tire mark on Bamboo floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a bad handle design or poor quality parts.","review":"I've had this vacuum for 18 months and the handle broke after normal use.It is not usable with a broken handle, so we put it in the shop and it is going to cost $83. to repair. Couldn't find receipt, so we have to pay for repairs ourselves. They had to order a new part, which probably won't last long either. Bad design or poor quality of parts in handle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas Eve Review","review":"This is the worst quality DVD that I have ever purchased.

It hasn't been released in the US yet so this is the only way you can get it. Thankfully it played in my DVD player with no problems at all! I love Loretta Young in this film and it's hard to believe she took a 23 year hiatus from acting before she made this film! The film was originally titled \\"The Christmas Dove\\" I believe but in the US it is known simply as \\"Christmas Eve\\". They used to show it on TV but they don't anymore. I don't know why...

You should read this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"The one book that helped me.","review":"I have read several books on the subject, searching for a way to break free of this. The problem is that many books adopt one of two approaches: either one designed for bulimics, which I am not, or a view that food is an addiction and certain foods must be avoided for life.This book takes a sensible and, most importantly, very doable approach - it doesn't ask you to monitor in written form, which can be quite a chore, but rather works on making you aware of your eating style and then overhauling it. Gradually, eating is normalized and the former binge foods are introduced - without leading to binges for me!! - so that your relationship with food slowly gravitates towards being \\"normal\\".All in all, a great read, the one book that changed my life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not rceived yet","review":"I didn't received my orders yet after more tahn one month...Is it normal?Could anybody help me with that?Thanks a lot.E.

You get to see the effect that various crimes have on the police, victim and even the perpetrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive history of Arctic exploration","review":"Overall this is an excellent book. It is a comprehensive history with enough detail to be very interesting. It is written as a chapter by chapter summary of all important Arctic explorers with extensive use of diary extracts where available. There are some fascinating well-known and not-so-well-known tales of extraordinary feats of survival. Also the controversies surrounding \\"first at the pole\\" are covered. A very good book, highly recommended and well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true tribute to America's heroes! All of them!","review":"I just loved this concert and was so pleased when they released this CD! It is truly one of the most moving and amazing tributes to all those who died on September 11 2001 Including those 189 people who lost their lives at the Pentagon.The Cd features artists like Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Limp bBisquit, Bruice Springsteen, and many more. All of the artists do a wonderful job of performing live in an extremely moving tribute to all those who lost their lives on that tragic Tuesday morning.Some of my favorite tracks included ,\\"Loves in nNeed of Love today,\\" By sStevie Wonder(I don't think other reviewers have done him justice He did a truly amazing job) I also really enjoyed, \\"lLong Road,\\" and, \\"Bridge over Troubled Water,\\" This is a truly excellent CD and its worth every dollar. I would have payed double what it cost because the money goes to such a great cause."},{"rating":"1","title":"At least they don't sing all at once...well, 'till the end","review":"Aside from Neil Young's beautiful cover of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\", most of this is extremely forgetable - sometimes downright phony or embarrassing - stuff. Even one of my favorite artists, Tom Petty, couldn't pull of a satisfactory rendition of \\"I Won't Back Down\\". And Wyclef John, taking time out of his MTV & Pepsi Commercial filming time to perform Bob Marley's \\"Redemption Song\\" wrapped in a flag is as close to sacreligious as music can get.On a positive note, it did benefit people who needed support in the wake of September 11th (though many funds took a long time to get through and much was even lost) - on the negative, it's filled with mostly drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dead Tribute to Heroes","review":"Very disappointing. The performers seemed to be trying to out-mute each other, though a couple didn't seem to get the memo. I can understand that it was a somber occasion, but Springsteen's solo performance almost brought me to tears of boredom. And he was the first \\"singer\\"! The various actors mouthing platitudes between each song would have been ok, if they could have only read the teleprompter! Since Sting was the only performer on the DVD that I normally listen to, I didn't know what to expect, but if this were how they normally sound, I would not buy any of their works! I just hope my money went to a good cause, because I will not be listening to it a second time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many old timers spoil the broth","review":"Why do we feel the need to rehash old timers in times of need. We need younger singers like Britney here. Not only because she is a good dancer but a excellent singer. Because all the old timers can't sing any more. And there voices were like all shaking and stuff. And they forgot the verses and stuff. Just like Paul Simon did in Bridge over troubled Water, He forget to say , \\"i will lay me down\\". I can't believe he actually forgot the words and like nobody picked up on that. and they were acting like, it was like all okay and stuff. But like I said, too many old timers on this cd. And plus most of them can't sing anymore, so why the need to herd them up on this cd. I just don't get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bruce's world....","review":"if you like the dribble bruce has put out the last 20 years, you might enjoy this.

With all do respect,Willie Nelson's guitar solo was quite amusing in the middle of that patriot feeling that might have been in studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moment to keep","review":"There may be more exciting concerts on CD, but few if any that carry the sheer weight and emotional impact of this history-making broadcast. The performances, with few exceptions, are direct and visceral, deeply emotional and quite unforgettable. The CD, shorn of the visual component that helped to making the telecast so memorably moving, fails to capture the full impact of the event but does prove that the music was indeed the as strong as it seemed on the night of the telecast. Highlights include Neil Young's heartfelt take on \\"Imagine\\", Bruce Springsteen's perfectly apt \\"My City of Ruins\\", and Wyclef Jean's interpretation of the Bob Marley classic \\"Redemption Song\\". The concert's spoken interludes/anecdotes by actors, while stirringly effective in the telecast, have been excised here, a wise decision. More than a memento of its time, this recording will undoubtedly endure as timeless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk On and Imagine","review":"\\"Walk On\\" and \\"Imagine\\" are must have classics. U2 is theonly rock-out performance. Very uplifting. And Neil Youngis probably the only person alive that could perform one ofthe greatest tunes ever written and very appropriate forthe cause. These 2 songs alone justify owning this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite CDs!","review":"I only just bought this CD today, and can't have enough of listening to it. I remember I was watching the live telecast of this cherished telethon for our heroes on a Saturday morning, and fell in love with each and every contribution that the artists have made.The recording is superb and it's difficult to decide whether this is a live recording or a studio recording! The sound is crisp and clear, no applause, no distraction. The organization even corrects some of the not-so-well-done parts of some songs (e.g. Mariah Carey's Hero where there was a part her 'inside' was not clearly sung).It's guaranteed to suit every one, every type of music lover, with a collection of songs for a good cause. Inspiring, strengthening and loving the songs may be, but let's keep them to our hearts.Makes a great Christmas gift or New Year's Gift. Never too late for resolutions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good job on e-RPG","review":"I received Brad's book one day and had it half read by the next.It is well written, very meaty, and surprisingly easy to read.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"e-RPG by Brad Stone....great book!","review":"This is a great jumping-off point into writing web applications and cgi programs using RPG.

John Wetton's new CD Welcome Back To Heaven/Sinister also (ironically) heads in the same direction with No Ordinary Miracle and the overall feel to the CD. Funny how these two CDs conincide in a way.

In a word rather boring other than 1 or 2 songs there is nothing here to catch the ear. John Payne is a great singer and Geoff Downes is brilliant but I believe they are missing the influence of a strong guitar player in the group to drive songs.

Looking forward to the next album hopefully it won't take as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing experience!","review":"Asia has travelled a long trip and has changed their melodies abd band members many times. I appreciate that Downes can still make a great music. My favourite tracks are Wherever You Are andLast Time. This album includes many ballads, which make my listening experience so relaxing. If you don't like Arena, youwon't necessarily love Aura. Anyway, this album much better musically. Listen and make your own opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Asia Minor","review":"Okay, you have 25% of the group that released the excellent \\"Asia\\" album in 1982. But this record is not quite 25% as good as that album. Geoff Downes is a great musician and has written some great songs, and this disc has a couple of solid tunes (such as \\"Free\\"). There are more misses than hits by my ears, however. I was about to say that this band might consider a new name other than ASIA, but upon reading the credits, I'm not sure who is actually in the band. There are more musicians on this thing than in Asia (the Continent, that is!) Steve Howe stopped by to add a few notes onto a couple of the songs, but you don't feel his presence as in the original band.This one is for Asia completists only."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel that this is the best Asia yet!","review":"It had been about 6 years since Asia had a studio album out and it was worth the wait!

Keep up the good work John and Goeff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD With Depth and Maturity","review":"This is perhaps the most consistent Asia release from start to finish since their debut release in 1982. The music and lyrics are mature and thoughtful, the musicianship is first rate. Geoff Downes' trademark 'wall of sound' gives the songs a good, ethereal quality without drowning the fine guitar work that is found throughout the album. John Payne's vocals are passionate and strong. Without a doubt, Aura is the best performance by post Wetton era Asia, and stronger than two of the three Wetton era releases. I recommend the import release, as the three bonus tracks are well worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMBARRASSING","review":"I clenched my teeth and somehow managed to endure the enternity of what was 79 minutes of horrible music.

These headsets are set at a default low volume or at least it seems like it. I kept on looking for a volume button because they were so low. I tried plugging it into different devices and still got the same result. I tested other headsets on my phone which has Pandora and when i plugged these in complete sound drop off.

However, the following session I had, the right earphone on one of them began cutting out. Now I don't know if it was the re-packaged one, because I threw out the boxes and don't know how to determine which one it was or ask for replacement or return?

At 60 ohms can't drive quite as loud as possible with a 9v battery powered altoids type headphone amp, so have ordered a beefier unit to see how that does. I'm not a huge fan of headphones and have nothing ne plus ultra to compare with but have had some killer ultra high rez soundsystems. These seem reasonably accurate and avoid the gross exaggerations of some of the more popular brands. As a result some might find them lacking in bass, or midrange emphasis, but in the long haul always better to have more accurate transducers IMHO. I don't find them to be completely comfortable either, unlike some of the reviewers, but not bad and have worn them for a couple hours at a time without undue fatigue, etc. All in all, a good value but sort of wish I had saved for some of the killer reference standard AT sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technica Studio Headphones ATHM40FS","review":"Well worth the purchase price.Enjoy listening without bothering others and I can do my thing anywhere in my home and still enjoy my favorite CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice sound, nice fit, poor quality","review":"I can't complain about the sound, but the product isn't very durable.

Simply put, I'd pay $100+ for them. I'm impressed about both the quality build and the quality of sound. You can readily hear the difference when you compare these to any consumer grade headphones (including Bose brand). You can hear the nuance in of each sound. Since they have a flat response in the range, the sound feels VERY, VERY real. One of the problems I've had with Bose in particular is that they do \\"mess\\" with the sound to make it sound \\"better\\" but their definition of better is not necessarily what I want. I was very pleased that Audio-Technica did not meddle with the sound. I learned of Audio-Technica some 10 years ago at a friend's studio and never bothered to get some for myself because I never knew they being a studio grade brand were so affordable.In short, if you like to hear or listen to your music or audio w/o any heaphone \\"pumping\\" or \\"boost\\" these Audio-Technicas are the BEST value in the market right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best I've owned","review":"I've been through a number of headphones over the years and recently broke a pair of Bose headphones that I was never that happy with to begin with.

I mostly used them to listen to music and watch movies. I purchased the M40FS headphones after my MDRs were lost/stolen. These headphones have a much bigger soundstage than the MDRs, and are definitely better for movie watching. I also think they are far more comfortable than the MDRs. The only downside to these headphones is the need to purchase an adapter to use them on Macbook Pro's and their unwieldy long cords.

The original audio quality was good, but underwhelming on the low end. After a few weeks of listening however they loosened up, and I have to say they have a beautiful sound across the audio spectrum. The mids are especially clear and you can hear the subtle details of guitar strings in acoustical pieces. I've certainly gotten my $50 out of these, and after a year they still sound great.

However within a week of having them, one of the ears started fuzzing out and eventually died altogether.Let me be clear that I was not hard on these in the least. They were the most expensive headphones I ever had at that point, so I was extremely gentle with them. They went from my head to my desk, no drops, no pulling on the cord, nothing. From looking at the other reviews, it seems that these phones may have design issues, as there were multiple other reviews with the same problem.The good news is, Amazon was extremely helpful and gave me a full refund, no questions asked. Now I have a pair of Sennheiser HD280s, and they have given me no problems so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good device","review":"These headphones are really good! The specifications are really deceiving unless you know what you are looking for, all and all they are awesome though. Sound quality is excellent, they are noise reducing so you don't need to turn up the volume so high to hear them. I only encountered a couple of problems. 1. I didn't notice that they had a bigger jack so they aren't for standard audio devices and 2. They kinda press on your ear so it is uncomfortable to wear for an extended period of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and comfortable","review":"I bought this product for my brother who has dialysis three days per week.

The book was mentioned in a surprising collection of other authors during that zeitgeist which is how I lost my original copy: borrowed and not returned! The recent replacement copy of Siddhartha sent to me through Amazon,however seemed to be an unedited and oddly formatted (margins inconsistent)piece of literature.

I have study guides and tests that I'd made using different versions of the text, and I can't find the answers to many of the questions in this text although I can in other texts.

As a teacher I used this book for many years ( the discovery of sex had to be glossed over of course) to take both young men and women on the journey to find out who they were and what maybe they would like to be given the strictures of parental morality and public school dishonesty.This book I sent as a gift to someone who has taken many journeys, none of which led to that \`ah ha\` moment. They feel as if there is no tomorrow, and no more inviting pathways. The person is in their mid-40s. I am hoping that Mr. Hesse's short novel can rekindle in this person the curiosity they once had about their unfolding world, and hope that through Siddartha that they can rekindle the hope required to take on a new difficult road with an open mind ready to take in new possibilities.Dr. Tim Scully"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book came in on time","review":"Actually this was a book our daughter said she needed for school (at virtually the last moment) and then wasn't available locally.

The translation appears to be excellent and in the true spirit of the lyrical style of the novel. However, I noticed a few minor issues. First, there were a number of instances where the translator used the incorrect word (e.g. woman vs. women and want vs. went), but it did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the novel. Second, the other problem I noticed was with formatting. It did not appear to be optimally formatted for viewing on the screen.

For the three hours'time the story runs on cassette tape, the listener is treated to a magical journey to the river of life as he or she accompanies Siddhartha, son of a wealthy Brahmin, and his lifelong friend, Govinda, on Siddhartha's search for enlightment. What is more is that there is just as much beauty in finding that one does not need to live a life of material wealth to find true happiness. I also found a certain beauty learning about the Buddhist religion, including nirvana, through Derek Jacobi's mellifluous reading, and that death is not an end to be feared, but rather a beginning to another life--a life in which we are free from pain, hunger, and thirst, because we know that these needs will be met.

I was thinking about ordering the pitching video from D&D, but now I'm afraid to take the chance. My final recommendation for parents and coaches with kids from 6-12 years old, look at different videos. We bought the Little League's (Official How To Play Baseball Video) three years ago, and for the money, it's a lot better video than Batting A Thousand.

It also achieves a remarkable feat, failing to mention history as a relevant factor in understanding and anticipating ethnic conflict in the 21st Century. It does nothing whatsover to suggest to the interested analyst, for whom this \\"template\\" was designed, how to operationalize the few relevant factors the book identifies, and does not provide any discussion at all of sources and methods helpful to studying ethnic conflict. There is no bibliography and no index. The footnotes are lightweight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have we made progress since the 60s?","review":"This is one book that would be better to read backwards. It's like a key rather than a theory about the underlying causes of ethnic conflict. The first part is definitions and it's hard to see where it's all headed unless you take a look at the last part first. A good companion to this book would be \\"Ethnic Groups in Conflict\\" by Donald Horowitz. After reading this book I have the impression that we are building up to an explosion that's inevitable if we continue the massive immigration.Another closely related book that's written on a very popular level is \\"Civil War II\\" by Thomas Chittum, which predicts an ethnic break-up of USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginners book for architectural use.","review":"This is an extremely straight forward and easy to understand book.

Sure, many of the topics covered are applicable to other uses of autocad, but I would much rather have had the book just show general examples of the functions of Autocad rather than focus on specific floorplans and the design of buildings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I am new to Autocad, and I needed a quick way to get up to speed with the whole program. Frey seems to anticipate the learner's thought process. I found Frey's style refreshing. I found myself wondering the answer to a question and turning the page to find a sidebar explaining the very thing. I wish he would write similar books for the 'Desktop' extensions to Autocad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is an excellent CD for a country fan, and all of the songs are among Toby Keith's greatest. One exception: where's Beer for my Horses? Otherwise, If a Man Answers is an excellent, and how can you resist Toby's debut hit- Should Have been a Cowboy? Overall, this CD is worth buying, and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Toby Keith","review":"I love listening to Toby Keith. Some of these songs I hadn't heard before at all. Most of the songs are just wonderful to listen to, and a total pleasure. I find that I like the newer songs better that some of his older hits. I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes Toby Keith music."},{"rating":"2","title":"High point in Keith' career","review":"This collection covers Toby Keith's material up until (but not including) \\"How Do You Like Me Now?\\" and is miles better than most of what he has put out since. The material is better, and the singles Keith chooses to release now, are with few exceptions, nowhere close to the quality of his music in the 1990s.Keith's music has never been better than it was with songs like \\"If a Man Answers,\\" \\"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying\\" and \\"Who's That Man\\" and the other songs contained in this collection. Keith's best album was perhaps \\"Blue Moon.\\"Do yourself a favor and purchase this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The old stuff is the best!","review":"Some of his songs are arrogant and annoying, but I really like this collection as a whole.

Definitely put this in your collection. It's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best!!!!!!","review":"I only discovered TK when he came out with Courtesy of Red, White and Blue. I had heard his other songs but didn't know who he was. Now this album is the most played in my truck.Of all the favorite songs the other reviews mentioned I hit the repeat again and again when he sings \\"Me Too\\". All the girls at work swore it was Merle Haggard when they passed my office hearing it on my CD.Oh, not only do I play it on my way to work but at work, then going home. If you never buy CD's, you only download online, buy this one. I can't understand why anyone would sell their used CD, this is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getcha Some.","review":"This Album Contains Toby's Greatest Hits From 1993-1998.

The rest had one leg hole that was much larger than the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent Fit","review":"I own these but I don't wear them anymore, nor will I be buying more in the future. While they're very soft and come in pretty patterns, they don't stay put despite their claims. They don't have a very full coverage in the buttocks, which then leads to shifting and having to manually put them back into place. Sort of defeats the purpose of buying a \\"wedgie free\\" panty. My biggest complaint however, is that without fail, at least 1-2 pair in each pack is cut oddly or much smaller than the rest. Leaving me no choice other than to throw the pair(s) away. They don't do what they promise, and they cause me to waste money by having to discard brand new panties. Not a bargain in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that fashion","review":"they were not that fashion. I receive what supposed to be my size but they were far bigger.

They are not cartoon-y, and they give real information and provide real images of the construction. He even likes the \\"jazzy music\\".

Will update this after a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"This is an amazing product from 3M, I used this double-sided tape for mounting my SSD in my PC case, and for my display adapter, it sticks very well so strong even after mounting its not easy to take the tape out of the item. If you want to mount light weight stuff (note that the description on the box says up to 0.9 kg but I think it can hold up for higher weights maybe 1.5kg) this double-sided tape works excellent. Also it doesn't get dirt easily, so it would last for a long time. It is made up of some foamy material, and soft. The dimension is: 25.4mm x 1.27m, and MADE IN USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serenity in Sound","review":"Alternately foot-stomping on the one hand, and spiritual and serene on the other--this Narada offering is several cuts above the later Best of Narada New Age (2002) which for my ears was painful. This collection (Narada World) is uniformly superior and recommended except for the Brazilian cuts which I found irritating. The music is authentic and well-performed. Because it is excerpted from earlier Narada releases, many of which I own, there is a good deal of repetition. But this is carping and petty. These CD's are superb traveling music--because of the consistency of sound between cuts it plays well in a car CD player, without fooling with volume or equalizer."},{"rating":"2","title":"this band is good!","review":"URIAH HEEP is a good one, they are the same contemporaries like Zeppelin, purple and sabbath in the early seventies HEAVY ROCK hey day.Long ago the fool rolling stones music journalist had condemmed them as inane and boaring band.

But compared to this, \\"This Island Earth\\" seems like \\"Gone with the Wind\\". Don't watch this movie if you don't have to. The kids will love it, but of course they're only interested in the dinosaurs. Special effects are aweful, and the entire movie has no basis to reality whatsoever. If I could I would have given this movie no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Las Dino-BORE!","review":"Some reviews of this film say that it is the BEST KAIJU EIGA film ever. Those people are on DRUGS!!! Richard Boone looks and sounds drunk through the whole movie. To make matters worse we are supposed to believe that women find him irresistible even though he looks like a rotten log in a safari hat!!! Joan Van Ark is so irritating and whiney that you'll want one of the dinosaurs to eat her! And let's talk about the other guy--some young scientist guy who must have attended the William Shatner school of over-acting and FLUNKED! ...However it is also very funny in some parts. My favorite is when the title dino is bashed in the head with a Flintstone styled catapult, and we get to see the boulder litterally dent and bounce off of the creature's head like a Nerf ball. My advice--buy this movie used for a dollar, make fun of it, and throw it in your dumpster!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Flick, Poor Quality Tape","review":"The movie is a blast--never saw the end as a kid--but I'm disappointed that it's in EP mode on VHS which lowers the video and audio quality. I purchased it throught Amazon.com, and I think that this fact (extended play mode), should have been revealed. At times the clicking, popping, and hissing of the soundtrack made it sound like the movie was made 45 years earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"the last dinosaur","review":"this movie can easily be a two star to a five star depending on if you like the boone actor the style is cool to me and the film quality isnt there but the actor played in movies i think for forty years and i think this was his last . it entertaining in some unique way ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The best scene was edited!!!!","review":"I saw this movie on television back in the day and enjoyed it. I found a VHS tape in K-mart 20 years ago and my kids enjoyed it growing up. I lost track of that video, so ordered this one recently. The quality is acceptable, but the best scene of the movie is missing!!!! At the very end, Joan van Arc says, \\"It the last dinosaur, the last one\\", and Richard Boone says, \\"So am I\\" - that scene is completely missing from this version of the movie. What a let-down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Satisfactory","review":"First the bad points: Fine tuning the table height is very frustrating. The arm that you loosen then tighten is set akwardly on the left. Furthermore, you either have to rock the table back and fourth to get it lower, or it just drops down, so much for fine tuning. The table that you place your work on is small. If you're working on anything of any size, it's difficult to clamp. Finally, there's no mortising attachment available.The good points: It's a solid machine that will make good holes for a long time. It's just the set up that's misery.I should have spent the extra [money], and bought the Delta 12\\" Drill Press. The 12\\" model has a crank to adjust the table height, the table is bigger, and a mortising attachment is available."},{"rating":"1","title":"You lost me at Hello","review":"There are some decent techniques taught in this video but the guy who narrates it is so dry and boring and does not speak fluidly about the processes.

There is claim to there being other scents involved, but all I can smell is the anise. It's hard to tell if it's a male fragrance or female.

Zane Grey, of course, adds his own twist to the facts, but over-all this is probably the most accurate accounting there will ever be, as Zane Grey was able to talk to old-timers who were still living and had gone through the feud. The one scene with the hogs is the one most readers will never forget, and is based on fact. The \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" part is consistent with other romances written by Grey, and has to be in the story line to make it historical romance, which is what he considered himself to be writing---not westerns! In fact, the word, or term, \\"western\\" was not even coined until around 1930. By then Zane Grey had been writing this kind of stories for 20 years.

(I know from experience that many hotels in the \\"Maingate\\" area of Orlando are a MUCH better value than the over-priced, less-than-impressive Disney \\"All Star Resorts.\\") Although there are some good tips for taking along your children, the book fails to provide an unbiased account that helps my family plan an economical, but fun trip. I did not feel I got my money's worth with Kim Wiley's book.I would instead recommend the \\"Unofficial Guide to WDW,\\" which gives a much broader and well-balanced approach to planning a trip to Disney.

I was already also a fan of horror flicks and this one delivered. If you're looking for a tense, nail-biting but also bloody and gory film, you won't be disappointed either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Gorey, suspenseful, and beautifully shot. I don't just mean the beautiful gore( which isn't everyones cup of tea, but why are you looking at Midnight Meat Train??). The scenes of the city and subway are well lit, yet feel dark. It is easy for movies like this to rely on darkness too much for tension, but it usually just becomes annoying. There is no distracting shaky cam or impossible to follow action sequences here. The only questions are the good ones that make you think when you are alone in the dark. Questions like \\"where did these creatures come from\\" and \\"Why IS Mahogany doing this\\", not \\"How did he get there? It was so dark I couldn't see what was happening!\\". I would love to have seen this in the Theater. Too bad I wasn't given the opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Lordy, what a waste of time","review":"I understood the CGI as fake.

I was disappointed that a final finality was not used and the bizarreness of the end, was not to my liking.So, the movie was watchable, and it kept my attention, but the end was just too off track for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"A gory, scary, horror film with an actual storyline!

The story suffers from plot hole after plot hole, stupid-character-syndrome, and an excess of needless CGI effects. I have one question for the \\"filmmakers\\" - is it really that hard to put some tangible fake blood on a sledgehammer? I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw this at the cheap movie theater for $3. . .","review":"and it would have been a complete waste of money, had it not been so hysterically funny. Seriously, it had it's moments, but most of the effects were just atrocious and some scenes were just plain idiotic. It was not in the least bit scary.

A relatively unknown cast with the exception of Brooke Shields turns in excellent performances and the Brit actor Vinnie Jones is foreboding as the killer, Mahogany. If you like horror films with plenty of gore such as \\"Candyman\\"--you'll revel in this very well done (pun intended) Meat train. The Japanese director Kitamura definitely should have a future in Hollywood after this film. The blu-ray edition of this film is excellent also."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"script is lame, acting is ok, way too unbelievable and absurd. it seemed like they had no clue where the movie was going and just made something ridiculous up on the fly. ridiculous and vague as hell......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie didn't play??","review":"I had to send this movie back twice........It wouldn't play in my DVD player.........I did get it to play in my pc, but it shook the pc so hard it was humming with the vibration........maybe the disc is warped?? i have no clue, but Amazon returns ROCKS!!!

This film is a HUGE let down. The lead actor just ain't got the chops to carry the weight of the role and for some reason the Director who usually has a great, fast paced and stylized hand with the camera seems very flat and boring with his shot choices and angles in MMT. Not enough Jones, not enough tension or believable aspects to make this a good film AND way too much terrible looking CG blood. TERRIBLE special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"Really? With ~10 minutes to go in this run-of-the-mill psycho thriller/horror movie that was largely a variation on the rear window, they randomly throw in zombies? Really?? Frickin' zombies????

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing too Special","review":"While this movie starts out strong, it quickly lost me with it's very cartoonish and very BAD digital gore. Many of the other effects are terrible as well.It did do a good job of making you care about the romantic relationship, but you'll regret ever giving a damn because of the ending. All is lost and you're pissed you even started watching.The movie would've ended GREAT in it's third act instead of going into the outlandish fourth act, but I suppose that would've been ruining the source material.I think this would have played better as a thriller with most subtle gore and not such a hopeless, deary ending. I realize hopeless dreary endings are a horror film staple, but I guess as the movie progressed I was expecting more and something original.Definitely just a rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best horror movies out there","review":"i caught this on SyFy 1 months ago and have become addicted to the movie so much that i had to buy it! i read the book by Clive Barker and love the screen adaptation of the book. i wish the movie had gotten more publicity.

And this movie is as good as other movies of him. Also if you get bonus of Jeetendera (another favorite of mine) and the evergreen Mala Sinha. All the three main actors perform their role in an immaculate manner and I could not find any discrepancy in their performances. The music is also good from Shanker-Jai Kishan. Eastman Colors look very cool. And another different end to a love triangle never seen in any other Hindi movie. Vinod Kumar has done a good job in directing such a wonderful movie. Acting from other crew was also good. Story is about two men falling in love to a woman and one of them managing to marry her and then losing her due to his own deeds. And then the other man managing to get her respect even though he was not able to win her heart in the first place.

Over all, I really like it and would buy it as a gift for someone else.

My favorite is definitely \\"A Song for You\\". Although the song was originally done by Donny Hathaway, Dennis Edwards turns it out...You hear nothing but love dripping off his vocal cords. The new Temptations cannot touch the sounds of the Temps of the 60's/70's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Temps Delivers","review":"This is one of the best of all Temptations albums of all times. The albums does not have one bad track on it. The music arrangements are tight. Side a (Before CD's came out) was the dance side opening with \\"Happy People\\", \\"Glasshouse\\" is another monster groove. \\"Shady Ground\\" of course was penned down by the late Ed Hazel of Funkadelic. His guitar playing along with Billy Bass (one of P-funks Bass player) kicks butt. The B-side was the more mellow side with Dennis Edwards singing \\"A Song For You\\" will leave you breathless.

The author spares no mercy in skewering their character, their dreams, their hopes on her didactic pen. So much venom.These are characters you will love to despise and which the author delights in showing in the worst possible light and is creative enough to make it almost poetic--if you see the beauty in psychic wounds which bleed hatred.The plot is a series of encounters in which the young people--some parents and others are preipheral characters--meet and talk with the purpose of committing the perfect crime: unmotivationless, calculated.How that comes about caught me by surprise, like a blow to the solar plexus.Read it and weep--not for them but for mankind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest to Working out at a Gym","review":"Love the workouts.

If you like to have music basicly everywhere and you're not in a position to even consider piping music around the house, this is the way to go. By the time it was stolen from the (overly) communal weight room in my condo's basement, it had served in every possible capacity.

As the title suggests, much of the music has undeniable Celtic strains, but, with the artful addition of other foreign flavors, the sound created by these artists is new, fresh, vital, full of crystal and fire.My overall impression is awe at the talent brought together into a single CD. Every single selection is so beautiful that it's difficult, almost unfair, to single out any one piece. I'll just say that Spring, the last selection, a hauntingly beautiful, magical combination of Japanese bamboo flute and Southamerican harp, is truly worth waiting for. What a value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vibrant and creative!","review":"I love to play this as I'm doing something in my room or working on the computer. It stimulates my creativity big time.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeing through the sex","review":"Few authors write of physical passion as beautifully as Ms. Hayes, but the real payoff in this book is the eloquent affirmation of what we knew all along -- the connectedness-at-the-core that occurs over time between two lovers can nourish their joy and sustain them through turmoil. The book is written from the standpoint of a smart, young professional as she weathers a bad marriage, then learns to trust her sensual instincts in a series of affirming relationships, the final one her life partner. This is not a cheesy romance novel, or a sex manual, or a self-improvement book, just an inspiring tale of one woman who lived fully, sensually. It stays with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"South Asia Clime?","review":"Threads of Passion is what English majors would call a \\"bodice ripper,\\" from the cover on.

If you are allowing God to use you at your fullest potential, you will find the book leading you into deeper areas of service and encouraging you to stay on course.

Please note as an experienced angler I wasn't expecting secrets to be revealed, but what I received was a 101 version of flyfishing, period. No advanced strategies to approach bluelines, nothing. I DO WANT TO MAKE A POINT that this is not a direct \\"stab\\" at the author or his wife. In fact, they are one of the foremost professional guiding services in all Southern Appalachia and their knowledge is seldom surpassed!

I am a woodworker by hobby and needed to do particular sanding. I found the packaging excellent, but that's where it stops. Yes it sands. The verticle plate in back of the 1\\" belt was 1/4 inch to the left and cannot be adjusted. It was also bent back 15 degrees and not flush to the belt. The throat is not deep, so, sanding a part of a piece of wood longer that a 10 inches cannot be done. Metal parts were jagged and dangerous, especially the little tables. The miter gauge with the disk sander table is small and wobbled in the miter slot and therefore useless for any specific angle of cut. All in all a very cheesy product. If a straight line or a 90 degree angle is of any interest to a user, leave this product on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine until it quit","review":"Worked fine for exactly 6 months; then the motor quit.

The reason for 4 stars is that although the flat sanding surface has plenty of life left, the screens near the corners of the sanding pad seem to rip/wear/tear a bit easier than I would like to see and will result in replacement well before the main sanding surface has worn.

Opus is looking for his mother who is at the facility. Its a damn shame these books are out of print. But If you really want to get these books just get em off amazon.

My first thoughts are that the game is actually quite good. The graphics are excellent, especially if you have a system that handles 3d well. The one thing I think could be improved is the perspective you have while you are riding around. Its kind of disorienting when you jump up and spin or do some other trick. It just has a wierd view which takes some getting used to. I also gave this four stars cause I don't think this game will have much re-playability for me. Its fun for awhile, but I'm starting to loose interest. I'm sure skateboard fans will really like this game. My suggestion is to try out the demo first, and if you like it, buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY GOOD GAME!!!","review":"This is a great game! The graphics are okay, but they could be better.

Otis, Paul, Melvin, Eddie, and David has at least one lead on this album and you feel as if you are on the stage or would like to be there stepping over and over again with The Tempting Temptations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Temptations in a Mellow Mood","review":"Classic temptations. May be their best album ever. Full participation from all members of the group. Had been looking for this CD for a long time. Will enjoy it for a long time to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time nor your money","review":"Contrary to one review, Novas and Cao did NOT research. There are so many instances of incorrect information as well as shameless stereotyping. I strongly feel that no one should waste their time or money on this bound book of filth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good intro","review":"I acknowledge the complaints of those who do not like this book. It is by no means comprehensive, nor is it a great scholarly achievement. But it's perfect for people like me who are history-illiterate and just can't digest the dry format of most history textbooks. It has a question-and-answer format that makes it easy to learn the history in small chunks. As an Asian-American, I am glad to finally have a way to learn a little bit of my own history. I would recommend this book to those who know little about Asian-American History and want an introduction to the events and attitudes that shaped it, but not to those who are looking for something more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read! Very informative and full of fun stuff!","review":"Wow! I love this book. The question and answer format is really user friendly. It covers all the Asian American groups and gives their history and all sorts of cultural information without feeling heavy. And yet, is IS heavy in the sense that it gave me a very good handle on the struggles and the contribution of the various Asian American groups, as well as all their celebrations, important holidays, legal landmarks, etc. I am half Japanese and it made me very proud of my mother. I am giving the book to all my relatives on my father's side. This one's a definite for any home library. They should teach it in schools. Maybe they do.It should be required reading for all non-Asians as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful book for all ages","review":"What a fun book! I finished this one in under twenty-four hours, because I was so interested in Jessie's plight. Abbott's voice makes the book fun and funny, and it was just what I was in the mood for. As soon as I finished, I ordered the second in the series. I can't wait until another comes out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pity about the settings","review":"I came across Aster on the brilliant double packaged, Desert Blues compilation some years ago; one breathtaking track with pentatonic piano scales to match. How could i resist an album of such rare emotive, vocal aplomb. Alas, that track chosen for the compilation was not emulated by its company. Raucous and questionably mixed disco jazz just doesn't compliment this fabulous singer. I'm hoping the recent ballads release is closer to my original sampling! So I am in agreeance with reviewer, Louis Alewayehu on this release regards star tracking and indeed down to his very selections!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits A Moving Target","review":"This is by far the most thorough and up-to-date compendium of Chinese government and officialdom that I've seen. As someone who has been doing business in China for several years, I've been frustrated time and again by the lack of current, complete contact details. Other directories, many of them several times more expensive, purport to provide the information. Most are out of date before the ink is dry. This one delivers. In addition to central government functionaries, it lists party officials, military types and municipal, provincial and diplomatic offices - no easy task at a time when there's so much shuffling and reorganization in official China. I was pleasantly surprised to find website addresses for so many government offices. This book is well organized and, apparently, will be updated frequently by mail and online. Those of us who do business in China can only say: It's about time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential tool for doing business in China","review":"Knowing the right people and connection is essential for having a successful business in China.

It is filled with all their greatest hits that I loved so well in the past!!! I had been looking for a very long time and it was either extremely expensive or not being reproduced any more.

Mylon has re-recorded it. Not crazy about artists doing that. Billy Grammer did it with Bonaparte's Retreat. I ordered the Monument Story to get that one song and found an alternate take. I still have the original on 45 thank goodness.I would love to find the original version Mylon put out.

All the batteries had an expiration date of 09/2011 on them. Also they were not in Duracell packaging as the website picture shows.

The back of the case says, 2 disc special edition - there is only one disc, there isn't even a space for a second disc, so, I don't know what goes, called Amazon, and they are resending, and checking the product out, but.... I did note that the product information says \\"one disc\\", but in the description and the back of dvd case it says 2 disc, time listed is the same, so, now I'm going to go check if the 1966 Miller version is on the opposite side - who knows? Don't mess with Alice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this to be rather poor","review":"It seems I stand alone in not liking this version of Alice in Wonderland. Having read the book, I know what is happening, yet I feel people not exactly fimilar with the story (Disney's version isnt good enough)would find it dry and lacking in a good solid story persay. Things are very quickly jumped into, and hardly any lines on the part of Alice. She is compleltly out of it and stares blankly off into space most of the time. Over all I found this version of Alice lacking and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO DARK AND DEPRESSING - NOT FUN AT ALL","review":"I love the traditional fun and whimsical ALICE. I've always loved the colorful and fantasy characters and cool scenes. This version is super dark and spooky. Very strange! TAKE A PASS ON THIS ONE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly Appallingly Awful","review":"The worst version I've ever seen. The story is constantly modified to avoid special effects$$. The Alice actress was instructed to be deadpan throughout, which is just as well because I get the impression she can't act anyhow. About the only fun is spotting Eric Idle (future Python) as an extra a couple of times. Some of the changes seem amazing to me: at thebeginning the sisters go into the field alone - no rowboat with Dodgson and Duckworth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond most people's scope","review":"This is going to sound like a snobbish, Peter Greenaway appreciating review, but it wouldn't be the first time I've ostracized myself. This TV movie did something that no other version of Alice has done: It made Alice, as well as the viewer, realize what it is like to go insane. As opposed to the \\"disneyland attraction\\" type of adaptation where little Alice simply goes with the flow, this Alice grows madder as it continues, as do most of whom she encounters. The psycho sexual nuances are all there as well, not to mention wit and very VERY understated performances from the over the top likes of Peter Sellers, as well as a young Monty Python Eric Idle seen as an extra. The girl playing Alice, though not a skilled actress, relays with a mere glance to the camera what countless other snotty nosed little girls playing Alice have NOT been able to accomplish; A thoughtful, blase, knowing insanity. People will either get this film or they won't, but in many ways it's the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alice as Somnambule","review":"I'm always interested in seeing what other artists can do with Lewis Carroll's iconic character, and this 1966 black-and-white meditation upon Alice in Wonderland is one of the best. Here Alice is a druggy, dream-laden sleepwalker drifting through a very dark and distorted little universe. Highly original, moody, and satisfying re-imagining of the first Alice book.

There is an extended version of \\"Don't Let My Love\\" - NOT THAT VERSION on Intruder (but hard to find).The artist confused me over time with Tea for Two. (There is such an artist, with the only song I heard, \\"Time and Love\\" on Flashback Alternatives.)You should purchase this album if you like Information Society, Animotion, Phil Oakley (Human League), and other similar artists from the 1980s.

Basiline does indeed deserve better, as several reviewers have noted. I am surprised and disappointed that the Basilone family would think it ok to have this book get their blessing.

It took less then one minute to start the Spotbot in motion once I got it out of the box. Very easy to operate (much like a dishwasher!)The only con is that surfaces Are still wet after treatment.

It is easy to use and works fast at spot cleaning HOWEVER, unless the rest of your rug is really clean (and most of them are not lets be honest!)you will see a large difference in the color of the circle left by the spot bot.I have a large area rug(8x11) in my kitchen with a cream base and rooster pattern around the edge. I keep it clean and vacuum at least twice a week and the circle was very prominent. I would bet on a light colored carpet it would be very noticeable where you had done the cleaning. I returned the item and bought the Bissell Power steamer-and love it! It looks like an upright vacuum and washes the whole rug easily! Never rent a cleaner again! I did the large area rug to new condition in an hour.Looked great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hits the spot!","review":"The SpotBot works very well, albeit, not always on the first go.

Doggie stains do come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing waste of money","review":"I bought this product a few years ago on a friends recommendation.

It was great to have something on hand to clean up these type of spots instead of having to drag out the full size shampooer.

When I went to use it the last time it would only work on one cycle; and then it would only spray out the shampoo but would not suck it back up.I was very disappointed on the life on the product. It was not used that much and it was well taken care of. Needless to say, I would not recommend that anyone buy this. It was not worth spending that much money on something that was not going to last any longer than it did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brown Spots","review":"We have been looking for a means to clean \`spots' on our carpet.

Thank God, we bought it through Amazon, you were kind enough to take it back and for that we are thankful."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pump will stop working - I promise","review":"We had three (3!) of this product's predecessor. Instead of a scrubber brush, they provided a hose with suction and fluid supply to soak the carpet stains, then vacuum them up. These units had two motors - one for the suction, one for the fluid pump.We bought three of the previous model (no harsh use here - just two kids and a cat). The liquid pump will simply stop working, leaving you with a small oddly shaped vacuum. Calls/complaints to Bissel went unanswered. We blamed the first one on a fluke.

They were clearing out the original Spotbots as they were getting in the new \\"pet\\" Spotbot. I couldn't be happier. While it does use a fair amount of solution, it cleans really well. I have several cats plus fosters and kitties barf up hairballs and sometimes food. It cleans new and old stains. I had an old stain where the neighborhood kids had spilled milk and cola nothing I used removed the stain - after a while it was just a dark gray stain on an off white berber. Spotbot cleaned the stain! It took about 4 uses, overlapping, but the stain is totally gone! I love my Spotbot! Spotbot cleans my berber and my other carpets - you'll probably want a different type of carpet shampooer for larger areas (I like my Bissell Quicksteamer) but for small areas the Spotbot is the best! (although the beep is annoying)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love My SpotBot!","review":"This little machine is the best thing I've ever owned. Bissel should be sending me kickbacks for as many of these I've sold on their behalf just by telling people how wonderful it is. It's kind of a running joke amongst our friends now b/c I'm so enthusiastic about it. We hosted game night and was telling our guests about it and seemingly on cue our friend accidentally launched a glass of cabernet onto our off-white carpet. No problem...SpotBot! Came right out. They were all so impressed that each couple went right out and bought one. Now with the addition of our puppy...embarassingly enough...you can see each and every spot he's had an accident and the SpotBot has cleaned it. Guess it's time for a professional carpet cleaner to come in and do the whole rug b/c the cleanest spots on it are where the SpotBot has been!!!! Thank you Bissel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on new stains.. but old not as good","review":"This product worked great on cleaning my micro fiber couches and cleaning up my kids stains they made within the past 24 hours, but older set in stains, not so well.

That worked great until after you clean up your spot the machine leaves a ring mark on your carpet... I had to get the ring mark off by hand... not the best machine..

Simple and quick to use, and the machine's size is not so large that you find it hard to move or store. I did have to find a way to treat the outside ring it leaves on the carpet. I used a spray on cleaner to blend in the edges once the spot had dried. But still, a great machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spot Bot","review":"The Spot Bot is living up to its reputation. I had set-in pet stains on my light colored carpet. Using Bissell's Oxy-Gen cleaner and the Pet/Odor cleaner, the Spot Bot effectively removed the stains. The carpet was wet for about 24 hours after treatment. A couple of the worst spots required 2 cycles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made spots worse!","review":"Contrary to the majority of the highly rated reviews on the SpotBot, I have had nothing but bad luck with it. I have several pet stains on my carpet that have been an eyesore for quite a while now, in fact, those spots were the main reason I broke down and purchased the SpotBot.Thanks to this device, these 3 and 4 inch spots have been increased to perfectly circular 6 inch spots. All the SpotBot did was spread the stain around in a circle and increase it's size. I keep my carpets in my house immaculate ... they are not dirty. So this new spot is NOT a large \\"clean\\" spot, it is most definitely a dirtier spot than what it began as.I have gone over each of the spots twice now with the SpotBot, trying each of the included cleaning solutions. No luck.This just goes to prove that if a device seems too good to be true, it most definitely is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing results","review":"I was ready to either give away our dog, replace the carpets or both until we got this. We will need to get the carpets cleaned throughout after using this since the spot bot cleans so well that the dirt on the rest of the carpet really stands out. Still cheaper than replacing the carpets. Absolutely love it, worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I got this as a gift. I have three kids, a dog and live in government quarters that require us to leave the carpet looking new (they even black light you upon checking out.) This product is a life saver. I haven't had any problems with spraying. It does leave crop circles, but does get all the stains out, then when I get the big steam cleaner out when I do that once a quarter cleaning, it all blends together. It is a great product that saves me time, energy and hopefully when we check out next year some dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talked the talk, but couldn't walk the walk!","review":"Bissell does heavy advertising for this product so I was happy to pick one up to clean a few pet stains. I figured it was the perfect product for the job. After all it is called the SpotBot.When I received the product I followed the directions to a tee. I even did two cycles with the machine to insure the stain would be lifted. It is easy to use. Just press a button and let the machine work. Unfortunately it did not work. Not only was the stain still there, but it actually got worse from all the shampoo this machine put on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cleaner bites!","review":"But not in a good way. After reading the countless great reviews here on Amazon and getting testimonials from other pet owners who own this vacuum, I finally splurged...excited that my cleaning duties were about to get easier.Was I ever wrong!This cleaner sounds great from the \\"stand back and watch it do it's thing\\" standpoint, but that's really about it. Simple stains took two cycles to wipe out adequately- but worst of all, was the amount of cleaning solution left in the carpeting afterwards. It was saturated!Similarly, the handheld upholstery wand was equally as useless. And while the spray feature seemed to worked well, there simply wasn't enough suction power to pull the fluid back into the machine.By the time I was done cleaning a few different areas in my living room, I found myself on the floor on hands and knees with a towel trying to soak up all the wet solution left behind. What's the point?They need to re-invent this machine. Too bad.

It's a waist of time. While it does work to remove some stains it just doubles the amount of time it takes me to clean my carpet.

Met all my expectations. As preveously noted, a fluid hog. Mixing high strength solution, and running the 6 minute set-in spot mode(stubborn stains)it uses 8 oz of Bissel OxyGen2 and 4 Oz Little Green plus tap water for each stain treatment cycle. The machine holds enough fluid for 2 extended spot treatments/cleaning cycles. But the proof is in the results. It really works. A truely painless way to clean. Just be sure and have enough supplies on hand. Once you get caught up, they will seem to last longer. If you can afford this $100 gem you shouldn't complain about the cost. The convienence is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product, minor drawbacks","review":"As with any product there is bound to be minor drawbacks. I found this cleaner to have two:1. The solution tank is only good for about 2 cycles (12 minutes) before needing to be refilled. This only becomes a problem if you use expensive cleaning solution. I use various powders that are mixed with water, but keep this in mind when you buy it.2. If you don't go over the spot with the manual brush, you will have a neat circle where the spot bot was. This only takes about 30 seconds to fix, but you have to do it every time. It's kind of annoying.All the same, it does a great job, especially for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this if you have pets and kids!","review":"I have had a large carpet cleaner for some time, but seldom got it out when there was a small stain or spill. I got this machine and keep it ready to go and there is no more hassle when the kids or pets have some kid of accident. Grab the machine and it goes to work. If you get it done at the time of the accident, it is pretty miraculous in making it disappear. For older stains you might have to go over it more than once, but I still got good results. I agree with another poster that it seems to have a slow leak if you leave the tank full, but I just stick it in the garage where it doesn't matter if a little liquid drools out. It does leave the carpet a little damp so I usually \\"blot\\" to dry afterward and fluff the carpet back into position."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE my Spot-Bot","review":"I love my SpotBot. I have purchased alot of carpet cleaning products over the years, as I have always had house pets, but never have I owned anything as efficient and easy to use as my SpotBot. It handles even the worst set in stains. I would recommend this product to anyone who has pets and/or kids. I don't know how I ever got along without it! The SpotBot is also made well. It is very sturdy! I had a sick cat here recently and it got put to the test.....and man, did it perform! I have no complaints what-so-ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crop Circles and clean stairs","review":"I used the SpotBot in a high traffic area to remove stains from spills - my bad I was left with crop circles - warning do not use the hands free feature on carpet that isn't mostly clean. (Using the manual mode would have worked just fine)On the bright side this was corrected by using a full sized cleaning machine when I cleaned the entire room.The product does work very well for stairs and cars where the full sized machine doesn't without a lot of hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy clean-up afterwards","review":"Being somewhat of a collector of household cleaning machines, I must say that of all the carpet cleaners I currently own, and have previously owned, this is the easiest device to clean. Aside from doing a fabulous job of removing carpet stains without having to apply any elbow grease, the often dreaded job of rinsing, dismantling, and re-assembling after use is pretty much eliminated. I use to resort to cleaning small stains with a bottle of spray carpet cleaner, and a couple of paper towels. The job of cleaning the cleaner was harder than doing the cleaning by hand! So far, I have not hesitated to pull the SpotBot out from the closet, and let it rip into newly appearing carpet stains. I only hope now that the machine lives a long, healthy life."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FOR STAINS!!","review":"Very pleased with this product! It removed some old pet stains after only 3 minutes. Easy to use and nice and compact. I love that you can walk away while it cleans. Yes, the carpet is damp but it dries."},{"rating":"2","title":"As seen on TV and WORKS TOO!","review":"This product really does what it claims. The SpotBot lifted and cleaned stains that I couldn't get up with a full-size deep cleaner (and thus they have set-in for months). The machine does go through quite a bit of solution. I found sometimes a run with clean warm water worked well also. I added formula only for really bad stains.Had a small problem with the machine out of the box. It didn't spray at all. After a minute of playing around with the manual hose trigger, the solution started pumping. No problems since.Again, there is no storage tray in the box, although instructions refer to it as \\"provided\\".Overall, a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"SpotBot","review":"Providing all you want to do is clean spots, this is an excellent spot cleaner for stains and there is a hose attachment for manual cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"good purchase","review":"I have had the spot bot for a couple months and with one year old twins, I seem to using quite often these days. It is simple to use and virtually does all the work for you. You may need to turn the manual suction on after a cleaning as it doesnt soak up ALL of the water from carpets. I used the manual use for cleaning up my cloth rocking chair from when my twins were very new and it had spit up all over it due to reflux. It did a great job cleaning it up even though it had been there for months and months. It is quite loud, I wish it was a little quieter. Overall, I am quite happy with my purchase. I hope that this will last throughout the years. Sidenote: buy extra formula, it goes through a lot during one cleaning. 4 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last but 18mths","review":"While it worked it was awesome but after 18 months, the hand held stopped working and the regular rotating brush stopped sending out solution. I am having to treat the area by hand and then let the brushes finish. It has always leaked if you leave the solution container on, so I take it off and set it in a bowl in my utility room.Overall, very diasappointed. I can't believe it didn't last 2 years and I take very good care of my stuff! I'm going to buy the Hoover SteamVac w/Clean surge next. I hear great reviews and it's about the same cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This product was a waste of money. The spray function did not work at all.

Better on darker carpet?","review":"I bought the Spot Bot after moving my bed and finding an old crusty pile of cat barf underneath. I had been wanting a carpet cleaner and didn't put off buying it any longer. The Spot Bot was delivered and I cleaned the cat barf immediately. The carpet was like new again; I was so impressed! After that I cleaned up various spills and stains and it worked quite well.I recently moved into a house with white carpet - Ugh! I woke up this morning to find that my dog went poop and pee on the carpet and it's stuck and stained. Great. So I get out my little spot bot. I put some Bissell Pet cleaner in it and let it go to work. It picked up most of it but still left a slight stain. Why oh why do they even make white carpet?!?! All in all I like the Spot Bot and I'm glad I bought it. I do wish it had better suction and I also wish I had a high end darker carpet, but it's a great little machine anyways."},{"rating":"2","title":"spot bot arrived broken","review":"I enjoy the product...however, the one I received from Amazon was broken.

Now we've got loads of circles on our carpet which are very evident to visitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"no spray","review":"I think this would be a great cleaner, if it would only work.Unfortunately it does not. I am wondering if there has been a defective bunch of them made recently because I just read the review before mine, and the person had 2 units in which the spray funtion would not work. I was really looking forward to using it because I have 5 pets who have frequent accidents. Last night one of them had an accident, and today two of them did ... I think because of the thunder storms they were afraid to go out.It was very frustrating because I repeatedly tried to get it to work. I tried the various recommendations, but the sprayer would not work.I ended up using my cordless bissel 2X spotlifter instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for upholstery","review":"This product may be great for carpets, but I bought it to use on upholstery, (in particular, the fronts of sofas and chairs where my dog rubs against and soils them) and it isn't satisfactory for that purpose (even though it is listed as one of its uses). To work on small areas, I couldn't narrowly direct the spray of the cleaning solution and ended up drenching areas I didn't want to wet. It was a mess. Easier to do small jobs by hand.

The automatic mode worked like a champ, but as many reviews have said, it leaves the carpet wet, so we tried to use the manual mode to suck up the excess water as reviews had suggested. Unfortunately, manual mode didn't work; the manual mode light just blinks and the machine refuses to start. Digging around on the Internet shows this to be a fairly common problem, supposedly involving the switch detecting when you've removed the hose from the unit. I've written to Bissel Customer Support, but may just end up returning the unit to Amazon since it's clearly defective as it came from the factory. Needless to say, the first impression in not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Product that actually does what it is suppose to do! It's WONDERFUL!","review":"I have 2 old cats that seem to puke up hairballs every 15 minutes. (They have long black fur which is brushed several times a week) In the past I would \\"OKY-Clean\\" the stains, but this was quite a process, took a long time to do and often didn't get the stains out. Finally my partner went out and bought us a spot bot which has worked correctly since day one! We use it everyday mostly on pet stains, but also when my better half spills something, which is almost as frequently as the cats! I can't say enough positive things about this machine, it has been a godsend, helping us keep up after our crazy pukey kitty cats. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR ANYONE WITH PETS. You will LOVE It!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Pet Spots","review":"I have kids and a pet, therefore I have spots. The SpotBot works great on the spots. It is very simple to use and easy to clean. There will be a clean spot once the cleaning cycle is complete. It takes at least a day for the spot to dry. I then have to work the spot to make it look like the rest of the carpet - vacuuming isn't enough. But all in all, I love it. It has removed set in stains and easily takes care of fresh stains. And purchasing it through Amazon.com was cheaper than at a local retailer or Direct Buy! It was delivered to my door within two days! I am a happy customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can See the Clean in the Dark","review":"This thing may work a little too well. Within 10 minutes of opening the box, I was cleaning black grease stains that had been ground into my carpet by workers over a year ago. Just fill the fluid tank. Set it on a spot, push one button, and six minutes later, the stain is gone. The trouble is, now I have six-inch clean circles all over my apartment. I'm going to have to clean the entire place once I get rid of the set-in stains. But I'm loving it. Who would have thunk it? I can clean my carpet without the addition of elbow grease!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea for a great product","review":"I bought the SpotBot from Amazon on the advice of a co-worker and based on the reviews here. I was a little nervous because of some of the bad reviews but thought it was worth a try. We have basically clean carpet with lots of small spots all over so we might be the perfect market for this device.Out of the box, the sprayer didn't spray. I called customer service, got right through (bonus star!) and was told to prime the unit as follows:1. Get a bowl of warm water2. Suck up the bowl with the hose (i.e. manual mode)3. Hold down the Manual button for 30 seconds.I did and it started spraying immediately. I just cleaned up two stains that were very set-in and almost impossible to clean by hand. Wow, I'm very impressed.The only minor complaint is that the unit tends to leave an excess of water behind. This is easily managed with the manual hose which sucks it up very nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tip on how to overcome noise of machine and watch TV","review":"A suggestion as to how to outfox the noise quotient of the SpotBot, and still be able to watch and hear your TV in the same room. Use wireless headphones with your TV. Works like a charm. Turn volume on headphones up high (however not ear splitting, for your own sake). You are still able to hear the TV while the SpotBot works its will. Also, I haven't tried this, however, I would think that after cleaning a spot, if you would take the brush tool and clean around the perimeter of the circle left by the SpotBot, it might minimize the \\"circle\\" effect left by cleaning the spot with just the machine. Just stroke the brush attachment vertically out from the cleaned spot, going over it a couple of times, and perhaps this will minimize the crop circle effect. Whoever tries it first, report in as to success or failure of attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"agree with no spots whooo hoooo","review":"i agree with no spots whoo hooo. i own the spotbot and i love it. you can cut down on the wetness if you use the hand held device and suck up the water after you have cleaned the spot it also helps with the circle thing. just scrub the hand held device around the circles and it blends in and cleans up the extra wetness. i use it all the time and would highly recommend it to those who are getting new carpet so your carpet will always look new no matter what you spill on it. i got my spotbot with new carpet and you would never know that my carpet is 5 years old and i also have a dog who sometimes has an accident and i have 6 grandchildren who sometimes spell stuff but no problem i have the SPOTBOT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A MUST have if you have Pets and Stairs","review":"I purchased this cleaner recently to use on the pet stains and the stairs. The fact that it works on spots, and has a attachment so that you can do stairs and high traffic areas such as door ways makes this unit worth every cent. I did one pet spot on the carpet, leaving me with a extremely clean circle, which only demonstrated how dirty the rest of the carpet was. I also plan on using it on the car seats etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time proven hard working machine","review":"I have had this machine for over a year and I cannot say enough about it. I foster rescued beagles plus have three of my own dogs in the house, in addition to two kids. So all my floor care apparatus is put to the test regularly. I have had a standard upright steam cleaner for years that everyone should get as a wedding present. But this little machine kicks butt over anything I have used in the past for those unexpected mishaps. Usually you discover those accidents at the most inopportune time. With my SpotBot I can quickly grab it and let it clean while I deal with whatever else is going on. Today I was going to clean up an accident in the living room and decided to do the whole rug with the upright. I had to go back with the SpotBot to erase the odor from the piddle. It's an awesome machine and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine","review":"We just got this product a few days ago and I am very impressed. It gets up the spots that our leaky dog leaves. We had our carpet professionally cleaned a week ago and need something to clean the spots though our next cleaning service appointment.

The four screws on the top that hold the top cover on break the plastic holders inside--Therefore there is nothing tight to hold things in place. It is totally unfixable with out replaceing the entire top--They do not sell the part--nor could all the electrical parts be reconnected. So enjoy your product for nine months then you too will have a piece of junk!!!!!!!All four of the machines broke in the same way.

It will probably end up costing us money... and we live with big spots everywhere. hmph"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"It's a little hard to fill the tank, since it's round on the bottom and flat on top so you have to do a balancing act to get the cleaning solutions in.

Spills are up before they have a chance to become stains. Just set it on the spot and it does the rest.

I've learned that if you clean the unitafter use you'll have no problems. Heres what I do. Drain andrefill supply tank with fresh cold water. Remove hose turn on manual and spray till you get cold water. Then remove tank andspray till water stops.Now fill SINK with clean water. Still on manual suck up water till recovery tank is full. Empty and repeat. This cleans the hose.

The instructions were easy to understand and the cleaner is very simple to use. My only complaint would be that the spout where the solution comes from (on the handle) sometimes will spit soap out when disassembling it. I just hate that I just finished cleaning my seat, and then 'Oops!' some solution falls on it. Nothing too bad, just caught me off guard the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolute rubbish","review":"The spotbot is a piece of JUNK after you use it press some paper towel over the area just cleaned (joke) and see how much filth is left behind but it is very useful as a door stop"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a really great thing to have when you have pets or little kids and carpet. I used it right away and it did clean up really nice. No more getting down on my hands and knees, scrubbing. But it is true, like others said in their reviews, you can not leave liquids in it. They will leak out. But that is not a problem, just empty everything when you are done. I like to add hot water anyways, when I clean. I usually just put some vinegar on the carpet stain, let it soak for a minute, while I fill up the container with water, then start the tool. I do dry it afterward with a towel, to get most of the water off my carpet. But I left it before, and it was dry the next day. The noise is normal, just like a carpet cleaner and the beeping afterward is not loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"SpotBot replaces husband","review":"I think the Spotbot has replaced me.It works so well my wife spends more time with it than me.We have an older cat we love very much but he makes a little bit of a mess.

Out of the box, the scrubbing brushes/head would not turn. It had been poorly assembled, but after disassembling and re-assembling the scrubbing head and getting the gears to mesh, the scrubbing function started to work. The next problem was that it will not spray. I tried all of the on-line solutions to this somewhat common problem (see FAQ Answer ID 443 of 10/27/2006), but it still would not spray. If I manually pour the cleaning solution into the carpeting, it does do a good job of scrubbinbg and vacuming out stains automatically. I wanted this to work, but would not buy one on-line for fear of getting a defective one like mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless if you have at least one hand","review":"I usually rely on Amazon customers for intelligent insight into great products. This time, I was really disapointed when I followed their advice. The unit is a silly piece of junk designed to do nothing more than consume Bissel cleaning products. The brushes are so weak that you would have to be the most lethargic person on the face of the Earth to provide less effort. Plus, going back to consumables, I used an entire tank on just two stains. TO make matters worse, the stain was still there after the 6 minute cycle on each!Honestly, the best results I have had is using a carpet cleaner in a spray can (that I bought at Sams), and a cloth. This machine is nothing more than a gimmick. If you are interested in wasting money and creating more landfill-destined junk, than buy this unit. Otherwise, save your money.Amazon shoppers, you really got this one wrong. I forgive you though -- your record is still pretty good. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crop Circles ALL OVER MY HOUSE!!","review":"When I bought this we thought it would be the best thing since sliced bread. I owed another Bissel model that the handle kept cracking and then would become a drip where it cracked. I liked that machine except for that issue, so when this one came out we though GREAT the perfect solution to our problem with the older model. Out with the old in with the new. In the beginning I was totally enamored with The Spot Bot it seemed to do the job well, now 6 months later all of the area's I have cleaned over time have re-appeared and I have a house full of little crop circles. This has become a nightmare especially on the lighter carpet I have in my house. I don't even know what to do here? Will having my entire carpet cleaned return it back to normal or will I be stuck with these little circles forever? And Who do you call or contact 6 months later?

I bought my SpotBot 6 days ago and it worked pretty good (if you don't mind bright clean \\"polka dots\\" dotting your room). After breakfast, I put the SpotBot down and it quit working on the second spot. The automatic feature quit. The machine would only beep at me with all of its lights flashing. Bissell customer service says this is a \\"most unusual problem\\" and authorized me to send it to them for service. I do not have 6 day old purchases serviced. I returned it to the store for a refund and I am looking for a different machine.In the interest of fairness, please note that I bought a 1200 model and it seems that it has been superceded by the 1200B (at least online)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Wished it would work!","review":"After reading the high marked posts about this machine I purchased one, took it home, first tried the short cycle, didn't pick up the spot, not a real tough spot either, so then did the 'set in stain' setting(twice as long as regular cycle). Well it appeard to get most of the spot out, but left alot of the water/cleaner in the carpet which spread out, then it dried over nite, then I had a bigger spot! This machine is a good idea, but Bissell did NOT finish the job, brushes move REAL SLOW, and the vacuum part is really whimpy so it leaves lots of liquid in the carpet to spread out the stain and not pick it up.. Oh well, I'm returning it, maybe Hoover will come out with a good one...love the idea though.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gr8 LIttle Machine","review":"This is my fourth generation of the Little Green Machine and this is by far the best yet.

It cleans so well you could end up with clean spots all over your house and need to use a regular carpet shampoo machine to blend it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it quits working...","review":"Like many other reveiwers, I was initially quite enthusiastic about the Spot Bot--seemed to do the job as advertised, and was great for the quick clean-up. However, I've only used this about a dozen times and today is just stopped--mid cycle. Sigh. There is no power to the machine, and the power light does not come on. I did the trouble-shooting tips (checked the breaker, tried another outlet, examined the hose and cord), but with no luck. I suspect it's the circuit board (like some other reviewers have mentioned) and thus not repairable. That's too bad, because a machine should last more than a dozen times. Just to echo what others have said, I also called the customer service call center. No luck, no help, just a long wait on hold. Very disappointed with the reliability of this machine and the lack of customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't say enough good about it","review":"I can't say enough about my SpotBot. I have a dog and a cat, and both have a real knack for vomiting on the carpet instead of my tiled rooms. The SpotBot ALWAYS gets the spot out. Amazing, given that my carpet is very light tan, and the spot usually bright orange. Per the recommendation of previous reviewers, I use spray bottles for the Little Green and oxygen cleaner -- rather than putting those solutions into the machine's reservoir. To repeat what so many others have said (and thank goodness they did, encouraging me to buy one)... EVERY pet owner should have one of these! Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spot Bot - Only if it worked ....","review":"I was willing to dish out the money for this product since I have dogs who are getting older and making messes. But I've had it a whole WEEK and it has already stopped working. If you look through the reviews here (and on other review sites) you'll see that the water spout/line must be defective, as was the case with mine. Used it maybe two times and now - no water. That is clearly a manufacturer defect, one that Bissel had to have known about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still wet? No problem!","review":"For anyone who is concerned about the carpet still being wet, just do what I do and go dig out the 3-gallon (or other) Wet-Dry Vacuum (mine is an antique Shop-V model), and it will get up almost all the damp, so everything'll dry quicker.Another answer is to get your $10 square window fan and set it on the floor near the wet area, where it can blow all night or day and evaporate everything. But be sure no pets or other causes might tip it over, unless it's got a safety-switch that will turn it off if it falls over.As for other reviews, I'm ordering my SpotBot today, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spotbot","review":"Great machine...however, when I first got it I had to call customer service to get the thing working. The pump had run dry and required to be primed before it started pumping liquid again. It was a simple fix but I never would have thought to do all that they led me through to make it work. Be patient, call the 800 number and do as they say...It's worth the trouble when it starts pumping successfully. I have experimented with other liquid soaps and have found that the liquid that ships with it works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Like everyone else I've only tried the Multiplayer Test. The graphics are incredible. It is very similar to the engine Quake 3 Arena uses, but better. The Multiplayer is really smooth and really good and its just a beta. You get sick of the beach map, but its still fun to play, When this game comes out I'm going to rip it right off the shelves. The single player is going to be really cool and will have tons of more maps for us to use. Overall I'm sure not many will be disappointed in this game when the retail version comes out. Yet, another great fps by ID.GO AMERICA!"},{"rating":"2","title":"id software never fails.","review":"I've only played the internet-release test demo (multiplayer only) and I must say this is one the greatest first person shooters I've ever played and I've played a lot.

I liked the first couple levels that reminded me of the classic. Then it got rediculous, and I was fighting legions of undead because the programmers decided to GIVE THE NAZIS A HOLIDAY and let invincible Zombies murder me instead.So much for the good ol' revenge shooter. Is it just me, or is killing zombies kinda redundant? I mean, they're already dead, and don't make for a villian that makes me go, \\"Woo hoo!\\" when I've killed them.Basically the programmers COULDN'T DECIDE WHETHER TO MAKE DOOM 3 OR WOLFENSTEIN first, and decided to slap the two together.You basically have here WOLFEN-DOOM, complete with an INVINCIBLE ARMY OF NAZI JUGGERNAUTS, and a legion of INVINCIBLE NAZI ZOMBIES.But I liked it. You should check out the demo or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money, RTCW is the latest overrated dissappointing first person shooter to come out. AI? None. Graphics? Quake Plot? Essentially none. Major step backwards from HalfLife and Unreal. Still trying to figure out how I was imprisoned in a nazi castle yet got my mission objectives. The graphics are incredibly dissapointing. There was no sense of discovery and the unknown like in Halflife. The AI was nonexistent (when you get to the guard behind the bullet-proof glass and you jump up and down and shoot at him and he just stands there you will understand). If you have nothing better to do I guess it will provide the first person shooter fix, but you will be left dissapointed.

Compared to some of the older FPSs out there like quake and unreal the levels are interesting and fun. About on par with half life or HALO. Multiplayer beats the older generation of games, but is about on par with some of the shareware half-life mods. I've noticed that most of the people that really rave about it don't play many of the newer games, though your results may vary. As far as I can see, nothing new here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent FPS Game","review":"Wolfenstein 3d was one of the best dos games ever, and RtCW is even better. This game really pushes the Quake 3 engine to the max. The gameplay is deep and addictive, some of the best I've ever played.

Buy it, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein","review":"I just finished the best game of 2001. I've read other reviews and comments by the critics and quite frankly I don't understand how they can't give it the best game of 2001. I've only played the single player thusfar and it has lived up to my expectations. Superb graphics, sound, weaponery, and story line. I was a huge fan of Max Payne before sitting down to Return to Castle Wolfenstein, but now I believe this is the best game of the year. All of this before even trying the Multi-Player. Wow, two games in one. Do yourself a favor and go out and get this game today."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WOLF IS BACK!!!!!","review":"After playing the first Wolfenstein which seems like eons ago, I was looking forward to an \\"updated\\" version.

The single player missions for the most part are boring and repetitive. I'm comparing it to Half-Life and it is nowhere even close to the quality of the single player. What is really shocking are the graphic defects present in the game - guns appearing through walls, dead soldiers hovering a few feet above ground, some cheesy AI, but better than most. The multiplayer is much more enjoyable, and uses many of the single player maps. I'll be selling it and buying Medal of Honor when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good game","review":"RCW is one very nice first person shooter. Using the Quake engine makes the graphics alone worth the buy. But with its price tag that alone is not enough to convince someone to purchase it. The enemy AI is good. As an example when you are detected they don't simply come charging after you, rather theytake evasive action and get reinforcements. So as a tactical tip take them out as you see them. Elite guards are more inteligent than the regular guards. The monstors are a big pain.If you want a shooter which will give you the mix of killing sprees and more calculated stratergic take-downs then this game is for you, with good graphics to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical 3D Shooter","review":"Good game, nothing really ground breaking.

I've replayed it more than twice the hours of Max Payne. Never going to put RtCW on ebay. Ran *smooth* on 866 P3 with 32 meg NVidia GF2 GTS. No bugs no patch, high framerates. You need 1600x1200 resolution to get the full photorealism. For that, used 1.53 Althlon and GF3. Make sure you at least look at it in 1600x1200, even if you are running a slide show. RtCW is without a doubt the game of the year. It gets beat in the mag ratings because of a weak story. For whatever reason, FPS games do not provide stories like the best movies and books. Does Half-Life compare to Apocolypse Now? Give up looking for high art stories; appreciate the immersion and graphics."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY violent","review":"Alot of people are going to say that two stars is unfair for a game that has such great graphics and playability...i understand where you're coming from if you think that, because this game looks great and is VERY fun. But it is way too graphically violent for me. I dont have anything against shooting games in general, I love Counter Strike and IGI, and Unreal Tournament was good back in the day, but Wolfenstein ups the ante way beyond simple kill and be killed gameplay, going to extremes like depictions of torture and mutilation. Even though i can spend hours shooting enemies in the head while playing Medal of Honor, and enjoy lopping off limbs in Rune, playing Castle Wolfenstein is, for me, completely demoralizing and dehumanzing. I dont play it because of that, and any game I wont play can't get better than two stars.By the way, this game is banned in Germany. But that might just be because of the anti-German sentiment as much as the violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's decent, but it's not worth upgrading your computer for.","review":"In my opinion, I wasted my money upgrading my computer at a cost of nearly $600 to play this game in it's 'full glory.' Although it is a nice game, it certainly doesn't live up to any hype and in many aspects it feels like a rehash of Doom and the Quake series....I spent $350 on an Xbox and Halo, and I can say without a doubt that was the best investment I ever made in the games industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but nothing ground-breaking","review":"OK, I'm about halfway through the single player campaign and I've played quite a bit of the multiplayer. It is a lot of fun. The graphics are stellar as is the sound. BUT, it keeps seeming like a bit of \\"been there, done that.\\" If you've played No One Lives Forever, you will immediately find numerous similarities: from the chatter between guards to the stealth-style required in many missions. It's not that it's bad, since NOLF was a helluva game, but it's deja vu all over again. That being said, it still a fun game, visually and viscerally.The multiplayer is quite a bit of fun but netcode could still use a little tweaking methinks. The life of this game will be defined by the mod-ability of it. I don't think the multiplayer modes as they exist today will play out for that long on their own -- again a bit of \\"been there\\" with some of the Half Life WWII mods.

I'll probably try it, but for $50, I expect it Joystick compatible!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, Scary, and plays well too","review":"This is an amazing game. The graphics are very nice. The textures on the buildings are nothing short from stunning. The actual gameplay is fast and furious (Kind of like quake 3, because it's by I.D. too). The use of scary sounds definitily makes the Wolfenstein atmosphere feel creepy. The levels inside the crypts are terrifying, I even jumped a few times. It may not be as scary as Undying, but it defintely gives you some chills. The story is great and developes throughout the game, sucking you in. Really this game is not that short compared to other FPS's and the fact it has a very good multiplayer means it has tons of replay value. Overall its a great game, that no action fan should miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addiction at it's best","review":"I don't know what the guy with the 1 star is smoking, but this game is just awesome. When you have all the eye candy turned on, it's a visual treat. Details are amazing, from the air strikes, and the constant shaking of the ground because of them. (the flame thrower....fire is so real and beautiful). sort of like being thrown back in time.If you like team based shooters, this is it. running around bunkers, defending, or storming enemy strong holds and it's all classic stuff (weapon wise of course). another thing, the objectives for each team are pretty clear and i think it helps the team based. i haven't played one game yet where it doesn't require team work to win. sure it's not quake 3 but hey it's using a more refined engine and who here has not heard of WWII.try out the test release - demo. it will give you a feel for it, but when the final release is out....some of those maps are going to rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Whan I first recieved Return to castle wolfenstein, I had already heard about it from friends, and needless to say was excited. And the game delivered, extraordinarily so. The single player campaign is great, with smooth graphics, great gameplay, and incredible AI. My only complaint was that the multiplayer was a bit dry, but hey, cant complain too much. Definitly worth your money and the 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paying for a mod","review":"It's pretty sad that anyone would actually pay for this game. Yeah, it MIGHT have a good single player game. The multiplayer so far, is sorta lame. Just a rip off from CTF basically.And the game itself is only a damned MOD. The graphics aren't impressive at all, not compared to others FPS that are out right now.And the flame thrower is pathetic. Check out the Unreal 2 one. Much more realistic and impressive.I'd just save my money for Unreal 2, or another game, which uses a modern engine, not a mod for an old engine which was only half way decent to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"only thing i liked about this game was the box art","review":"iv played the full version's single player all the way throo (wich by the way only took about 7 hours) and this game is pure [...] from start to finish the only thing i liked about this game was the box art :<) everything els in this game compaired to released and upcomming games is pathetic this in my view is pretty much TFC with q3 graphics and none of the fun and the multiplayer is almost as sad as the single player game it gets tired after about 2 hours the best map wich also isnt that great is the beachmap from the demo i resold this game back to EB and reserved ALLIED ASSAULT wich just from looking at it seems to be the best ww2 game out for a while so anyone hungering for a WW2 game wait til FEB when ALLIED ASSAULT comes out it will actually be a WW2 game and not some fake attemp to revive an excelent classic"},{"rating":"2","title":"return to castle wolfenstein","review":"this game is a 10+++++++++.great graphics,easy to use control and the multiplayer is addicting.this is the first multiplayer game i ever played.and i mean it.it is like a drug.be prepared to be in trouble with your better half or your kids because thats the only minus to this game.i have 1.8 processor.256 rdram,64mbinvidia,56kmodem.even without cable modem you will have a great time.some glitches but for the most part runs clean.oh yeah,singleplayer is great also.i cant wait for the sequal!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mulitplayer is nothing new","review":"I bought this game primarily for the multiplayer action, and they really didn't reinvent the wheel. Similar to any game with \\"Classes\\", like Half Life mods Day of Deafeat and Team Fortress. Although the game is visually stunning, the grapics don't make the game play any better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan since 1991...","review":"I have been listening to David Arkenstone (isn't that a great name for the musician?!) since 1991, and I am not surprised to see him branch out into Tolkienesque themes. What a delight his music has been to me.The syntho/folk themes are wonderful; the arpeggios and percussion lilt and charm the listener.This collection of songs heralds, again, the Middle-Earth themes, complete with a mystical journey/narrative, a fanciful map on the CD cover, and the theme of noble adventure. His work gets better and better all the time! I highly recommende all of his works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Presented Musical Journey","review":"I only have recently discovered David Arkenstone. I have been looking for music that has dimension and is upbeat. This cd allows my mind to be clear and erases any brain overload. The music is varied due to different parts of the \\"journey\\". Each piece stands on its own. Highly recommended. So glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderately Useful","review":"Although there is some useful and interesting information in the book, the author is more interested in pressing his environmental agenda than in compiling scholarly information on the Green Man. I was annoyed by his constant preaching. I'm sure there must be better books on this subject than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written book on a fascinating subject","review":"This book covers a huge wealth of folk culture and history, but sadly cheapens the subject with awful suppositions and new age wittering.The author creates theories, then bases other theories on those, to create a whole nonsense of his own imagining.for instance (and this is my own lazy approximation,and not an actual excerpt) \\" xxxxx was also associated with the colour green, so as we can see xxxxx is also a green man archetype. As we have seen, all green things are essentially the green man in some form or other\\"There are some tantalising snippets of information in here, that warrant further research, but the rambling style and eco/new age slant make this a tiresome read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beguiling story","review":"This is a fascinating novel, beautifully written with grace and style. One is mesmerized as one follows the fortunes of Tak Sing---from the turmoil of his childhood in revolutionary China, through his struggle for survival as a refugee in Hong Kong, to the later intrigue of his final years. This engrossing tale of courage and integrity is filled with poignant and tender scenes of human relationships, underlining the author's steadfast belief in the power and magic of love. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Behzad's comeback......","review":"He is one of the greatest and passionate guitarist today. Behzad's third album Luna y Sol is just beautiful. Since I heard to his second album, strings of desire, I became fascinated with behzad's music. Behzad plays a beautiful spanish guitar which will take your pain away and will lift your spirit. This album is blend of pop, eastern and spanish music. There are so many tracks which is my favourite like track 2 and 5 and many more. Behzad's music is a perfect music for romance and unforgettable moments which you never forget.VIva behzad, Zendeh bad Behzad.Buy this album, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This CD is one of my top favorites, I have to force myself to turn it off so as not to get weary of it and spoil its magic. It has depth. It is a lot more than just a guitar to give a full, beautiful sound. I'm not totally in love with all the tracks, but 1, 4, & 6 stand out as excellent. One can get lost in this music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are the songs on this CD?","review":"It is probably a great CD but sence I don't know what is on it I can't say. Discriptions of a CD should indlude the list of songs on the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peterson's Colleges in the South","review":"I was very disappointed with the content of this book. True it did give provide the hard facts such as how many students, how many faculty, majors available, $/semester hour etc, but it was sorely lacking on describing the philosophy of the college. There was no information indicating the degree of liberalism or conservatism. There wasn't even a description of the degree or lack thereof of the ethnic diversity found on the campus. Before I will even think of attending a specific college I will want to know how the college mind set will complement, expand, or terrorize my own. This book did not provide any information in that area to help me with my selection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE THIS SERIES BUT...","review":"I love this series and I've read them all, [if you want to find #1-28, go to amazon.co.uk] but I hate this one. I mean, c'mon, Aisha gets mugged, gets amnesia, and thinks shes 14 again. this one is definetly my least favorite. however, the rest of the series is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasing, gets to the point","review":"Aisha finds out that a previous boyfriend is coming back to the island. He has invited her and her friends to come to a gig that their band has. She goes, and Christopher becomes jealous. Wait until you see what he does!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WHOA! EVEN THE LAST BOOK IN THE SERIES IS AWESOME!","review":"My first line may sound pretty corny, but it's the truth! Man, if there ever was an EIGHT book series I wouldn't mind reading again, this would be it. Aisha is one of the islanders near Maine along with her friends Zoey, Lucas, Jake, Nina, Claire, Ben, and Christopher. I just finished reading this book yesterday and started sometime last week. I hate reading, but this book got my attention. It ends the series with a series of events pertaining to the other books in this series and wraps everything up. You first have to start with \\"Zoey Fools Around\\" (first in the series), otherwise you won't know what the heck is going on. If you miss even ten pages of this book, you will be so dazed you have to go back. Then you'll never want to skip any pages ever again. This series is perfect for both girls and boys. It isn't corny or childish. Actually, this book shouldn't be for anyone over 13 years old"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great material, poor movie","review":"The premise of this movie is interesting and compelling, the potential for a great dramatic story was there, but the movie is very lame. With better acting and (yes) better direction, this could have been a masterpiece. Instead, I think it's little more than a wasted opportunity. Don't expect anything even remotely close to the Bicycle Thief or Umberto D. This is nothing more than a 1970s melodrama with excellent but badly developed social contents. It's not surprising that this movie is not as well known as other De Sica's movies. If you are planning on watching a limited number of neo-realist movies, my recommendation is do skip this one and go for the earlier path-breaking masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life goes on","review":"This has always been one of my favorite movies, and I was overjoyed to see that it was finally available on DVD. Unfortunately over the past 30 years we have grown, and what was once cutting edge, now appears to be something that has been seen many times before. Florinda is still beautiful and the clothing styles would fit right in today. The return to 1973 that I was hoping for didn't happen. A tad dissappointed, but still a great movie, and I am glad to have it in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Brief Vacation","review":"Italian director Vittorio De Sica returns to my newsletter. THE BICYCLE THIEF, AFTER THE FOX, and this. This one's 1973, Italian with English subtitles, in color. The premise is \\"sickness is the vacation of the poor.\\" Clara has a lousy husband and a lousy job, but some lung damage sends her to the sanatorium in the mountains. I like the premise. I grew up in the \\"work til you drop\\" culture, and in fact I'm still fighting to reprogram myself.I really wanted to like this movie, as a De Sica fan, but it was boring. The acting was surprisingly bad, and the opening 50 minutes in the factory were so cliche. I waited for the part in the hospital, hoping it was \\"the good part.\\" Nah, just some eccentrics and a romantic interest. A few good performances, largely wasted. I've seen movies excel with less, but this one just didn't pull it off. But on the plus side, the scenery was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"This fan is awesome, but a little loud.","review":"I bought the Lasko Air Director because of it's pivoting feature. My bedroom window is an an odd angle to my bed, and the fan can be turned to direct air exactly where I need it. It's powerful and moves a lot of air. My only complaint is that it is very loud, even on low I have to turn my television up to ridiculous volumes to be able to hear it over the fan. Other than that and the fact that there is no reverse motor feature to draw air out (you have to manually turn the fan around in the window), I would have given a five star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud","review":"I wanted a window exhaust fan that would it in a sliding window.This is not it, it don't fit in the window and exhaust cause it can't rotate more then 180degrees.On high it moved good air, pulling in outside air through the other windows of the apartment.However the thing it loud!!!I was expecting noise, which i figured on med or low wouln't matter much as it was was going in another room away from the bedroom.Boy was i wrong, its only just bearable on low, but it don't do its job on low eather."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"Very nice, powerful airflow, even on the 1st of three settings. Creates a nice draft, especially if a window on the other side of the room is open."},{"rating":"1","title":"Improved?","review":"Bought this \\"same\\" fan several years ago at a local Aubuchon Hardware and it has been working flawlessly since. Then last weekend, my wife decided to take it apart and clean (over zealously, apparently) the dust off of the blades, and broke one.After searching several stores locally and finding their selections to be lacking in design or just plain junk, we decided to order the \\"same\\" fan again. It arrived today and I agree with many of these other reviews...it is loud! Much louder than our old one. Upon closer examination it appears that Lasko has re-designed the blades. Our old fan had larger blades and resembled the fan pictured on the box. This new fan's blades seem about one third smaller (narrower). Suspect this may be the cause of the additional noise.We are not returning it because of the need for a fan now and because the last one was so good... but are still searching for the right one."},{"rating":"2","title":"moves air well","review":"being able to direct the air flow was the reason i purchased this fan. this fan moves air really well and blows where i want it to. it is a bit loud on medium and high, but we rarely use it on anything but low, so its ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great but noisy","review":"Very simple to use - most versatile. A great addition to my cooling arsenal really simple to use - most versital"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smaller window fan","review":"I loved this fan so much that I bought another one and one for my daughter. Smaller than the 20\\" box fans, it fits into the smaller windows in my apartment easily. And it WORKS. Whether using for intake or exhaust it does the job. Do you cook and don't have a stove fan vented to an outside wall? Put this fan in your kitchen window. Family comes by and you're not heartless enough to kick old Aunt Mary outside to smoke? Sit her down next to this fan in the window.I've only had it for one season, but I really like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfactory","review":"This fan is extremely loud. The low setting is louder than the high setting on comparable fans. The plastic case looks and feels very cheap. Pieces fit together poorly and the switch sticks out unattractively from the case. However, in my opinion, $35 + shipping is not cheap for a simple fan. It was not reviewed at the time I bought it so I hoped for the best.I bought the fan from Creative Products. Their return policy requires a 15% re-stocking fee unless you exchange it for another product of equal or greater cost. This was disclosed. However, in the future, I will not buy anything that is not well-reviewed from a vendor that charges a re-stocking fee."},{"rating":"1","title":"This fan blows!","review":"It's loud as hell. I mean loud. The low setting is like its on high x3.Would work perfect to dry a house that was just painted. I had it upstairs and could hear it downstairs. The design is ridiculous. Sure it fits in the window... if you enjoys having it stick out a foot.Loud and bad design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Noisy Noisy","review":"This fan seems like it is well constructed but man, is it NOISY. I can barely hear myself think when I've got it running -- even at the low speed. Seems like with all those decibels it generates this little jet engine should be displacing a lot of air, but in fact it seems to do only a modest job of moving the breeze in or out the room. Kind of a disappointment actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unique fan, quite loud","review":"I purchased this fan because I have an 18.5\\" square window. Amazon's description says this is for 18\\" windows. Unfortunately, the box states it is for 19\\"x20\\" windows. This is no really Lasko's fault, however. The main issue with this fan is it is annoyingly loud -- even on the lowest speed. Not quite as loud as my portable air conditioner, but close to it. If you plan on spending much time within 12' of this fan, I suggest you look else where. That being said, it does move a lot of air and if you are looking for a window fan for an unused portion of the house, then this may be ideal for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midrash magic","review":"This book is a little miracle. Like the King James Bible, it is lyrical. Like Torah, it goes to the essence of faith.

They all contain music with lots of good ideas and themes, but to me they all sound like film soundtracks rather than music for intense listening. They are experiments that don't quite work - a little grandiose, intellectual and messy. I think of them as creative practise for his great more recent work.One track on this collection (The Rug Merchant) is very good, and anticipates my favorite album of his that came 15 years later - \\"Ambient Cafe\\" (Briza). That album should be in the music collection of every good cafe on Earth. Any cafe that sticks a picture of the album cover on its door can expect me to stop for coffee.

The longer features are also good however they are read by males with lower voices and were harder to hear because I was on an Airplane, so I did not listen to them as much.Lucky Day has a very great climax and you will be shocked and amused as the narrator dramtically reveals the last few paragraphs.Trapped is a less known Dean R. Koontz story, however it is a very good one, and is quite believable!I share these treasures with my friends in my car, and long plane trips seem much shorter with this book!

This so called \\"copper top\\" is nothing more than a copper-aluminum alloy called copposyclamatrane. I can't top the copper top? hardly. After the analyses, I put these \\"copper top\\" batteries to the test. What I did was I stuck them in my flashlight expecting a brilliant flashlike-like sheen. What I got was far from. A tiny light that could only be classified as much less than miniscule. I threw the flashlight at my cat in disgust, expecting hilarious results, and I wasn't disapointed! This was the only good thing that came out of the worst purchase decision I've ever made. Thanks for nothing, dura-hell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mundane","review":"Basically, all the songs are nothing more than very, very slow plunking at a piano. There is very little distinction between one song and any other. The songs are unimaginative as well, and sometimes the arrangment of different sounds borders on random. I didn't give it one star because music has to give me a headache to do that. (Some music actually does.) I very highly recommend Yanni. His music is magnificient. Some songs are fast, some are slow, and his orchestra/band contains a wide variety of musical instruments. Of course once someone makes several dozen musical pieces some are going to seem repetitive, but the uniqueness between Yanni's songs are a magnitude greater than that of David Lanz's. I do regret spending money on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LIKE THIS MUSIC !","review":"This is the second David Lanz CD I have purchased. The first was Christafori's Dream. They are both exceptional. The music is soft, relaxing, comforting. It is great background music for romance, reading, meditating, ...etc. Any time I play this for family/friends the first questions are \\"Who is that?\\" and \\"Where did you get it?\\". It is music that can be listened to over and over again without getting bored or tired. I always feel refreshed and peaceful after listening to music like this. Enjoy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best introduction of David Lanz's world of music","review":"I like to hear new age music since a few years ago and the first masterpiece which leads me get into this horizon is the \\"Cristofori's Dream\\" by David Lanz. It lets me know that there's some music which can really dissolve one's heart, make your so comfortable. It's the first cut in a Narada's 10 year collection. Then one day I found this album from the CD store and brought it back to home undoubtedly. As expected, it didn't make me disappointed. And since then I love his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity and expression power put together","review":"This CD was my introduction to David Lanz, and as collection of his previous works, it allowed me to experience the spectrum of Lanz's Music. It's simplicity and expression power proves that you don't need complicated passages to produce a music that touches you so positively that brings you calm and peace instantly as he plays with his heart. For each piece he explains his motivations, thus allowing you to get the picture in his mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD hud was a big problem","review":"After just only 2 weeks of purchasing this cd player as i was taking the cd out, the cd hud snapped right in half. I even had my finger over the hub because that makes it easier to take the cd out. But it still snapped. And it was at limited use. I only listened to it about 4-5 times in those 2 weeks. And it was also frustrating how easily the cover lid scratched. It played well, ok bass although it didnt get very loud. Aside from some of the good things about this cd player, I believe Sony needs to start making better products that last longer without problems. Basically this cd player is the nike shoes of cd players. I dont recommend buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"After telling my wife I was looking for a Walkman type CD player with extra good anti-skip features, she bought this for me for Christmas 2000. The NiCad batteries included never held a charge sufficient to run the player. In mid-January it stopped working and I brought it to a Sony service center. If you receive a Sony product as a gift, get the receipt from the giver. Without it there is no warranty. \\"Those warranty cards don't mean anything to us\\" I heard this from the service center and the 800 number. Two weeks later I received my player in the mail and it still didn't work. Two weeks after that I received the player in operable condition (both times absent the batteries I foolishly left inside). Today, March 28 2001, it stopped working again. This is one very expensive paper weight and is without a doubt the last piece of Sony junk that will come in our house. Run from this product.

I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found Izze.I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling clementine soda. Nothing beats an icy, cold Clementine Izzy on a picnic. The clementine flavor goes well with a nice thick sandwich and a handful of chips, but it is also great just by itself.My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop! I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."},{"rating":"2","title":"XY Survival Guide is Essential Reading for All Youth!","review":"Hello Everyone.

THANK YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Classical Chaos","review":"This novel was a frustrating journey through classical greek literature with three seemingly unrelated plot lines finally converging into an unbelievable climax that left all three plot lines unresolved. Numerous characters, most one-dimensional, appear from no where and disappear again without explanation or resolution. A frustrating read. The author's Hyperion series, while complex, at least was understandable - this novel is just the literary equivalent of showing off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sci-Fi book.","review":"This is a must read book if you like high level and though provoking sci-fi. The pace of the book is a little slow at the beginning. Around 1/2 of it, Ilium becomes a real page turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This is a mindbending read. You think you know what happens, but trust me, you don't have a clue. A truly enjoyable reworking of the Illiad and I can't wait to read what happens in the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stick with it","review":"Ilium is confusing at first with its quantum leaps between different stories, times and places. But give it a chance. Everything comes together with lots of action, adventure and surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing","review":"I have loved Simmons's other work, but this was a boring and pointless slog, at least to me. Various story lines, none of which were emotionally compelling, dragged together to a non-conclusion so that it can be spun out into a series. Some potentially interesting premises, but disappointingly executed, and I resented reading the entire book to find that it is nothing but the setup to a future series."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting concepts, end leaves readers hanging","review":"I do not consider this book to be a page turner but I did find it interesting. Unfortunately it ends on a cliff-hanger that requires the purchase of another book. Reading the reviews for that book evidently it's not very good. This is all very unfair to the reader.This was my first Dan Simmons book and I expect that it will be my last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews for Olympos before you buy this","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but I would not recommend it to anyone. The ending is a cliffhanger, and if you enjoy this book you will feel compelled to read the sequel, Olympos. The sequel is a complete disappointment -- read the reviews and see what people say about it. Although reading Illium was fun (although it dragged in the beginning), the overall experience of the two books was negative. I wish I'd spent my time and money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"so promising, and yet...","review":"The concept of this book was what drew me in, being overly fond of both the Iliad and science fiction. And now, both -- combined! Huzzah! The thing is that I couldn't stand any of the characters. More to the point, I couldn't stand the one and only character, since everyone introduced had the same voice. Imagine, if you will, watching a movie. The 1st character on the screen is one that you do not in any way like. Now imagine that each following character, when they open their mouths, has exactly the same voice -- the same manner of speaking, the same inflections -- as the 1st character, differing in only superficial ways. Not only that, but the voice belongs to a bad actor reading from a bad script. Now, I don't expect brilliance from a mass market pocket book, but I couldn't slog through more than 75 pages of this book with its obnoxiously incomprehensible techno jargon even with a much reduced goal of being mindlessly entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Totally disagree with various previous reviews. I can hardly wait for the sequel - When, Dan?!!!! Could not put the book down. The change from character and scene to another kept me turning pages. And how appropriate to read about Olympus Mons and Mars as we now are presently exploring Mars further. And loved his historical references to the Trojan war and the gods of Olympus. And his characters are all fascinating and complex as well as his scenic descriptions and well thought out and imaginative locations. One of his best. Actually, I think it is even better than Hyperion or Endymion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Engrossing","review":"All those who bemoan the fate of the sci-fi genre can stop. It's not that science fiction is dying, it's just that few authors are good enough to write such a rousing, involving tale as Dan Simmons has done with Ilium. I especially liked the mesmerizing scenes with Hockenberry and the resourceful and all-too-human Trojan women. Believe the hype and grab this novel! I eagerly await the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"none","review":"Sensational in wonder and scope. (Simmons) once again shows that he is one of the true visionaries in the annals of SF."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I hold Dan Simmons completely responsible for the exhaustian I felt the day after I finished reading Ilium. I started reading the book on a Saturday afternoon and couldn't put it down. I read halfway through the night, in as many snatches as I could on Sunday (that is, when the kids and the dogs weren't making demands on me) and then halfway through the night on Sunday-til I finally finished! Like Hyperion, this book is so creative, so unusual and so fast paced that you can't put it down. Hurry up with that sequel Dan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"This book makes no sense.I was delighted by the summary and the first page - I thought someone who really knew the Illiad had written a modern book. I was kind of disappointed on page 2 when that illusion was shattered. Then things got really confusing.I've got a friend who has studied writing and whenever we discuss books she points out something she learned that people can't read a story with more than 6 active characters without getting confused. This has way more than the maximum number of characters.This is actually three parallel stories, which may or may not be co-temporaneous (who knows? I've read it and I'm still not sure what is going on.) Any one of the three plots would be an interesting story, and the individual plots are very well written, but when you have them in parallel it is absolutely confusing!I'm so confused that I'm not even willing to tackle the sequel that may bring everything together and explain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely boring","review":"this long, boring, full of not finished ideas and stories will waste a lot of your time. beware. i bought it after reading the hyperion books. it never comes close! dan simmons, i will never read any of your books again."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazingly original","review":"Hyperion is my favorite science fiction novel of all time, in it we saw how simmons can draw on dozens of threads to weave a masterpiece. Ilium isnt as dazzling a literay achievement as that, however it is totally unique and though it starts slow the last half of the book I couldnt stop turning the pages. There the real conflict begins and the characters start to evolve due to their sudden need to fight to survive. This is a cliffhanger and I cant wait for the conclusion. On one level Ilium is a examination on violence, defensive and offensive, the eternal presence of it in human life and its effect on us. For this Homer's Iliad is a perfect springboard. Ilium also considers the virtues of living a ordinary life versus an extraordinary one(Achilles choice). I'm curious to find out how this relates to violence in the authors eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful meld of the classics with the modern","review":"You don't have to have read (or remember!) your Homer to enjoy this adventure, which combines the classics (especially the Iliad), with some ingenious new story lines based on science fiction. This book is a wonderful meld of literature that is simultaneously thousands of years old, with references to contemporary events (at one point, an evil entity is referred to as a \\"September 11th god\\"), and a plot line that incorporates interplanetary travel and quasi-biological beings (the moravecs--named after a living scientist). Despite these various plot lines, they work together wonderfully well and interweave in a manner that only an author of Simmons's talents could execute (though I suspect Neil Gamain might be able to pull this off, as well). The only drawback to this novel is that it is only 600 pages long and that we have to wait for the second volume to see what happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is genius","review":"This is the first Dan Simmons book that I have ever read. I saw it sitting on the shelf at Borders and decided \\"Sure.\\"I am so gald I picked up this book. Like the others before me I could not put it down.

The book did not disappoint me. The story is gripping and the writting have the Simmons mix of epic drama, high-end Sci-Fi and fantasy.Best book I've read in a long while..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an Easy Read, Often Incoherent","review":"This book lacks coherence and many parts were often unintelligible. Simmons has the bad habit of making up his own words and terminology - this would not be such a problem if he defined them and explained the words when using them. However, he often does not explain the terms until hundreds of pages later, if at all!!(scholic,moravecs, voynix, faxing humans?- i still dont know what these are after reading the novel).He seems to be trying to tell more than one story at a time, and therefore the novel lacks any semblance of a normal progression. I often found myslf mumbling, \\"what the heck is going on?\\" and would look again and again at the story summary on the dust jacket vainly seeking an explanation.I understand that Simmons is considered a top Sci-fi writer- but he would sell lot more copies if he made an effort not to write in such an obtuse style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently Great Sci-Fi","review":"Dan Simmons consistently brings together incredibly diverse and well thought out strands of philosophical and literary thinking with well researched and understood science to create a unique and compelling combination. His science fiction is like nothing else I've ever read, and it is very well written (often not the case in this genre) and very thought provoking (also not always found). In this story very credible sentient \\"machines\\" are inserted into the Iliad, in which the Gods are futuristic nano-enhanced humans. Throughout the book, beautiful discourse on Shakespeare, Proust, and Homer is juxtaposed with conceit, arrogance, and the devastating destruction that can be caused by the misuse of advances in human knowledge. It is a wonderful saga, and there is something here for the linguist, the literature fan, the science buff, and even more for folk like me who like to mix them up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"No more Trojans, please.I am sure I am all Trojan-analogued out with all the various pieces I have read over the last couple of years, and while I really like Simmons and some of his books and stories are among my all-time favorites, I have picked this one up twice and tried to read it, no joy.(Book is actually 0-4 in this house, as the spousal unit has done the same thing).Just one of those things, I suppose, so on to his next book, as this one is too tedious and uninteresting to be finishable.1.5 out of 5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Torah availability","review":"The Mystical Judaism had been the domain of the extremely learned since the beginning (since after Moses died), until 300 years ago the Baal Shem Tov began teaching and making it accessible through understandable parables to the common Jew.

Even the mundanely-dressed schoolgirls are irritating and giggly. The flaw of this film is that it does not appeal to any other age group unlike classic teen comedies such as Mean Girls and Clueless, which can be enjoyed by many.

On top of that, the batteries I ordered (a 4-pack of 9V) had expired 7 months prior to their arrival.The packaging plus the age of the batteries makes this all seem very sketchy.

Other individuals, unfortunately, have received batteries near or past their expiration date as well as less than acceptable packaging. I would do two things:1) Make sure when you are ordering the batteries that you are ordering from amazon itself and not one of the other vendors that may pop up replacing amazon.2) When you receive the batteries make sure you check the expiration date of the batteries and, if you have a volt checker, test the batteries.Overall a good deal on a wide variety of sizes and quantities."},{"rating":"2","title":"My life is brighter now","review":"It seemed that all the battery-run objects we have would run out at about the same time, and we would have to scramble to look for new ones.

It's hard to pick a favorite here since they are all good songs, but if I had to it would be the remix of The Way You Love Me- it is just amazing. Overall, I would highly recommend this cd to anyone, it's definitly worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"ruining good songs","review":"I'm not upset about Faith choosing to make pop music instead of country from now on, but on this album Faith manages to ruin the country songs that made her famous. Songs like \\"Let Me Let Go\\" are re-done and \\"diva-tised\\". But we souldn't blame Faith, why not sell millions of records to buyers who are satisfied with so-so vocals, lyrics, and musical creativity? Bottom line, if you like Faith Hill buy her albums, not this collection, the only good song on the whole album is \\"Somewhere over the Rainbow\\" but you can find better performances by other artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad and more bad","review":"I've heard the album, and I give it 10 thumbs DOWN.

Its a great book about an amazing person..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice :-)","review":"Faith Hill is not only stunning, but has a stunning voice. She is best whilst singing power ballads and there are a few in here for sure. I love the title track There You'll Be and also Breath and You Give Me Love. That song is upbeat and so good. There are a lot of familiar songs on here (This Kiss etc) but she has opened my eyes a little to country music. I'm still not a big fan of it, but she does those songs justice. I would love to see her live in concert, but for now, this cd has all her good songs covered. There is a bit of something for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good Enough","review":"I write this knowing how much I love to hear Faith Hill sing , and knowing how much of her Music that I own , and have listened to over theyears , this supposed to be Greatest Hits Ablum that leaves out some of her Hits ,adds these New Songs does away with what the Album is Called , and suppose to be , \\"The Best OF Faith Hill\\" , I DON'T THINK SO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertisement","review":"These are not Aimco rotor is an off brand.

Best romance book I have read this year","review":"This is a must read for romance readers. Slightly different than the usual romances you get. A well written story about two people who have lost almost everything in their lives who find each other. A moving account of the lives of the Irish during that terrible part of their history with the famine and the treatment of the British. I liked the way the author showed us this using flashbacks through nightmares that Conor would have. The romance and sex scenes were well written and passionate but not over the top. The sex was not the main point in this book. It was about two people coming to terms with their past and starting to trust someone in their future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Well written and heartwarming, Could not put this one down.

I really enjoyed that aspect of this game and how you can progress from an ancient civilization to a modern scientific wonder.Again, I wouldn't say it is a classic. This is one of those games that is quite enjoyable for a while, but in my experience will end up collecting dust from lack of use within a few years when you move on to something else.

Sadly there was no such campaign.... It is also still TOO similar to CTP 1, i mean I expected new units, a whole new things... If it was going to be like this, they should have just made an expansion for the first game and sold it cheaper.

I'm not a long time member of their fan club or been following them \\"before they were somebody\\". That being said, I love this album! Every song is not perfect but I just find it difficult to take out of my CD player. I when I do switch to listen to my IPOD via iTrip, I find myself going to RK on my playlists. The first three songs could all be singles (two are, in fact - \\"It's a Hit\\" and \\"Portions for Foxes\\", the other: \\"Does he love you?\\") and I have no problem listening to them over and over. \\"I Never\\" is also a highlight. A man/me/then jim is kinda slow but really solid. \\"More adventurous\\" is the title track and has some great lyrics. I really am in love with Jenny Lewis' voice and the rest of her isn't so bad either. Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"*tear*","review":"Oh man was i dissapointed. Execution of all things was a pop ladden mmasterpiece with emotion and fun. More Adventurous isnt.

Their previous albums, \\"Execution of all Things\\" and \\"Take-offs and Landings\\" have been lush and beautiful. The over-production makes them sound very ordinary. Another exmaple of a record label taking a good band and wrecking them (see also Less Than Jake, Midtown, Against Me!, )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"I purchased this CD after hearing \\"Rabbit Fur Coat\\" and wanting more by Jenny Lewis. While it is probably an ok pop record, it is nowhere near as good as the aforementioned. The songwriting is not nearly as mature. It really is just another pop record.

I am actually quite fond of this genre of music, if it is done right. This one just does not tip the iceberg, so to speak. It is boring, and the musical content does not sound like it was recorded by professional musicians. On this album, \\"More Adventurous\\" the music is as creative as a W2 form. I absolutly applaude any human being that claims to have an ear for good music that can find the courage and will power to subject their ear drums to such brutal and grotesque defilement. This album is certainly one for the brave."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step UP. Not down. A better execution of an album.","review":"I liked \\"Executions of All Things\\", but I didn't love it. I enjoyed it for the handful of songs that drew me to buy the album, only to be sorely disappointed that the rest of it did not live up to my expectations. I thought the lyrics in its songs were not as good as they could have been. They did not match up to the quality of the songs' arrangement and instrumentation.So, here I am with lowered expectations as \\"More Adventurous\\" is released. And I'm surprised to find on the radio (KCRW) choice cuts off the album. And they all sound great! So, I buy the album. And this time, I'm pleased. Even that guy doesn't sound too much like Elliot Smith this time. (There can be only one Elliot Smith.)The lyrics in \\"More Adventurous\\" seem less clumsy than those in \\"Execution of All Things\\". And there are more songs in this album that leave a more lastingly good impression. I'm left more satisfied of this album. A definite step up. A well-executed effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of an album","review":"Although Rilo Kiley was somewhat overshadowed by Death Cab for Cutie and other similar acts in 2005, they really deserve to be more widely heard, as More Adventurous is one of the year's most refreshing CDs.\\"Portions for Foxes\\" is the clear stand-out hit here, and while no other song approaches it in quality, \\"It's a Hit,\\" \\"Accidental Death\\" and \\"A Man/Me/Then Jim\\" more than justify the purchase of the CD.Although much of More Adventurous is smooth well-tuned modern pop, hints of Jenny Lewis' future more folksy solo project turn up here and there, including in \\"I Never,\\" which is a cowboy hat and a steel guitar away from being a hit country single.A recommended purchase for fans of Death Cab for Cutie, the Postal Service or even Sons and Daughters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype.","review":"Based on the reviews on the DVD jacket, I expected this movie to be edgy, and speak more to the ills of racism of corporate america in the 70s.

The way this movie tackles race and politics would probably get the filmmakers into trouble these days, with political correctness and all that.

It's still funny and innovativebut also tied to the positives and negativesof the Black Power movement of the latesixties and early seventies.Some of its humor is tied to outrageousness and politicallyincorrect language and sight gags. An example of this is a newly Black runfirm assigning someone to dunk bags of cash receivables through a basketball hoop. Another is the use ofthe board chairman's stuttering as a source of humor.This film seems to be lightly edited from the one I saw in the theater in 1969, That versionincluded a longer segment on the Borkman 6."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very slow movie, a very bold statement","review":"When I first saw this an old roommate of mine rented it. He popped it in and instantly I was like, what did you rent dude. About 30 minutes later, I asked him if he thought the movie was going to pick up at all... it didn't. The thing that did pick up was the hilarious commercials and bold statements that Robert Downey Sr. wasn't afraid release. Unfortunately, the movie is grossly misunderstood. In today's age when interracial relationships are common place and we have a black president (well, kind of), the youth of today cannot understand how bold this movie was and cannot see the humor. this movie was brilliant for it's time though."},{"rating":"2","title":"They don't make 'em like this anymore","review":"Raw, funny, and original, Robert Downey's masterpiece just leaves every other attempt at clever comedic film coughing violently in its hip dust.

It gets progressively worse with each viewing! In short; terrible camera work, bad sound, bad acting, bad direction, amateur editing, crass, vulgar, irritating, unfunny, distorted cynical view of life. A waste of Allen Garfield who is the only one who comes away unscathed by this \\"B\\" movie (well add a couple of token hot women to that list).

You should have seen their jaws drop when those episodes came on!I wouldn't recommend this CD for really young children. They just won't get it.

Quest of the Dream Warrior follows the story, written especially for this piece by Mercedes Lackey, so well that visualizing the story is not just easy, it's almost impossible to avoid. Arkenstone places the listener in Kyle, the heroine's, place. The listener experiences the thrill of the ride, the savagery of the villian and the sweet taste of victory. A masterpiece well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, but not flawless","review":"I prefer to listen to this one just for the songs themselves. I'm not really thrilled with the flat cookie cutter journey story that goes along with it even though it was a nice touch. And I really expected less melancholy, more powerful, songs like the ones on his Earth Trybe offshoot album. My two favorites: track one \\"Tallis the messenger\\" has a captivating air of mystery about it and a fast paced crescendo. And \\"Wings of the Shadow\\" has merit. They are the best on the album, though I wish shadows had a longer peak and less of a slow let down. The rest of the songs are still inspiring but not all that exciting. I usually listen to his albums when I am writing or drawing. Overall this one is worth a listen, especially of you are an Arkenstone fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend!","review":"Arkenstone uses percussion and synthesizers to new heights!

With this CD, he has taken off in another direction with his music. Although the lyrics left something to be desired, I think his vocals add to the magic and mystery of his music. The CD starts with an immediate attention-grabbing chord, and it does not release you until the end of the CD. The rhythm is his best to date, with a little experimenting in some of the songs (example: The Voice....not many artists use 9 beats per measure) DEFINITELY buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved Them All Over Again!","review":"Both of these movies were as good this time around as last.

The paper sleeves are also particularly good when mailing CDs and DVD discs because they protect the disc while reducing the cost of postage. It costs less to mail CD and DVD media in paper sleeves than it does to mail the same CDs and DVDs in slim jewel cases. This savings alone should make these sleeves pay for themselves!They are also useful for people who have accumulated so many CDs and DVDs that to store the media even in the slim jewel cases now takes up too much room.Overall, these are good quality paper sleeves at the right price. I highly recommend these CD/DVD paper sleeves for people who want a practical and cost-efficient alternative to jewel cases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thickness, neat, professional, and badly packaged","review":"These sleeves are excellent, unlike some of the others here on Amazon, they're industry-standard thickness and fairly reliable - nothing cheap and flimsy here. However, and most unfortunately, they come wrapped very tightly in a rubber band that ends up leaving a fairly nasty indentation straight through the center of 5-6 on both ends of the bundle, and crimps in the middle-top and middle-bottom of all the rest. There's absolutely no need for that rubber band to be there, and if they really must put a rubber band for some reason, then employing the use of a wider rubber band would have resulted in considerably less crimping. Makes it acceptable for home use, but probably not the impression you want to be giving out if you're using these to mail CDs or DVDs to your customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrinkly plastic window","review":"I've been ordering this same brand of Memorex CD/DVD sleeves for maybe five years. I could deal with the decreasing quality every year. It was always better (thicker paper) than the next major brand or a no-name.This year -- no more.

Viacom's lawyers should look into this because the VH-1 logo is in the bottom right corner of the screen, and there's no way VH-1/Viacom would've ever licensed out shoddy product like this. It's really no better than a pro-shot bootleg - very grainy/fuzzy. The case claims it's in 5.1, but when i put it in 5.1 on my system, i basically got the SAME sound out of every speaker - i highly doubt this is 5.1. Sound is overall decent though, but the terrible picture quality sinks this release. The performance is good, though, but the disc only runs around 42 minutes or so, so this thing is pricey for what you get.

The image quality, I'm sorry to say, is no different than the DVD and looks to be derived from the DVD with marginally increased sharpness. The sound quality is what made me return the disc. The Japanese Dolby Digital 5.1 track sounds AWFUL! Worse than the DVD, which had a great 5.1 mix. Also, it looks as if the only Dolby True-HD tracks on the disc are both English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 2.0! Why would you include an HD 2.0 mix on an HD disc that most definitely has 5.1 audio. I've seen 'Ichi the Killer' theatrically and know all too well that it looks and sounds better than this.

(Ouch!)Every now and then, Miike throws in a bit of absurd humor, like the woman hopping down a hall after one of her ankles has been chopped off.Viewers who are easily shocked shouldn't get anywhere near \\"Ichi the Killer.\\"One report said they handed out barf bags when this screened at the Toronto Film Festival.Those who want to be jolted out of their gourd should drop everything and run to \\"Ichi.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Strangely fascinating.","review":"The first time I saw this movie I saw the edited version.

I would definately recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I love the work of Takashi Miike, he can make any story seem new again with his surrealist style of filmaking. But this was just an overated, incoherent gorefest with the most blatant excuse for mutliple stories and events to come together. Some may say I didn't get it but I don't WANT to get it. Lots of violence that goes nowhere, girls get raped and die in some brutal and sick ways, random scenes that add nothing to the film or plot. Just a whole lot of nothing from a director that has made a few of THE BEST films I have ever seen. The acting is actually done very well from the lead guy Tadanobu Asano and some even better acting from Ichi's right hand man in the film played by Shinya Tsukamoto (who made the excellent films Tetsuo the iron man and Tokyo Fist). But other then the good acting, this falls right on its ass with the rampant violence and gore.Don't believe the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takashi Miike's Quintessential!","review":"This movie turned me onto Takashi Miike and I have been in love ever since!What can I say about Ichi the Killer?

It's quite cooly disgusting in a cartoonish way but after a short while it runs out of steam and drags along from one over-the-top sequence to another.

I don't mind violence in films -- some of my favorite films are the Godfather series, Taxi Driver, GoodFellas, Total Recall, Pulp Fiction, Casino and Kill Bill. However, Ichi the Killer nauseated me. Takashi Miike seems determined to put every sexual fetish, every sick perversion and every violent act imaginable onto film. After seeing this film, I felt unclean and disturbed. And judging from what I've heard about his other work, including Audition, I don't think Miike varies his themes or tempers his bloodlust that much. Like I said, I can take lots of violence in movies, but this is just too much. I hope Takashi Miike gets some serious psychological help -- he desperately needs it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Japanese Bunuel?","review":"Miike is a filmmaker capable of transfiguring your concept of what film can be.

But the execution of the packaging was extremely poor. This was released in 2007 and by the time I got my copy, all the blood had long since dried up leaving behind a rather unattractive looking piece. That's the first issue. The second one has been discussed here before but I will reiterate. Both discs are crammed into the pockets in the cheap vinyl blood pack. So removing them is tedious and it's nearly impossible to remove them without marring them. So with that being said, I do recommend this amazing film to fans of foreign cinema but I would go with the single disc, unrated version. It would be nice to see this two-disc edition released in more conventional packaging so that all may enjoy the extra features and learn more about this great little Japanese film and a solid 4-star film at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"ichi is a killer who has down syndrome","review":"First of all, the picture is not ichi, its some other wacko who actually is kinda cool unlike ichi who is aretarded twenty year old who is manipulated into killing gangsters and prostitutes by some other weirdo.

Once again foreign cinema leads the way in this brilliant comic book manga style epic.

I was actually expecting ICHI to be much worse than it was, but I reckon it is right on the money. So if your keen to see something new and beautiful (style wise, not torture wise:) and are an adult (and maybe even a manga fan) grab it now!

Bad Move. This film is amateurish from the top down. First, it looks like it was shot on a dollar budget with recycled fuji film. The acting (acting?) puts it in a class with \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space.\\" As for the gory effects; a crybaby killer leaves a trail of red paint and pig intestines wherever he goes. Honestly, the whole film is so overdone, it is laughable. By the way, notice that the killer has a three inch blade that pops out of the heel of his shoe. With that blade he slices people in half! This is very effective if you are fighting 2 1/2 inch thick opponents!!! Any wonder this film never gained wide release in this country?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No sizzle here ..............................","review":"There are a couple of good tunes, but a level of inspiration in the playing that could lift them is not there.Artists producing their own work is a situation fraught with danger - there is just not enough perspective on what really works and what doesn't.

The background vocals by Rahni Song are good, but Janice, who is a co-writer with Rahni and Alex, is ultimately the weak link on this track.

Therefore, one would expect that \\"Five Days\\" would be a commendable piece of historical writing. Oh, you would be wrong. It's confusing and dull. How one could make Churchill dull is beyond me, but maybe that is what makes Lukacs great: he can do the unimaginable. As for the confusion, perhaps Lukacs attempted to re-create the fog of war. Regardless, I finished the book and, with regret, felt that I had wasted a couple of hours of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poorly written and rambling hodgepodge","review":"I love war history, and was looking forward to this book, based on the fascinating idea, and some new documents, that Hitler convinced some people in the Churchill cabinet to surrender, and Churchill just barely held them off. It should've been fascinating.Instead, it reads as if a college professor just dictated his notes into a dictaphone. It rambles. It zigz, it zags. At times, it seems almost stream of consciousness. Most of it is a hodge podge regurgitation from prior books and well known facts. The book loses focus quickly.The oral tone (the author constantly says things along the lines of, \\"Well, now I have to dealt with this and would like to go back and say x about y\\") is distracting and symptomatic of someone who didn't spend much time on prose style.What new information there is, is unfocused and spewed out in disorganized fashion.

Lukacs also often expresses forceful opinions without any support (no footnote, no discussion -- just a statement that someone \\"was wrong\\" in his opinions). The result is that the Churchill- Halifax debate is muted by trivia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written, mostly rehashed","review":"I love war history, and was looking forward to this book, based on the fascinating idea, and some new documents, that Hitler convinced some people in the Churchill cabinet to surrender, and Churchill just barely held them off.

It's premise is that the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax was willing to consider a negotiated settlement with Hitler while Churchill thought that even consideration of a settlement would be the beginning of a \\"slippery slope\\" leading to conditional surrender. So far so good, but Lukacs tells the story with no drama and liberally pads it with boilerplate descriptions of the course of the Second World War in the first half of 1940. I suspect he lifted these from his other published works. The book just doesn't have enough original content to be worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read this - it's boring","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. I went in with high expectations: I'd never read Lukacs, but my understanding was that his reputation was good. At a minimum, he's published a lot. Moreover, I liked the idea of an events-oriented narrative confined to a short, narrow time frame. What should have been high drama, however, was almost painful to finish. Plainly put, the book is boring.As for (somewhat) related works: I'm not familiar with Churchill and this period, although I've read a bit of his memoirs and found them pretty good. A recent World War II read that I thought deserved its Pulitzer was Rick Atkinson's An Army at Dawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"The subject of the book 5 days in May 1940 is one of the key swing points in WW2. Lukacs book is boring, difficult to read and lacks sufficient support material to warrant the length of the work. It seems that the author had some facts and then spent the greater part of the book padding them out.There is for me no coherent form to the book as it zig zags from one subject to the next with no continuity in the process.The book could have been better structured and the language simplified to make it a much more readable piece of work which would have appealed to greater audience.The one point that the book was enlightening on the reasons put forward as to why Hitler held his advancing forces in check.One, he was not aware of the disarray in the French and British ranks and second, that a humiliated Britain would prove more formidable.The subject is worthy of an in depth treatment but this book fails to deliver in an interesting or entertaining way and I do believe that books should be both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!","review":"If you are considering this book for A.P Europoean History at M.H.S., don't do it.

I did not get a chance to read it until recently. The book is an interesting read, but does not go into enough detail on some of the more important meetings going on at the time which is why I give it only four stars instead of five.The book details the events of the end of May 1940 when the Germans are overrunning France and the British are trying to extract their army and decide how to procede in the war if France drops out and/or Italy decides to enter on Hitler's side.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the early years of World War II and who wants to see how a democracy decides how it will fight a war it did not want, but must fight in order to protect the values it is based on."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Lukacs is a unique intellect","review":"A fascinating 'microscopic history' of larger-than-life personalities - Hitler and Churchill.

The KAIRI songs are my favorites whenever I listen to them I remember the parts in the game where Sora and Kairi are together, to me, those are like love songs, which are my favorites. Finally the song that made me buy the KINGDOM HEARTS O.S.T., \\"SIMPLE AND CLEAN\\", written by Utada Hikaru, a famous Japanese singer,is my favorite song of the S.T, my favorite love song. It doesnt matter if your not a fan KH, but if you like Orchestra/Instrumental music I recomend you get this, and to all the KINGDOM HEARTS fans, like me, this is a must-have. Long Live KINGDOM HEARTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best!","review":"If u r a hardcore fan this is perfect!

I enjoy instrumental music the best, and this cd has a lot of it. The Vocal song \\"Simple and Clean\\" is great too, as well as the remix. I like the \\"Hikari-Kingdom Orcheastra instrumental version\\" the best.

That's all I can say without totally spoiling. Intense and disturbing but really a pretty good movie. Watched it late New Year's Eve and had it on my mind all day the next day. Good acting and well made. If this is a low budget film you can't tell. Baker is awesome and not like anything you have ever seen him do on TV or other films. If intense and disturbing is your thing you will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Forgotten Simon Baker","review":"Perhaps I shouldnt be reviewing this film. After about 10 minutes, I could tell this movie was just WEIRD. I usually give a movie 30 minutes before I leave or stop watching.This movie was not even worth the 10 minutes. Luckly Simon Baker struck gold with his peformance in \\"The Mentalist\\"for this and the other DUD \\"The Book of Love\\" was enoughto end anybodies career in the industry.This was one of those movies that appeared to be film with no scrip, no direction, just start and Hey, make it up as we go.Sadly, the movie never went anywhere except into weirdsville"},{"rating":"1","title":"Small hints in the dark","review":"The daughter of Jack Bishop (Simon Baker) is kidnapped. The police look for her. The police look up the usual suspects. Jack Bishop and his wife (who is not the mother of the daughter) look for her. They go to a blind psychic woman who gives them some leads. They go home.Many scenes at night time. It is dark. It is hard to follow what is happening. Very small hints are given. Much too small. The viewer is not intended to really understand. Not until the end, the chocking end. Yawn.If you want to make a movie that has a \\"clever twist\\" in the end, but not much of interest before the ending, why not make a short movie for 30 minutes? This one is more than one hour too long.What is worse, the clever twist may be clever in a way, but it makes the story completely implausible. Good acting cannot save bad writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances, but a frustrating plot","review":"Like other reviewers I got this from Amazon to see what Simon Baker can do with a character different from The Mentalist or The Guardian. Wow! Great job! Baker has a truly impressive range as an actor. The plot is pretty dark and compelling, but frustrating. I watched this about 4 times trying to figure out how the didn't-see-it-coming ending could result from what went before. No luck. It can't be done. It is not possible for the characters who did it to pull all the plot strings necessary to make the ending logical. That being said, get this DVD just for the enjoyment of watching Baker make the impossible seem entirely real. It's a great story, well presented, great location details, worth repeated watching. Just don't expect the ending to make sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"all atmosphere and no thrills","review":"\\"Not Forgotten\\" probably won't do much to enhance U.S./Mexico relations. Set in Del Rio, Texas, a town located just north of the border, this thriller stars \\"The Mentalist\\"s Simon Baker as a loan officer whose daughter is kidnapped by a bloodthirsty religious cult that, we're told, has achieved widespread notoreity in Mexico.\\"Not Forgotten\\" - which is strong on atmosphere and milieu and weak on anything even remotely resembling suspense - features all the red herrings, false leads and narrative blind alleys that we've come to expect from such films, with each of the characters harboring some deep dark secret from the past that, when it is finally revealed, turns out to be a surprise only to the other characters in the story. For, indeed, when the most likely suspect turns out to be the actual culprit in the end, you know that the screenplay could probably have used a few more runs through the typewriter before going before the cameras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this one","review":"I really wanted to like this. I'm a big fan of Simon Baker, I think he's a fine actor, but if he keeps making movies like this, his movie career will go into freefall. How he can go from sublime TV like The Mentalist to this, only he knows.A story of a man whose daughter from a previous marriage is kidnapped. He and second wife go out to find her and so ensues dodgy religious stuff and lots of running around in the dark. The movie doesn't know whether it's a horror, thriller or is it just wasting our time. Go for the latter. There is zero chemistry between the two leads although you've got Benito Martinez from The Shield who is always worth watching.The sound quality on the DVD is atrocious and there are no subtitles."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad","review":"Love Simon baker.

I walked away reading this book feeling as though my time was stolen from me by reading this book. A lack of a clear, consise thought on paper really shows. It seems more emotion was present in the writing then any fact backing up his claims. I know doubt believe Mr. Shubins intent was in the right place, however that doesn't make up for the poor dialogue the book has. My recommendation is DO NOT READ this book or you will feel as if you were robbed of your money and time. I assume since Mr.Shubin has know real theological background and is a lay minister that this book really shows these qualities. Bottom line- Read books by people who have the credentials and who make clear points on their position and biblical backing to stand up to it.

This narrative, in it's lucid and practical treatment of ideas that oftentimes seem protected beneath a veil of academic elitism (ideas such as relativity, particle physics, and the like), is unsurpassed by any such writings in its genre. Many thanks again to Mr. Ferris in his efforts to bring us this book. I would recommend it to anyone who is involved in science to any degree. Whether a student of newly developing scientific curiosity, or a weathered professional, this book promises to open doors to yet unseen cognitive vistas, and blaze trails over yet unknown conceptual wildlands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoever said science has to be boring?","review":"This is Timonthy Ferris' best book, although \\"The Red Limit\\" is quite good, too. In \\"Coming of Age in the Milky Way,\\" however, Ferris had a very simple yet very intriguing thought: To tell the history of scientific thought not by the \\"ideas\\" but by the \\"people.\\" Sure, the ideas are here too, but the heart of this book is the many colorful characters who have contributed to science, from the ancient Greeks to modern times.A fun book to be sure, but be warned: After reading \\"Coming of Age...\\" you will never again drink a glass of beer without thinking of poor old Tycho Brahe."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book","review":"What I really liked about this book is that it is both a history of science, and an explanation of scientific thinking. By following the thread of scientific thought from the beginning until now really makes all the pieces fit together.I occasionally like to read books about real science for the lay person, and many modern theories such as relativity and quantum mechanics are not very intuitive and seem pretty weird. But after reading about the historical context in which those theories were derived, they suddenly make much more sense.

I was on my summer holidays from Ireland and was quite lost. Being an avid Follet reader i snatched it up immediately.Lets call a spade a spade. The book lacks depth, character development or any sign of tension. However, it was an entertaining read for a person who was travelling by train around Europe and was often stuck for english material. by Follets own admission the book didn't turn out the way he had planned. nobody would try to argue that this book is anywhere as good as 'pillars' but at the end of the day it is still a good entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"An early Follett novel only most ardent fans will moderately enjoy","review":"There's not much to say in reviewing the Modigliani Scandal, an early Follett novel published before he hit it big with the World War II thriller \\"Eye of the Needle.\\" In a forward for the version I read, Follett acknowledges that this little story about art dealers, artists and thieves in London doesn't have much depth. Still, it is fun to read and to see traces of the greatness that is to come. There really aren't any main characters, just a bunch of story lines that all merge together in the end. The plot concerns the chase for a rare painting by a famous Italian artist, Modigliani. The plot also follows a Lucian Black as he tries to open his own art gallery. The book is short and easy to read, and if you're a Follett fan, I recommend you read this, but I don't think I'd recommend that you pay money for it. It's just not that good of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Follett has been better","review":"I recently read the Modigiliani Scandal. I think this is the worst Follett I have ever read (and I have read quite a few). There are many weaknesses in the plot- first of all the ease with which art experts can be fooled seems too far fetched. Secondly the lack of a solid central character. Also by the end you get a feeling of being cheated as it seems what you have just finished was not a Follett at all. I do not recommend the book to any Follett lover"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lite and Trite","review":"I love Follett books, but this is his weakest effort. The characters are not well developed and none are endearing. You don't find yourself pulling for or against anyone and I could care less about having a beer with any of the characters.

Many photograhs are used to illustrate the techniques and projects which are more helpful than the usual diagrams used in many books on the subject. Techniques include: bead stringing, netting, peyote, brick, right-angle weave, and herringbone stitches. Although the projects given are simple for the beginner, the author also gives more advanced variations for some of the projects(such as the bracelet shown on the cover).

Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent enough if you use enough tape","review":"This is double-sided tape that's just sticky enough to put very lightweight posters on the wall without adhering so tightly that it damages the wall. It seems to hold up just fine and it hasn't marred any of my walls. The tape is not re-useable though. Once I take it off a poster, which doesn't damage the poster either, the tape usually sticks to itself as it curls up.However, given anything with heft, such as a laminated poster, won't work out. It may seem like it is going to work, but gravity is eventually going to win. That might be fine in the privacy of your room, but it would be very distracting in the middle of a presentation or meeting.I tried this product because I got it free through Amazon Vine. I wouldn't pay for it though."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I like and what I wish I had known","review":"There are things I really like about this product:1. It holds well to a wall, even a textured wall--pretty neat.2. It really is super easy to remove--as easy as a \\"sticky note,\\" which I did not expect.Now the things I wish I had known:1. The manufacturer said the product is for light-weight objects. What you really need to know is that the product label says in small print it holds a maximum of 4 ounces. This means a large poster could conceivably be too heavy!2. The claim of removing easily without mess or damage refers to the wall, not the item you are hanging. So while I was able to remove objects easily from the wall, getting it off the object hung is a little more daunting. So items you want to move or use again could be damaged.3. There is a qualifier to not damaging walls upon removal. The small print said it could damage flat paint.All in all, I like this product, but it is not all I had hoped it would be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Removable yes, gentle no","review":"I found that this poster tapes works well on glossy surface, but on flat painted surface, it can take off some of the paint. And depending upon the heat conditions your item has been in, it can take some paper with it when using paper-paper contact. As long as you realize this possibility and exercise some caution it should be ok, but it is not as \\"removable\\" as a Post-it, since it does need to hold up some more weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Works!","review":"I don't know if removeable and tape should be int he same sentence. My kids changed pictures on their walls daily so I'm always looking for a product that go stick on the wall and comes off easy. I use the tape to hang my kids posters, papers, butcher paper, lettering, pictures, just about anything that is fairly light-weight to walls, white boards, file cabinets, anything that has a smooth surface. It is works wonderfully on MOST surfaces. It is also easy to remove by just rolling it off. It however doesn't seem to work so well on glass windows when the temperature constantly change. Somehow, the temperature of the surface does affect its sticking ability. Also, if the item is heavier than what the tape can hold it won't stay put. Heavier posters....forget it. Wish there was a tape for heavier posters. Other then that...great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well!","review":"This stuff does pretty much as it advertises, which is a nice thing for once. Tried it on a calendar in my kitchen. Been a few weeks and so far so good. I used 8\\" pieces on 3 sides because it is a pretty heavy calender. It's stuck on semi-gloss paint and is doing fine.Just for the heck of it I tried sticking a piece of copy paper to a wall that is painted with flat paint. It is holding but it is also a relatively small piece of paper. I don't think it would work with my calender.It's not super cheap, but you do get 150 inches which is enough to mount a lot of posters and stuff.

It's Italy, it's easy you say? Except, Fraser is holding down a full-time job, knows little about viticulture, the area he bought his land in is known for terrible wine, it's too high, and the Italian regulations are too thick. That's what makes this story a wine adventure!I was inspired by Fraser's perseverance in learning through books and meeting with anyone who would talk with him. He educated himself as he proceeded to establish his vineyard and then his winery. The story is filled with wonderful cultural stories that bring texture to the Italian people.For those with a secret, or not so secret, desire to get away from it all and grow grapes and produce fine wine, this book is for you.Salute!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy A Bottle Of Cheap Wine Instead","review":"Buy a bottle of cheap wine instead of wasting money on this awful offering. I've never heard of TGG Direct and I now see why. This trio of old school Black films looks like they all came from videotapes. Honestly, I only glanced at Brotherhood Of Death and Children Of The Night. I was very upset after seeing the horrible transfer of Candy Tangerine Man (the reason I bought this rip-off) which looks worse than a Ebay copy I purchased years ago. I was hoping I would finally get to see a remastered print of one of my favorite trashy Blaxsploitation films. This looks like it was copied off my copy. TGG may be short for Tommy Gordon's Grimy VHS Collection. Please, just stay away from this Urban CON-nection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album","review":"This is a very good album, as my rating would suggest. Community's music is less a solid state affair than an exercise in open-mindedness. The four duets where the loving couple sing together, Police State, Unity, Know who you are and Healing have a funky backbeat and a foreground that allows various styles to come and go as they please. This is quite an interesting approach and I like it. The gentleman singer sings 'Heaven', a grungy rocker and '27 years' a tribute to Nelson Mandella. The songs the lady singer sings on her own are a bit too emotional for my tastes, but a lot of people like that way. Understanding and Mother are really funky, while the other songs she sings are torch ballads. Their lyrics are positiv and forward thinking and their melodies are original. I hope my review gives you an idea of what the album sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence overview of the Federalists and the military","review":"A must-have to understand the origins of the American military.

Some of them are reviews of the Cryan' Shames' first album, which this CD is not. This CD is a compilation of most of their hits and best songs. I really like this CD, but, I can't give it 5 stars because of one glaring error in this compilation. Included in this compilation is an 'unreleased single version' of \\" Mr. Unreliable\\". The problem with this is that \\"Mr. Unreliable\\" WAS released as a single and was a Top Ten hit on WLS. The version here is not that recording, nor is it the slower album version. If that single hit had been included, this CD would have earned 5 stars. Since it isn't, no matter how good the sound is here, I can only giive it 4 stars.

Green returns to the rich, vibrant universe he created for the Deathstalker series. In this book, the seventh book in the series, Green leaves behind the characters which he worked very hard to create for the first six books to focus on their successors. If you enjoy space operas, this is one of the finest. Complex charater motivation is played out across a galaxy Green has populated with science fiction horrors and wonders. While there are many factions and characters, this book (and series) never becomes difficult to follow. Mind-candy at its most delicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the???","review":"Simon Green's Deathstalker series was one of the best I have ever read, untill this book came out. Plots that took several hundred pages to set up were resolved in the blink of an eye. It seemed like that Green set out to finish the series on a long weekend. What a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unfortunate conclusion","review":"I have read the entire series... and while I have been used the occasional bad bit of writing and plot tie ups in the series ( usually only in sections of a book ) I was very saddened to see that almost the entire book was cliched and ( I really hate to say this ) badly written. Dialogue between characters was weak almost as if I was reading a rough draft. And it appeared that the writer was just trying to finish the book with as few loose ends as possible.I almost really hope that Mr. Green did not write this book but someone else finished it for him, it would explain many of the amauterish mistakes I would catch.Simon R. Green's books are among my many favorite's. I still reread the first Deathstalker book and Blue Moon Rising. The Hawk and Fisher series is excellent light reading. I am just sad to see such a conclusion to a story that swept me up in its mythos and took me along for a ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book just plain reeked.","review":"I am sorry I bought it. This book was horrible, from beginning to end. It was nothing more then a rehash of the first books and provided nothing original at all. I am embarrassed to even claim to have read it. I hope Mr. Green, who has written some very fine pieces of science fiction, goes back to the drawing board and figures out what to do with his career. If no one will buy any of his books unless the word, \\"Deathstalker\\" is in the title, then I feel for him, because he is a much better author then he let on in this book or the two that proceeded it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thoughtful, provocative commentary on the modern family","review":"In this book, Rob Evans focuses clearly on troubles in families which interfere with childrens' readiness for school and learning. The book is filled with thoughtful reflections on how families have changed, with special attention to the many ways in which parents' energies have been drawn away from home and family. The book is thoroughly researched, extremely articulate, and a very entertaining read. Evans does not shy away from provocative assertions to support his diagnosis. He is a compassionate advocate for children and their families, and while he respectfully declines from offering simple solutions to complex dilemmas, parents will find much to use here, and educators at all levels will look at their challenges in a new light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schools and Parenting","review":"In Family Matters Rob Evans offers an insightful, respectful perspective of childrearing today and the resulting challenges faced by schools.

However it's all harmless as the girl, Lizzie, actually wholeheartedly believes in fairies and the power of their magic so she and Tink become fast friends. Meanwhile, Tink's friends fearing the worst, set out on a daring rescue to bring her back to Pixie Hollow. The story nicely ends up bridging Tink's world before Peter Pan, as the idea of fairy dust,humans flying, and the mantra, \\"I do believe in fairies\\" are all introduced. The only mildly intense moments for younger viewers come from Lizzie's nasty cat who threatens the fairies, but ultimately gets it's due.

The biggest surprise was the fact that while Vidia's character shows some growth (coping to getting Tinkerbell stuck in the toy house)while Tinkerbell's character seems the same brash character from the previous films.

In fact, you can get through it about an hour.The only interesting part was the introduction, which gave a brief biographical account of George Low.

The characters did not hold my interest and the plot was uninteresting and felt a bit contrived. Sorry, but I expected so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"I live in Bucks County. I have read this book. It seems the author has foucus on his point: to tell ghost stories. However, he seems to focus on UPPER BUCKS COUNTY. I have found no LOCAL stories that I can relate to. Also, the book focuses on Bed and Breakfasts Inns, rather than ANY place. If you love a good creep, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"The book Books County Ghost stories, is just poorly written.

My cats couldn't fit in it, and although it was quite expensive, I didn't want to return it since I paid $20 postage to receive it and didn't want to pay even more postage to return it. So I gave it to a friend and it looks like one of his 2 cats who is pretty small may be able to fit in it. I found another larger nicer one for a lower price and so got that for my cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly packaged","review":"The product would have been fine but I received the compressor upside down.

This book is mildly clever in places but one is left wondering what really is the 'takeaway'. Yes we all know that the right person is needed in the right job but how profound is that as a business lesson. Even \\"Who moved my cheese?\\" had more to offer than this somewhat trite attempt at a business parable. Give me books like \\"The obsessions of an Extraordinary Executive\\" and \\"Death by Meeting\\" any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run for your life!","review":"How excruciating.

This book was a total miss. The humor was painful, and the management lessons were forced onto a weak story.I read the reviews of this book, and thought - it can't be that bad - but, they were right - this was pretty weak. I do not give out many 1 star reviews, but this book actually deserves it. If anything this book is mildly entertaining, but could have been half as long. Better luck next time....JVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Try So Hard","review":"The overall premise of this book is that much of management has to do with common sense, and that one should avoid being duped by the management fad of the day. The overarching message is that we should emphasize people's strengths by putting them in positions where they can utilize them best. Makes sense, right?Unfortunately, this fable tries so very hard to be funny that it detracts from the simple message. In fact, the premise becomes so exaggerated in order to set up the animal puns and humor that its validity is actually called into question. Post parable, a small dose of balance is finally restored.Nick McCormick - Author, Lead Well and Prosper: 15 Successful Strategies for Becoming a Good Manager"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk!!!","review":"Out of the box, I never expected this grinder to have a 1/2\\" of wobble on the wheels.

I immediately unplugged and arranged for return. Will get something different now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pleased & Disapointed","review":"The Jet 8 inch grinder is a powerful, nicely substantive machine with one significant design flaw and a disappointing quality problem.The Design Flaw and my major complaint involves the really crappy aluminum work rests. Since most grinding work in the real world involves steel, aluminum in constant contact with much harder material simply wears away at a rate that soon renders the work rest usable. Even stamped steel would make a better work rest. I have fabricated steel work rests that will last as long as this otherwise well made grinder.My quality disappointment involves the grinding wheels which are so mall formed that the wobble makes immediate use impossible. While the wheels were concentric, the side wobble was out by 3/8 inch. Side dressing that much diminishes the useful width of the wheel and structural integrity substantially.My conclusion: Buying a new machine should not require fabricating serviceable work rests to make the tool truly useable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The jet 8\\" bench grinder is great right out of the box","review":"It is the smoothest grinder I have run right out of the box no truing of the wheels or anything I like that the rests are heavy and not the cheep stamped metal you get on a lot of grinders. For the money I think this is a great grinder unless you don't mind spending $400-500 on a Baldor grinder. The motor is strong and doesn't bog down if you are pressing hard when grinding like some cheaper grinders I have used.

Since I have both though I won't even bother entertaining the thought.I enjoy music from all over the charts and have quite a selection going.American Folk Anthology is my favourite piece/s of music I have ever heard or bought, while Roots N Blues Retro may just be second.

I use the book for personal reading and to give a sense of history and develppment to other courses. His book is especially notable for considering a wide variety of psychological ideas, and its consideration of the interaction of cultures, societies, and psychology. the only reason I give it four stars is because it's not quite as exciting as a novel and I want to see certain sections expanded - (eg. the intellectual-cultural roots of founding psychologists in Germany and Vienna) - but the bibliographies are especially meaty for a textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money","review":"If you want a heavily opinionated angle on history written by a sexist bigot who decided to pick and choose what to include and what not to...this is your book. The topics are very dear to me, but the author's take on each topic was disheartening and at times infuriating. He has an extremely whig (and ethnocentric) view of history. I am used to ethnocentrism mostly in books written by white men, but what is bothersome is when he completely excludes or barely mentions issues of a period...for example he barely mentions how Black Plague, even though he talks about the contemporary period. He talks about how \\"Islam and China\\"(yes apparently they are equivalent) did not let philosophy and science flourish but Europe did(completely ignoring the influence of the Catholic Church at the time). Instead of just presenting the philosophies that have influenced the shaping of psychology, he never fails to impose his own opinion about each philosophy...so on and so forth...Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"low quality","review":"the seller said the book is in an acceptable condition, but when I got the book, the condition is really bad!I have to buy another one for my class!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeremy Glick; A True Judoka, Always a Mench","review":"This is a must read for all judo players.

If you love the outdoors, you owe it to yourself to give it a read. I finished it a couple of weeks ago, and many of its stories still play through my mind. I guess the word for that is \\"haunting\\". Dave's narration is eloquent yet accessible, and the stories are a wonderfully candid peek into his life and the lessons he has learned in the far north. The story of Esker the wolf is particularly moving, but even the more mundane stories transport you to that far off world of ice, solitude, and caribou.

I admit that isn't much time, but if the story doesn't grab me after that long into it, I can't see wasting any more time. The characters were \\"blah\\" - not much to like even in Miriam to keep me interested in her. And, when Paul's parents find out that he has died and fly out to her house, they don't seem to concole her at all or even be emotionally connected to her in any way - they just seem to tolerate her and the reason for this is never explained...I couldn't give the book more time to reveal it to me.

It is a groundbreaking, good piece of work trying to integrate two traditionally opposing views: psychotherapy and neuroscience. The book is clearly written - mostly. There is also, as Cozolino himself points out, some speculations entangled with the research references. I would personally have wished that Cozolino would use more space to discuss more of the conflicting results in the neuroscientific field. Some places I was stuck with the feeling that this book presented the crosspoints of these fields to simple. However; this does not take ANY credit from Cozolino in writing a solid piece about an extremely important subject, a subject that will be more and more important in the coming years - hand in hand with the neusro-research."},{"rating":"2","title":"How It Works","review":"The author explains how what we think programs our brain and how learning to think differently changes our brain: he explains the psyiology that underlies psychotherapy.

It seems that the previous owner had a lot of comments to note in the book as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I struggled with this book, but that might be down to my style. Books written from the \\"I\\" point of view often leave me cold, as the ego of the author somehow intrudes upon, and diminishes the value of, the content. There was some useful stuff in here but I could have condensed it by about 80%. Sentences like \\"If you answered 'Sometimes' to many of the questions, then obviously you are a sometimes listener.\\" are so trite as to be almost worthless. And throughout the book there are claims about the efficacy of the content that just somehow seemed to create a tone of superiority. I tried to like it. I am very keen to improve my listening skills, both in my profession and in my home life. But what I got from this book was a poor return on the time and money I invested in it. Sorry. Books that resonate with me I tend to keep and go back to them, whether frequently or otherwise. They get well-thumbed. Not this one. Would someone like to buy my copy?

No reader should ever have to force themselves to finish a book by an author that they usually enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I believe Ms.Krentz has forgotten the meaning of the word variety.

Contrary to most authors, Jayne's best work (in all her three pseudonyms) was her earlier work. My favourites are her Trilogy as Jayne Castle, Hidden Talents, Perfect Partners, and a few others. The main characters in all her books are basically the same, but now I'm affraid that the novelty has worn off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance? A believable story?

I hope her next book, which I will wait until it comes out in paperback, lives up to her usual standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old, same old","review":"What a disappointment. Krentz just seems to be recycling bits and pieces of her old books. It's the same hardbitten businessman, yuppie cuisine, New Age nonsense, etc. The characters are simply flat; more \\"Krentz caricatures\\" than people. Worse, there isn't a flicker of genuine emotion in the whole darned thing. Save your money.

Having read her for years (and still enjoying her Amanda Quick historical novels), I am disappointed in her mystical and New Age story lines. She is such a good writer that it is a waste of her talents to issue yet another book on the New Age nonsense! I miss her earlier style of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't read it twice, though","review":"The first JAK book I read was 'Trust Me', and I must say I was greatly entertained by the witty dialogue, the fun, the humor. I was totally immersed in the world created by the book itself, like watching a movie.So, it was with great expectations that I picked up \\"Eye of the Beholder\\". While it is not really a great disappointment, I find myself skipping pages. The story did not really give a lasting impression. It's ... okaaay, I guess. Not bad. But not that good either.The dialogues are not as colorful as in \\"Trust Me\\", and the characters a rather 'flat' and 'dull'. The only real character I like is Harriet McClelland, the art forger, and to think she only appears at the end of the whole story.I wouldn't read it twice, and I'm glad I only borrowed it from a friend, because I think it's not really worth buying.Well, I'm not giving up on JAK yet. I still have a lot of her books to devour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not one of Jayne's best.","review":"Where oh where is the Jayne Krentz of the early books - Family Man and Perfect Partners? The last books have been a disappointment to me. If it's a comtemporary book it is New Age and crystals and if it's an historical Amanda Quick it is a map. Enough already. I have saved every one of her books but this last one is going to the second hand store as fast as possible to get something out of it. I get the sense this book was written for a deadline and her heart was not really in it. I've not given up on JK but I hope I have the discipline to wait until the next book comes out in paperback at least. Enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring... Dull... I couldn't even finish it.","review":"I usually love Jayne Ann Krentz. Some favorites are GRAND PASSION... SHARP EDGES... ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY... TRUST ME. These novels sparkled with sassy dialogue, unique secondary characters such as Macbeth in TRUST ME, and perfectly wonderful protagonists. EYE OF THE BEHOLDER didn't even come close. There was no wit, the secondary characters were tired New Agey rehashes, and the protagonists were dull and lifeless.What exactly did Alexis do in the course of the story that made her such a \\"wild woman\\"? So she entered into a relationship with the dullest man Krentz has ever tried to pass off as a hero. So what? Women do that every day. What's so wild about making love under a fountain? Just sounds dumb to me.Even the Art Deco backdrop was dull. Try again, Ms. Krentz. I'm sure you'll do better next time. I doubt you could do much worse than EYE OF THE BEHOLDER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dullsville...","review":"I have read quite a few of JAK's books and have liked them. Don't waste your time on this loser.Character development was weak, and there was way, way too much scenic description. I felt that she had nothing to say, so she just kept on about the scenery, the art works, the bracelets everyone wore. Snore.....Really had to struggle my way thru this one even to finish it. Better luck next time Jayne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Krentz's Best Effort","review":"I really hate to say this since I LOVE Jayne Ann Krentz's books, but I didn't care for this book very much. Lately her books, while still somewhat enjoyable, have been rather flat and predictable, sort of \\"if you've read one, you've read them all.\\" Now, I love the New Age influences and the quirky characters in her books, but I'd like a fresh twist on the old theme. And I definitely think that twist is missing here.My recommendations to those contemplating the purchase of this book are:If you haven't read her other novels, buy one of those instead. They really are better books and well-worth your time.If you have read all her other novels, buy this one too but wait for the paperback. Better yet, check it out at your local library. And, if you have other books in a pile waiting to be read, don't bother with this one.Sorry, Ms. Krentz. I am looking forward to your next effort, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to dream on!","review":"Find an older Krentz, Castle, Quick, or other of Jayne Ann's pseudonyms on vacation. Anyone can have an off day, unfortunately, this was one for Jayne Ann Krentz.Normally one of my favorite authors, which ever century or planet she chooses to expose, this effort lacked the humor and the spark.

She had the very strong male lead, strong female counter-part who may be antagnostic towards one another, but have great physical chemistry; a crisis which can involve either of their respective families, work/careers or both; and a mystery that must be solved. In the Eye of the Beholder, all the ingredients are there, but JAK missed the mark. I haven't given up on her work yet and will be willing to give her next book a try. Her old books which I have been collecting through Amazon.auctions rarely disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running out of steam","review":"This is pretty awful. Like beating a dead horse.

From Neural networks to Evolutionary algorithms, each of the books chapters cover a different aspect of nature inspired artificial intelligence, and real world applications each approach could be, or is used for.

Even when authenticated and connected with good signal cannot reach the LAN, cannot ping anything.The tech support is dysfunctional: on hold repeatedly, never getting a resolution.

There is nothing \\"business class\\" about this AP (that's how it's being advertised and priced).It will perform acceptably in a \\"clean\\" wireless environment. However, it has extremely poor performance even if a single additional AP is present. A \\"business class\\" AP that doesn't consider a building with multiple offices/floors, and subsequently the possibility of multiple APs, makes this unsuitable for any serious business use whatsoever. If it was designed to deal with such an environment, it's extremely poor design.You will obtain the same performance from a $50 home use AP. Don't spend your money on this.BTW, the \\"auto-cell\\" feature is non-existent. It's not even mentioned in the newer version of this AP (v2). So the last comment about firmware upgrade is inaccurate.

He gives an overview in the beginning of each chapter and then he gives a summary at the end. This feature helps to summarize the material into understandable groupings. There are exercises at the end of most of the chapters allowing you to use the skills you attained by reading the previous chapter. Virkler gives an objective overview of this topic by presenting various views and then referring you to books from both sides that will further your study of the more specific topics. (i.e. dispensational & covenential theories.) If you are looking for a balanced and objective introduction to hermeneutics, this IS the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and useful","review":"Verkler's goal in this work was essential to provide christian laety with a volume on Biblical interpretation that was useful for not only understanding but implemeting the text of scripture. I feel that he has met his goal. Verkler addresses the issues that are typically involved in hermeneutics; history of Biblical interpretation, lexical/syntactical elements, theological models, etc. But he makes it clear that application of scripture is ultimately the purpose of hermeneutics and ultimately his goal in this work. This is a very easy to understand, basic treatment of hermeneutics that will aid in further study. I would recommend this work to anyone who does not wish to, in the words of Matt Damon in 'Good Will Hunting', \\"...drop a hundred fifty grand on an education you could've gotten in buck fifty in late fees at the local library\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"To Each His Own Hermeneutics\\"","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book. In a very \\"round about\\" way Virkler tells his readers that the Bible is to be interpreted personally, that is, no interpretation is wrong, and no interpretation is right, i.e., \\"to each his own.\\" This type of new hermeneutic, though on the increase, decreases the authoritative nature of God's Word."},{"rating":"2","title":"very well done","review":"Difficult material presented in a precise, well-formatted way.

A United States historian, he tries to use his understanding of 1968 in Berkeley, CA to understand the rest of the world, and the American lens does not always display clearly. He's obviously enamored of Charles de Gaulle, to a point where it's almost embarrassing, and his treatment of Mao's China leaves a lot to be desired. That being said, Power and Protest has some good moments, particularly when Suri discusses Germany (although this part is far too brief and could have been much better had de Gaulle gotten fewer accolades). Still, overall, it's just not that great, and his thesis is if anything disproven."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Frighteningly Superficial Book.","review":"This book at first wins you over for its apparent ambition.Then you realize that the cost of this ambitiously wide focus is its incredbily spotty and poorly substantiated generalizations.Its comments on the 1960s and in particular Vietnam policy are made with all the subtly and insight of Operation Rolling Thunder. More importatnly they very very often just plain wrong. I found myself shaking my head and reattatching my jaw several times while reading these sections.The international comarisons are meant to seem oxymoronic and countercyclically brillient. Then you step back and realize that these generalizations are so basic and vague as to seem not even worthy of a single sentence.

Joll's book would be a good read for anyone who thinks that the term anarchy refers merely to chaos or that it is an invention of the youth to scare their parents.

The surfaces should be thoroughly cleaned and as flat as possible to allow the maximum surface area contact. After initial adhesion do not apply too much stress/weight to the tape and allow about 24-48 hours for the adhesive to cure properly before stressing the connection. This means if you have a heavy item you're trying to secure you should probably support it independently until the adhesive cures. I'm currently using this to mount my cell phone holder to a vertical section of my dashboard in my truck. Its pretty damn sturdy, in fact i sometimes rest my laptop on the cell phone stand and it still hasn't come down.

Truely nice engineering, parts fit well, comes apart and goes together easily. I tried it in the den on a floor I just previously cleaned with my Hoover floormate; it brought up a tank full of dirty water. That was impressive but if I didn't return it to Target I would still be working in the kitchen trying to capture the streaks and clean up the crud bulldozed against the floor boards there! How fickle! It is a step above a mop and bucket but it just won't replace my Floormate! And you have to clean before and cleanup after it! I was looking for a machine like my Floormate with steam; this isn't it. For me it's not a steamer, it's not a cleaner, it's not for me.

When it died after nearly 6 years, I researched and decided to try this one. I was skeptical that such a small, lightweight, cheap machine could actually clean well and unfortunately I was right. It was so horrible, I wasn't sure the suction was working properly. I checked the tank and sure enough, both the spray trigger and suction were working properly. There were a few stains on the carpet, one was cat yak and the other chocolate pudding. Despite pre-treating the stains, it did a poor job on the cat yak (my spot bot works SO much better) and barely touched the pudding. It also left my carpets VERY wet even though I was careful to not go over each spot twice with the sprayer and suctioned quite a bit.This might be an ok machine for an elderly person who isn't easily able to use a full size machine and doesn't have much traffic, but with a houseful of animals and kids this was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment !!!","review":"The good: Cute little machine, lightweight, easy maneuvering, good size for a small closet. Not cheap plastic if you assume so just buy looking at its picture or the price. But I still have to return it because....The bad: It does not work at all. Read other 2-3 stars reviews and it is exactly as discribed. I hate to admit what people complained were right and I'll consider the low rating before any purchase after this one.

But you do need to go back and forth to really get the stains out. But no complains here.Cons :- It leaks water after you turn the machine off. Drops of yucky water (after vacuuming up the cat puke) on the clean floor. So more clean-up work for me.- Poor engineering!You cannot really clean the water tank. Though it is easy to remove and empty the water (through a very small gap), there are just too many grooves. The dirt and cat puke gets stuck in all the compartments and just not possible to clean. I've soaked the tank in bleach, tried to shake it vigorously and even tried using a skewer. All I get is dirty water all over me. YUCK!!!- Not sure why they call this a \\"steamer\\". It doesn't steam. Just puts out water and vacuums it up with a brush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bissel 1770","review":"The Bissell 1770 Quicksteamer Lightweight Upright Deep Cleaner Carpet Cleaner is really light.

I am very happy with the results of the machine's cleaning abilities. I am also very surprised at just how much dirt has been in my carpets. For what I paid, and the results, I give it 5 stars. However, I know that deal is far and gone, so I am giving it a more realistic 4 stars.The drawbacks are the width of the cleaning (quite narrow, leading to more paths, which is more time consuming) as well as a small container for your water/chemicals. The manual says to work in 3' x 4' areas, so you can imagine how long it takes to do a large room if you have to keep filling up. My other problem with it is the container that holds your dirty water is difficult to clean out the gunk and hair that collects in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A STEAMER!","review":"Don't let the name fool you - this is not a \\"quick steam\\" anything.

I have done them 3 times & finally got out the swiffer & did it that way.

It is NOT a 'steamer'. The name is deceiving. It's a basic carpet cleaner. The closest it comes to being a steamer is the temperature of water that you put in it.Assembly took, literally, 5 minutes and it's as simple to use as a vacuum. It cleans very well, but I suggest first spot treating any areas that need it. For the price it's a good machine.

I opened with high expectations because I've read Sunshine and Beauty by the same author. This book, however, was sourly disappointing. The first story wasn't that good, but I thought it would get better.It didn't.Like the other two books I've read by McKinley(and like someone mentioned below), it needs more dialogue. There are so many pages that I got bored and stopped paying attention without even realizing it- then I read the page again and the same thing happened.Another thing that irks me about this book is how the people fall in love. They don't know know each other but they someone know that they love each other. What? This is pretty typical of fairy tales, but I was hoping McKinley would be better.So, in the end, it looked like a good book... but wasn't at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"Another young adult book by an author good at fairy tales, but this one is a collection of four fairy tales instead of a stand alone story. The book blurb says that two of the fairy tales are retellings and two are \\"new\\", but I found all of them to feel like retellings of stories I'd already heard. I didn't care for the book, but the kidlet loved it. He just likes McKinley, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS","review":"I first read this book in highschool, I found it absolutely enchanting. Robin McKinley did an excellent job in all the stories, my personal favorite is \\"The Door in the Hedge\\" the retellings also have depth and color but the title story is full of mystery and wonder. It is about mortal kingdom that is next door to a faerie kingdom, and the princesses of the mortal kingdom. It is short but then it is a short story, don't expect a 700 page novel, however the story is complete and facinating and certainly no where near \\"dull\\" or \\"boring.\\"As I said before the other stories in this collection are also great. Almost anyone who enjoys fun and well-written fantasy stories will also enjoy \\"The Door in the Hedge\\" by Robin McKinley, (or any of Patricia C. Wrede's books, whose well-written stories are positively enthralling)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Next up","review":"Not /quite/ as enthralling as \\"A Knot in the Grain\\", the next closest compendium of tales, or \\"Sunshine\\", McKinley's current Masterpiece, \\"The Door in the Hedge\\" is by no means to be overlooked.As always, touched with the author's characteristic Fairy Tale style, but written to immerse any but the most casual of readers, each tale in this book stands well on its own, but taken together makes for quite an interesting read!Filled with interesting, and rather original tales even if two are simply reworked, this book makes a must have addition to any Robin McKinley fan.See also the listing for the paperback version, for more in-depth reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Purchase!","review":"This was a great find for my grandchildren that we have temporary custody of.

Corporal punishment, threats to safety, and parental disapproval are all too common and real themes in the lives of some children. Dressing it up with beautiful illustrations and artful storytelling doesn't take the sting and concern about of the stories themselves.

I also use a C-pap but because of my spinal problems I simply cannot lay on my back for any length of time. This little pillow is a true gem. I love it and would recommend it to anyone.Just one word of caution before you buy it though. It fits around your neck in a clinging fashion so if you turn it stays with you but cushions you face when you are on your side.

It also has some really obnoxious hand-drawn diagrams at the end of each chapter. This book would be perfect if its length were cut to approximately 1-2 % of its current length, or around 12-20 pages.

This book is cheap which is nice. BUT it is NOT HELPFUL. Even for someone with a background in logic this book is worthless, but especially for a beginner.

Swirling with guitars, bass, and drums. One of the bass players is heavily inspired by Peter Hook of New Order and it shows. This is one bassist that's not afraid to be heard. The use of two bass guitars creates a strong rhythmic medium for the intelligent and meaningful lyrics. Ned's borders on not quite pop not quite punk, but all energy. The guitar keeps you jumping around and begging for more. This is Ned's Atomic Dustbin's first major album and they take it to the limit with reckless abandon.

I happen to like the sound of God Fodder even though or maybe because all the songs sound alike. You won't be able to play 'name that tune' with this cd. But like I said its a great sound Buzzy fuzzy guitars and steady pounding drums and most excellent vocals, even if some of the lyrics seem to be no more than words and thoughts strung together. The author of these may disagree but to me most songs have no meaning. The best songs are Kill Your Television Grey Cell Green and What Gives My Son.

A few of the songs on the CD (ex. \\"Kill Your Television\\") were taken from their earlier independent label issue, re-mixed here and blended to match the theme of the CD. The energy of God Fodder is similar to Linkin Park's \\"Hybrid Theory\\" - in fact, if you have never listened to Ned's, I would suggest this CD is like a mix between Nirvana and Linkin Park. Unfortunately, Ned's Atomic Dustbin's later CDs never reach the level of intensity this album does, and have the feeling of overproduction, though they did manage a minor hit with \\"Been Sleeping Around\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now In The Dustbin","review":"God Fodder is another one of those discs that seemed a lot harder and angrier when it came out than it does now. Ned&#65533;s anthemic &#65533;Kill Your Television&#65533; sounds more than a little tired 10 years later.

Both the length of the book and many of his conclusions go beyond what is necessary or prudent. Redundancy is high, so this is a skimmer, for sure. Read the charts, read the bits with italicized headings, and keep your wits about you. His slavish repetitiveness is as engrossing as a Teletubby (Full House! Full House!). With the same message over and over again, it's best to stick to the salient points and move on. Good idea, worth maybe 25-50 pages, not 230.

His points about statistical distributions are obvious as well. While it's fine to bring them up in context (e.g. Mortality rates of a population vs. that of an individual), he shouldn't pretend he's discovered something \\"deep\\" in statistics.

Are humans really arrogant for feeling this specialness? Only if they ignore their relatedness to the rest of life, as he suggests. Fascinatingly, his take on the \\"accidental\\" nature of our evolution undoes the pretensions of both traditional humansists and religious believers, one seeing humankind as the apogee of a wholly material and essentially mechanical existence and the other as the center of God's wholly supernatural creation.

It must have been a slim year. Bruce has made some brilliant albums over the past 30 years, notably Humans (his best), Dancing in the Dragon's Jaws, In the Falling Dark, and Stealing Fire. This CD sounds like it was written while he was asleep--there are any number of songs herein that have the same cring-producing quality of his most embarrassing songs (see, e.g., \\"Making Contact,\\" from The Trouble With Normal). But don't give up on him just yet: BC's last two efforts, Dart to the Heart and Charity of Night are among the finest of his post-Humans period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not making contact, losing steam...","review":"A tired effort from an estimable singer, Burning Light is terribly earnest and earnestly aimed at listeners who can't get enough Jackson Browne. Only about four tracks out of 12 click; those about American Indians and NAFTA (?!) are awful, more lectures than songs, didactic without being a bit as bracing as If I had a Rocket Launcher. Lyrics here are sub-par: the man who wrote lines like \\"gotta kick at the darkness 'til it bleeds daylight\\" gives us clinkers like \\"the so-called white so-called race / digs for itself a pit of disgrace\\" on this album.

It was the instrumentation on \\"Kit Carson\\" that had caught my attention and kept my interest throughout the album.

While always one to present strong material and innovative music, this album may be one, with the aid of some well-deserved promotion, that could draw in more members to his crowd of loyal followers.

The text is full of buts and howevers as the author flies off on tangents from the concept being discussed. The book is obviously designed for an advanced audience but that doesn't excuse the lack of clarity. The tangents would be far better suited to different sections or notes to avoid cluttering up the main concepts covered. Also, the examples are rarely well explained and generally consist of small chunks of code that don't illustrate the entire problem.

They use the same few costumes in every single song. I would say there was little to no planning, just show up in some random costume and run around acting silly. Do yourself a favor and spend a little extra for the Baby Einstein or even Baby Genius videos. Those are a million times better. Even the quality of the songs is extremely bad on this dvd.

The movie appears to be a collection of home videos of a group of kids who had a little too much of extra time on their hands. The children in the video do not even interact with the song playing over the audio; they do not dance to it on rhyme or even sing along with it. During story time, the story is read over the audio, but the 'storyteller' in the movie just moves her lips clearly not actually reading the story.

NOBODY in the video sings along to anything. Not even when the story reader reads the story does she even attempt to follow it with her mouth.

The music is equally dreadful, consisting of incredibly cheesy, karaoke/lounge singer-like versions of old nursery rhymes and songs. This is by far the worst DVD I have ever wasted good money on for our toddler. He stared at it for a few moments, and then ignored it. When we asked him if he would like to watch it again (in spite of how ghastly it was - we wanted to get some use out of it) he told us in no uncertain terms that he did not like it, which was a great relief to be honest. Please don't waste your money.

The songs which are quite rythmic and upbeat should be familiar to most adults and are very appealing to most toddlers. Each song or story is aligned with a letter in the alphabet.

The fact that his wife took this or that picture, for example, just doesn't need to be in the text. Many of the pictures were too small or of too poor a quality to be useful. That said, the author has clearly done his research. The sheer quantity of supporting evidence, much of it rather convincing, more than makes up for the quality of the writing. The author agrees in part with David Rohl's book Pharaohs and Kings, but places the Exodus in the 12th Dynasty of Egypt, which I find more convincing. This is volume 1 of a promised 2-book set."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book needs a reprint!","review":"Ted Stewart's Solving the Exodus Mystery is outstanding other than the small pictures and no index. When Ted's second book comes out many will find he will reference Charles Forster's Sinai Photographed as this was the first book to show the Hebrew writing on the rocks in the Sinai and translates the writing, which in turn gives us the name of the Pharaoh of the Exodus (Amenemhet IV). Ted did an outstanding job putting together all the imformation and pointing out the connections to the dates of each of the Pharaohs' reigns.Ted didn't have the backing to do a the art work of Roth's Pharaohs and Kings or Moller's The Exodus Case, but of the three Ted's is the most important and should be reprinted with more care to photographs and a better editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only there were 10 stars!","review":"This book is magnificent.

It reads like one of the best novels ever written - something you can't wait to finish. There is no one young or old who will not treasure both the day/to/day languaging and the attraction of the moss green cover. The only indication of the cover being attached upside down is the pressure engraving of someone's name in tasteful print facing the wrong way.

I instantly thought the translation was horrible. There are obviously a lot of people who like this version, but I couldn't stand it from the first verse. The Living Bible is an infinitely better paraphrased translation for those looking for a simple and easy to understand version which they can read like a novel. A direct equivalent version (such as the NASB) is a much better choice for those wanting to \\"study\\" the Bible. I recommend reading a little of The Message to see whether you like it or whether you would (like me), chew off your own leg to avoid the torture of reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting new way of reading the Bible","review":"To say the least, this is a very cool and often fun translation of the Bible. To go a step further, I've found it to be a great resource in ministry, especially with teens. The contemporary language adds new dimension to the scriptures and provides a new perspective on things I've read numerous times before. The Message reads like a book and I've sometimes found it frustrating that it doesn't have numbered scriptures for quick reference, but that is a small issue compared to the what the author has accomplished. I highly recommend this book for your bookshelf, especially if you are involved in ministry of any type.

Sometimes, after reading many passages over and over, it helps to have a new perspective. The Message Bible is written in modern day language (english) and is very easy to understand. It makes the Bible all fresh again. After reading several chapters in The Message, I check it out in NAS and usually find that the same thing is said in a different way. I especially love the gospels in The Message. Only problem, start to read just for a few minutes and end up reading for an hour or more. Great work by Mr. Peterson which I believe was definitely inspired by God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not horrible but . . .","review":"I don't like this version. My teenage daughter doesn't like this version. My husband won't read it because the print is too small, but he probably wouldn't mind it too much. Maybe our take on it isn't all that typical because we really don't like paraphrases as a rule, but reading this version seriously irritates me. If you don't readily remember what the Bible really says in this or that passage, it might not affect you that way.It's not that the Message is heretical or anything. It's just way too coloquial and often too shallow for me. It'll be out-of-date within ten years if not sooner. As I said, it's not horrible, but if you want the depth of God's word, which is so incredible and rich and has so many nuances and shades of meaning, and is truly and literally alive, this is *absolutely* not the version for you.

Why all the verbiage? I'm voting for the NRSV."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Bible","review":"This book is not the Bible. It is one man's interpretation of what he thinks it would say if it were written today. The words are so changed from the original, that it simply doesn't contain the same *message.* It is unrecognizable as scripture, because it isn't scripture. This is not God's Word. If you want to know God's plan of salvation, read the King James Version (it's really not that hard), or the NIV or the NASB.

This is most glaring in the Psalms and Proverbs. What should be beautiful and pithy become commonplace. Peterson's methods work well in the pastoral Pauline letters, for the most part, as they are suited to the subject matter of those epistles.

There's a lot happening, and you do encounter a number of interesting characters. But it goes on too long, and the last hundred pages or so turn into a bit of a slog. Also, it relies too much on coincidence, and some characters do things that seem inconsistent with their nature. Adam's wife seems more like a plot device than a real character; she is definitely over the top, and her fate is foreshadowed long before we learn it.Nevertheless, and notwithstanding the noted defects, it holds the reader's interest -- well, it held mine -- most of the way through its 760 pages (in hardback).

I have watched many a High School play conducted with greater craft and better skill than this sad thing. The set might have been a rented room in a badly managed local motel...draped with ponderously boring tapestries and furnished out of the local thrift stores.It is not difficult to imagine this movie playing on an endless loop in the lowest circle of hell.

This musical about the model of the statue of Liberty combines some hoaky, musical conventionals, but also some funny and sentimental numbers. \\"Give Me Your Tired, Your Poor\\" captures the spirit of the Lazarus poem and is inspirational. \\"Let's Take an Old-Fashioned Walk\\" is an old-fashioned number, but easy to sing along with. Eddie Albert isa not the greatest singer, but can carry a tune. Allyn Ann McLerie is the best singer on this album, while Mary McCarty is the conventional good old girl friend who sacrifices herself for the man she loves.

The simple pleasures and homespun concerns of life in rural Oregon are preserved in Claudia Lewis' poetic journal, as she gradually realizes that her pre war world is slipping into the past-- impacting both her town and her family.

The writing is gritty, but for Batman, and this story line, that works.There is an interesting addition to the history of Batman, by way of Martha Wayne's history, and the motivation for the murder of Martha and Thomas Wayne. I won't say more and ruin it. . .The descriptions of Batman/Bruce Wayne and the other characters are dead on and you feel like you know the character. The descriptions of the settings are just as good. The dialouge is also realistic and well done.I'd recommend this story to any ADULT Batman fan, but only if you're in the mood for some serious reading. This is not a light, fast, escapist read.

It was a great idea to put a fictional character like the Batman in a real life situation.

I like Mr.vachss writing style with his emphasis on characterization and mickey spillane-like fighting scenes. I hope he can one day write a sequel.

He seemingly makes no effort to get the charicterizations correct. I wound up wondering if Vachss had ever read a batman comic book, seen a Batman movie, or even caught a re-run of the old TV show; probably he asked a friend who the important charicters were and went running off to write his book before finding out anything about them. He should have invented his own detective and saved us batman fans the agony of the book or that awful comics adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and clich��d","review":"If there's a hero that deserves to be praised, that is Batman. There's a lot that has been said about his persona, alter-ego, symbolism, etc.; that's why, being such a deep and grown up character, it is a shame that he has to stand this simplistic, boring and obvious story. That the story is about child pornography? Yes, it is, but the way it is treated is so absurd that it's almost the Reader's Digest version of the problem. It's not exactly the same, but in Batman's Night Cries (a much much better story) the problem of child molestation is presented in a much more mature and interesting form, and dealt with in a form we suppose Batman would.

Andrew Vachss has completely disregarded that film, and brought back Batman (at least in book form) to the way it should have stayed with: the way \\"The Dark Night\\" series and Tim Burton's two Batman films depicted it. He has even gone one step farther than Burton by giving us Batman/Bruce Wayne a real personality instead of just a showcase for a rubber costume. Andrew gave Bruce a good reason for wearing the suit and fighting crime. He also made him older, more worn out. And for the first time Bruce seriously considers if all the effort he spent over several years, all the training, and all the sacrifices he made have truly made a difference. This perfectly redeems the dark knight. If Warner Bros wants to do a fifth Batman film they should seriously consider a faithful adaptation of this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Andrew Vachss standards","review":"Andrew Vachss is best known for the Burke novel, dark, seedy travels through one man's psyche as he battles personal demons, as well as his prime target, child abuse. Burke does have a great deal in common with Batman; both tangle with their own twisted realities, both are vigilantes who roam the streets, both have lairs that no one may enter, both allow no one to touch them emotionally. But where Vachss invests Burke both with nobility and realism, he fails to do so with Batman. Perhaps its the fact that Batman is more superhero than mortal, more mythic than human. Maybe is the fact that he wears a cape and a rubber suit. Whatever it is, Vachss fails to invest Batman with the emotional nuances of Burke, and the novel itself becomes a tiresome treatise on the horror of child pornography. Not that the subject itself isn't worthy of attention, but Vachss has done it before and since, and all times much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"gotta love it!!!","review":"this book is absolutely awesome. it will grip you into the story and not let go. trust me!!! i was kinda skeptical at first but now i can't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I guess you get what you pay for.

The author finds these generalizations necessary in order to be able to analyze at all. He also likes to point at those who harbor prejudices towards the author's opinions. Instead of insights, I only found attempts to justify the author's conservative opinions, which basically can be summed up as: America is doing (and did) great things and the right things, and this includes the Iraq War, ... I respect different opinions, but only, if they are presented as such and not disguised as incredible insights. Unwilling to see Europe and the US as partners, the author shows a strong need to reaffirm superiority of all that is American compared to all the is European.

I doubt that Zendejas can distinguish herself in this well covered genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the author, disliked the book","review":"I heard this author speak recently, and I liked her speaking style so much I read the book. She was really entertaining, funny, and provocative. After reading this book, I was terribly disappointed in \\"The Tame Cactus\\" because it was such two- dimensional writing. Not at all like what I'd expected. I know that the author recently put out a new book of true stories about her family and childhood. I would give that one a chance,because you could tell from the author that she really was passionate about her family, but I would not recommend \\"Tame Cactus\\". The characters are flat, undeveloped, unbelievable and uninteresting. The events jump too quickly and not enough information is given to evoke an emotional involvement in the reader. I wanted to like this book, but I couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog got worse","review":"My vet told me to use it on my dogs ear and his ear got worse so i have nothing to say about it bad or good.

At first they would fall off, but then they eventually figured it out. Also, in a windy storm my feeder and the bottom hook on the underside of the baffel fell right off. Hook is lost in the snow, had to buy a new one at hardware store. Can not recommend this. Am going to try to coat it wish vaseline or wd40, see if that works.

Easy, swinging, and very tasteful. Ray Kennedy displays an unobtrusive mastery in this repertoire. Really fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD for every fan of jazz piano","review":"Ray's playing is simple in the way that his interpretation appeals to a very broad audience. While Jazz neophytes can appreciate the way that his fingers so easily and nimbly grace the keys so that it just \\"feels\\" good, Jazz afficionados and musicians can appreciate how hard it is to make music sound that easy. Ray's twists and turns on Schwartz's music have a sort of serendipitous quality; they are masterfully subtle but never cease to perk one's ears just as you're beginning to get comfortable. He approaches standards with both reverance and creativity and that makes this a MUST HAVE CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The sander your father used","review":"This sanding block doesn't have all the new bells and whistles. but it is still the best for hand sanding a flat or evenly curved surface. It is easy to hold and put pressure on when sanding. It allows you to use regular sheet sanding paper ripped into fourths (easily done on a sharp edge, just like ripping a regular sheet of paper), so you don't have to waste money on expensive specialty sanding papers that only fit one type of sander. The only downside with the block is that it takes some effort to load replacement sandpaper, but that doesn't have to be done all that frequently, as you can load about four sheets at a time and just rip off the used sheets as they are used up."},{"rating":"2","title":"3M sanding block","review":"Owned one for about 3 decades,gave it to my daughtrer, couldn't find one anywhere until I looked on Amizon.

I'll make one out of wood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells terrible, does the job though.","review":"This is a huge hunk of rubber with \\"mouths\\" on each side and nails for teeth to grip the paper.

My son wanted it as he was in a local play of the same title. It is pretty much like all the Broadway CD's of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Undiscovered classic","review":"This CD is a great reminder of how much the American musical theatre owes to Meredith Wilson, creator of, in my opinion, THE American Musical, that is, The Music Man. A classic. Although this show does not meet the high standard set by The Music Man...it comes awfully close. The songs are tuneful and catchy...and I especially like the title song and Arm in Arm...it's a shame that this is not as popular as it should be. This recording combines everything and leaves an impression on the listener...everything clicks...the performers are wonderful and the songs...again...are very good...however the book, in my opinion is a bit tedious. But other than that...a good show all round."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"Great gift idea for the person who has every thing or who is a lil odd in their tastes!!!!!Got it for my father and he absolutely loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Release in the USA","review":"Mike & the Mechanics, if your reading this please release this album in the USA, I am in the US Navy currently on cruise on the USS Stennis and I purchased this album in Dubai(UAE).

Keep them coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah!","review":"If you own and love the first Mike & the Mechanics album with the same name, you will be disappointed in this one! It's a collection of lame pop songs with very predictable lyrics. \\"When I Get Over You\\", sung by Paul Young, is the only tune that closely resembles something original.I think Mike Rutherford is a very talented songwriter, and I've always respected his work. Unfortunately, Paul Carrack seems to be bringing out a sappy, unimaginative side to his songwriting that I'd not heard until now. If you didn't know you were listening to Mike and the Mechanics, you'd swear it was a Paul Carrack solo project - Paul Young doesn't sing nearly enough on this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty; but uncomfortable!","review":"Very pretty embellishment for the bathroom; however the seat is not very wide - only a couple inches, which makes it quite uncomfortable, even if it's just for a short time.

It is somewhat wider than most books so ensure you have a deep bookshelf. The photographs are of the highest quality and the editorial is well written and researched. This book is not a technical manual, it is a collectors book that portrays the most beautiful examples of the watchmaking tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for beginner collectors and experienced alike","review":"The book gives excellent history on some of the worlds premier watch makers. High quality glossy pictures show some of the most amazing watches in the world. I highly recommend it as a coffee table book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't recommend this book at all.","review":"Glossy pictures, looks more like a picture book, a little bit of history of some companies, absolutely no in depth information, almost no information about movements. I regret that I wasted my money on this 'book'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent example of incompetence","review":"So-called \\"historic reviews\\" is awful. For example - on page 156 we can read: \\"In 1810, King Louis XVII of France appointed Breguet as Watchmaker to the Royal French Navy\\". Did you hear about Napoleon I? Sophie Ann Terrisse (editor of the book) no. For editor information - Louis XVI were executed much earlier 1810 and next Louis XVIII claimed as King in 1814. Louis XVII never was as King in fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Redording","review":"I have the Original Broadway Recording of Candide with Barbara Cook, and I love it, but I needed to get the 1999 Royal National Theatre Cast recording as well. You see I am a singer/actor and I am going to be performing in a community theatre production of Candide and this version is the one that is closest to the score that we are going to use in the show.To be honest after I read the other review of this recording I almost did not get it, but I am glad that I did. Yes there are some added songs and the order is changed around a bit from the original but the performances are first rate.This is a wonderful recording and I would definitely recommend it. I think that anyone who loves musical theatre as a genre will enjoy this recording of Candide. I am very glad that I have this recording as a part of my musical theatre library."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read...","review":"Shows much of the Vietnam conflict from the eyes of a Vietnamese female from ages 5 thru 20, and gives much info. in the culture. Moreover, the author has some interesting commentary on her perspective toward the Viet Cong, the South Vietnamese soldiers, and American soldiers. This book is SO MUCH better than the movie based on this book and its sequel, though the movie is worth (barely) watching.My only complaint is that the cover shown here is the one always shown on Amazon, but when you order the book, you may not get this cover. I have ordered three used copies. The first time, a few years ago, I got the cover shown, but the next two times I got two more covers. Also, the last version I got had smaller print than the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful, Touching, and Informative Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Le Ly Hayslip's account of her Vietnam War experience. Hayslip presents her story in a way that does not invoke sympathy from the reader; the story instead represents a call for action from the reader. Hayslip story is the heroic journey of a Vietnamese girl, and she effectively presents the numerous dimensions of the war in ways that relate to both Americans and Vietnamese Americans. I recommend Hayslip's novel to anyone wishing to learn more about this war and specifically any student of American history or culture. This story has the ability to bridge the gaps opened by the Vietnam War that have yet to be closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heartfelt Book Full of Love, Life, and War.","review":"This has to be the best book that I have read in a very long time. If I had to discribe it to you I would find myself short on words that would do this brillent work justice. If ever you get the chance to read this book please do. It will change the way you feel about the world and make you think about your own life in a new and more appreciated way. Le La is a wounderful writer and I hope that she continues to use her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Brutal","review":"This book was suggested by a college professor. I remember that when I finished it I just sat and cried for the brutality and pain of this young woman's life, and the inhumanity of those around her. Although it gives an honest inside look at the lives of those caught in the middle of the the war, I don't recommend the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"OMIGOD! This is the best book that I have ever read. It is a stirring story about a Vietnameese woman who lived throught the Vietnam War, and moverd to the US. It is a fasinating story of empathy, and culture. It should be madatory reading for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic read","review":"I loved this book. It was a fantastic read, and a wonderful story. It is well written, and very enjoyable. I think it is a powerful story of the real dammage that war inflicts on people, the real pain it causes, and Le Ly Hayslip's journey to fix it. I reccomend it to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gripping saga of human survival and spiritual victory.","review":"I confess that as a Viet Nam War vet, and someone who is recently married to a Vietnamese national from the Mekong Delta, I have a fascination with any account of an experience from that place and time. I immediately became engulfed in Le Ly's story, but what the book has left in me is an astonishment of her great spiritual character. Not only has she forgiven those who committed atrocities against her, but she has matured from her Buddhist roots and the lessons taught to her by her father into a great, compassionate woman. Le Ly tells her story honestly and with the vision of someone who is able to see both the good and evil in those who wronged her. This book gives those of us who served in the war a better understanding of the forces at work in another continuing, on-going chapter in the history of human suffering and tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"You do not understand the Vietnam war...","review":"...unless you've read this book. Hayslip is insightful, honest even about her own tragedies and mistakes, and beyond blaming or hating anyone. One of her desires is to help Vietnam war veterans find peace in their own hearts, and I think her book can help. I cannot believe how good this book is, and I strongly recommend it. I read 20 books this summer, and this was easily the best one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"Wow. I loved this book (even though the emotional story was a bit of a tear jerker). I was heading to Vietnam and wanted to learn a little about the Vietnam (although in Vietnam it is called the American) war.This story gave me a sense of what the people went through, what the country must have been like during those days for people and further reinforced the travisty of wars. I will be sharing my copy with my family to read as I am sure they will all love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you should know and more","review":"Randy goes into depth about some of the pitfalls that bike retailers make. Since this industry has very tight margins this book will help a shop owner maximize their profits and take their shop to the next level. He has pro formas, spreadsheets and detailed info on administering the bike retail shop. He goes into depth on marketing and sales, I estimate I have improved my sales by about 20-25% using some of the techniques and strategies set forth by the author. Shop owners should have their employees read this book too, so they will understand what it takes to be the owner. One improvement I would ask for is to have it updated with a companion web site with some of the tools in the book in e-form for easy downloading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great forgotten musical, deserving of another look","review":"Stritch was always Stritch. And she hasn't ever disappointed me. But singing songs ranging from ballad to patter, she joins Don Ameche in presenting music that was too quickly forgotten. Walter and Jean Kerr, teamed up with famous arranger, Leroy Anderson, to produce a musical with at least eight completely original, vastly amusing, jewels of songs. (Yes, there are a few you should pass over.) I haven't heard good things about the book, which often explains a musical's early demise, but the album makes me wish that I'd been born thirty years earlier! Oh, to have seen this live! And for you Wizard of Oz fans out there, Margaret Hamilton is featured as a \\"Bad Companion\\" singing on one of the shows key numbers. If you know this musical, you're a better person. Let's not \\"Pussyfoot\\": it's a great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grateful to find this on CD","review":"Why doesn't someone bring this musical back to life? I don't know why it didn't make it back then.

But there we are, complete with serial killer! I originally read this book because of its local interest but couldn't put it down because of my interest. The story is fast-paced, absorbing, and chilling. Computer details ring true, as do the descriptions of my small hometown.

I picked it up because I read Quentin Tarantino raving about it, knowing he likes Elmore Leonard I thought I'd give it a whirl. Couldn't finish my whirl.

This was about as thin as it gets. Apparently, this is a part of a series that has to do with food?etc?

I've heard this band compared to Low and Idaho and some of those other slower bands (I won't use that stupid label critics use to lump them together). Calla reminds me more of the slower moments of Girls Against Boys. The GVSB songs \\"Satin Down\\" and \\"Bughouse\\" off of V-Lux are kind of the vibe I get from this band.

In fact, I hardly got through it at all. It seemed to me the book was just written in order to gain new clients (as the writers own their own investment boutique). I definitely would not recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice mix of African artists","review":"This is african reggae. It is not the cutting edge stuff you will find coming out of Kingston alleyways. Instead, it is the kind of make-you-feel-good reggae that you want to listen to when you are on the beach and it is hot outside. It is an excellent introduction to an otherwise lacking gendre in world music. The artists include Lucky Dube, O'Yaba, Baaba Maal, Dr. Victor, et al. All in all, give it a chance if you can find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"[stinks]","review":"I did not quiet like not all african reggae stars were on it so it is just not worth the buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleepy dog various artists","review":"This album gave a great mixture of reggae.

Ann Muscari was a vice president of that nationwide network of facilities when she wrote this, so it is not surprising. But I am surprised that a publisher such as Doubleday would print such a biased book. Actually, it wouldn't matter if the book were promoted as such, but the book purports to be \\"a practical sourcebook\\" that \\"explores every option available.\\" Instead, every sentence is heavily biased against in-home nanny or grandparent care or any other type of home day care, and it uses manipulative reasoning to advocate commercial day-care centers, even to rationalizing away their weaknesses and drawbacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"Excellent production.

I happen to like them both, but this is espionage like it probably really is. A slow political chess game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferable","review":"I admittedly have not read the book that this film is based on and would not think that as a prerequisite. Unfortunately, that is not the case. This insufferably dreary and overlong film presumes one is at least familiar with the story. This fact alone would immediately turn one off and make it signficantly more cumbersome to comprehend the inexplicably disjointed narrative this film presents.As someone who appreciates artistic and dialogue driven films I found this production tediously difficult to absorb. It was a combination of deathly slow pacing, poor direction. weak editing and a lacklustre ending. The production values were not that impressive and looked cobbled together from a Dr. Who set.On the whole I could not give it more than two stars - and that's being kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Karla's Job.","review":"Karla must have had a mole in this DVD's production team, who sabotaged the subtitles. If it was a Chuck Norris or Steven Segal movie, I would have no complaints, but with this spy drama's complex plot and many subtleties of the dialog, subtitles is an absolute must, even for a Brit. Not to include them (and there is no CC, either) is irresponsible as to defy belief. It seems that for the price of this set, one might expect such basic feature as subtitles, but sorry, no luck.Amazon UK sells BBC region 2 release of both, Tinker Taylor and Smiley's People for a fraction of this Acorn Media set's cost. You get the subtitles, and if one wants the sequel too, there will be enough money saved to buy an all region player on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical quality is far below blue ray, but content is excellent.","review":"I agree with others who fault the technical quality of the disk. It is far below usual blue ray, and probably not worth the extra cost compared with DVD. However, shopping around, I found a blue ray disk for a few bucks more than the DVD. That seemed OK. And, to echo the others, this is the best spy movie ever made. Friends of mine who have jazz bands tell me that, in music, the audience can tolerate large amounts of technical in-expertise. But they know immediately when a band's heart is not in the music and just walk away. Same goes, IMHO, for this DVD. Alec Guinness and the entire crew put so much heart into this production that I really don't care about the technical quality of the blue ray. I first saw this on BBC TV in Hong Kong in 1982 on a 19 inch TV sitting in the roof garden of the YMCA. And I would watch it again on VHS if I had to."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for program, 4 for DVD transfer","review":"If the sound had been clearer, item would have received 5 stars - excellent acting/dialogue.

Much more like reading a detective story slowly, slowly unfolding. Of course, when you find out who the mole is after 5 hours of watching, instead of ending, the movie gives vent through the character a diatribe against capitalism.

It is based upon the john LeCarre novel and follows it very closely.But, after reading this one or read the second part of the trilogy, The Honrable Schoolboy, (Not made into a DVD yet). The acting is superb and the plot captivating and one that draws you in to the intriguing dialog. Then for the third in the trilogy watch the DVD, Smileys People.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great production.","review":"I've watched Gary Oldham's portrayal of George Smiley.

It is drama at its most compelling heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie from an excellent book","review":"The book by John le Carre is wonderful.

I will only add one more line or two.It isn't until Ann's final line, indeed the final line of the series, that the other shoe drops. Smiley and his colleagues are indeed living in a world of their own. Smiley's act of cleaning his spectacles, in one shattering moment, turns from an act of \\"clarifying\\" what he sees to one of a desperate attempt to some how, some way being able to see and understand normal human interaction.Ann and Smiley have suffered. There must have been very little warmth received from George Smiley during their marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"There are three of them, and Alleline...\\"","review":"No doubt, maybe the best translation from novel to film ever done--on par with Sherlock Holmes (Jeremy Brett), The Foresyte Saga, and I Claudius. This BBC masterpiece is litered with British super-talent. Imagine matching various characters in literature to their most perfectly suited actors, and then sticking them in a six hour feast-for-the-senses. Combine this with fantastic directing, and the result is a one of a kind dramatic thriller. If you want insight into the realities of cold war espionage, read Carre's novels. If not, better stick with Hollywood's pathetic interpretation."},{"rating":"2","title":"World Class Espionage","review":"This is one of the best made-for-t.v. drama productions ever.

Well worth the effort though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius of Guiness and La Carre","review":"One of the most wildly atmospheric, brilliantly put together spy stories. Alec Guiness, already amongst my favourite actors of all time provides the standard for this very english (as it should be) adaptation.

My only complaint echoes the other 4-star poster. This is a sticker, not a window cling. You can't stick it to the inside of the window/door, but rather on the outside. I only hope it is highyl weather-resistant. But all in all, a good purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the pet home","review":"I purchased 6 of these so I could add one to each window plus my front door. I hadn't thought about it until recently, but it gives a peace of mind to know that if there should be a fire when I am not at home, they know there is a life to rescue inside, and that there is a greater chance my little Princess, whom I love dearly, will be found.The items are exactly like they look. There is enough space to put number of cats or dogs, and if you don't have too many animals, the name of one or two. It's also reflective, so the can easily be seen if a flash light shines on it. It's a small thing to do, but the emotional rewards are so much greater.

What is does provide, however, is a great visual summary of spaceship design in the first 77 years of the 20th century cinema - but this edition has but one picture from Star Wars, which had come out just the month before. But it does give you images of spaceships from 2001, Planet of the Apes, Star Trek, Forbidden Planet, and even really obscure and cult movies like Invasion of the Saucer Men and even Matt Helm movies.

However, I like it much more than the last one. Granted, the last one lasted one week before it ripped at a seam. This one seems much more sturdily constructed. The clasp on the clothes hooks is pretty ingenious. It works great. I did wonder how you get the hooks through the opening, but it opens completely and you can just hang the shoulders of the bag over your garments and close the clasp that way. I can easily fit two suits and shirts in this bag. There is room enough for some more, if I want to push it.I do wish that there was a shoulder strap, but I knew that going into it.

It has all that plus a nice history of the guitar and a treatise of notable rock guitar players. From early blues and jazz through the years when rock guitarists were gods.

Not only does it offer insight to guitar design and players who revolutionized it, it also has sections devoted to playing the guitar and maintainence. If you are a beginner I would really suggest this book. It teaches you how to start off and what to look for in a guitar. As you progress as a guitar player, you will find other \\"guitar primers\\" you can buy will eventually collect dust on your shelf because their scope is limited. However, with the Guitar Handbook, it covers a wide range of topics. When I got this book I had no idea what some of the stuff in it meant.

It's about a deaf social worker named Holly who also does some work for the police reading lips, a talent for which she is particularly gifted. Her child welfare investigations lead to some tense situations, one of which leads her to believe that she may have been cursed and is being followed by a supernatural creature, Raven.The novel is an especially easy read, with incredibly short chapters. But it feels like a first draft, as if it needed to be revisited, perhaps rewritten, to really flesh out the plot.And the ending, frankly, is stupid.I read a lot of Masterton novels, and I know how much I didn't care for this one because I would not recommend it to anyone, and I would never want it to be the first Masterton novel anyone read.

First, the water didn't do anything. I bought a cleaning solution. Second, the 3 minute cycle wasn't long enough to clean out the gunk between my diamond and setting. I ran the cycle 5 times (for a total of 15 minutes). Only then did my jewelry come sparkling clean. Third, you have to change the cleaning solution often ... which makes me wonder if it's really the solution that's doing the cleaning and not the ultrasonic. Fourth, as I was cleaning out the basin, I guess some water seeped inside through the cracks on the side (the outter shell is like 3 pieces of *CHEAP* plastic put together). Well, guess what? It stopped working. I know it's my fault but c'mon, this is ridiculous. Those reviews about the flimsy build ... totally correct. Oh well, it was great while it lasted. I'm off to by the Sharper Image ultrasonic when I'm down in the States."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well... while it worked.","review":"This product worked extremely well -- that is, while it was working. After 3 months it stopped turning on when you pressed the button.That being said, it did a wonderful job cleaning channel set baguette and round stones. It really removed the grime between and left the wedding band and engagement rings sparkling like new. My husband also used to clean his glasses in it, and it also worked well on my water resistant stainless watch with diamond accents. The capacity on this cleaner is a plus.I was truly disappointed that the machine ceased working, but this time around will probably try another product with a higher average rating than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"I bought this item a few years ago and then it just stopped working.

It doesn't do much of anything for silver which really disappointed me because I have lots of silver that is really tarnished. I ran the silver through numerous times with a few drops of detergent, as recommended. It remained tarnished. Gold, on the other hand, looks like it just came from the jewelry store. Not so sure its worth the money. Try another manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good on most items, easier than scrubbing forever!","review":"I read the 1st review of this item, and ordered the cleaner anyway, hoping for better results. Indeed my Haier machine works quite well. BUT...don't expect jewelry and coins to come out sparkling clean, like the pictures and the hype. Instead, think of the machine as a shortcut to a lot of scrubbing with a toothbrush. Earrings gunked up with hairspray were somewhat cleaner after a few cycles; but then after just a short scrub with a soft brush, they were as good as new! Same with diamond rings, etc. The cleaner helped greatly, but did not clean everything immaculately all by itself. The cleaner really gets into the nooks and crannies in watchbands, etc., but again, some follow-up is needed with a brush.In my opinion, it is definately worth it's purchse price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else.","review":"Quit working 2nd time turned on.

I've purchased three of these, and know now it was a poor investment. The first stopped working after 5 months, and thinking it just bad luck, bought two more; one, I gave as a gift and reportedly is still working, but the second stopped working for me after almost a year of regular use. It works well, but you'll take your chances with this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too weak to clean anything","review":"I bought this knowing that there are very few home ultrasonic cleaners that can do the job that manufacturers describe they can do. I was right. This one failed to vibrate any dust or residue off from my dirty KEYS, let alone rings and necklaces. The power is just too weak. I have used an industrial-powered ultrasonic cleaner on anything from watches to rings to eyeglasses, and the effect is amazing! After a couple of items the entire pool of water became muddied. When I used this ultrasonic cleaner on a handful of jewelry, the water remained pristine.My advice is unless you're willing to shell out $500 for a real ultrasonic cleaner, you're better off just going to the jeweler to get your jewelry cleaned."},{"rating":"1","title":"fell apart","review":"First the cover to the on/off buttons fell off. I didn't mind because it still worked (left button = on, right = off). Then the bottom came loose from the rest of it. It still worked, so I still didn't mind. I just held it carefully from the bottom. Finally, the bottom fell all the way off, wires appeared (one of them was severed), and an important looking piece broke off and sprang forth from its innards. Now it's in the trash. .P.S. These things happened during normal and non-traumatic use. All I have done is press buttons on it and take it back and forth from the cabinet.Edited 10/20/06I bought another one of these hoping I'd just had a lemon. Nope. Second unit is in the trash. This time the plastic covering of the screws popped off so I had to hold the top in place while opening and closing it. Then it stopped working altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this item","review":"I purchased this item approximately 7 months ago.

More than I expected for ~$40. But I might have well been soaking things in a glass of water. I've had cleaners before that actually worked. This made noise and nothing more.

Off to Sharper Image for the ~$80 one I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes noise - doesn't clean","review":"My wife had to have this gadget, so I ordered it from Amazon. She used it a couple of times before giving up on it as a lost cause. Now it sits in the bottom of her bathroom vanity cabinet. Interestingly other folks say it works great for softening gunk before they scrubbed the gunk off with a toothbrush. I think this is the result of soaking, not this device's cleaning abilities.

First off, it has a timer that keeps the \\"cleaner\\" on for about three minutes. I quickly learned that three minutes was never getting the job done. So I developed a routine of hitting the button every time I passed for about a half hour each evening. Even this wasn't doing a complete job and I ended up scrubbing them with a toothbrush every few days. Thankfully this \\"cleaner\\" just stopped working one day (bought is in March -- died in October -- 7 month lifespan).

The primary use was to be cleaning knobs and other parts from antique radio equipment. After several cleaning cycles, I still had to clean the knobs manually with a toothbrush. I also tried to use it to clean my razor with similar results. I tried to clean coins with no noticable results. The \\"buzzing\\" sound it makes when running makes me think it is not really running at ultrasonic speeds. It seems to be well made and is an attractive design that is reasonably priced. It did a reasonable job of cleaning my toothbrush. I would reccommend buying a more expensive unit and leaving this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Haier brand!","review":"I bought this item from Jeweler's Supermarket because I wanted to get the Haier HU335W.

Lost in Paradise sounds like Love Bites (also by Def Leppard).As well as the usual similarity to Foreigner, there is again the occasional funky interlude (Time To Burn sounds like early Extreme.)This is an even better album than the first Giant release, full of burning emotional intensity and phenomenal melodic hooks. This is an EPIC album.BUY IT NOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Burned","review":"Unoriginal glamrock outing featuring a multitude of anachronistic guitar riffs--these guys would have been huge had this album come out in 1982, but 1992?

The result is not as wonderful as it was on the first album (where almost 90% of the songs were co-writen by Mark Spiro), but it goes highly recommended.\\"Stay\\" was the promo single for the record (though it had a different version, with more keyboards, and it was shorter in length).\\"Now Until Forever\\" is a killer ballad, where \\"I'll Be There (When It's Over)\\" and \\"Without You\\" come as close as a radio-friendly AOR track could get.Great AOR music, great production...get it now !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered a PT-9500PC; Received a PT-1650","review":"I went on Amazon and found a great deal on a Brother P-touchPT-9500PC labeller, but received a PT-1650 instead.

The main character, Charles, is sure to win your heart over with his innocence and naivety to the real world. He is charming and amazingly unaware of his surroundings because he's so self-absorbed. This high-society brat ends up learning about life the hard way from an unlikely character, Frank, who is Charles' complete opposite, and you can't help but cheer this friendship on. Paul Murray gives such a vivid description of Charles that you can literally see how out of place he is in his surroundings, which in turn will make you crack up trying to visualize it all. This was one of those books that when you finish it, you want to pick it right back up again and start all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizarre, moving, hilarious","review":"Bizarre, moving, hilarious and engaging - I adored the mechanics and perplexing relationships of this novel, which holds a beautifully awkward mirror to the world under scrutiny.

I couldn't wait to turn the pages to learn more of Charles, his family, and today's Ireland examined and revealed through tender humor. However, the book is more than just humor, and this is where it fails. When the book is written as humor, it is most successful. Unfortunately, the author, Murray, shifts from humor to a type of melodrama toward the end that doesn't work as well. Short-listed for the Whitbread Award? Fine and good. The beginning deserves the recognition of such a respected award. However, the disappointment of the ending rates the book a 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"much too long, and not worth it","review":"From the cover, I assumed this would be a light frothy romp through British upper class decadence, like something brittle and brilliant that Waugh or Wodehouse could type out quickly. Instead, it was about an Irish family facing hard economic times. The hero is an alcoholic slacker who is obsessed with actress Gene Tierney, who obviously represents his own mother and sister. There just aren't enough laughs in the early pages, and then the darker stuff takes over: exploited foreign workers, thieves living in squalor, a mailman who steams open everyone's letters, poverty, the heartlessness of international megacorporations.I reached a point where I just didn't care for these characters. I wanted something impressive to happen. I didn't believe a couple of the final plot twists. I kept counting pages; 424 was just too much for me.

The premise of the book intrigued me so I sprung for the $25. Being a fan of Patterson, Grisham, Baldacci, et all, the story here was very light in development and detail. As a father looks for his kidnapped daughter, the first 48 hours of her disappearance are counted down. The premise here is that when someone is missing for over 48 hours that it isn't very likely that they'll be found. After a very short while I found the constant referrals to how much time was left on the clock extremely annoying. In all I figure that 2 of the 48 hours were wasted just talking about how much time was left. I felt the countdown didn't really add any suspense at all in fact. On the good side, the book is a fairly quick read so the pain is somewhat short lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green not at his best.","review":"I'll start by saying I have read every last one of Green's books and have enjoyed them for the msot part. Never to be confused with great literature his books dwell ont he worst scenario possible side of life. This book like the others coudl use more character development and a bit more attention to detail. A carful reader will spot holes in the plot and other mistakes. Having highlighted the authors weakness, I confess that his style is highly entertaining, fast paced, and he comes up with great metaphors and descriptions.This novel starts well, but the plot and tesnison relies to heavily on the suppsoed 48 hour rule. To me the timeclcok did not feel real enough to justify the urgency. Other than that The First 48 would get three stars for the fun easy read it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book wasn't for me.","review":"I had heard a few good things about Tim Greens books, from a few of my friends, and my girlfriend. So I got a copy of this book.The story was well written, but unrealistic. I realised this by the time in the book, you have Jane Redmon driving in Manhattan in her convertible, while on an assignment. I haven't heard of to many reporters that do that in Manhattan. Not that they can't, just that it would be very inconvienant. That is just one example.Otherwise, like I said it was very well written. If you aren't looking for realism, just a fun book to read, then this might be for you. Its just not a book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time & money","review":"The premise was good... the first 48 hours in a kidnapping being the most important to recovering the victim alive. Good man/father brought down by his own mistakes, but willing to do whatever it takes to recover his adult daughter alive. The hint of political intrigue with a corrupt senator (somehow linked to the father's past).

I was mistaken."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The story is improbable and full of holes and inconsistencies. I'm usually good at suspending disbelief but this novel went too far for me. The worst part was the ending. Tim Green wrote himself into a corner. I was interested in seeing how he was going to write himself out of it. Instead, he ignored the difficult parts and gave no explanation. The other ridiculous part was the arbitrary 48 hour deadline. I understand the statistical importance of the first 48 hours but this character acted as though his daughter would be vaporized as soon as 48 hours were up even though he approximated the start of the countdown.There are so many good writers out there (Nelson Demille, Greg Iles, Brian Haig, Harlan Coben, etc.). I can't imagine the ones I've read having an aberration this disappointing, so I doubt that I'll be giving Tim Green a second chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"far-fetched entertainment","review":"This book is a real composite of Tim Green's fiction. It has the fast pace and pretty far-fetched plot of several of his NFL-based thrillers (such as Outlaws), but it also has some of the originality and hook of his more recent legal thrillers (such as The Letter of the Law and The Fifth Angel). The First 48 is not as good as his legal thrillers; it really signals more of a return to the action/suspense stories Green spun in some of his later NFL novels. The style in this book is very short chapters that are episodic, though Green ties them together nicely, that don't really give you much character development. Green starts off strong, as he usually does, but then gets a little carried away with the plot. A couple parts had me saying with a laugh \\"Oh, come on!\\" But it's entertaining, and the conclusion is fitting though short. The First 48 is not Green's best effort, but it's still fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Generic Thriller","review":"Having read and enjoyed a couple of Tim Green's other books, I picked this one up hoping for more of the same.

Green's earlier work, like \\"The Fourth Perimeter\\" is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"If you want to have a solid understanding of numerical computation, this book is definitely the last choice. Many theorems are given without any proof or even intuitions behind them in this book. Even when a proof is provided, it's often far from rigorous. The organization of chapters is the worst I have ever seen, revelant materials are scattered over several different locations rather than put together. Take the SVD for example, it is mentioned in the end of chapter 3, but reappears in chapter 4, which is very confusing. If you are new to this area, please don't read this book. It gives you many many facts without explanations, which I think is not a good way to learn new things. David S. Watkins' Fundamentals of Matrix Computations is a lot better and easier to understand. It also emcompasses many detailed treatments of various theorems. If you have bought Heath's book, don't be sad, at least it can serve as a coaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for advanced mathematics theories.

It has some great comedy and some good fight scenes. The only down side is how weird it is to hear the voice of the person who dubbed over Jackie. All in all, this is a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really embarassing!","review":"I'm sorry, but I really didn't like this movie. I thought Drunken Master, Half a Loaf of Kung Fu and Snake in Eagle's Shadow were all far superior. The comedy in this is so low it makes the Three Stooges look like sophisticated intellectuals. I just cringed through the ridiculous cross-eyed beggar scenes, and Jackie in drag. I actually thought Fearless Hyena 2 was better (or maybe I should say it was less bad), even though I know Lo Wei made it without Chan's input or approval, and using a look-alike in some scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a good Movie.","review":"This was one of the frist Comedy/Martial arts movies ever made and it still is one of the biggest money making movies of all times in the Hong Kong area.

I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have read this book many times.","review":"I picked this book up at a college bookstore in the early 80s and was unable to put it down. I re-read it and gave it to friends, each time searching out a replacement copy because I wanted to re-read it again. I am sad that this book is out of print and hard to obtain. I DID eventually get it on E-Bay (possibly Amazon) and paid much more than the cover price, but I am keeping this copy for my children to read when they are old enough.I love the language of this book. I am an aficionado of slang, and this book is written almost entirely using a very attractive slang voice. I might like the language of this book even more than the harrowing narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not on par with original Tchoupi","review":"This is a lousy movie, and it is a shame. The Tchoupi series are all very innocent and sweet and revolve around small daily events like a new kitten, planting a garden, etc. This movie has a cheap storyline involving a menacing black shadow with yellow slit eyes who steals special toys. It is genuinely frightening. Tchoupi does unrealistic things like drive all over town in his toy car with his friends. Pilou's robot can fly and attack people. There is an awkward dream sequence that looks like Mario Brothers where Tchoupi shoots and is shot and attacked by the scary menace. It's just really bad, and it is too bad. Shame on the producers! (If you buy this, note it is Zone 1/North America, even though it is all in French.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...]","review":"Weird, confusing, and pointless.

It is also very funny, full of Bushisms, limericks, and parody song lyrics that are irresistable.When you are done with your copy, put it in the lunch room at your office, and spread the word."},{"rating":"1","title":"So the hatred extends to ice cream guru's too.","review":"So it's come to this. After reading through this book I realize that the people who write these books are really serious, and that is beginning to scare me because they actually have an influence on people with books like this who are ready to be told what to think without actually thinking for themselves. Once again it's always easy to see how Conservative and Liberal books are written. The Conservative writers try to explain world events and bring out facts. Books like these have cute insults and goofy parodies and half-truths filled with hatred and intolerance, but under the banner of being a concerned citizen. After reading this book I decided to toss my last pint of Phish Food into the trash and switch ice cream companies altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neverending photos (unless you have to format)","review":"On our trip, we packed about 60 photos plus a couple of short videos on each of three Kodak 64MB MultiMedia Cards.

Kodak said the only solution was to format the card. I lost what photos I had on there, but the card worked fine after that. The card is extremely small and easy to lose. It's like carrying around a postage stamp. I can't believe they can get 64MB in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Industrial Goth","review":"I have been a fan of Phoenix/Nebulin since their first CD Distanza.

Appears to have been made without anyone checking to see if it was made right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as picture shown! But nice product nonetheless.","review":"This is a well made product which comfortably holds both my tripod & monopod. The only negative is that the material showed a small snag (catch) early on which I was rather surprised by given that it generally seems strong, and I would prefer the zip to be on the same side as the handle. The way it's designed means the zip always ends up on the ground, thus attracting grass & mud to the teeth. But overall I think it warrants it's four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tripod Bad","review":"Tripod bag is good and holds my Slik 700x tripod comfortably.

I found myself Wowing and Hoo-Hah-ing at times. The effects in places are seamless and almost indistinguishable from reality. The acting is what you would expect for the period, the movie drags and is corny, but there is structure in four parts. It is quite philosophical in places, with some dramatic speeches and nuances. The incredibly innocent beauty of Helen Mack, former child star, at times just stops the action, although her abilities are quite sporadic. Nigel Bruce is so damn blustery, English, and irritating you want to see him killed and eaten, but then that is his constant character. There is waaaayyy too much \\"ritual\\" dancing and choreography, which NEVER works in film. But, for the time, its kinda snappy, if verging on Buzby Berkley at one point. You expect them to break into a tap chorus line, but thankfully they don't. But I think they thought about it. This movie deserves your attention. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE says get this movie","review":"This is a lot of fun to watch. Most people will connect Merian C. Cooper with the original King Kong, but this is also a great film. Randolph Scott is the star here as the leader of an expedition to find the \\"flame of life. Look for Nigel Bruce in a supporting role. He was better known for his portrayal of Dr. Watson in the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes. Special effect are very good for their day, but do not over take the storytelling. This DVD has both the original version and a colorized one. I recommend this, its fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"She","review":"Since I've already extolled the benefits of online Video on Demand services like Amazon's and given a relatively comprehensive review of the She DVD, I'll keep this brief.She, of course, is the imaginative science-fiction epic detailing the misfortunes of explorers to the South Pole who encounter an Amazonian tribe ruled by a cruel Empress. If you imagine a high-fantasy King Kong (as this film was done by some of the same people), you'll be on the right track.This digital version of She is one of the best quality copies of the film you'll find, which is particularly important when viewing on a high resolution computer monitor. For this, we have the recent technical re-mastering supervised by Oscar-winning special effects legend Ray Harryhausen to thank. Certainly a worthy view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"Theres nothing wrong with this movie. Its typical 1930s escapist fun. The problem here is the transfer of the film itself. I've ordered the DVD twice, through two different vendors and both had the same problem. The bottom half of the picture flutters. This goes through about the first 10 minutes or so of the film and is extremely distracting. I can't say whether thats just how the copy of the print they used was (KINO is usually better than that) or if its just a batch of badly pressed DVDs. I guess I'll wait awhile and try ordering it again in a year or so. Too bad, as its really is a fun film."},{"rating":"2","title":"She","review":"Ok!So they moved the story to the arctic [the books setting is Africa], but, the story remains much as H.Rider Haggard set it out.The COLORISATION, is wonderful and reminds me very much of early Technicolor.Who is going to watch Black & White when they can have color!She - In COLOR!

It only has one wheel in the back which is a bit too light. This makes the vehicle spend too much time upside down, making very loud noises.

It was also poorly designed from what I could tell. To charge the battery, you have to remove it from the car, and charge. This means taking the cover plate off and detaching the battery cord. Detaching the battery cord was incredibly hard. A young child would have to get an adult every time the RC needed charged. If this product was free, it would still be a little too pricey for me.The seller (IGgFactory Inc.) has also not responded to my requests for a refund. Avoid them at all costs.

The score is better than the most of Strouse's scores at that time (it's even better than Bye Bye Birdie). There isn't one song that doesn't urge you to hum itself and songs like \\"Melt us\\", \\"We speak the same language\\", \\"Nightlife\\" or \\"I've just seen her\\" are songs of a quality Broadway hasn't brought forth for maybe 20 years. Of course at that time (early sixties) there were more great musicals on Broadway and when \\"All American\\" opened there was strong competition with shows like \\"How to succeed...\\" and \\"A funny thing happened...\\" but could that be the reason to not even give it a tony best score nomination.

The rest consists of interminable step-by-steps stating the bleeding obvious (click Department to edit the Departments).

Lira never touches the potential of his own plot. His writing is haphazard and confusing, he continually flips between writing in the current and past tenses, even in the same sentence. I found my jaw sore from gritting my teeth everytime the author used to the word 'poop'. The characters are flimsy and unbelievable.

Unfortunately, I was quite dissapointed. It's composed of three different tales, the first one referring to the Adam & Eve biblical story. The lyrics here are very silly and tedious. The second tale, \\"The Lady or the Tiger?\\" contains songs that are simply awful, probably the worst ever written for a Broadway show. The third story, \\"Passionella\\", contains music that does nothing to make things better. The album contains a good informative booklet in English, German, French & Italian (as Sony uses to do)which says that Time magazine defined this show as \\"three moldy figs\\". I entirely agree. I would recommend this musical to those suffering from insomnia: it will put them to sleep right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"I still remember these songs after 40 years","review":"I saw this show on the stage when it first ran, and have never forgotten it. The key to a good Broadway show is this question: Are you humming the songs when you leave the theatre? In the case of The Apple Tree, the answer is a resounding \\"Yes.\\" I have been waiting 40 years for this show to be revived, and I have tickets for the revival opening in December at the Roundabout. I hope not to be disappointed, for the trio of Barbara Harris, a very young Alan Alda, and the late Larry Blyden were terrific.

Too bad Amazon sent me a damaged copy","review":"I loved this movie when it was in theatres, and was looking forward to the DVD and the extra minion movies. The double pack is supposed to come with a digital copy as well, and I was looking forward to loading that on my iPad. What I got was a broken case and torn cover, and no digital copy at all -- just the movie and the extras. It's a darn good thing I wasn't giving this as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My!","review":"Well, the first half of the movie should have been redone. [Or at least left on the editing floor.] The second half has humor and some sentiment but, I am hard pressed to see it's merits for children or even adults of a childish nature. You really need characters to whom one can be relate or are at least recognizable in some imaginary life. Same thing for the antagonist. I have seen more dimension in a single blank sheet of paper. The underlying story of the hard hearted bad guy going soft over the helpless guiless child, needed a lot more development, that it did not get. Whoever did the little yellow guys got it. The director didn't, in my opinion. If you get it half price and skip through the first half, then you might get your money's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD problem","review":"The movie that i ordered does not work. i have tried a lot of times.

Ordered 3 disc Despicable Me and received Blu-Ray/DVD only combo package. Not that it matters, the Digital Copy would have been expired and useless anyway even if I had received it. Guess I should be lucky I only paid $9.67 for the movie. Would have just Tivo'ed it off HBO had I known this. 12/31/11, really? Its only been out a months! Aren't there false advertising laws?

If you want to have fun, go for it.The reason I gave it one star was that I bought an item that was supposed to be new, from Amazon.Not only it was open, indicating that it was not new, but the disks inside were blank. No printing on them whatsoever. One side solid silver, the other solid purple. Obviously my 3D bluray player got an error and eject the disks (i tried both sides, just to be sure).Now I paid more than 20 US dollars to send it back to get a refund of less than 40.Wasn\`t expecting something like this when I bought a item that was supposed to be new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluray was defective","review":"I was sad. The bluray disc just stopped playing at one point and even when I tried to skip past the freezing part, it still wouldn't play. Great movie.

A few scenes may be a bit scary for the little ones, so use your best judgement there. Some people may not appreciate the sarcasm from the girls and attitude of \\"the bad guys\\", but it's a comedy. Don't take it too seriously!I thought the movie was OK the first time I saw it, but it gets better with repeat viewings, with lots of funny little details. My parents and single siblings even enjoyed it.The audio & video are perfect and show off your system, if you care about such things. It's definitely worth paying extra to watch it in blu-ray.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this movie","review":"Yes, there are some maybe potty jokes, but this is a really cute movie with a good moral.

So far in the past two weeks we have watched it five times and it hasn't gotten old yet! The movie is about a villan name Gru who is evil but hilarious. He plans the biggest heist of his career and with the help of his minions (little yellow creatures) they almost pull it off. In comes Vector who is another villian trying to make a name for himself and does his own crazy heist. To beat Vector, Gru adopts three little girls and uses them in his plan, but he of course falls for them. It is a great movie and between Gru's accent and the minions, we all laughed throughout the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal","review":"The quality of the rental was very good, despite being streamed online.

I thought he did a tremendous job with this character. really surprised, guess I don't know enough of his work. The movie was probably the best I saw in 2010. Can you believe that? A cartoon! I guess that is more common nowadays. Women were crying in the theater, including the one next to me! You know, that good cry. Watch this with your girl and/or family at home! Good couple of hours spent. I'd give it 6 stars, and i don't say that lightly. I saw Megamind last year also, and was so disappointed after seeing this. Not that it was really bad, but it pandered. If you have to make a choice, go with this one! This is THE 3D family movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie. Shorts are hilarious too.","review":"Cute movie. Get it. I didn't even realize it was Steve Carrell as the main character. Now I know why I love it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good!","review":"This was a great deal for a 4 disc set.

Fast shipment as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is awesome!","review":"Any movie with small, spazmatic, little creatures which are loyal to the hilt and silly as the day is long, you have my vote.Pros: Lots of good messages here and chances for Gru (the main character) to remediate his ways and become the good person he really is (but never loving his clever side).Cons: A little too much dialogue at times, but the action was mostly great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"This quickly became one of our favorite movies.

Very enjoyable without having to put up with parts that don't make sense or push the envelope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Wait To Get This Movie","review":"Before I went to see this movie in the theater I thought it was going to be a waste of money but actually it was not. One of the little girls out of the 3 that Gru adopted was sooooo cute. When Gru put them to bed one of the girls said that he was scary and the youngest girl said Like Santa. It was a heart warming and funny movie and cannot wait until it comes out on DVD.

Nice!Great 3D scenes where in some movies you'd find it objectionable, but fits nicely here.Trivia: To make \\"Agnes\\" giggle on cue, they recorded her while her Dad tickled her. Got the job done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gru's Minions steal the show!","review":"I rented this movie from Amazon's OnDemand video library (FYI: When you rent an OnDemand movie, you also get a $4 voucher towards the purchase of the same movie in DVD or blu-ray).I didn't have high expectations for this movie. It look cute and silly, and it delivered. Steve Carell as Gru was weird and funny. The little girl, Agnus, was probably the cutest character (\\"It's so fluff!\\").The scene stealers, however, were Gru's minions. In fact, I wish the movie had been a little longer with more minion scenes. Just listening them laugh will make you laugh.This movie was definitely not as deep or drawn out like some of Pixar's classics, but it's definitely worth your time, especially if you have kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I was surprised at how much I liked this movie.

You will not be dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A movie with laughs and heart!","review":"It's kind of a bizarre experience to relate to cartoon characters and feel the human emotions they emote about their story. Pixar has made a few films that tug at your heartstrings (UP in particular). I was very pleased to watch this film with my son and connect with these odd characters surrounded by 3 adorable orphan girls. It was a very funny movie with a somewhat-typical ending of the hard-hearted villian finding love and acceptance. (This reminded me of the Grinch movies). Just because we recognize the theme from other films doesn't take away from this fun telling of this familiar story. I'm very glad that I made this purchase and that it now belongs in my movie collection!

The very beginning was promising as it generated a chuckle but that was it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it . . . .I really did.","review":"I really like Steve Carell, and I tried to enjoy this, but I just couldn't get into it. It lacks the clever multi-level humor I'm used to from the classic Pixar films like Toy Story and A Bugs Life. I found myself becoming bored with the plot after about 30 minutes, and the characters weren't interesting enough to really grab me. It seems to be a hit with the kids - my girlfriend's 9 year old son enjoyed it, but I don't think it has enough substance to maintain an adult's interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is this???","review":"You people actually like this? It's garbage! I do not believe you pay money to watch such rubbish. TheThree Little Kittensstory has more depth to it!I pay for it too, they did not have a copy of 'How to Make Enemies and Defeat People' so Despicable Me seems to be an acceptable alternative; but i am so disappointed. These three little girls are not amusing! They annoy the great hero at every turn. They thwart his great achievements and distract him from his goal. And they never listen! How is this to be good movie with such characters? It's so fluffy!I will be returning this digital versatile disc to the shop from where i purchased it imminently; no amount of persuasion will convince me to do otherwise.yrsGruAargh!

It's entertaining for all ages, and the little minions are sure to make anyone laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupendous Me!","review":"Some animated films work better than others. In our crowded market of animated masterpieces, Despicable Me stands out. Better than Megamind, and on par with Hercules/(and likely Yogi Bear), Despicable is NOT.My first reaction was that Gru was a stolen name! Really, Sergio Aragonnes and Mark Evanier created Groo the Wanderer, so we thought the worst. We were wrong.Gru (Steve Carell) is delightful, and his supporting cast of 3 young children, and hench things are great. His arch nemesis (voiced by Brand) is meaner, and leaner, yet this film just may define villain/hero differently. Megamind took a villain and turned him into a hero, but this film is different, it turns him into a DAD, one step better.Animation wise, it rocks. Humorwise, gotta love it. Theme wise, no one is beyond redemption. Plotwise, sometimes the most obscure work the best. Steal the moon, sure Gru, give it a shot!Highly recommended.Tim Lasiuta"},{"rating":"2","title":"Despicable me","review":"I bought this movie for my kids and they absolutely love it.........they watch it 3-4 times a week..

Despicable Me is dull and that is its worst failing. It has characters which are even more cartoonish than you would find in a cartoon. I found the plot very dull and difficult to follow. Not because it was overly complex, but due to the fact it was just so poorly written.I also disliked the fact that the film lacked the genuine humanity of such great films as Toy Story or Wall-E or any of the Pixair movies. Those films have a level of humanity which is completely lacking in this film. If you get this for free it's worth your time. Otherwise it's not a very good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really didn't like it","review":"Steve Carell seems to always be funny, but this movie was dark. Dark humor--things that kids just shouldn't see. I was glad my husband and I watched it before showing our kids. There's a whole message about stealing in there (that it's ok) and I'm surprised that although the main character did change in some respect by the end of the movie, there's never a message about \\"I was wrong for stealing things and am going to stop.\\" Yes, I know this is a comedy, but having the little girl go into a torture case where it looks like she's been literally pinned to death is disgusting and morbid.

I bought it, and I won't buy just any movie. My criteria for spending and investing more than the money for tickets to see a movie to begin with, to decide to commit more money to own any movie, is that it must highly enjoyable to watch the movie in question... This movie meets everyone in my family's criteria for repeated viewing. True, maybe some more than others, but nonetheless it is very enjoyable to see more than once and therefore own.

I thought it was a very cute movie. Of course for an adult it was pretty predictable what was going to happen. Then main plot of the story is for a \\"old\\" criminal to reinvent himself with a new crime that was so big to prove that he wasn't out of the game. A new and young criminal tries to compete with him through out the movie. In the end it shows Gru growing as a person and showing a much better side of him. I really like that it shows a different side of a bad guy. Of course the little yellow men where so cute. There were tons of them.We loved this movie so much that we bought the DVD to watch over an over again.

The animation was solid and the character was excellent.The plot moved along nicely and it was funny--there were even some laugh out loud moments. The premise- how does a world-renowned bad guy top a evil competitor in the face of the harrowing threat of three adorable orphan girls. Good stuff. Include this in your DVD library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great animation, even better in 3D.","review":"Liked this film at the theater and when I bought a 3D TV I wanted to see if the Television and the film were up to par on it. Well, I must say, the Vizio 55\\" 3D Smart TV and this film work together well. GREAT picture, NICE 3D; better than the theater in my opinion! The passive 3D system of the Vizio means you don't have heavy glasses to wear and the 3D effects are all there.The film? Great storyline. If you haven't seen it, read the reviews, read the plot, and if it seems like something you would like, order it. Some of the lines we regularly use around our house come from this film. Makes for good comedic moments at times. Two thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"Despicable Me�� begins with the truth that villains are often more fascinating than heroes and creates a villain named Gru, who freeze-dries the people ahead of him in line at Starbucks and pops children's balloons. Although he's inspired by many a James Bond bad guy, two things set him apart: (1) His vast mad scientist lair is located not in the desert or on the moon, but in the basement of his suburban home, and (2) He dreams not of world control so much as merely dominating the cable news ratings as the Greatest Villain of All Time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio CD","review":"This is the second Audio Book I've ordered that was not defined as MP3.

I knew it was an earlier book, but Strange Bedpersons is one of my favorite books, and What the Lady Wants and The Cinderella Deal are worth re-reading. Much loved authors raise our expectations, and we remember our favorites of what they have written so fondly we frequently don't judge their latest creations fairly. (Waiting a long time for a book does that, too.)But Trust Me on This is a marshmallow, a light snack, Chinese food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Fast Read","review":"I loved this book! Jennifer Cruisie has written a fast-paced, enjoying tale.

Its ok though - most of her books are good & so if this is the price you pay..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Crusie \\"Hall of Fame\\"","review":"I just got hooked on Jennifer Crusie after reading Fast Women over the summer. And since then I read Crazy for You and Bet Me (MY FAVORITE). This book took me forever to read because the plot line is slow, the chemistry is nothing special, and I was just straight up bored. Not Crusie's best book and doesn't have her usual pace where you're guessing because of the latest twist, turn, or passionate embrace. If you're new to Crusie (like I am), avoid this one until you've read most of her other stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"My answer for the photo problem","review":"I love it! Having seen it prior to receiving it as a gift, I decided to print photos on labels to intersperse in the book, particularly for the mushrooms not covered in the photo section.

Otherwise, since their Bolete book has been a savior for me, I figure this book will cover everything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mushrooms of Northeastern North America","review":"Very big reference book packed with a huge amount of information to aid in the correct identification of mushrooms. This isn't a picture book to page through. Great in helping clear up some gray areas of doubt that may have been left by other field guides and websites. When it comes to mushrooms there are no \\"stand alone\\" sources of information but this one certainly helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the definitive volumes on northest mycoflora","review":"MNNA is a very good book, and has the finest keys I have ever found in any work on mushrooms. However, I find its coverage of certain groups of fungi to be in want of more detail. For example, the avid Russula student will find that few species have been included. The book could use more information on various genera, especially those which are in need of detailed systematic analysis, and more comprehensive data on the taxonomy of included fungi, which has been very neglected. I hope that a future edition of this book may correct some of these problems. Nevertheless, I reccomend Mushrooms of Northeastern North America to all serious amateur mycologists, you will find it to be an indispensable reference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed book arranged in a frustrating manner.","review":"The tempting potential of this book title is definitely not realized upon holding it in your hands.Organized so that it doesn't facilitate ease of use, it falters as both a reference manual or guide. The photos are clumped at the back of each genus section with no correlating page numbers to link to the descriptions and the descriptions give no page numbers to link to the photos. Flip alphabetically through the photos and finally you will find what you are looking for. The color plates are small and not so helpful for identification. Who designs a book this way? The three authors of the book seem to want to make accessing their knowledge a difficult and aggravating procedure.I should have returned this volume before I creased the spine with all my exasperated page flipping.If your time is of the essence, this book will take up a lot of it.Bassette's North American BOLETES is arranged the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance","review":"The movie provides realistic dance struggles and believable dancing. While somewhat predictable the movie was overall underrated. Would recommend to dancers."},{"rating":"2","title":"God as a Risk Taker","review":"This book gave me new ideas about God. First, that God, having given us the freedom to choose the path we want to follow, takes the risk that we will choose a \\"Good\\" one. Second, that this freedom takes enormous courage on God's part because things may not work the way that God would prefer.I also found the exercises at the end of the book very useful in giving me methods to enhance my spiritual journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"More records should have sounded like this one","review":"This is a great record, in that all the instruments sound GREAT.

Canon only fixed it once under warrenty now again I have to pay. If you don't mind that you miss all the special moments or that the odds are good it won't work then this camera is for you!

We were not impressed at all. When we tried to record our opening gifts in a living room, the picture looked terrible. It looked bad on the view finder & even worse on the television. We thought that it was possibly the lighting at my mother's house. So we tried it at home in our living room with an over head light, and the natural light from outside, it was still terrible. Our digital photo camera took clearer videos than this camera. The only time we could get the video to look semi clear was below our incredibly bright track lighting! Well, clearly you won't have that light quality hardly anywhere. Needless to say, we returned the camera, after exchanging it once because we thought it was a lemon.

The distaff side of the Landes clan has a keen eye for detail and a sharp nose for the unexpected tidbits that make visiting any city a delight.Directly as a result of following one of the walks I have found a club that is now, years later, a regular stop anytime I am in Paris. Everyone who has an interest in the quiter, more intimate details of Paris should take these walks.

Especially if it is a chuck where one adjustment screw moves all of the jaws at once. Also if you can't fix the wobble by changing the jaws around you may use a lathe chuck grinder mounted to the cross slide to tru the chuck jaws up. It is a fairly simple operation if you can borrow the grinder set up. Hope this helps. It is common in machine shops to freshen the chuck jaws up occasionally even if they don't cause the stock to wobble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Witchcraft","review":"If you're new to traditional witchcraft, this is the book that you've been searching for without realising it. In The Witching Way of the Hollow Hill, Robin Artisson presents not only a wealth of in-depth information, he also offers his readers an often moving account of his personal experiences. This book covers it all, in elaborate essays, ranging from an extensive description of the pagan worldview and the nature of Fate, to various workings and exercises to encourage and support the seeker to set up his own practice as a traditional witch. Purchasing this book is not a risk, it's an investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gain the true knowledge of the old ways.","review":"If you have ever been intersted in Witchcraft but all you have seen or read has had Wicca in the title it is time for a pardigm shift.

His Fiction is great but this book is definitely not even close to a worthwhile read.Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rambling and mediocre content","review":"Perhaps I was bitten by the high expectations for this book based on reading some of these glowing reviews. I've been working in and researching the Craft for quite a few years, and I've read my share of mediocre to excellent books. This really falls on the low end of that scale, unfortunately. I was turned off by the preachiness and repetitiveness of some of the text... the tone of the book was a bit much for my tastes.

Robin is a controversial figure in the online Pagan community, but love him or loathe him, when it comes to practising the Nameless Art, he knows his stuff.His writing is clear and unabiguous, and his passion for the Art shines through in every sentence. There is not a book currently on the market that can match this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Specialized text does its job","review":"This book may be of little interest to philosophical \\"tourists.\\" It comes at a time when many \\"new age\\" publications have proliferated to fill the desire for what one might call \\"fluffy bunny paganism.\\" The pursuit of a pagan spiritual pathway necessarily plays out in the context of Christian domination and suppression of such expressions. This book addresses that history better than any other i have encountered to date. It provides valuable specifics about the worldview, spiritual challenges, benefits and ritual neccessities of \\"earth based\\" religious practice. As such, it is earthy and demanding in the level of dedication asked of adherents, ritual settings, and recognition of the spiritual entities in question. I would recommend it for those wishing to step beyond the comfortable level of dabbling in occult practice and into true spiritual dedication and union with \\"the world below.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting stuff.","review":"I found this book to be very thought provoking, and I can say that it has heavily influenced the way that I describe my own path. While I do not follow the exact same brand of trad craft as the author, I deeply respect and appreciate what he has done to bring the older views into the modern era. This definitely isn't a light and fluffy jaunt; it is most definitely the blood and bones of a form of British traditional paganism.The only draw back to the book was that it was a little heavier than it needed to be. It is by no means unreadable, but it lacks an intimacy I'd expect when sharing in someone's views of faith and practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the item I ordered.","review":"What I received was not the item I ordered!

I saw Nan Fabray on a rerun of What's My Line? and my interest was piqued by her mentioning starring in the show. Sadly the show seems to have closed due to the long newspaper strike of 62-63 and of course, the assassination of JFK (even though the show's is not based on the kennedy's as is stated in the first song, you feel they must have had some influence.)

When I opened the box it turned out to be what you might describe as a heavy duty dryer hose. I pulled on the end to extend a portion of the hose and being still cold the hose broke at about 6\\" in. The next thing I noticed was the box was printed 12 mill vinyl in red ink, but there was a sticker added at the end of the box that said 6 mill vinyl.The 50' was only $50 bucks so I thought I may keep it as a back up that could be made into whatever size I needed and that it may be somewhat more durable when warmed up.Several days later I hooked it to my 110v planer then to the dust collector. Within 30 minutes holes were beginning to appear in the creases of the hose.

His plot twists in this book are particularly indepth. He creates a new world, completly diffrent from most fantasy fiction novels, it is a kind of Lorance of Arabia meets the Black Company. Cook takes a personl approach to the characters which makes the reader become more involved. The book is not the best Cook has ever written but it ranks up there (maybe the best story line). The book is a great read with several diffrent plot lines, a must for the Glenn Cook fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Like Garret PI series","review":"I am a huge fan of Glen Cook's Garrett PI stories. I really disliked Tower of Fear because it tried to tell about the adventure from several protagonist viewpoints.

(\\"OK Computer\\" is the first 'genuine song cycle' since \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" YAWN.)Some of the information is interesting, but some of it is just plain wrong, e.g. \\"Exit Music (for a film)\\" in fact is NOT heard on the \\"Romeo + Juliet\\" soundtrack.Perhaps worst of all, Doheny makes enemies of \\"Spinal Tap\\" fans everywhere by claiming that \\"Nigel Smalls\\" called \\"the key of B minor\\" the saddest of all keys.

The music he has written for Superman is very brassy, full of energy and quite beautiful in places. If the lyrics to most of the songs weren't so obviously confining (a song about Superman ignoring Lois can only ever be about Superman ignoring Lois) they would have major singers clamouring all over them. The lyrics are well suited to the topic, but one can't help wishing there was a completely instrumental version, just to hear the beautiful horn music behind Lois' first solo, or the smooth, sashaying music behind Linda Lavin's songs.

A dial indicator (resolution of 0.0005in) was mounted to the table and set to measure the lateral travel of the lower end of the quill. A 1/8 in. drill bit was inserted in the chuck, and a few ounces of lateral force was applied through the drill bit.

He depicts the vulnerability and isolation each child faces (and which all of us are subject to at one time or another), accompanied by some person reaching into their lives in an unexpected way. In a similar way, through the eyes of children, we see how our preconceived ideas of others often fail to show us the true character of who that person is beneath outward appearances.Wonderfully written, most enjoyable.

I still have some filters left and I will use this pitcher until that time, after that I am switching to some other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be great","review":"Tons of black bits in the bottom of every glass.

Use another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great size, still holds a lot","review":"This pitcher is wonderful for a mini-fridge or fridges that don't have a lot of spare room. It fits right in the door, yet still holds a lot of water. I withheld a star simply for the material it is made of, as it seems that it can scraped or fractured semi-easily.

May have been a random occurrence due to shipping. I love Brita so I returned this one and bought another from Wal-Mart."},{"rating":"1","title":"At first, OK but...","review":"I used the original original Brita for many years. I drink about 3 glasses a day and the dog about one.I liked this model because it was slim and I had a small fridge. But after 2 years of use, actually sooner, I realized that it is just a little too small and you spend a lot of time filling the darn thing up all the time.Finally, one day, the white insert fell on the floor during a filter change. Parts of it broke off. I thought this was rather odd. The whole thing should be indestructible. It is not.So when my local store had a sale on Brita, I picked up the current basic standard Brita and it is just big enough that I don't feel like I am filling it all the time.So the Slim is just too slim (unless you are really not a big water drinker and petite?), it seems much more fragile than other models."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken","review":"this pitcher did not work, when it arrived i thought nothing was wrong with it, but the next day when i opened it to use it and i filled it up with water, it was leaking, very disapointed-i will not be reordering this product again, im better off just looking for it at walmart and buying it there, at least i know it \\"most likely\\" will not be broken when i buy there"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluoride","review":"It might take minerals such as iron but fluoride is still present in the water and it's over 1 part per million.

Better safe than sorry, we started using a Brita. This pitcher comes with a filter and easily fits in the fridge. It is big enough for a couple of glasses of water before it needs to be refilled. Perfect for our needs. There is a vinyl sticker used to keep track of when the filter needs to be replaced. Simply a marker saying the filter was installed in, say, February, and needs to be replaced two months later - in April."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective design","review":"I've used the Brita slim pitcher for a year. While it does indeed filter out some of the chlorine elements in the water, the pitcher is so poorly designed that you have to angle it very carefully and narrowly in order to avoid spilling water all over the counter when pouring. Moreover, the lid does not stay closed on top, and it will pop off from time to time causing massive water spillage. In short, it's too messy and a real hassle to use. Cheaply made of flimsy plastic and poorly designed. Not worth the ten dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"no complaints","review":"Came on time. Clearly new.

The only problem I have is, pouring, you have to be careful that the plastic filter holder does not disengage from the pitcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the others","review":"Previous Britta pitchers all had issues. Most annoying, the small cover that effectively seals the spout would suction itself on once wet and when we tried to pour, water would leak around it or actually cause the lid to fly off and water to go everywhere. We even tried creating a notch in the plastic cover, but to no avail. This one with no cover obviously solves that issue. Only slightly less annoying, the carbon bits that would leak down into the main pitcher. So far, no bits. Two thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I was expecting clean tasting water and what I got was a plastic/chemical taste. I have to gulp this water very fast just to get it down. I prefer the water that comes out of my faucet which is saying a lot because my faucet water is disgusting!not only that but black granules constantly leak from the filter.this is definately not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black film inside pitcher","review":"Inside there is a black film on the bottom and sides. I changed the filter thinking is just was extra charcoal. It came back. I washed out the pitcher with plain dish soap, it came back. Added a 1/4 tsp of clorox and filled up the pitcher with tap water. I removed the filter before doing this. The film is back and disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Brita","review":"This is my first Brita pitcher, and I am confident in saying it won't be my last. I needed something that fits in the mini-fridges for college and this... fits. I don't drink excessive amounts of water, but I do however want the water I do drink to be clean, so Brita does the job. As I understand it, all the filters have a \\"problem\\" with the charcoal, which is fixed by filtering water through it until it runs clear. Which is worth the effort. This model hasn't broken or leaked or given me any kind of problems (partially because I don't fill it up to the top) I think I've heard of.So to sum up: It's perfect for small fridges in college dorm rooms or offices, but if you have a normal fridge get a bigger model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"When this pitcher arrived it was scratched so I sent it back. I've one before and I loved it...I will try again. I don't think it was a probel of Brita I think it was a shipping problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite small","review":"I like the Brita concept. Water does seem to taste better from Brita, whether or not it's healthier or not. But part of the concept includes having enough water to drink. What good is purification if it only applies to a few cups? That's the problem here. The design is quite narrow. This helps it fit into a fridge door but limits the possible uses. I find that I fill up the pitcher all the way and then use it to fill up my metal water bottle. By that point the pitcher is practically empty. It's tedious to go back and forth to the sink and keep refilling it.I'm left to wonder who this is intended for. Does anyone have such a small fridge or so many food items that they would need to cut down on their Brita pitcher size? I would opt for a larger version."},{"rating":"1","title":"charcoal particles in water, lid falls out","review":"My old dorm building has some pretty awful tap water so I bought this to fit in my tiny fridge. After following all the instructions and running water through it a few times, the water would still have fine charcoal particles floating in it. I did this several more times and there's still particles floating in it. The final straw was at a certain angle the lid keeps falling out when pouring and even the filter would tumble out into the pouring reservoir. what a waste of time and cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drips During Pour","review":"Very disappointed at the mess - filtered for the first time last night - chilled the water; pouring this morning - it drips while pouring, regardless of the speed of pour. OK - it's \\"only water\\" but it's very disappointing to have a pitcher that cannot pour!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best-tasting water ever!","review":"Changing filters is a bit of a nuisance (you can't just pop the old one out and a new one in, there's a bit of preparation) and about half of the time when you go to pop the lid off the whole unit comes out of the pitcher with it, but these are minor problems for what you get. I thought we already had good water in our county, but drinking it after it's been through the Brita filter is a whole new experience. I had no idea tap water could taste so good!The slim pitcher fits nicely in the refrigerator, too, as promised, hardly taking up any space at all. I wish I could give this 4-1/2 stars, because it's that close to perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!! pitcher. made my tap water taste great!","review":"excellent product. great design. very pleased with this product overall. filters tap water very fast and definitely applies the \\"cleaning\\" treatment. and great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carbon in the water","review":"Even after following all the instructions there were small black carbon pieces in my water. I was informed if I continue to drink the water from the filter it would seriously harm my health. It is appalling that a defective product like this can be sold on Amazon.com and something that can cause critical health concerns.I suppose that one piece was faulty but I would never buy this product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real pain!","review":"I've inadvertently dropped two filters in the sink while attempting to pour the carbon pieces out of the tank. The filters do not lock into place. The lids also fall into the tank if not placed on carefully. The bottom of the filter always needs to be wet, so it doesn't dry. This means you're not going to get a lot of water before needing to refill. I would seriously consider shopping around before purchasing this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"well...it IS better than tap water","review":"...at least in terms of taste! This one is attractive, compact, and very very low-cost.If you really want high quality filtered water however, no charcoal filter is EVER really going to compare with a decent reverse osmosis filter. Aside from a cup of tea in the morning and maybe a beer or two a few nights out of the week, water is 90% of my fluid intake. I used Brita filters for years as a college student, then finally splurged on a nice 4-stage, two hundred fifty dollar countertop R.O. filter with a 1 gallon reservoir. Sure it was bulky and kind of a pain to operate (had to buy a countdown timer to tell me when the reservoir was full, which usually took 35-40 minutes) but the water quality was so much better and totally worth the extra space, money, and time for someone like me who drinks almost a gallon of water a day.So get a charcoal filter like the Brita if you must, or if you don't drink all that much water a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping problems","review":"The pitcher arrived in about thousand pieces.... where do I turn to to get a new one? It was not properly packed, I ordered two one was in perfect condition the other was completely shattered inside the orginal box.Thank you for letting me know how to proceed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water spills easily with every pour of water! Junk!","review":"A few years ago the Brita pitcher was good. But the two new ones I bought in the last 2 year are total junk: with every pour of water, the lid would fall off and water spills out big time. What a junk! I have no clue what happened to Brita. What a pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this one","review":"The water filter falls out easily. Be extra careful or buy something else.This should bring a little disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than two months.","review":"I loved this pitcher for the 45 days or so I had it. I went to fill it one time and as I put the lid back on a the front of the reservoir slipped forward and down. I noticed there was a tiny crack near the spout. Probably not enough to make the pitcher useless, though, I thought. I stuck my finger into the spout in an effort to pull the reservoir back up. Just as I barely touched the case a giant crack split across the middle of the pitcher starting from that once tiny crack. Sounds like I'm in the minority as far as quality. I suppose if you make ten thousand of these, one of them has to be bad. Still, buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Removes chlorine smell","review":"I bought this pitcher to remove the untolerable smell of chlorine in tap water. The jug does its job well and there is a clear drop in the chlorine smell after filteration. The water doesn't take long to be filtered, just a few minutes. With a coupon from Amazon that took five bucks off the already low price, I think this is a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Love it! I have been used Brita for several years. This one is small and it saves a lot of space! Very nice for office/home use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacing one that cracked after seven years of hard daily use!","review":"Obviously, I am very happy with this pitcher. It filters the perfect amount of water to fill up two .75 liter-sized metal water bottles, and it filters them fast enough.

It is a perfect way to keep cold filtered water for one or two people (it is just myself using it) since it only holds 3 or 4 full glasses of water at once. The handle is slightly awkward at times if you have big hands like me, but nothing terrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"Holds enough water and the shape is nice as it might even fit on refrigerator door, but it turned out to be another piece of junk from amazon. In the last year or two nearly everything I order from Amazon fails to meet my diminishing expectations.The problem is that the mechanism which houses the filter doesn't fit snugly enough into the pitcher, and if you don't use two hands to pour, the whole thing will plop out, knocking over your glass and spilling water all over the place. However if you try pressing the mechanism down into the pitcher, you're going to have a terrible time extricating it. DON'T BUY THIS PITCHER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carbon dust?","review":"\\"It is normal for carbon dust to appear in your first 2 pitchers or 1 dispenser\\" um ... this my tenth time i added water and still there is carbon dust ><"},{"rating":"1","title":"No cover for spout","review":"I'm returning this pitcher because it is faulty, the lid is loose and there is no cover for the spout. I intend to leave this pitcher in the refrigerator at work, which is kind of nasty and I do not want the odors and anything else floating around in the bridge to get into my water. I think this is a major problem with this pitcher if anyone is planning to leave it out or in the fridge. This was a huge waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small pitcher with annoying lid","review":"Unfortunately this pitcher is a bit smaller than I realized -- you get roughly two and a half small glasses of water for each time you fill it. I don't mind if my water isn't fully cold, so that isn't really a problem but I do refill at least once or twice a day. Where that really becomes frustrating is that every time you try to get the last of the water out, the filter moves/falls around inside. Plus, if you don't hold the lid firmly in place it will come off. If you rarely drink water this product is probably great, but it was not really what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok as a water filter","review":"Easy to set up and no problem with the charcoal if you follow directions. I bought it to filter coffee water at work and even though it has a small capacity it seems to filter quicly and is enought for a pot of coffee.I only gave it 4 stars because there is no cover for the spout therefore leaving the filtered water exposed to the elements. I have to use a piece of tape to cover the spout...a simple flip type lid would work better than nothing.Replacement filters look kind of pricey. I most likely will use this one and instead of replace the filter look for one with a better design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"The size is perfect for someone who lives alone. One little thing that bugs me is that black little particles keep appearing every time I filter new water. I understand it's some sort of carbon dust from the filter. It doesn't going into the actual water I drink so I'm not too bothered. I followed the instructions and soaked it in cold water and all that but it doesn't really have much effect. Other than that the filter is good."},{"rating":"1","title":"why the filter i got does not look like a new one? but i pay for a new one price?","review":"i opened the box and found the slim pitcher does not look like a new one. there are badly scraches on the surface and dirty inside!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This item is not good at all","review":"For starters being plastic sucks to begin with, but that's what Brita offers.This item has a massive problem with the LID. It does not stay on. This is a design flaw.Here's another weird design idea..The Handle is HOLLOW allowing water to pass right through it,so if you accidentally get water in the handle, and then set it down on the counter, it will leakall over the place.It has too many small crack and crevices where it's hard to clean and the plastic wears outover time.It doesn't hold much water and you have to constantly fill it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water For One, Please!","review":"Ordered this slim model as I live by myself. For guests I aim to set some aside in a gallon container. It is the perfect size for one person. I set at least one refill aside in the bathroom for my puri pot and oral care. It is so quick and easy to use. As I rent I cannot install any inline filters. But this filters the chlorine and limestone from my tap water so I don't have to buy bottled water to:1. get tasty water,2. insure appliances don't clog and3. germ proof oral and nasal care. (ewwww!

The water still tastes like chlorine, it's really annoying and makes me sick.So far, we will have to buy bottle again...##### EDIT - Monday February 14th #####We have been using it still until we don't have any filters (I don't like to waste)... and we discovered that the cylinder where user put the filter was not totally round. Therefore, the water goes through without being filtered. If not only this would happen, some particles of black things (charcoal ???) go out from the filter by its top... and because the cylinder is not round the particles fall into the pitcher.You can try by yourself to see it in action: Turn the filter so its head is in front of your hand and shake it.

It causes the whole inside unit to come out. I find that if you dig your fingernails into it rather than trying to lift it with your fingertips helps.

I have one regret: at the advice of a family member, I switched to another water filter/pitcher. I recently switched back to Brita and I will tell you there is a monumental difference in the taste of the water. Brita is far superior to the competition. It tastes better than bottled water. I have been drinking so much water since I set the pitcher up, I'm sure I have exceeded the recommended 8 glasses a day...and, that's a good thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be good. Now the filters are TERRIBLE!","review":"I've used Brita pitchers/filters for years. They used to be very good. In the last couple of years however their quality control has gotten worse and worse. The last few filters I bought all leaked large amounts of the black granules (about a teaspoonful a week). I don't like having black granules swimming in my glass of water. We're using filters to get rid of junk not add it in! When I contacted Brita about this several times via email they wouldn't respond (other than to send me an automated response saying they'd get back to me within a few days).Buy a different brand. Brita is becoming a joke due to very poor quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale Water","review":"This pitcher is cheap, and you get what you pay for. It has very poor functional design. The chamber that holds the water to be purified and the purifier will pop out of the pitcher while pouring water unless you pour at a very shallow angle. And since there is no spout cover, the purified water will take on all the funky smells of your refrigerator if left to sit for too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made to be compact","review":"This pitcher fits perfectly in the mini-fridge in my office. However, while slim, it's still fairly tall. I understand it's made to fit into the door in particular, but some door panels aren't adjustable and simply aren't tall enough.

Its permanently open spout, unlike other models, is inherently unsanitary, and it my apartment, it attracted roaches to crawl in there and drown. Our water filter pitcher became a roach graveyard!

I am disappointed that Amazon would sell such junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Product at a fair price","review":"I have been using these Brita pitchers for years now. They are very practical in use and greatly reduces the expenses of buying bottled water. The filters do a good job and the water quality is pretty consistent. The pitcher is fairly small and you only get about 6-7 cups before having to refill the pitcher again. If you have a large family and use it often, I would definitely recommend getting a larger size or a faucet filtration system. With that being said, this is a solid pitcher for small applications. The filters last for a pretty decent while before having to be replaced and they are not overly expensive to replace (especially considering the alternative of buying bottled water). Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as others say","review":"I bought this for my dorm because I hoped it would give me cleaner water than the tap from the fountains. I followed all the instructions like soaking the filter and washing out the container, however, when I filled up the container with water the black granules appeared at the bottom. I thought it was just because I didn't wash it well the first time so I poured it out and tried another batch. The second time even MORE granules appeared at the bottom. I am very disappointed in the quality of this product and I do not recommend this to people who want clean filtered water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"The little black granules that everyone talks about are definitely a problem for me. And we found something else swimming in the water. Our other bigger, Brita pitcher is better than the small one insofar as suspicious looking stuff floating around, but still. . .

Done with Brita."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fits but doesn't perform","review":"While I like the pitcher for its easy fit in my refrigerator, I am disappointed by how little it holds and how frequently I have to refill it.

More frustrating than that is the fact that when you get to the bottom of the pitcher, the angle you are pouring out causes the inset reservoir to fall out of the pitcher. Messy and difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small!","review":"This thing is tiny! It only holds 40oz. Perfect for filtering your fawties! In seriousness, this is very handy.

It is as though no one ever actually tried to USE the darn thing before they sent a whole load of them to WalMart.Just so's you know--it's a piece of garbage and I'll never trust the Brita brand again.-----Seems to be a different model than the one on Amazon, but the other reviewers have the same problems I did except no carbon in the bottom in my case.

I have to keep washing out the top of the filter. At one time I even say some cloudy stuff inside the jug it self. I have been using this filter for three weeks now. I had a Lotus filter before that I bought for half the price and It did a way better job. I am totally disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward Size","review":"I ended up giving this to a family member and purchasing the larger size (here on Amazon). This is an awkward size, frustratingly slow to fill for just that little bit more (for 6 cup coffee pot). The lid is very flimsy. Small and compact, perfect if you live alone. But in a larger household, its too small to be practical, and it takes too long (as with all of them), but even longer when you're waiting ... for the refilled filter to filter. Go with the larger model"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little too small but does the job","review":"We find ourselves refilling this one way more than our last square one but the next size up was too big for our needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a pleasent surprise","review":"The water at my apartment tastes smells/tastes off, so I thought I would give this a try. What a nice surprise. I actually got a little excited.It would be nice if the lid snapped on, but I can manage.This model was the cheapest I found anywhere. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems","review":"Brita let us down--the inner part and the filter fall out VERY easily every time you use it--not like the other products..Kay ."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good","review":"this is the perfect size for one person, especially a dorm student.the only complaint i have about it is that the spout is open to the air and the water can take in some of the smell/taste of the foods in your fridge. just something to keep in mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"good water, right size pitcher","review":"I live in an upstairs bedroom with a bathroom. I didn't want to go downstairs to get a glass of drinkable water that tastes good. (We're told that the water from our tap is drinkable, but it tastes awful.)So, anyway, I was really pleased to find out that the pitcher insert fit under the tap in my bathroom sink for filling. I keep the pitcher right on the counter. The slim size is just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine leaks","review":"Sure it filters the water just fine. But I left mine on my dining room table and several hours later found half a cup of water on the table. It is a slow leak, so now I put it on a plate. But people should be careful not to leave this on anything that can't stand water. Maybe not all of them leak, but there is a seam up the side of this that when imperfectly sealed results in a leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great-50% improvement at best","review":"I bought this trying to cut costs by eliminating the water delivery service we use. I had previously tried using one of the filters that goes directly on the tap. It worked great, but we found it was always getting in the way and greatly reduced water pressure even when we weren't using the filtration. So I thought I'd give the pitcher route a try.I live in OKC which is supposed to have the best tasting municipal water according to the \\"American Waterworks Association\\". I think it's horrible, but I guess I'm picky. Apparently super-picky because even though this pitcher did make the water better, it was still pretty awful to me. I'd say it gave a 50% improvement. So depending on how sensitive your sense of taste and smell is, you might want to go with an on-tap filter."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER AGAIN...","review":"Takes up too much space in the fridge yet only holds about 3-4 cups of water, takes too long to fill up, water still tastes like tap water (yuck)! Back to buying bottled water. I guess green is not my color..."},{"rating":"1","title":"PUR is so much better","review":"The charcoal bits that float around my pitcher is not acceptable, even if the manufacturer claims it is normal and safe. My pitcher has also started to leak between the top and bottom portion, so that the little bits float down to the \\"purified\\" section. How pure can my water be if tap water is passing around the filter and not through it? I replace my filter very frequently (like every 2-3 wks) since I have noticed that the bottom of my pitcher became green. How gross is that? Please save yourself this headache and buy a PUR. I've used that brand for many years and have never had any complaints. I swear water tastes better with a PUR. Their filter actually screws in the container to prevent leakage. Someone was thinking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable","review":"I couldn't use this after a week because the carbon kept falling into the water. Nothing I tried could fix it, so into the trash it went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be good, Now don't waste your $","review":"In Columbia SC we have been voted to have the best city water in the nation. I purchased a Britta about 2 yrs ago to filter out the Chlorine. At first I was thrilled with the Britta but noticed in the last few months the water tastes different (like charcoal) even after I replaced the filter and ran several pitchers through it. My husband said the same thing with the pitcher he bought for his work from a store 2 hrs away so I don't think it was just a bad batch.I have a bladder condition so the water I consume is very important. I now only drink Deer Park water because it has a Ph of 8 and the bottles are made of less plastic than regular water bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Fit in Small College Fridges","review":"I bought the slim brita filter to put into the personal fridges that everyone uses in college. The pithcer DOES NOT FIT in the side compartment. I had to take the bottom rows out to make room. The filter works great, but you should upgrade to a larger model because I am constantly refilling the pitcher. If you are buying this model for its slim design to fit into the personal fridges, I suggest buying a different model because it will NOT FIT in the side compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"3rd Brita filter.","review":"This is the 3rd Brita filter-pitcher I've bought. I like 'em, the other ones worked great, but I keep loosing/breaking them whenever I move.Anways, it came quick and well packed. Water tastes great out of it.You might as well pick up a pack of replacement filters, as I put a new in once a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I really like this pitcher. It's a good size and the water comes out looking clean and tasting good. It takes a little time for the water to go through the filter but I guess that's an issue with all filters/pitchers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Brita pitcher","review":"The tap water here in Savannah, GA isn't all that tasty so I rely on my Brita pitchers (I have one at work too) for tea and coffee. I buy loose varietal teas and the water needs to be pure to get the best result, and my Brita pitcher works great. I also like the filter change reminder. I've had the one I use at home since 2000 and I love it. I got the Slim Pitcher for the office, and it works just as well. As an added bonus, I'm not clogging up the landfill with empty water bottles. It's cheap, compared to bottled water, and greener too. I don't want to even THINK about living without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEEE -licious!!!","review":"First of all, the water in our town is terrible. In the morning when you turn on the tap you have to decide if you are drinking bleach or water. Needless to say a lot of people use a water service to provide them with drinkable water..I did some research and decided on this Brita product.No disappointment here -- the water is delicious and even tried it on my neighbor -- who himself bought a Brita pitcher also.. I grew up on a farm and our water came from a well 90+ feet deep -- So I had become spoiled bygood water.. With my Brita pitcher I now can have good water again..Thanks Brita ....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well, small size","review":"My home includes 2 large dogs and rusty water. The rusty water is why I bought this pitcher. I've been amazed how much water we drink in the course of a day! I like this pitcher - small size so it fits easily in my tiny kitchen and seems to do a good job filtering the water, at least to my eye and taste. However, because of its small size I fill the pitcher 2 or 3 times a day. Wish I had gotten the slightly larger size. The filters do allow bits of carbon to sneak into the water filter area, but none go into the drinking water, so I'm not bothered by that feature. Overall, a good buy. However do think carefully about how much drinking water you (and your loved ones) use in a day when you decide between the sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"This is great a set.The water tastes so much better and I drink so much water so this makes my life way easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well","review":"Arrived on time, and it works well. This is my first time using a filter like this and was surprised to see lot of carbon particles in the filter compartment, but the water is clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not filter out lead","review":"Beware inaccurate info on the Amazon site for this item. The description here indicates that this will remove lead from drinking water, but Brita's packaging says NOTHING about removing lead. It only claims to remove copper, mercury, cadmium, zinc, and chlorine."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADDS A BITTER TASTE","review":"I used Brita in the early 1980s. It gave my water a clean taste. Then we went to an under the sink filter. Recently, I noticed that this did not filter out copper (and we have copper pipes). So, I got out my old Brita pitcher and bought some filters. After soaking the filter for several hours and then passing 5 pitchers of water through it, the filtered water tasted extremely bitter. I did some research online and found out that those tiny, loose pieces of carbon cause the bitter taste. I ran several more pitchers of water through the filter, and it still had a bitter taste. Just in case I had a \\"bad\\" box of filters, I waited awhile (for the inventory to cycle through) and then went to a different store and bought another box of filters. I GOT THE SAME RESULTS -- absolutely nasty tasting water. My sink water tastes better without the Brita.I gave the pitcher and remaining filters to a thrift store. Their quality has definitely gone downhill."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"good price and arrived very quickly. this pitcher is perfect for me. Water taste great and it's very easy to keep fill. coffee taste better also. Saves me $10 week in bottled water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, water tastes great","review":"I purchased this to filter water before putting it in my keurig in an effort to help with scaling, etc. So far so good. My daughter now refuses to drink water directly from the tap. She wants it from the Brita pitcher. I like that it is narrow and doesn't take up too much space."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works","review":"I have a water well with high mineral content. This filters out enough of the minerals to make it better than bottled water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean water","review":"The taste doesn't change drastically, but the filter definitely makes the texture of the water much more palatable. Overall, definitely a good buy and money saver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for small fridge","review":"This water pitcher is slim enough to fit in the door of the fridge and, because of its size, is also lightweight (which might be nice for kids)."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible lid design","review":"I read some reviews about the poor lid design, but I was in a hurry to get a replacement pitcher. So I went ahead and bought it anyway. OMG it is horrible. Don't try to use pitcher if there is still water in the top container, because the water will pop the lid off, and you will get a big puddle every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water tastes delicious!!!!","review":"This filter is great. I recommend brita filters to all my college buddies that waste their money on bottled water from walmart. Just get this damn pitcher and your water will taste great from the tap or fountain!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pitcher, Great Value","review":"For the $10 or so I spent on this, it is a great deal and the pitcher works great. I live in an area with highly-chlorinated water that wasn't very good. I got the Brita going pretty quickly and the water no longer has any chlorine flavor. It's not the most flavorful water I've had, but it took out the bad stuff, which is what I wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent slim water pitcher","review":"I bought this pitcher for my wife and loved the fact that it fits in our small refrigerator's door. I drink water out of the tap but she tells me that it is excellent for fresh-tasting water that is nice and cold. The filters are a bit pricey but by doing a bit of online sleuthing I can usually find great deals on the 3 packs - and they don't run out quickly so that is a plus. Great buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice water fiter, reasonable price","review":"I had this water filter for about a month, and I like it.It is cheaper than those sold at WalMart, yet it get the job done well.

I didn't think I'd have to fill it so much but I do drink a lot of water. So far it works pretty good for just me. The only draw back is the height of the pitcher makes it a tight fit in the sink when refilling. Guess I could use a cup to transfer the water into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water tastes worse after filtering","review":"Straight tap water tastes better. I did as instructed. Soaked the filter for 15 minutes, and ran a few pitchers through before I drank any. Water tasted bad, so I ran a few more pitchers through. Still tastes like chemicals, or plastic. I tried filtering the water into a glass pitcher and it still tastes bad. The compartment that holds the filter even smells like chemicals or plastic. I thought Brita water was supposed to taste better than tap water. At least I didn't waste too much money, but this experience is not going to make me want to go out and buy any more Brita products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good..","review":"it's worst Brita pitcher I ever seen.

We always appreciate hearing from our consumers. I do apologize that you are having some trouble with the lid fitting. The Space Saver lid was not design to snap down onto the pitcher or have a tight seal. It was designed to sit on top and to lay on top. Therefore, while pouring the pitcher it is recommended to use one hand on the top to keep the lid on.\\"Because the lid frequently falls off whether in the fridge or when pouring, I would advise consumers to buy another product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.","review":"This product helped us reduce the use of bottled water by far.
