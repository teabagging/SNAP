They play well in Barbie's house, always on their best manners and get along quite well with all of the Teen Titans people. If your child is a fan of this series and especially if they are into imaginative play and smaller hand-size toys, they will surely love these too.

I bought this book because I was interested to read a Liz Carlyle contemporary. And, to be frank, her story wasn't that contemporary. Both characters were pretty old-fashioned and the setting seemed to be early 1960's.Sherrilyn Kenyon's story did not keep my interest past the first chapter. I knew where it was headed and the setting of \\"sex camp\\" could have been funny if the lighter hand of a grownup had written it, but the writing for this was pre-pubescent.I didn't make it past the first chapter of Nicole Camden's story either. The writing was leaden and the premise of a woman who could remember a guy's body parts but not his face was just plain silly, or a better word for it, would be - coarse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just sexy... or maybe not","review":"The three stories are alike.

When you plugged it in it automatically went on. I returned both of them and bought them elsewhere. After several years of use it broke again and I purchased it from Amazon. It worked for about 3 weeks and then stopped working. When you pressed the button to turn it on nothing happened. I just got off the phone with Amazon's customer service and they are sending me a shipping label to return the item. Amazon was very helpful once I explained the situation. The coffeemaker is the best out there for the price but apparently the store that it's coming from is selling damaged goods."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIED","review":"When I first received my coffee maker it made a decent cup of coffee, worked quickly and was easy to clean. Then after about 1 month of making 1 or 2 cups a day it died. no light, nothing. Being a curious and having a technical background I disassembled mine and discovered that it has 2 thermal fuses in the heating element circuitry in contact with the heating tube. These are to prevent overheating and a possible fire hazard. I have read several reviews where owners have stated that the coffee maker turns on by itself, which, if there was no water in the coffee maker and it had no fuses, would be a definite fire hazard. One of these fuses in mine was blown and they're not replaceable. I'm guessing that it turned on by itself, with no water, overheated and subsequently blew it's fuse. I assume that's why the makers tell you to unplug the unit when it's not in use. My coffee maker is out with the trash, but I guess if you unplug it when it's not in use.......It IS an inexpensive unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee maker didn't turn on","review":"I bought this to replace a Black and Decker coffee maker I've had for 6 years. When I plugged it in, the light did not turn on and the coffee maker did not make coffee. The plug worked, because I tested the old coffee maker. I returned the item.I did not ask for a replacement because it seemed the box had already been opened and I believe I got an item someone else returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traded in a Keurig for this. Good decision!","review":"I had a Keurig, which I liked well enough. But it took up a lot of counter space and I was getting tired of the price and limited selection of the K-cups. So I sold the Keurig and bought this instead. This little machine does everything the Keurig can do, but faster, cheaper, and with more flexibility. No more being limited to 3 cup sizes--make any amount like, up to 16 oz. Use any coffee you like, in any strength you like, at any price point you like. You don't even have the expense of buying filters, as there's a reusable one built right in. It's dead simple to use, easy clean up, and bonus mug included. It shuts off automatically, so if you're forgetful, you don't need to worry about burning anything. If this product has any flaw, it's that the travel mug is not well-insulated--it gets very hot to the touch. But at this price, and with everything else working so well, that's a pretty minor quibble. I don't even use the mug half the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely lasted 6 weeks","review":"This is the first time that I had a coffeemaker break within months.

To bad it was great while it lasted but I need a coffeemaker that lasts more than 6 weeks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Bought this for my mom because she drinks coffee slowly, but was disappointed. The travel mug is cheap and doesn't keep the coffee hot. We've had to go back to a regular coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the neck to use","review":"My last B&D; Cup-at-a-time coffee maker was great! Then it broke and I bought this as a replacement. It was the closest I could find. It works the same way and uses the same size filter but it's designed to use a tall travel thermal mug and if you try to put a standard coffee cup (or mug) instead of the thermal one there is too much of a gap and coffee splatters all over the counter. This is a stupid design since not everyone wants to use that thermal mug. I like china cups and my kitchen counter gets messed up up each time.There doesn't seem to be good replacement for the original B&D; anywhere on the market so I'll continue to use this one since I like to make individual cups of coffee.Real dumb change in design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inexpensive alternative to Keurig, etc.","review":"My husband and I have totally different requirements when we drink coffee. I sip all day, and I don' t want to stop each time to brew a new cup. He wants each cup fresh brewed. The single serve systems and their K cups are too pricey for a couple cups of coffee a day. The Brew \\"N Go actually works very well. The cup that comes with it makes a generous cup of coffee, the coffee is hot, and it brews very quickly. Hubby was dubious at first, but now he's very satisfied with it, especially in light of the savings to his pocketbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the occasional coffee drinker","review":"My fiance has been getting into coffee but he's the only one in the house that drinks it.

It brews a perfectly wonderful cup of coffee - I use a combination of 1/2 Maxwell House w/ caffeine and 1/2 Gevalia decaf (different flavors and strengths).Use filtered water whenever possible so as not to ruin the heating elements with hard water deposits - you should do this whenever making coffee anyway, since the water \\"makes\\" the coffee.You can't go wrong with this little coffee maker - and the price is perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT COFFEE FOR ONE","review":"This is just the type coffee maker I was looking for and I am very pleased with it.A good Black and Decker product at a great Amazon price."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea, bad product! Coffee ground EVERYWHERE","review":"I love the idea but this coffee maker is disappointing. It doesn't matter how much coffee I put in, or how large the coffee ground is, they do not get filter out. My cup of coffee always has great amount of coffee ground that I have to drain my coffee at least twice everytime for it to be drinkable. Also, because the coffee ground gets every where, washing is a pain! I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best buy ever in a single serve brewer","review":"We have used this product for a number of years, and like freshly brewed coffee or tea three or more times a day. We always keep a new one in reserve in case B&W ever stops making it. The heater and filter will eventually wear and need to be replaced with a new brewer, but it will last several years under heavy use. The metal screen filter will accumulate a buildup of coffee and tea stain which can be cleaned with a small stiff brush while flushing with warm water. The brewing platform provides enough height to use a tall mug which is important for us tea drinkers who like a mug of tea to carry around. We heartily recommend the B&W coffee maker to all coffee and tea drinkers. There is nothing on the market at this price level that performs as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUNK","review":"It worked for 5 months and then wouldn't push the water through.

I had the original one for YEARS and loved it. I broke it. I tetered back and forth whether I should buy this one. I did and have to say so far so good. I was a little concerned that there was less \\"screen\\" in the filter, but as long as you put the proper amount of coffee in there, I see no problems. I have been pleased so far and have had it a couple months. I still use my original mug from the older model too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for.

I found it to be a great product, especially for the price. But the newest model went on the fritz in less than a month and began shutting off halfway through the brewing process. I did an online search and found it wasn't an isolated incident. I'm more than disappointed and will not buy another one. Ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I purchased this product 2/17/12 and received it 2/22/12. Today 3/21/12 it is broken. The small valve in the water chamber popped out and won't stay back in. Since I've used this product for almost a month, I don't have the original packaging to return the item and now have to deal with the warranty people or toss it and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would pass on this one","review":"Great idea, but you get what you pay for. Like many others have written, 75% of the time the coffee grinds overflow and find their way into the water tank and ultimately into your cup. It's nasty and not drinkable. You end up wasting time and material. Even the cup was junk. Right out of the box, the cup outer shell separated from the inner liner and handle. Useless. It's all going in the trash now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brews large cup of coffee","review":"This is the only single cup coffee maker I know of that has the capacity of 15 oz (comes with either a plastic or Stainless 15oz cup with lid). It's the main feature I like the most. Most others brew 8 to 12 oz and most take those measured dosed coffee plugs which I don't want to buy. I've had 4 of these over the years (and still have a brand new spare still in the box). A couple of them had problems leaking out the bottom after awhile and I got rid of those. I also like the permanent mesh filter, works fine for me. If you like a large cup of coffee, this is the one to get. Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of the ones that leaked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay for the price","review":"I have used Black & Decker single cup machines for years. I am not a big coffee drinker, and the machines are inexpensive, so I didn't mind having to replace them often because the start switch breaks regularly. However, after repeated switch breakage, I've reached my limit and am searching for another brand and a switch that is not the press downward, springloaded type. I think it must be the internal spring that breaks. Since this has happened to me for years (10+), I can't imagine that Black & Decker isn't aware of it, so I suppose they don't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&D DCM18","review":"Very nice product. Purchased the device for a short trip (2 weeks). It was very handy to use. Used it after the trip because I liked it. It broke in about two weeks; did not heat water and the pilot lamp would not light. Tried to register the product for the product warranty service at the B&D web site shown in the instruction material. But the web site would not accept my registration without; date of birth, income level, phone number, and the other things B&D does not need to know. So, I did not register the product for warranty service. I'll accept the loss and dispose of the item. My conclusion is that it's not a reliable product."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect size & right safety feature","review":"This brew 'n go was the perfect size for my office; small enough to fit on a small table next to my deck & wall. Also, I didn't like having to clean the permanent filter so I started using the #1 size disposable paper filter and it works great. The main reason I bought this brew 'n go was because of the auto shutoff after the coffee is made. I don't have to remember to turn it off which I usually did with other types of coffee makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit working after one month","review":"Can not complain the price since I got it for 15 bucks.

I bought another from Amazon and have had nothing but trouble because they CHANGED THE FILTER DESIGN which lets less coffee through and often causes the coffee to overflow into the water reservoir and it's such a humongous hassle to clean out the grounds.I'm very disappointed. I've now been using paper filters but the coffee doesn't taste as rich as it does with a wire mesh filter.Grrrrrrrrr! Why did they mess with the original design? Probably because they don't care and didn't test it.Nothing matches the wonderfulness of making just a single cup of coffee. Black and Decker ruined the experience.Also, you can microwave a this cup, but not the stainless steel ones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective straight out of box","review":"I Bought this as a christmas present and straight out of the box this coffee maker did not work sputters and turns off before it has brewed the coffe"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last a month!","review":"I purchased this coffeemaker for my daughter, who lives in a college dorm, in Sept.2010. In less than a month, the on switch malfunctioned and the unit will not turn on. When the company was contacted, they offered to send a new unit, but we have to pay the shipping charges which are about one half of what we paid for the coffeemaker. Not exactly a deal in my eyes. She went ahead and got another unit, a Keurig, and we hope that since we spent more it will be a better quality and last longer. This was a relatively inexpensive unit, but should have lasted longer than it did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent single serve coffee maker","review":"This is an excellent single cup coffee maker. I had one for about 7 years before it finally died, and decided to try another brand for a replacement because it was cheaper. I was not happy with the other brand, so I finally bought another Black and Decker and am very happy I did. It has a permanent filer, although I use paper filters for cleaning convenience, and comes with a travel mug. Mostly I use coffee pods though as they are the easiest, although the coffee can be a little weak with the pods. All in all, I would recommend this produce."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Great product for small spaces :) It works great, is easy to clean, and provides a quick cup of coffee.

Small foot print, easy to clean, can use your favorite coffee mug but not your tall travel mug. You can drop in a pod but the dense filter of the pod will not give you a strong brew. Using the #1 paper filters avoids the coffee grind mess and makes a very good cup of coffee. A good second coffee maker, it does the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to the last cup","review":"I've had this little coffee maker for nearly three years and after I learned it's little quirks I found it does a good job on a daily basis for me. The main quirk is the little thingy at the the bottom of the water well that allows the water to do it's thing with the coffee. (how's that for a scientific explanation?)Anyway..it gets stuck and the coffee doesn't hit the cup but goes out on the counter top. First few times this happened I was ready to 86 the coffe maker. But since I found this valve and give it a daily jiggle before I pour in the water it has worked without a hitch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Brew 'N Go","review":"Delivery was speedy. This was a gift for my husband who had the Brew 'N Go with the cup that did not fit the cup holder in his vehicle. He loves that this one does fit the cup holder but commented that it was easier to pour water into the other one."},{"rating":"2","title":"On-Off switch","review":"I have never had a problem with grounds floating into the water reservoir probably because I have always used coarser gound & decaf coffee. Plus, I barely use 1 measuring scoop of coffee (the scoop is from Gevalia brand and is smaller than normal scoops)and it is guite strong. No need for too much coffee. Using the travel mug to pour the water into the reservoir seems very easy (it doesn't drip or splash) and if you want the mug to be full then add a tad bit more water and it won't overflow because of the evaporation. My unit is defective in that the On-Off switch turns OFF after brewing but then turns itself back on again after a few minutes. I was going to return it but felt unplugging it after each use is probably safer anyway. So that's what I do and all is well with my cup of coffee. As someone else mentioned, the coffee brews HOT but because of the plastic mug it cools off VERY quickly. I would recommend this product to others but tell them the shortcomings first."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly made, poorly designed","review":"Since it was new the switch never worked correctly. I had to pull the plug after each use. Now it has stopped working. I forgot and left it plugged in and that must have overheated some thermostat or some other control. Also poorly designed. Grinds constantly get into the water tank. Also pouring the water in was designed for left-handed people. The tank opening is on the left side and it difficult to do with your right hand. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"big disappointment","review":"bought it..used it twice and the 'permanent filter' had come loose. the filter is glued(?) to the filter cup. uponcloser inspection, it showed that the filter was applied sloppilyat the factory causing it to be weakly held down on one side andexcessively more on the other side of the filter cup.I also agree with other review concerning the small water reservoirand the apparent malfunctioning power switch.A very disappointing product from a company with serious QAissues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped performing in less than 3 months","review":"I make two or three 8oz. cups of coffee per day. I bought this machine on Feb 16 and now on May 4th, it has gone awry, only giving out about half of cup and then shutting off, leaving the remainder within the pot unprocessed. I tried cleaning with vinegar, still no good. A half dozen efforts proved futile. While it was working I was okay with the machine, giving it only a three. That was because I don't use the larger cup that comes with the machine, and a half dozen times or so, for no apparent reason, the liquid didn't pour directly into the cup I used (not as high up) and trickled around and dropped 'outside' the cup. Possibly it wasn't seating perfectly, but I was usually very careful to make sure that it was. Thus, even if you're willing to take the chance on longevity, if you're not intending to use the cup that comes with the machine, be forewarned.In it's favor, I'll say that it was the quickest brewing of any 2-4 cuppers that I've used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think of buying it","review":"I researched one-cup coffee makers, and gave this a shot after seeing someone elses on their desk.

Here's the breakdown:The Positives:-Colorful design that babies love.-Straps snug and secure to our headrest, Best on the market in this area, IMHO.-Baby can see themselves in the mirror well.The Negatives:- The round shape. The frame of the mirror protrudes over the top of the headrest, blocking part of your rear visibility. It's not prohibitively bad, but it's a stupid design flaw.-The mirror makes the baby look like they are 20 feet away.-The most visible item on the mirror which catches your eye is the Fisher Price logo. This is a person peeve, but I simple despise when companies doing these tacky, slimy marketing moves.After installing this, I did shop around to see if there was anything better. (Mainly because of the way the mirror takes up more of the rear view than it needs to.) But I am sticking with this for now since I think it is the best on the market as far as I can tell."},{"rating":"1","title":"hazy and annoying","review":"I was very disappointed to find a white haze (like a steamed up mirror after a shower) over part of the mirror when I pulled off the protective film. It got worse after leaving it in the car for a few days. I wiped it with a soft cloth as recommended, but it made no difference. I can barely see myself in the mirror never mind the baby. I called Fisher Price and they directed me to the manufacturer (it is a licensed item) and no one could tell me how to get rid of the haze. Now I'm going to try and return it. (But for the haze, it would have been good.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reassures this First-time Mom!","review":"In our prenatal class, it was stressed to not have anything \\"extra\\" around your baby in the car. Well, I think our instructor has forgotten what it's like to have a crying baby in the backseat. This product really reassures me. I can see what my son is doing - playing, sleeping, crying... I think he also enjoys seeing his reflection and the colorful mirror border and animals.I like how there are several ways to attach the mirror. We've used to j-hook to attach it to the tether hook in the backseat. You can also adjust the height of the mirror with the velcro tab. The downside - my husband and and I require different heights. It's a pain to change it every time we switch drivers, so I just have to sit up a little straighter to see into the mirror. Other than that, I really recommend this mirror!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby too small","review":"I installed this in a new Nissan Altima and could barely see my baby and what was going on with him.

It is extra tall for big cans, but won't open anything larger or wider than a mini can of sliced olives. It locks up and won't turn, causing you to try to muscle it around yourself.

Blending traditional celtic tunes with mediaeval instrumentation and the early french text (deeply edited) results in a fresh, lively and engaging production--a thoughful parable for our time. Well done! I can recommend it to serious early music buffs who cringe at the \\"disco chant\\" approach of some other cds..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting","review":"I highly recommend this beautiful Dorian recording by La Nef. The traditional period melodies (although some are modified and reworked) played on traditional instruments (harp, early guitar, penny whistle, dulcimer, santur, bass voil, etc..) blend seamlessly with the vocals to tell the story of the young knight Perceval. A real gift for anyone who is interested in the Arthurian legends or time period, medieval music, or just beautiful music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolutely Stunning Recording","review":"I liked this cd from the minute I turned it on.

The element was bad and had burnt out (nothing I did). I was just glad to have my EXPENSIVE maker back. The next morning I poured water in, and it came out the bottom of the machine!! It is now at Krupps service department again. It has been there for a month now, I have spoken to someone at Krupps, and still have no response. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS MACHINE OR COMPANY!!

It was bigger than I imagined, and showed a few areas of obvious cost-cutting?mostly on the coffee maker side. I first tried making cappucino, and it quickly and easily made two lukewarm cups. Next, I tried to set it up to make coffee the next morning. Since it doesn't have external water level markings, I had to use the carafe to measure the water. As I was starting to pour the water, the handle partially popped off, spilling water all over the counter. Luckilly it wasn't full of hot coffee! Braun coffee makers have a similar handle design, but they seem to be firmly glued on rather than clipped on like the Krups. That coupled with other cheaply made components got this coffee maker a trip back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try another brand","review":"As with a lower-priced Krups expresso maker I bought, this one started out OK but soon refused to extrude more than 1/3 an expresso cup of expresso. The coffee -- no matter how coarsely it was ground or how loosely I put it in or what amount I used -- became compacted into a brick that water could not pass. Removing the coffee from the expresso holder involved digging it out with a spoon. (This compaction doesn't happen at first -- only after the machine has been used about 20 times. What causes it to happen? Beats me.)With the first machine, I thought it may have been something I had done.

No, seriously though, how anyone can not pour coffee out of the pot without spilling it all over the place, blows my mind. These must be the same people who run a car for 20,000 miles without an oil change and then write negative reviews regarding engine noise. The espresso maker works great and as for the temperature, it burns my tongue. The unit is well made and a breeze to use. The auto timer is great and easy to set up.

I read the trouble shooting guide and it said that my grind was too fine. I now use a grind of coffee in the espresso maker that is more course than I use for the auto drip.

The expresso feature can not be used concurrently with the brew feature. Nore can the milk steamer be used while the brew feature is on, therefore you must brew coffee, turn off the coffee pot (thereby rebdering the coffee cold), turn on the milk frother or exresso maker, wait for it to warm up to make either expresso or steamed milk.....not a good system at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this machine!!!","review":"I made the mistake of purchasing this very nice looking expresso maker back in April.

What makes it worse is that I called Krups home office and they assured me that the part was mislabled by the computer and they would overnight it to the service center. Over a week has gone by and the part still hasn't been sent out nor have I heard anything from Krups. Everytime I call the home office I have to leave a voicemail!

The service center in town, San Francisco, acknowledged that this was a very common problem and that the seals to the expresso pump and the coffeee maker often fail. For something that costs $300, you would expect a lot more quality especially given that this unit is made by the Swiss. Learn from my mistake.

Buyer Beware !!!","review":"Having used this Krups product for several years, my sole complaint is its very poor design.For example, on the espresso side, the two (2) brew head gaskets (hard rubber) become loose which results in the leaking of hot water from the boiler.

It's a little tricky to clean the inside -- can never get all the grounds out! -- but other than that, it's a handy little appliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thats Too Much","review":"I find that hard to believe that Bunn wants $160 for a coffee grinder and yet their coffee brewers are only about half that price. I just cant see spending that much on something that dont even make the coffee, just grinds the beans, and the coffee makers are cheaper....?????? I think buying already ground coffee will save you time and money, its cheaper than buying the whole beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing for a Bunn product","review":"Replaced my old Krups when it finally wore out. Should have gotten another Krups. The grind is nowhere as good as the Krups. I have cleaned and taken the cutters out and checked them but does not matter. Have to turn the timer all the way about 3 to 4 times to get enough coffee to make a pot of coffee. Something I did with the Krups in a few seconds. Makes a good paperweight. Bunn should stck to coffeemakers. Love my commercial machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"I had two of these worthless grinders. The first one died and Bunn sent me out another(great company BTW). It lasted about the same amount of time. When it finally died I just tossed it, not worth the hassle. It was so loud it would wake the dead and you would have to turn the dial 2 1/2 times to get enough to brew a pot(took forever). And it ground the coffee way too coarse even on the finest setting so you would have to use much more coffee than usual to get it strong enough. Bunn makes great coffeemakers and I'll bet the commercial-grade grinders they make are just fine- but these consumer-grade grinders are complete junk. Back to using a cheap Braun slicer type grinder till I can find a decent burr grinder that doesn't cost a fortune."},{"rating":"1","title":"It grinds too coarse.","review":"The Grinder is well made and we have had it for 5 years. But it never ground the coffee fine so you end up using more beans than you might with another product. We are retiring our Bunn.

We swear by their coffee makers. But it's hard for me to believe this grinder is from the same company.The dial on the front -- which regulates the amount of coffee you grind -- feels fragile and flimsy, as if it might snap off.The dial for fineness of grind is inside the coffee bean chamber... UNDER the beans. If you want to adjust the grind once the beans are in there, you either have to empty the chamber, or feel around to turn the knob without being able to see where it's pointing.In our case that hardly mattered, because the grinder produced huge particles no matter what setting we used. I'm not talking about the coarse grind needed for French press -- rather, the pieces were about 1/8\\". Clearly, it was defective.As others have mentioned, it was unusually noisy. Coffee grinders tend to be loud, but this one was abnormally loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, a worthy addition to any library","review":"This gentleman started the self help field with his writings.

Even if you are lucky enough to get a lint-free protector mounted on a lint-free screen, the first time you touch the surface (which is hard not to do if you are using a sylus) serpentine patterns will appear between the protector and the screen, and they don't go away until you remove the protector and try again. I was so determined to make these things work that I went through the cycle of removing the protector and reinstalling it about ten times. After the tenth attempt, I threw the protector away. If you try these things, get a small suction cup to grab the protector to help remove it. Once the serpentine patterns appear, it is hard to get the protector to slide on the screen in order to get it off.

THat is, you have to peel off two layers of plastic films from both sides of the protectors; otherwise, your screen will appear green and muddy looking. After that, the screen looks great and although I am unsure of the benefit of the screen protector being scratched by the stylus (I have never heard of these kind of problems from other PDAs), when you spend that much money on a Pocket PC, it's best to protect your assets. I gave it a 4 stars because I think I would have been just as happy with my Pocket PC withOUT the protectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad implementation","review":"Would love to have a screen protector that works. This cover is very thick and it is very difficult to make the stylus function. After getting used to it, you can make do.

I'm thinking maybe \\"3 1/4\\" might work, if there was such a setting. Plus, on the rare occasions when I do get it right, toast comes out unevenly browned. To make matters worse, there's no cancel button, so as the black smoke is rising from your toast, you have to literally pull the plug to get it to pop out.

This is awful for actually making small amounts of rice, as you get a lot of waste thanks to it burning on. Otherwise, it works well.

This fine machine has been in our kitchen for 6 months and it is great! I would recommend it to anyone who desires a great cup of coffee! We are coffee fanatics and demand a great cup of coffee in the mornings. This coffee maker makes a great pot of coffee. I have never had any problems with it leaking or with putting the pot back in it's spot. It wipes clean easily and has proven that it is a superior coffee machine! I have never had the taste of plastic in using it either. I get GREAT tasting coffee every time.Way to go Black And Decker!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's going in the trash as soon as I get a replacement","review":"Within a week of purchasing this coffeemaker, the hinges that attach the door that covers the water receptacle broke off. The unit just seems like it doesn't fit together - there are wide gaps between sections of it, and doors have to be manipulated to go back to their original positions. I purchased this machine because of the \\"programmable\\" feature, but every time I turn the unit on to start brewing, it changes the time. This means that if I want to use the programmable feature, I have to first correct the time on the unit which is a nuisance. I wish I could find the receipt so I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"An avid coffee consumer","review":"I received this coffee maker as a gift from my mother. Upon using it the first time I was disappointed to see that only 4 cups of coffee made it into the pot. I found the rest of it on the counter.

There is no way to pour liquids out of this thing without it dribbling/leaking/spooshing down the side and bottom of it and all over the counter/floor/dog/shoes.Maybe this was their gag line of coffee makers?I give this two stars based on the fact that it does indeed make coffee.

However, after two weeks of fiddling with the strength adjustment, changing coffee brands, changing the mix, etc., we are resigned to the fact that this thing just makes lousy, bitter-tasting coffee. Never mind that it is impossible to pour from the top half of the carafe without spilling and that the timer erratically changes it's setting. I could live with that if it weren't for the bad coffee.

So far, so good. I agree with the reviewers who noted the tendency of the carafe to pour like a dribble glass. Apart from this design flaw, the machine works well. I will hang on to my old Hamilton Beach model just in case. BTW, this B&D model has a very small footprint, one of the major reasons I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Decant","review":"Although the price on this item was fantastic after receiving it my husband and I were greatly dismayed to find that you cannot pour from the decanter without spilling the contents all over the counter top. You cannot pour water into the brewing receptical nor can you pour coffee into your cup without it spilling everywhere. We have had to resort to using the decanter from our old coffe maker on this machine. Either we received a lemon or the pour spout is poorly designed.

As it was, I needed a cross-cutter saw this one (P70CM) on sale and bought it. It jammed on day 1. It has jammed numerous times since. Although the capacity states 7 pages, you're better off shredding just a couple of pages at a time, but be warned that they recommend the unit can only operate for 2min at a time due to shoddy engineering. 6 months after purchase, a document caused it to jam resulting in the motor shearing the teeth off the internal nylon gears (for an extra 10-cents these could have been metal...). The other point is the wire basket which at first looks stylish, but oozes paper dust, and emptying is a struggle as the shredder jams into it - this requires some effort to dislodge which causes you exert and bend the metal basket even more etc.etc. This shredder has now joined its own output. The 1-star is for the 6 months of limited use I got out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it.","review":"I bought the Fellowes T7CM that is virtually identical to this unit.

(I have a GBC that has worked for years.)This unit is a piece of junk.

It's the second one I've gotten in the last 4 months. It's fun to use and I love the mesh basket so I can see what I've shredded and the layers of colors. The first one jammed up after a couple of weeks and it was dead. The second one seemed better, but it was probably because I was being more careful. But now it has jammed beyond the point of no return and I'm faced with buying another. As cute as this one is, the other reviews & my own experience are telling me to get real and find something else. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I had fun using it, but it really deserves only 1 star. =-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"We purchased this shredder a few months ago for use around the house. With all those unsolicited credit card offers you can never be too careful about protecting yourself from identity theft.

As soon as the shredder jams, the motor strips teeth off the plastic gear. Terrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shreds itself over time","review":"The motor has a metal shaft which drives 2 nylon gears, which drive metal gears. Over time, the nylon gears weaken.

First, Dez's voice seems to be damaged from touring, because he sounds nothing like he did 2 years ago. Second, with the exception of \\"What's In Your Mind?\\", none of the songs have any of the intensity of the first album. Either the band \\"sold out\\" and made an album for the radio, or their heart wasn't in making this project a success.

This CD is a huge improvement from their debut album.What's so great about this CD is that it shows growth in the band. Many of the songs now have a different, more katchy melody. That doesn't mean that it's not hard though, because it still is. If you want to know what I mean, it's like komparing Metallica's \\"Black Album\\" with their previous releases, just harder.I also like how much more mature this band sounds. Instead of screaming out oddball lines, they are actually telling a story within many of the songs. \\"Untrue\\" is about a cheating girlfriend, while \\"Tyler's Song\\" is about telling your son to stay strong.If that's not enough, Ozzy puts his vocals in \\"Shock the Monkey\\".

The guitar sound might bother you at first because it's so heavy that it sounds like a lawnmower, but you'll get used to it.

But this is the kind of book that one should probably read on paper.Those are incidentals. Rumi is my all-time favorite poet, at least in Coleman Barks translations.

Barks also gives unsatisfactory summaries of who rumi was and what he stood for. Folks, he was not some flower child with roses in his hair dancing in the night to a candle!

As such the book's title gives a false impression.Knowing no Persian either I am in no position to judge these poems against the real Rumi. Compared to other Mystics whom I do understand (like Meister Eckhardt, Jakob Boehme, Hildegard von Bingen) I get a sense that they try to describe the wonder of life, often in the small things, as well as the horror that is equally a part of it. This sense of depth and complexity is lacking in Mr. Barks' poems, they are saccharine in a 'Pop' way and like Pop can become quite grating after a while.On a positive note Coleman Barks has made me become interested in Rumi, so that's a plus, and he relies heavily on the works of Annemarie Schimmel who is indeed outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Reading!","review":"Rich and layered prose and poetry.

The foundation was laid by Rumi, steeped in the Islamic culture of Persia. The channeling into the mind of the contemporary West was accomplished by a poet born and raised in the Christian culture of the American South.

In so doing, the reader is drawn not only into the story of Job's suffering and revelation, but he/she is gently enticed to take an honest look at his/her own situation and ask similar questions: Why is God allowing me to suffer?

It's a painful book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blows the doors off of your preconceived notions","review":"An excellent little book.

It's fast and it keeps the coffee warm for quite a long time. The only downside to it, is that it's a 8 cup instead of the regular 12 cup. It automatically shuts off so you don't have to worry if you left the coffee maker on. I think the carafe pot is the way to go. The coffee stays warm and it doesn't break like the glass ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"no bells and whistles, nothing to go wrong","review":"Let me begin this brief review with an awkward confession. When I wake up each morning, I stare into this little Black and Decker contraption before and for longer than I stare into my wife's eyes.My morning coffee is the essential precursor to conscioius life. Nothing can go wrong or I'm screwed.Once I had the good sense to move over to the thermal carafe, it was a no-brainer to get this inexpensive, dependable, very basic coffee-maker onto my kitchen countertop and to get on with the complexities of life that awaited on other fronts.It has no alarm clock. It doesn't grind your coffee for you. It will neither paint your office in earth colors nor walk your dogs.It just makes coffee. Previously ground coffee. It then puts it into a carafe, whence you can pour it directly down your throat or partake (the recommended option) via the mediation of a coffee cup.Greatest feature: won't complicate your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"has some problems","review":"I received one of these as a Christmas gift a few years ago. While I prefer the thermal carafe style machines, I can't recommend this one. Like most lower end machines, the brew temperature is too low and the coffee doesn't taste right.Another problem is that the overflow is desgned to go back into the reservoir. Most people won't run into this problem. I did because I was using a #10 SwissGold filter basket in it. That particular basket is not cone shaped and the coffee needs to flow out the sides.This exacerbates another problem which is that most coffee makers aren't designed for brewing fresh coffee. There isn't much extra room under the shower head. The stale canned stuff would probably work okay but fresh ground, freshly roasted beans bloom when water first contacts them. I tried to make a strong pot with some freshly roasted beans and had huge mess on my hands. That was too much to deal with before my morning coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"The coffeemaker from Hell.","review":"This is the coffeemaker we use at the office and we all hate it! It turns itself off repeatedly (usually 3- 4 times) before it finishes making a pot of coffee! When it's not failing to continuously brew a pot,it's overflowing all over the counter. It will overflow for no reason whatsoever. I swear if it's not one thing, it's the next. If you're looking for a coffee pot that allows you to walk away from it while it brews, this is not the pot for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"B&D COFFEE MAKER TCM300","review":"I rarely write reviews but I must remark on this coffee maker. I have used it for 4 years. It makes perfect coffee and pours into the cup without spilling. The coffee temperature is perfect. Coffee is not supposed to be HOT Hot!! I'm buying another one for my new RV. Don't hesitate to but this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"This coffeemaker stinks !!","review":"First of all, the carafe doesn't keep coffee hot at all, just warm and barely warm after 2 hours. The water evaporates so much you barely get 8 cups out of it. Even when not submersing it when cleaning it, water gets inside the carafe between the plastic housing and the thermos glass. Then it leaks out slowly, with a dark moldy color. Also there is no \\"off\\" button...only an \\"on\\" button which is VERY easily bumped and then the brewing has to be stopped by unplugging the machine.I am completely dissatified with this coffeemaker and wish i had never bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee leaks EVERYWHERE frequently","review":"This coffeemaker has three prominent problems. First, if you do not have the carafe pushed in perfectly, brewing coffee will run EVERYWHERE except into the pot. What a MESS!!! This has happened to us repeatedly. Secondly, the on button is right in front and is easily turned on at the wrong time. The only way to turn it off is to unplug it (no \\"off\\" button), which in my case was difficult because it was plugged in behind my cabinet near the floor. Lastly, somehow coffee gets into areas of the carafe that it should not, then drips all over the place. In summary, this is a VERY messy coffeemaker. Don't buy it unless you prefer the coffee-stained look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Carafe Kills Otherwise Great Coffee Maker","review":"The carafe is the weak link in this coffee maker. I've had mine for about a year and coffee leaks from the top seal into the inside of the carafe liner. Everytime you pour some coffee the trapped liquid leaks out of the bottom seal and gets all over everything. There is no way to seal it up that I know of. I ended up drilling a hole in the bottom back side of the carafe to let the coffee drain out better then duct taped the hole to stop the leaking until I was over the sink to empty the leaky liquid. If you serve coffee to anyone in your living room make sure they are wearing their rubber underwear because they are going to end up with a lap full of yesterdays coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I gave this coffee maker to my wife as a gift. She thought it looked nice and we have always preferred thermal carafe coffee makers. Two weeks after we started using it the carafe liner exploded without provocation or warning. Black and Decker was non-responsive to their one year warrantee claim I called in. I can't recommend the quality of this B&D product nor their warrantee."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good","review":"This thing sucks; I have to stand there and keep pressing the on button every 30 seconds because it shuts off by itself. In order to brew a pot of coffee, I have to stand there and babysit.

We make coffee in the morning and rinse out the pot in our building's restroom before we go home. Then repeat the process the next day. However, I purchased this white version for home and by the 4th day, the interior lining exploded on us! Fortunately, my 3 year old son wasn't nearby. My advice is that if you are careful, this is a good coffeemaker. But you must be careful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point...","review":"..if the thermos doesn't keep the coffee warm.

The videos were made in the early 90's although they look like they were made more around the 80's. The information given was very minimal. You could probably put all the informative content of the whole series into about 15 minutes. I was very disappointed and thought it was a waste of time and money. But if you're interested in old 80's /90's type of semi-soft core porn under the thin guise of being informative then this is for you. I would be suprised if these so called \\"doctors\\" were real, because they seem to have as much knowledge of the subject matter as your neighbors teenage kid. Try to find something that is bit more current and more informative -- you could probably even learn more from a real porn movie than this series but I'm sure there are a lot of other, better instructional videos out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word, pathetic!","review":"Extraordinarily, abysmally, even spectacularly disappointing! The video is a total, unmitigated failure. Trust me, you will learn nothing, unless you don't exactly know what sex is, and there are few such people over the age of 18. The techniques are so basic and beginner-level it's almost humorous. But having wasted time viewing this pathetic production, I'm not laughing; I feel only contempt and disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugly and old","review":"The sinclair institute may have a reputation for quality products but the better sex series is a big let down. What the other reviews fail to tell you is that these videos were originally produced in 1990. IT was an exeriment to use \\"actual couples for loving sex\\". It was a neat idea at the time but this is what you get. Ugly models having sex. My wife and I had to turn this off the first time. The models are just ugly and old. It seams as if the majority of models are over 4 and not good looking at all.

No kidding. Must have gotten switched from someone else's bag to mine during the luggage search. Well, it's pretty cold up here this time of year and the libary is none too big, so I decided to see what this little book was all about. Turns out it's about the eternal quest for GOLD which seems to drive men to go to the strangest places, like Alaska or the Amazon jungle. I was on my way to Alaska once myself, but ended up settled here in the Yukon for reasons that would make a novel in themeselves. Anyway, this novel by R. M. Ryan is a good one. He must be a poet, because he does go on and on sometimes, but most of it's interesting. And the weather and the sex in this book are so hot that I got warmed up just reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not Proust","review":"In 'The Golden Rules' The author, a well starched midwestern stockbroker, opens his closet door on an ensemble of eclectic characters pursuing the classic dream of the archetypal American Loser. The story is well written and paced to keep you awake if not engaged. The flaw, as is often the case with first novels, is the profusion of gratuitous perversons that obscure and prevent a reader from ever connecting with the characters. Where Flannery O'conner can write a rape scene that reads like a religious experience, Ryan's muse seems to be the letters to the editor in a cheap porn magazine. While the ending is obvious the ride is well constructed and the story works. With the exception of the used car salesman who shows up once too often to be credible, it is scary to think that some of these characters really could be out there somewhere. If you can find a copy in a used bookstore on the dollar table and morality isn't an issue... there is a lot of talent in these pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I received this item as a gift and ever since i started using it i have hated it.

The frame is rigid as mentioned. There is NO tensioning mechanism for the blade. The blade tangs are made of what looks like aluminum and are barely adequate to hold the blade in place. The blade itself cuts VERY poorly, so poorly I was wondering if I got a manufacturing defect. If you have a few extra hours to kill, then by all means use this saw to cut a branch or two! The whole point of a bow saw is portability and quick sawing action. This one fails utterly.I purchased this saw in June of 2008.

The saw is wide enough to go through most of what I need it for. If you are looking for something to grab and cut a piece of wood with. This works.If you want to replace the blade... this may not work well. If you are looking to adjust the tension of the blade, if you are looking to take care of your saw, and treat this as an investment. Invest your money elsewhere.I pulled the saw apart on day one, and barely got it back together without it falling apart on me. The pin at the handle side is extremely cheap. Actually, the tube is fine. The blade is fine. Everything else is sub par. There really is no way to adjust this saw. To replace the blade will be to risk destroying the saw.but it cuts wood, it does the job required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money but....","review":"It's inexpensive and cuts wood easily thanks to the very sharp teeth. A couple of things that could be improved are:1) The handle is not very convenient. With the metal latch just under your hand it makes it tiresome to operate.2) the bow could have been more arched to allow cutting thicker trees. Right now if you have a thick tree to cut you have to go around it and cut from all sides that may not be always possible or convenient.If not these two considerations I would have given it a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for the camper...","review":"I bought this saw to keep with my camper to cut up fire wood for the campsite.

When I'm cooking vegetables, I just don't enjoy results as consistent as the steamer when I'm using the microwave or the stovetop.Although I can do as good a job with rice by other means, I still prefer using the steamer. It frees up the microwave to reheat something, and the cleanup is a breeze since there is only one bowl that really gets dirty. However, the timer on my steamer does run a tad slow.

You may wonder why I say this so I will tell you. It is very repetitive, you do the same boring stuff over and over again. The weapons are not very good either. The game has almost no storyline other than Donkey's kids want a bed-time story and you have to have a series of fights to go along with the story. Also characters have only on special move the rest are shared by all characters. The graphics aren't anything special but they are pretty good. I'd say the graphics and the variety of characters are the only good parts about this game. This game also has \\"mega challenges\\" which are mini-games for you to play, which are not all that great. Overall I give this game 1.5 stars and would only reccomend it to someone who enjoys totally pointless fighting and really needs a game badly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget About It!","review":"Shrek looks uglier then an ogre should in this game.

Until the other day when I noticed that the unit had shut itself off completely. It's plugged in, but it's not getting any power. No LED, no interior light, no gurgling sound.I tested the outlet, and it's fine. So, I'm assuming it's a short in the wiring, or perhaps a blown fuse in the unit itself. Whatever, I now need to empty the unit of the wine, and lug it to the service center where they'll try to determine what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good... while it lasts","review":"I bought this for my wife less than two years ago and it has been in one place the whole time. Up until last night, it worked fine.Last night I noticed that the temperature (normally restricted from 45 - 60 degrees) had dropped to 23 degrees. Despite efforts to \\"reset\\" the temperature, it still kept chilling. It must be the thermostat, but the warranty is for only one year (except for the compressor, which is 5 years).The nearest authorized service center is 30 miles away, so the time and cost of repair makes me want to warn others that:This is a good unit, but I would look for something with a longer warranty. Under two years of service is pretty grim for the cost of this item.Update: Unplugging the unit overnight and placing towels to soak up melted ice seems to have corrected the problem.

Unfortunately the cooling unit was broken upon delivery. Following Amazon's recommendation, I directly contacted the manufacturer. They gave me a list of 9 different repair people within my area. I called all 9. None of them service Haier Wine Coolers. Finally, Haier found someone who actually services their product. He recommended replacing the unit. However, this is not as easy as one would hope. I guess returning and replacing the product requires manager approval. I have called to receive that approval and am still waiting for a call back.I am now trying to get Amazon to just pick up the cooler.

It is built very solid (which is not true of all hubs) and seems to stand up well to some heavy use. (I'll sometimes have to take it into work and I move it around frequently when I rearrange my office...so it gets more \`mileage' than most hubs!)The one weakness I've found with Netgear is the Tech Support. Their web site is not the most user-friendly site and it can be a bit of an effort to find a driver or anything. But it is all there and you can get PDF copies of the manuals and such, so that is helpful. The one time I've had to contact Netgear phone support (related to a wireless network card) it was not impressive at all. But for this hub, you should have no need for Tech Support and it is an excellent hub."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifetime Warranty is a Lie","review":"The manual and information all says this product has a lifetime warranty on the hub.

It is not a punk record, mostly midtempo pop. The three songs Diggle wrote and sings on are basically awful; Shelley's are considerably better - the usual wry lyrics and great hooks. I would say about 3 or 4 of the tunes are topnotch Buzzcocks stuff; newbies should buy \\"Operator's Manual\\" or \\"Going Steady.\\" Or dig up the amazing \\"Different Kind of Tension\\" from a used record store somewhere!

And the Spedding songs here are just wretched, at least the Shelley-penned numbers are merely bad.

And what is a STATE police cruiser doing at a COUNTY crime scene? In a carefully edited book, it would be a clue, but in this book it's just sloppy work.These mistakes are incredibly distracting. Normally, being a careful reader enhances my pleasure in a well-written book, but I would probably liked this book more if I read it more casually.

The explanations of answers oftentimes don't make sense. And, unlike the real test, the science practice tests required some actual science knowledge.

Neither is information on the units involved in this campaign provided. The work is presented, in my opinion, in a way that assumes the reader is knowledgable of the war and soldiers involved. While the movements of the various units before, during, and after the raid are covered quite well, it is written in the mode of a regimental history, dry and without adding much in the way of things that would be interesting to the casual student of the war and campaign.

It's not possible to roll the pasta thin enough for a good ravioli either, as if it's too thin the filling just squirts right out. It is also impossible to clean when a wet filling gets inside the machine (which it does) if you cannot use water to wash it (which it says you shouldn't as it may rust). I recommend the old fashioned way of making ravioli, it's actually a lot easier and you have more control over the size and shape of the finished product.

In her book, Crespin attempts to reveal the woman behind the diva. However, the reader realizes that the heroine and the diva are one in the same (as in \\"Tosca\\", one of Crespin's famous roles): Crespin is a real-life opera heroine with her emotions writ large in a manner appropriate for grand opera. Tosca's famous aria \\"Vissi d'arte, vissi d'amore\\" (\\"I have lived for art, I have lived for love\\") could be sung in an opera of Crespin's life as well. In a world lacking real divas, I admire Crespin all the more for her honesty and candor in this book. However, she can't fool me....LA Crespin comes through on every page of this book, and I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 cups isn't really 2 cups","review":"I've had these since Christmas (8 months) and I just realized that the problem I have been having with making my pizza dough is that the 2cup bowl ISN'T 2CUPS!!!

And how interesting could an artifical river be anyways? Fortunatley, I didn't discard the book, but read it and I was completely shocked. Carol Sheriff has completed an amazing feat. This book about the Erie Canal pulled me into its world giving a tremendous feel of the 19th century world. Sheriff provides a look from all classes of society adjusting to the shifts of progress.

The only reliable and reasonable source that she had was the New York papers, which were sent in by thousands of people.

I'm sorry that I bought this book because I do not care to read something from a man who has such a negative view of Christ and His followers.

Otherwise, for a more balanced and historically accurate book, I'd suggest you look elsewhere.One example: The author says Jews today have no claim to the land of Israel, as they are not descendants of the original Hebrews who inhabited and ruled Israel. Really? How exactly does he explain the genetic studies that show a relationship between all Jews from all backgrounds and countries?

He blames anti-semitism on the Jews. Of course he doesn't call this problem \\"Jews,\\" only \\"Zionism,\\" which is obviously Mr. Hart's codeword of choice for Jews. Communists that hated Jews often labelled them as \\"Capitalists.\\" Captialists that hated Jews often occused them of being \\"Communists.\\" Whatever an anti-semite hates is what the Jew represents to him/her.The vast majority of Jews today feel Zionism as a great thing.

I've never felt the need to leave a review before, but if you are looking for a fryer that is well worth the money... here you go. If you force me to say something bad about it, I would say that the temperature control gets a little hot to the touch, but that is simply solved by detaching the power cord and letting it cool before unplugging it.

As others have mentioned (and is advertised) there is no pole to attach the vacuum, but I have several telescoping poles, so didn't order another. Problem is, the adapter is much larger than standard poles, so you will have to purchase a special size to fit. Secondly, the suction is very light, and didn't pick up much of the heavier debris (small pebbles, etc). It did pick up some \\"muck\\" but nothing substantial and the small bag to sift water/debris is so small it isn't practical to use (unless you don't mind emptying every few minutes). The suction power wasn't too impressive, but that could be because we have a well pump, and it may not generate enough water pressure. Of course, you won't know that until you try it.I would not suggest this product if you are looking for a small vacuum to do a light pond cleanup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for cleaning the spa","review":"This is a great tool for cleaning out a mildly dirty spa.

The hose mounting is a little awkward but, honestly, I'm not sure there's a better solution. Build quality is good, with heavy plastic and the friction fit for the different nozzles works and keeps them in place. I've had a little trouble with the net coming loose--the net slips over a tapered pipe segment and a ring is pushed on to hold it in place.

Yes, of course, color cartridges do go quickly; but, even the black cartridge wouldn't operate unless all of the others were full. This is not what I was told when I purchased this trash.

It makes good prints (when you use the right media), and scans accurately. I'm not too worried about print speed, because I'm an amateur home user. Where I take issue with the CX6600 is in changing ink. The cartridges have a chip on them which tells the printer when they think they're out of ink (whether or not they actually are); and once that happens, all you have is a (rather ugly) desk ornament. If, for example, you're out of cyan ink, you can't print in black only; you can't even scan. I discovered this recently when I needed to scan something for my job; that cost me some time running out to get some (obscenely overpriced) ink.

Epson provides good quality printing at a reasonable cost. I bought this one without doing any research because I could always rely on Epson in the past. Big mistake. I'm happy with the printing and copying function. I haven't done much scanning, but I what little I did seems okay for my needs. The problem, as everyone has said, is that the ink levels drop like a stone. The color levels are going done as fast as the black even though I haven't printed any color pictures. I have printed five or six web pages with some color and about 30 pages of black text. All four cartridges are done to 1/4 full.

I couldn't believe how fast it went! The thing literally said my ink was half gone after printing one picture!!! I'm hoping it might just be one of those things where it takes a bit extra to get going. Also, the print quality is good, but it's nothing fantastic. I'm considering going back to my 6 year old printer that did just as good of a job, and worked for 2 years of heavy printing before it's ink ran out.Also, for anyone considering this printer...keep in mind that it is more of a \\"stand alone\\" machine.

The band was put together as a joke, and they were only going to only release one album and do one show; however, they are still going strong. They have offensive lyrics, but what's the point, you can't understand what they're saying. AxCx may make the worst music I've ever heard next to Good Charlotte and emo bands. They even make Ashlee Simpson look talented! If you want to make your whole neighborhood or friends angry, blast one of AxCx's CDs, they're a real party stopper!

So why does this even get a score? It's hilarious. Granted, it's not worth the money, and if anything, it's the only album that isn't worth a single penny.

This whistle is off key. I had a train whistle when I was a kid and this sounds nothing like it. This product makes a more of a high pitched whistle thats really harsh on the ears.

This product is a piece of junk - literally a piece of wood with holes in it. Doesn't sound anything like a train, and needs way more lung capacity than my 2 year old possesses. Will be returning this asap. Oh... and despite the what the picture shows, it only comes with one whistle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment all around","review":"There is only one whistle. My fault that I didn't catch the \\"one\\" word in the description. All images show two. I only needed one. But I was still annoyed... until I tried it. This whistle is difficult to blow. I can't imagine my young children will be able to use it if I find it difficult. It doesn't sound good either; I'd say it sounds harsh and shrill. All around disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped the wrong whistle!","review":"We ordered three whistles for the kids coming to our baby's baptism. They arrived today and 1 of the whistles is almost half the size of the other 2 whistles (which are as shown in the picture description).

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this.","review":"The other 1 star reviews are already on target, but to re-summarize: the whistle is too hard for a child to blow into, and it does not sound like a train, but rather a high pitched shriek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but not the best you can do.","review":"I was frankly rather disappointed by this book. I love the writing style, and the author's anecdotes about showing her dogs are hilarious. Unfortunately, I was expecting more actual ideas for games you could play with your dog that would motivate or teach him, and there isn't much that's new in this book. Also, as a clicker trainer, I find the fact that the author claims to support learning by positive reinforcement to be mildly amusing, since she's miles away from what most of us would call by that name. (I got The Culture Clash at the same time as this book, and the difference is striking.) To sum up, I think this was a useful, cutting-edge book... for 1986."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows Lincoln's Agreeable and Disagreeable Sides","review":"\\"Lincoln\\" pays ample tribute to its subject's achievements and provides interesting information about Lincoln's earlier life that I wasn't aware of.More interesting are the possibly \\"negative\\" sides to his personality--his intense political partisanship, his less than courageous views on race, and his strange relationship with his wife. This isn't to say that Lincoln was not worthy of his reputation, and the book does not aim to strip away the respect so many have for him. The information is simply presented in a matter-of-fact way that shows Lincoln was not perfect but tried to do the best he could within the limits of his world view.All in all, this book is insightful, well researched, and a good place for expert or novice to get a feel for what made President Lincoln tick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Audiobook","review":"Having just enjoyed McCullough's Truman, this audiobook was disappointing. Although the isolated comments about vignettes contained in the other reviews seem generally true, the overall book seemed insufficiently cohesive. The story seemed fragmented in a way that made it difficult to follow any overarching theme. The story line failed to move along in a coherent and timely manner. The content overall also seemed superficial in that it failed to convey adequately the great issues underlying the Civil War conflict."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice disinterested synopsis","review":"Great depth of scholarship, an obvious familiarity with primary sources and a dispassionate turn of mind make this author's work one of the greatest Lincoln biographies. One comes to understand that despite having personal views on the matter of slavery, Lincoln was not disposed to get out in front of the great plurality constituting the nation as he found it. I initially found it troubling to hear of Lincoln described as primarily a passive leader, but this proves to be a key quality in this amazingly calibrated president. He often needed to not just triangulate but to quadrangulate amongst the multifarious factions and interests. With such a wealth of material and insight, one still feels as though this is a glance, albeit a deeper one, of Lincoln. The author has obviously had a long look to provide this to his readers. A highly satisfying and engaging read such as one feels in the work of a masterful author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True American Hero","review":"This was a superbly told biography of America's greatest president. Filled with personal details, the strength of this book lies in the recounting of Lincoln's most intimate moments. Read this book and you will get the full picture of the man behind the legend. He was truly an American hero, and I daresay that if you read the book you will come to love the man. Like any great novel, this book makes a profound impact and stays with you long after you have completed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable book","review":"I had to read this book for a history course. I am glad that I did. I learned much about our 16th president and the kind of life that he lived. I felt that the author kept the subject interesting and I never got tired or bored reading it.Do not let the size of the book scare you. About 1/3 of it is the index and the authors endnotes.One point about the ending, when Lincoln dies the book ends. The author does not write about the funeral or the legacy of Abraham Lincoln. I write this for those who may be interested in that sort of thing.If you are a history buff then you should read this wonderful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It should be required reading in schools, It's educational and inspiring...","review":"Wonderful wonderful,, I'm so glad I read it...

Donald certainly meets his objective of writing about the president from the president's viewpoint. I would like to see another edition published with additional photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN IMPORTANT BOOK ABOUT OVERCOMING ADVERSITY!!!!!","review":"Professor Donald has expertly written about a man who for me, is one of the earliest personifications of the American dream. Lincoln is a legend and for the first time I truly understand and appreciate his achievements. His accomplishments are even more astonishing when you consider the enormity of his challenges, both internal and external. This is a story of perseverance, honesty, intelligence and hard work. This book should be suggested reading for students of political history and compulsory reading for students of life. Donald knows his subject and was a pleasure to read. V. Kearney."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lile a college course","review":"OMG, this is so detailed and slow reading that it is painful to get through.It should be a text for a graduate study program."},{"rating":"2","title":"An abridged version of this excellent biography would be perfect for me at my level of interest","review":"I read James McPherson\\"s 65 page \\"Lincoln\\" in one reading session. For me it was a page-turner but as a result Lincoln flashed by so quickly. This book is a page-turner in many places but certainly not from cover to cover. Quite a few less consequential parts of Lincoln's life story could be edited out by a skilled editor in such a way that nothing essential would be lost. A slightly shorter life story would be more interesting. The editing, for example, could start with some of the more obscure legal cases that Lincoln worked on back in Illinois."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitive, but . . .","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago. I've heard it described more than once as the \\"definitive\\" Lincoln bio, but it's not the most readable. I don't insist that the history I read be easy and light, but this book was a bit too dense and detailed for me, and the writing style was too dry. Parts were interesting, but I got seriously bogged down in the middle. There have to be Lincoln bios out there that would be of more interest to the general reader. Any recommendations?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Having problems","review":"Having problems reading this book---I read about 50 pages, put it down, read another book, started again,put it down, reading Meacham's great biography of Jackson and I'm not convinced I can go back to this dry,exhausting biography--it is too detailed with far too many unimportant characters and associations.Lincoln was not a boring man, and this is a very boring biography---it is all there but way too much morethan one needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice account of Lincoln's Life","review":"David Herbert Donald does a great job of walking the readers through Abraham Lincoln's life. Wonderful depiction of his personality and how he is perceived by others. The only criticism i have is that i found that the book could have included certain documents/letters that Lincoln wrote in addition to the short quotes that are included. Also, the book appeared to end immediately after Lincoln's death. It lacks reflections on Lincoln's life and achievements, as well as his impact on future generations as a result of the emancipation of blacks"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good biography of Lincoln","review":"This is a biography of Lincoln. Donald is an expert on the letters written by, to and about Lincoln. If you are looking for a book that takes you through his life, beginning in his childhood then look no further. This is not a critique of the rightness or wrongness of things, but just simply tells what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly, wonderfully readable work achievement!","review":"Professor Donald has achieved \\"another\\" biography of Lincoln which should be read and studied by all who are interested. It is a book which caters to those who are not \\"history buffs\\" as it reads like an interesting novel, and still it delves deep enough into the history of the time to expose the great Lincoln in his time and context. This book is WONDERFUL!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is education in a man's greatness?","review":"On reflection, we see Lincoln as a man whose lack of formal education was followed by a lifetime of gradual steps of personal education. Rather than a man of great beliefs, we realize that he was a man who evolved in his beliefs, often driven to those beliefs by dire necessity. His early belief in the sanctity of the union of the country at any cost, even at the cost of the continuance of slavery was central to the stance he took into the Civil War. But, it was countered by a similar belief that slavery should not be allowed to spread into the newly emerging territories (soon to be states). When it became clear to him that he could not accomplish the latter without crushing slavery utterly, he gave up his earlier position.When we reflect on the early Lincoln, we see how carefully his life experiences, serving as his education, prepared him to be America's great Pragmatist, rather than its great Idealogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much new to add - really nice biography of a great man","review":"This book has been reviewed to death, but I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed reading it. Abraham Lincoln is such a fascinating subject that it would probably be difficult to write a poor biography of him, but Mr. Donald certainly did a fine job. I have not read Mr. White's new biography of Lincoln (or any others for that matter), so I cannot compare this biography to any others, but I think this book was well-written and well-researched. It was not a dry read in any way.If anything, it was a bit short. It left me wanting more. I would have enjoyed more information regarding the trials and subsequent sentences of his accused assasins. I would have liked more information regarding the lives of his wife and children after his death. But if you choose this as your Lincoln biography, I do not think you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln, the man, but not the political figure","review":"Herbert does a great job of sharing the real Lincoln and that which contributed to the individual doing a difficult job. Other biographies of this great American tend to only look at selected episodes in Lincoln's life. This book, rather, attempts to share his life more broadly. As a result, you are treated to a view of the man that is more complete and less focused only on the tragedy of the Civil War. So, if you a political historian this book will seem life fluff. If, however, you are an American wanting to learn, this book will do a great job of showing you how much Lincoln suffered during his life and how he dealt with these issues. After reading this book, you should have a whole new appreciation for our most tragic president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lincoln","review":"Great book, wonderful condition and fast shipping.

Compared to the early books, this one is pale and weak. The plot might have been OK for 100 or 150 pages, but there's at least 150 pages of boring filler material in this one; besides, a very similar idea was used in another book not so long ago. Although slightly better than some of the other recent editions, the satire is still strained and unfunny. The characters are reduced to caricatures who exercise their \\"trademark\\" behaviors too often, like Remo absently rotating his wrists or Smith's grey suit. Lastly, the racial and scatological jokes are the product of laziness and a severe underestimation of the readers. I love the Destroyer series, but I am finding myself more and more disgusted by the low quality of the current books."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor door spring closing system","review":"Everything works very well except for the door.

The vast majority of the time, I walk away from a book with a good feeling. In other words, I like most things I read. No book has left me with a WORSE feeling than this one. Every character was a tired cliche...Goodkind followed the \\"HOW TO WRITE A FANTASY NOVEL\\" guidelines to a tee. It was generic and boorish. And not surprisingly, I predicted the exact outcome of the book, how the hero would \\"cleverly\\" outwit the villian, while I was still 200 pages from the end! I hated it. Horrible.

When you read these you think, WOT hardcore, kind of like the ECW is hardcore wrestling, same thing. This took the plots and ideas of the Wheel and gave 'em a hardcore touch. Not that it isn't well written, the dialog is just as unbelievable as most of current fantasy, a flaw most fantasy readers have grown used to. There's the Tolkien ideas, Dark Lords, magic rings or swords or trinkets, made up monsters, ect. Then there the Robert Jordan ideas, women with a \\"one power\\", complete calmness of mind, group of remote people who almost all follow a Super-hero leader, ect. There are a lot of good charecters in this series, ones that keep you thinking about their fates long after the books are over.

Well, it's turned out to be an amazing experience. Schulze and Namlook retain the analog atmospheres, swirling electronics, and vocoders of thier earlier work, while combining them with more updated electronica techniques. Yes, there are drums, but unlike most of Schulze's attempts at updating his sound, these beats flow in effortlessly with the overall mood, enhancing it rather than distracting from it. In addition, unlike most Schulze releases, this album is not a dark and moody excursion throughout it's entirety. There are moments of great calmness, and a sense of vitality that has been missing from SChulze's work for a long time. I very highly reccommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always - Klaus Delivers","review":"If you liked anything from Klaus you will like this one as well.

I spoke to several physical therapist I worked with and they reccommended an upright bike for post ACL repair. I was not able to actually use it until 4 weeks post-op but when I did it really helped me get back my range of motion. It is a good solid magnetic resistance bike, you can also use low to no resistance like I did following my knee surgery. I have recently been able to increase the resistance and it really tones your legs and buns quickly, and you will burn calories and sweat when you do! I prefer this bike over the recumbent bikes because you get a better calorie burn, however if you have a back injury I would suggest the recumbent bike(my physical therapist explained that it takes the pressure off your spine). Overall I am very pleased with this bike. Mine is the Gold version and I paid $128 total."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value!","review":"For the price, this is an excellent no frills exercise bicycle. I had no issues putting it together, but it does take 2 people. It doesn't take up much room and is easy to move around. I got it because I have a bad knee and wanted to be able to jump on it and use it while watching TV. The tension is a little stiff even at the lowest sitting, but I am working my way up to longer times. Other members of my family will jump on it and exercise for 10-15 minutes. So this is a good thing!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shop Around For A Better Price!","review":"Target had this bike for $98! With shipping, I paid a total of $135.74.Despite positive reviews, I was concerned about the sturdiness of this bike, but turns out that my fears were unfounded. This bike is solidly built. The movement is smooth. The seat is the perfect height for me (and my legs are short - a 29.5\\" inseam) And the best part is that I didn't have to assemble it! I have to agree with other reviewers about the uncomfortable seat, but that can be easily remedied. The only other thing is that the computer readout does not have a storage function, so if you're tracking time, distance, speed or calories burned - make a note of them before you get off the bike because it resets to zero. I'd recommend this bike to anyone wanting to start an exercise program."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am impressed.","review":"This bike is very sturdy. I'm going on 6 foot 1 and even with a few more inches or pounds I would be able to fit on and ride this bike. It goes down low so short people shouldn't have a problem either. The price went down right after I ordered it and Amazon refunded the difference. Great service. I also think it is very quiet. The computer isn't much to look at being from the iPod or even CD generation, and that is the only thing about it I found to dislike, maybe will grow on me. Still gets 5 stars for being so nice and inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"ecellent value!","review":"This is very quiet bike. Your breathing will be louder than your pedaling. The wide range of seetings would suit almost anyone. The lowest setting is really easy, good for rehabbing. i like to do 10 minutes at setting #2 & then \\"climb\\" at setting 8 for 5 - 10 minutes. The higher settings give the bike a stairmaster effect. It does not keep a record of miles or hours beyond 1 session, and the seat could be a little more comfortable. For the money, I'd say you won't find a better value. By the way it was very easy to put together, it took about 10 minutes, and I struggle with these kinds of things. Buy it, you'll feel good about the money saved & the quality of the bike. This was only 50 bucks more than my Stamina brand wind bike. What a ripoff that piece of junk was!.

I've been using this unit about 3-4 times a day for about 15 minutes each time since I got it and have been very pleased with how quiet and smooth it is to use. I will agree with a previous reviewer that the tension cable is extremely difficul to connect, but I can't really hold that against the finished product. Overall, I think that in terms of quality for the price, this unit would be impossible to beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Service","review":"I bought this item for my father and i got the bike and it was cracked and was missing parts.

Zack edits an anthology on \\"microdiversity\\", basically investigating the fac that there is more diversity within races than between races and mixed-race individuals substantiate this. Zack basically goes back and forth on whether racial categories should be used strategically or obliterated. The anthology has some interesting pieces from Native Americans. It is lacking on pieces from Latinos. It is very academic: everyday fans of Maria Root's books may be stumped here. The book ends with this awkard, unnecessary essay by a Jewish woman that is not even bi-religious.

We used Redenbacher corn . I'd much rather have popcorn less often and have some that is much better tasting than this. If you do use this, have a very deep bowl to put underneath the chute. A large baking bowl will not do it. It also will not melt cool/cold butter..it has to be soft to begin with. This was not a fun thing to do or use, especially with kids. I'd never let them use this.

I do not use the option to melt butter in the cup as I prefer to have my butter ready to go and pour as the corn comes out of the popper. Once it starts to pop, it really finishes very quickly, so I have my little pitcher of melted butter ready and drizzle as the popcorn fills the bowl. Pops almost every kernel, the exception is once the first of the popcorn pops a few unpopped kernels are blown up and out of the popper (don't try to pick them up and put them back in HOT!), but it is way fewer than popping any other way. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep Looking","review":"My chief gripe with this popper is that the popping chamber is very shallow and it seems like half of the popcorn kernels end up getting blown out of the popper before they get a chance to pop.

This makes the loud hairdryer-type noise of all air poppers, but that's its job. It makes quick work popping popcorn,and the clean-up is easy. Dump out the kernels that fail to pop (that's the seed's fault, not the machine's), and give it a quick wipe with a towel, and you're absolutely done cleaning! I like to melt my butter in the microwave in a glass container, because after a while the oil tends to coat the cup in the top of the lid, but if you like the hot air to melt it, heads up. It's lightweight, looks nice, and doesn't have any moving parts besides the blower mechanism. There are no touchable parts that get really hot, so it's fine to have kids around, waiting for the popping to begin. A nice popper, mostly for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked awhile then broke","review":"Today's poppers don't work like they did 30 years ago. This one did work for about 2 years before breaking, which when it did it caught on fire instantaneously.

I will be returning this one and replacing it with an additional Cooks hot air popper for my second home. All hot air poppers are not created equal as I found out. Also the Cooks hot air popper is cheaper. In both poppers you can use the cup that is included to measure both the popcorn and the butter which melts as the popcorn is popping...a nice feature.

Next I ran the machine for about a minute to warm it up. I placed another 1/4 cup of kernels in the popper. Again, all it did was blow the kernels into the bowl without popping.

This machine blows popcorn like a rogue hairdryer.2. Burnt up after 2 years and less then 10 uses (bowls of popcorn). Kinda a deal breaker, no?

It's difficult to catch all of the popped kernels as they pour forth from the chute without holding up a large bowl right below the opening.Now for the really bad stuff: The plastic top gets so hot that it actually softens. I almost think it could melt if I left it on long enough. It's really cheaply made and can easily burn you if you're not careful.

This does it best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for standard yellow popcorn--not other varieties","review":"I've had this popcorn popper for years--I would estimate 10 years. If you're only planning to use it for standard yellow kernels, it does a good job.If you try popping any other variety of popcorn, a few things could happen. Either the popper won't force the popped kernels out quickly enough, and the popcorn will burn inside the unit.Or the kernels will be too light and get ejected from the popper before they've had time to heat properly.I've never had luck with any other popcorn other than standard yellow kernels with this popper.If you plan to melt butter using the removable butter melter at the top, make sure that the butter has thawed for a couple of hours first. Otherwise, it's not going to melt while the popcorn is popping. Cutting it up into smaller chunks also helps.Also, the \\"18 cups\\" referred to in the description is 18 cups, popped. The unit warns you not to use more than 1/2 cup of unpopped kernels at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Popcorn fast and fat free","review":"I purchased this popper so I could have fat-free popcorn.

But, it was not for me, it was for my wife who likes eating styrofoam chips, why, I don't know! It performs quickly, pops 99% of the kernels, and they pop very large too. It has no off/on switch, so plug it into a power strip with a switch if you don't want to plug and unplug. It has a butter melter tray on top; but that defeats the purpose of air-popping to avoid excessive calories. In addition, on other brands that I have owned, not this one as I am under orders not to contaminate it with butter...the butter melters stop up anyway just like your arteries would, I suppose. But, for old, hard headed me, my popcorn eating days are over. If I can't have the greasy skillet variety, I don't want any stryofoam chips. But healthy chewing to all who like this, and the popper itself is great, except for the switch business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpopped Kernels Everywhere","review":"This thing is horrible! Half of the kernels were pushed out unpopped by the popped kernels. Both flew out with enough force that about 10% of them were missing the bowl (one large enough that it shouldn't be a problem) and flying all over the kitchen. Just what I need when making popcorn with my toddler... burning hot bullets flying through the air. I'm guessing that it's due to the poor lid/chute design coupled with a fan blowing everything up. Just look at the vertical space at the opening between the bottom of the chute and the top where things can fly horizontally without hitting part of the lid and being forced down.Oh yeah... and no on/off switch. Plugging it in turns it on and you have to pull the plug to turn it off. I'd pay another dollar to have a switch.

Almost no \\"old maids\\". Result is extremely consistent, too. Never burned. That being said, if you don't like the way your popcorn tastes coming out of this machine, it's because of two possible reasons. First, get a better grade of popcorn. Second, popping corn in hot air means no flavor from the oil, etc. Plain popcorn is boring! What do you want?One hint: this machine does NOT work with the smaller, so-called \\"hull-less\\" popcorns. The smaller kernels blow right out of the machine. I figured that would be the case, but I had to try. So, if you want to pop that kind of corn, don't use ANY hot air popper.

After one use, we packed it back up and returned it. Unpopped kernels flew out of the popper onto the floor as soon as we turned it on. There were many unpopped kernels when we were done. We tried to melt butter in the butter melter but it didn't melt - not hot enough. We had to melt the butter in the microwave. The popcorn wasn't even very hot when we ate it. We bought an air popper many years ago at Penney's that we were seeking to replace, but it's so dramatically better than this one, we'll just keep using it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Tough popcorn","review":"I bought this knowing that I had a wal mart brand but it didn't pop all the kernels.

I haven't even used it a month, but since I didn't open it and use it right away, I can't return it, but it's burned out too. I may as well save $5 and get the Presto one if they aren't going to last. I had one that lasted 5 years of continual use and the last few don't last for nothing.

It used to be so easy to get a good air popper, and now they don't even know how to make them right... The kernels spew out of the chamber (unpopped) from the get go. I think it's because it doesn't spin. Our old popper growing up had a rotating chamber, so the kernels stayed put until they popped. The result was great popcorn and only like, 3 unpopped kernels per batch. This thing wastes A LOT of kernels and makes a mess in the process. I've tried many tricks to fix it but nothing really works. So sad... I miss my old popper. It finally burned out after years of daily use.

We thought at first that it was the quality of the popping corn we used - as it turned out the cheaper the corn the less chewy the result. The worst results were using Orville's own gourmet popping corn. After a few months of use, this popper stopped blowing, but the heating coil kept going - so the popper started smoking. A terrible design when you think about it - why would the heating coil run when the fan was not? Tonight the popper blew out the circuit in the wall in which it was plugged - and after it cooled down we tossed it in the trash. Do not get this popper - its a poor design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Popper","review":"This is a perfect product for those that wish to make popcorn without oily additives. You can always add melted butter, salt, etc. to suit your preferences. The air popper leaves very few unpopped kernels and is extremely cost efficient when used with standard popcorn found at any grocery store.I recommend keeping an eye on the popper towards the end of the cycle in order to minimize errant kernels. The popping cycle is extremely fast, so this does not take much time. Cleaning the popper only takes a few seconds.Overall, a 5-star product."},{"rating":"2","title":"* FAST & EASY *","review":"This popcorn popper is great. It is lightweight, easy to store, and sturdy. It pops regular popcorn within 1 to 2 minutes. No oil is required! Just use the handy 1/2 measuring cup it comes with to measure the amount of popcorn you want, dump the unpopped popcorn in the chamber then plug it in! The popcorn is healthy with nothing added... NOTHING ADDED! You can add whatever you want after it has popped. I usually just add salt and butter. By the way, the handy measuring cup also doubles as a butter melter, but it does not work well. The popcorn pops too fast for the butter to sufficiently melt. I melt my butter in the microwave with my own microwave cup. Overall, a great buy which will pay for itself! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW: best word to describe this popper!","review":"I had a Toastmaster popcorn popper that lasted less than 2 months and I wanted to replace it with the best because I like the taste [and the nutrition--let's not forget that] of hot-air popcorn. I have it plain--no salt, no butter--and I need my popcorn!I am SO HAPPY I bought this popcorn popper. While the Toastmaster had so many unpopped kernels, this one is WONDERFUL. The first bowl only had 7 unpopped kernels, and the next bowl I made had NONE!If you need a hot air popcorn popper [and for us popcorn lovers, it is the way to go], buy this one. It is relatively quiet, fast, and is the best $27 [with shipping] I've spent at Amazon in a long time.......do you get the idea I love this popper?

It's extremely easy to use --- pour in the kernals, plug it in, and in two minutes you have a HUGE bowl of popcorn. The reason I decided to purchase an air popper was to have more healthy, wholesome snacks for my kids and although we eat a lot of the good stuff, we also eat a lot of junk too. This was a great way for us to continue enjoying popcorn but not all the bad stuff that normally comes with microwave and/or oil popped corn. We don't put anything extra on it and my kids love it. We have been using Orville Redenbacher's Original popping corn and like it a lot but am definitely interested in trying other kinds in the future.

A glop of olive oil, toss in 3 kernals, then they pop, add your popcorn. Shake the pan (with cover on) until you hear no further popping. Eat.I use the hot air popper to roast green coffee beans. Yes, I'm sure that this does void any warranty. I plug it in, wait 15 seconds, toss in 2/3 cups green coffee beans, throw the cover on and I'm roasting coffee. Works great. Further instructions on UTube or something, if you're gonna try it yourself. One thing, roast OUTSIDE. Coffee beans smell much worse, compared to the sweet smell of popcorn. The whole roasting process takes less than 8 minutes, and that fresh roasted Sumatra is sooooo good. With a pan of fresh popcorn, of course.

This product is poorly designed and actually dangerous to use...I can't believe all the rave reviews, but maybe they just like to live dangerously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoointed","review":"I am disappointed with the popper.

But again my wifes claims its the best she ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Popcorn Popper","review":"This popcorn popper has met all my expectations and then some! We use it 4-5 times a week. The only limitation seems to be that it takes butter longer to melt in the little cap on top of the popper than it takes the popcorn to finish popping.

This is a great way to make healthy popcorn!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Not the prettiest thing ever, but at least the sticker peels off.

Maybe this is how they get customers to buy the (larger kernel) Orville Redenbacher brand.The thing has no power switch - instead, you have to plug it/unplug it.

Both do a great job...but FYI, to pop the most kernels and not have leftover unpopped kernels in the bottom, you really have to store your popcorn properly. Moisture retained in the kernel is what keeps em poppin. So when you buy your corn store it immediately in fridge with a moist paper towel and change out occasionally. The dryer the kernel then it wont pop.My kids are super excited about the popper, its really fast and makes plain popcorn taste so good. I cant have sodium so this soooo awesome.

I have tried this several times but the result doesn't taste as good (dry, stale flavor even with butter), there are much higher un-popped kernels (I usually average 0 on the stove - this gives me about 8), the butter doesn't actually finish melting before the popcorn is done so it requires running it longer or melting the butter on the stove, if I were to try using chilled butter there would be no hope, thus depleting my stock of room temp. butter.

And once it starts popping, some very hot kernels fly out, only to pop inside the popcorn bowl, throwing popcorn all over the place. The plastic gets hot enough to become noticeably soft.My old machine blew sideways, creating a vortex inside that did not allow unpopped kernels to escape. The only drawback was having to pour the remaining contents out of the machine after it was done popping, but that's nowhere near as bad as having to pick up popcorn off the floor like you have to do with this device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like hot kernels flying everywhere","review":"I ordered this product to be able to make popcorn without the oil, and it does accomplish that task. However, as the kernels heat up, they start to fly out the chute before they have popped, resulting in hot kernels everywhere. They are so hot, in fact, that if you try to catch them or pick them up, you will get burned. If you tilt the machine way back while it is heating, this isn't so much of a problem, but it is far from ideal.

When beautiful Sydne Rome, stays at a millionaire's mansion, who is a recluse to say the least, she can't seem to grasp all the uproar and havoc she causes. Polanski has a co-starring role... I think his character is called, \\"Mosquito\\" or something like that. Marcello Mastroianni, from famous Italian Fellini films, has a strange part as an itchy, conceited, sex crazed pervert.

But, the amount of machine oil and dirt being removed was incredible. I ran two batches through and was still found large amounts of oil and dirt coming out. Further, the dough began sticking to the machine and wouldn't go through fully. I don't know if this was due to the amount of residual factory oil in the machine or not, but it made a real mess. I spent about 1/2 hour with a toothpick cleaning it out.Worse, during the second batch I noticed that chrome was flaking off the rollers.At that point, I gave up and returned the machine.

Cheaply made. Unit squeaks and jams since day 1. Take those screws off on the cover and you will see why; bare metal to metal grinding, and small cheap tin pinions. I put some cooking oil in them. It helps, but surely will not last long. I would like to return the unit but it's all messed up with flour that I am not going to return it. Used it a couple times making small amount of noodles (five servings). Now I see black metal dust sticking to the noodles, dropping from roller side. I haven't investigated where these metal dust came from. But you definitely don't want it in your noodle.So, I would suggest try other brand, or other better quality model. I am sure I will need another machine. Hey, I am not eating that metal dust either.

Its heavy and solid.So, to our surprise after the third use, the hand breaks off entirely!My husband attempted to try and reassemble the handle but it was impossible, as the handle would need to be welded back, and is connected to the mechanism that allows it to move the pasta through. Very disappointed because it was rated so high! Just returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pasta Machine CucinaPro 177","review":"I purchased this machine for my Husband as a Christmas gift.He just used it last week and it was working great then all at once, it locked up on him and then the roll out size would not hold and became very inconsistent like a pin or something came out. Any way half of his pasta came out great the second part came out very inconsistent the roller would go back and forth large small large small so he ended up with some very thick noodles.I felt bad that I bought him some thing that would not work when he was excited to have received this. In addition, when I just went online to see about returning it the time has pasted and I would have to pay for returning and then they may or may not refund me any thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patti","review":"I purchased this for my daughter who loves to cook.

Tried contacting the manufacturer only to be told the warranty doesn't cover this problem because they deemed it misuse. So I disassembled it and freed the rollers (due to poor machine work). Then the thickness adjustment knob failed. The thin metal used to make it actually tore. Don't bother with this one. Maybe others aren't so bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value and no problems","review":"So far, so good. Based off of previous reviews, the first time I opened the package, I soaped and rinsed the roller and attachments. My first batch of pasta turned out well, and I didn't see any metal shards or anything of concern like some people mentioned. I think it smells slightly- from oil coating the gears, but maybe it will go away with time. I didn't smell it on the pasta so I think it's separate from the teeth. I found the crank to move smoothly and easily.This is my first pasta machine, so I don't know how it compares to the others (like the Atlas) but I find it works well and it is simple to use. The only annoying part is that pasta bits can get stuck in the teeth, but I found that I could remove everything by spearing the dough with a toothpick since I didn't have a stiff pastry brush. It's probably a common problem for any pasta machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"CucinaPro 177 Pasta Fresh Pasta Machine","review":"Purchased for cake decorating.

The product was received in pieces and when we tried to fix it or put it together, it would fall apart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately flawed","review":"We had great expectations for this machine and to say the truth it worked well the first time but after that the problems began:1. The knob used to control the thickness stopped working, this was a simple nut that came loose so a flat tip screwdriver and a small wrench fixed the issue.2. The entire mechanism became really hard to turn so we had to completely dissasemble,realign and assemble back together.3. The thickness knob stopped working again.4. Number 2 above happened again5. We gave up!Other reviewers have reported similar issues while some seem to be quite happy with it. The truth is that the balance between 5 and 1 star reviews is close to 50/50 so I'd suggest looking for something more reliable and less risky, even if it means paying a bit more.Summarizing, I wouldn't let a friend buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"gears stripped after one month light use","review":"Flimsy and cheaply made, first thing to go was the thickness adjustment knob. After prying it off (for a home fix) and replacing the nut which had fallen off into the knob, the pasta machine worked for a few more times before whatever gears there are inside stripped completely. At that point, turning the handle did nothing. I was a few days past the 30 day period in which I could have sent this pasta machine back.

We hope to make our own ravioli later this week!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for home cooks","review":"While I wouldn't want to run a large amount of pasta through this machine (it's fairly small), it works great for home cooks. I've used the Imperia commercial rollers at work this model is obviously not quite as sturdy or hefty as that, but even for it's size, it seems fairly \\"light.\\" Also, the thickest setting is not really quite thick enough, but once you learn to adapt to that, it's not an issue. Nevertheless, it works fine and makes great pasta."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT ORDER MACHINE THIS THRU TARGET!!","review":"I have ordered this pasta machine twice from Amazon (shipped by Target), and twice they have sent me a cheap replacement - the V177 Cucina Pro. The machine they are sending is made in China instead of Italy and retails on the Villaware website for $19.99. I have seen it on Amazon for as low as $12. Because it is shipped by Target instead of Amazon, getting a refund is a pain, and I am making my second trip to the post office to return the POS today.

Plain and simple, the machine does not work. If you have the patience of Job and the gulibility of a 3 year old, you may say that this is a great machine, but it definitely does not meet up to the glowing reviews given here. The Villaware Imperia Pasta Machine is made cheaply, assembled cheaply, and is unsanitary and perhaps even dangerous as gobs of machine oil come off of the rollers. Once you can't see it, there still is unseen residue on your pasta. The dough cannot be cleaned off of the rollers or the cutting blades and remains there to fester microbes and all sorts of nasty things. Added to this, the machine does not cut pasta very well. The noodles consistantly were clumpled together no matter what dough mixture was sent through the rollers. This machine is a scam and a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"sent me the wrong product","review":"I ordered a noodle machine, but a pasta machine was sent to me. It is also from a different brand.

After four uses it is garbage. The machine does not clamp well to the counter which causes two problems: 1) you need an extra person to hold the machine for you while you are running the pasta through and 2) due to the lack of support the mechanisms will bend over time making the machine useless (hence the reason it is now garbage). One other problem with this design is the handle does not snap into place for rolling. If you're not careful the handle will fall out. After repeated landings on my foot this aspect of the machine got very annoying. As with other reviewers I was appalled at the amount of oil on the machine and how much flaking the chrome does, not appetizing. I'm going to look into a KitchenAid machine and get the pasta making attachment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chrome flakes off in less than 2 years","review":"I have one of these Villaware rollers.

After using it several times, I've concluded that traditional pan fried bacon tastes much better with a more satisfying texture. The best thing I can say about this bacon cooker is that it is a relatively simple process and the bacon doesn't sit in grease at any time while cooking. The results, however, have varied from poor to mediocre so I'll probably stick with pan fried bacon for 5 or less rashers or bake it in the oven when I need lots of rashers at the same time, which has always come out great. Also, this product is less easy to clean than either a fry pan or a baking tray, which are each a single surface. With this, you have to clean 5 separate components."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"You can fit 10 slices at once, which is important to us. Hot bacon is easy to remove 5 slices at a time with a knife. Thick or thin cut works well. The cooked strips are bent but easily flattened when you lay them on a plate. If the bacon edges stick together, let them cool for a minute and they're easily seperated.Cleanup is a minor task.. take apart the racks and place them in a dishwasher. Next dump the grease from the pan (there's a lot!!) and place that in the dw as well. Its well worth the effort since the bacon comes out perfectly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful bacon!!","review":"I was a little skeptical when I went to buy this, but based on the other reviews I decided to give it a try, and boy am I gald that I did!! I love my bacon very crispy and this worked perfectly. It only takes about 60seconds per piece of bacon (in my microwave), so it's very easy to plan my breakfast. Plus, I don't have to deal with the grease splatter on my stove, which is always a huge bonus! It takes two second to put the pieces together and lay the bacon strips accros the clear plastic pieces you see in the picture. Then to wash you just dump out the grease and throw everything in the dishwasher. To store, the plastic pieces lay down flat in the black base, so it doesn't take up too much room. If you love bacon, and want an inexpensive, easy way to make it, then this product is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Easy Microwave Bacon","review":"Finally got the presto Microwave cooker after reading very good reviews.I use only extra thick bacon and will often times purchase 3-4 lbs at Sams or Costco for a fabulous bargain price. I like to cook it all up at once to about 3/4 done then reserve or even course chop in my magic bullet blender to keep available for dishes and toppings. Cooks 8 huge slices at a time with no fuss and very little muss. It always cooks even and I'm convinced that the finished product retains considerably less bacon grease than when cooked regularly. Cleans up in the top rack of my dishwasher. Best of all - once you know how it cooks in your own microwave you can put it on (in my case for 11 minutes on high) and walk away and come back when your ready. Saves me much time and energy and fromm constantly having to standing over the cooking process."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bacon Cooker","review":"This is my second microwave bacon rack.It is way better than the first one where the bacon lay flat in the pan in it's own grease.On the Presto, the bacon sits on racks and the grease drips down to the pan and off the bacon leaving crisp dry strips.I do with it would come with a cover though instead of having to cover the rack with paper towels to prevent grease splatter on the walls of the microwave.An excellent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had great expectations, sadly disappointed","review":"I purchased this after reading what seemed like were above average or pretty good reviews. Got it on sale for around $12 with tax. I was disappointed. Very disappointed. Tried 2 different brands and types of bacon. One was normal cut thinner pieces and the other was a thicker cut bacon. I adjusted the cooking times since I did two batches of each. It didn't matter how short or long I cooked the bacon, it either wasn't done enough or was burned on the ends. Plus I thought this would make it crisp. To me it tasted rubbery. Sorry but this is being donated at the end of the year to Goodwill. Save your money and either pan fry or bake your bacon in the oven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bacon cooker","review":"This tremendously failed.

I like to cook bacon in the microwave because it is the easiest way to get cooked bacon with good results. This product does a pretty good job of cooking bacon.

It holds 6 figures on the pegs used for talking, you can fit another 15 or so on it just to look good.Now for that bad part, On average 3 out of the 6 pegs either dont work correctly or dont work at all, but no matter whats wrong you can fix it just by opening it up and raising a little part of the peg up.

There are many individuals who have dedicated their lives to this religion and take it very seriously. Santeria is not a fad. Divination is not something you learn from reading a manual or a how-to book. It takes years of dedication, sacrifice and study to comprehend divination. Indeed, it is a life long process. There is a saying that goes: \\"No se juega con los santos.\\" Loosely translated it means, don't play around with the saints/deities or something that you can't possibly comprehend. Perhaps it would be wise to keep that in mind when you read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to the source of Ifa The Odus","review":"For any one who truly studies the Yoruba culture, please avoid these types of books.

All worshippers are not chosen to divine for themselves or others. These type of books are to attract other energies to our culture. Be ware.

They had already read it, and that's why they told me it was a good book.This book is not for everyone. In my opinion, it reveals too much information for the aleyos. Secrecy is part of this religion, and when that secrecy is taken away it takes away part of the mystery for new people. But for priests it is all right.If you are an aleyo or an aborisha or an outsider who has not santo done, do not read this book. It is not for you. In my opinion, only initiates should read this.

He focuses only on Ebo, and never talks about the meanings of the Odu. And he does not understand that the Ebo is decided upon through Divination, by asking and is not fixed for each Odu. he never discusses refranes at all. When the author wrote this book, he had not yet completed his first year of initiation. It is considered very disrespectful in Santeria for someone with that little experience to think he knows anything. It takes years to learn the Cowerie shells. The author was arrogant and disrespectful for writing a book, which anyone with any real experience in the religion can see is a waste of paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"fake","review":"Ochanilele, aka Bart Stuart Myers, seems to have translated a whole lot of Cuban books on dilogun, but he failed to weed out the many many mistakes.

Even though the title does not say so, you might guess from looking at the author that the book is intended for staff development at libraries, and you would be correct. I'm interested in staff development in educational settings. However, I think that the book has useful information that can be applied outside the library, if it is used as a basic primer. The book includes all the steps you need to take to help develop your staff, what obstacles you might ecounter, and how to overcome them. If you already know about staff development from other books, this one may not provide you with new information. The book is thin both in size and the amount of detail it gives. Its better to use as a jumping off point.

This thing has such a large and round jar with such small blades that it will just not reach every piece. Lumps and more lumps. I even tried sharpening the blades. The Krups turned almonds to powder in 10 seconds. This turnes almonds to small pieces in 2 minutes. So it makes a good alarm clock to wake the whole house. Even the banana was still lumpy.

I have read through most of it trying to figure out what exactly our baby needs and what he doesn't. Instead of finding helpful advice, however, I found that this book essentially ignores breastfeeding and cloth-diapering (both are growing in popularity in our society). I also began to wonder if Target and Wal-Mart paid these authors to write this book, given how many times these particular retailers were referenced as the best places to buy things. My advice: save your money, ask other parents for advice, borrow some clothes from friends, and remember that all babies really need is food, love, and a safe place to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I'm reading these reviews and I have to say that this book is really a collection of press releases.

I don't know if they're just too scared to rate them (lawsuits??) or if they just don't bother to. We bought the Consumer Reports book and found it lacking in many areas. They don't rate the products like they do in their guides (if you're used to the red and black cirlces you won't find them in their book). This book went in depth and told us exactly what to expect to pay, what to look for and where to find it.

We had the 5th edition, technically the 2nd revision (Version 5.2), from 2004, and by the time we were done with it, it had many sections highlighted and many pages folded down.My biggest complaint is the many typos. Presumably the book is being constantly updated--it is currently in the 8th edition (2009)--but a proofreader is needed to fix the misspellings, missing words, broken index pointers, etc.Of course Amazon is an amazing reference tool for expectant parents in terms of researching products, but Baby Bargains is very helpful to take with you to stores, or to read in bed.P.S.

Lots of good information on what to buy and what not to bother with. I used this book to help inform most of my baby purchases, and I was pleased with almost all of them. The reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 is that the authors tend to lean towards the high end baby items....I believe their top recommended high chair was $170 or so. (I ended up perfectly delighted with my $50 high chair.) However, they do make an effort to be sensitive to all budgets, and generally have recommendations in all price ranges.

I expected to find this book helpful (Bridal Bargains by the same authors was excellent), but for several reasons, this book was a waste of my money. We live in a big city without a car, so the car seat discussion was not helpful; we co-sleep with our baby so we didn't buy a crib; we are using cloth diapers and so sections on diapers and diaper pails (the company provides this) weren't relevant either; etc. It was depressing, reading all the sections on expensive must-haves, when really you *don't* need to buy so much for your baby. The authors give advice on ways to save money (mostly by buying quality items that will last, a no-brainer) but ultimately, you could just reject the notion that most of the items in here are necessary and be a lot happier.The sections I could have used help on, maternity clothing and baby announcements, were missing a lot of good sources."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO CALORIES GIVEN FOR RECIPES : (","review":"This is a lovely book, with great pictures; however, no nutritional information is listed.

The twists and turns of the plot are neatly matched by the twists and turns of the calles and canals of its location."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent addition to a strong series","review":"This might just be my favorite(so far) in this series, or at least tied with 'Death and Judgement'. The story is immediately engaging and Leon's prose is, as always, excellent. The stories in her mysteries are very well plotted and she's not afraid to critique aspects of a culture she clearly immerses herself with, as deeply flawed. Donna Leon's books have a tendency to both entertain and sadden, because she explores certain possibilities in human behavior and doesn't shy from exposing depravity in even the most innocent seeming people. Very good book and series, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Wax!","review":"I have been using the Meguiar's NXT wax for years.

I liked it at first, but after about 10 uses, the thermostat no longer worked properly and the griddle would seriously overheat in a matter of a few minutes. Since the year warranty had already expired, I could not return it. I never exposed the electrical parts to water, so that is not the cause. I like the size for just one or two people and it is easy to clean because of its small size.

It was terrific, but when I finally dropped it and the plastic handle/supports broke, I realized it was time for a new one. Plus, I was no longer cooking for a crowd, but for just the two of us. With this Liddle Griddle, I'm amazed at how much more precise the temperature control is, and how much more often we use this thing -- often in preference over a skillet, which takes up more room in the dishwasher. (Yes, I said dishwasher.) Though the earlier one could be washed in the dishwasher, it was too big. This one fits easily, and still leaves plenty of room for a day's worth of stuff.

It is of very good quality and I like the ease of cleanup. However, if you plan to have company or are feeding a hungry man--don't get this product. It can only reasonably make two (or maybe three) pancakes at a time. Perfect for single person in an apartment who does not entertain. I wish I would have mapped out the measurements at home prior to purchasing the product. I probably would have seen it was not big enough. The box is deceptively larger with its packing material. However, we are are using it for the occasional one-person toasted cheese sandwiches or other snacks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little appliance!","review":"I purchased this for the sole purpose of making grilled cheese sandwiches, which I have never been able to make right in a skillet. It works great for that, so great that I have found several other uses for it. My only complaint is the lack of clear markings on the thermostat.

Although much of the information presented here is common knowledge to diehard fans, it is still fascinating to read about the evolution of \\"black\\" music, funk, and the Minneapolis sound as it relates to Prince's music.

However, Jones' writing is stylistically poor, making for a frustrating read (and not in a productively challenging way). Her citations (or lack thereof) are also frustrating not only in terms of the interviews (as others have mentioned), but even in her other sources.

Although there was a lot of information about the artist himself and the music industry, the writing style was that of an eight grader. She jumps from subject to subject, not even in chronoligical order. It appeared that she got more information from magazines and television rather than from her \\"long awaited\\" interview. She talks about so many people like we've known them for years. She adds a lot of, what seems like, inside joke humor. Unless you've worked with The Artist, you would have no idea what she's talking about. All in all, if you would like lot's of information on The Artist, read the book. But be prepared for being confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rehash of interviews already given.","review":"If you are a huge fan of the Artist, do not rush out and buy this book.

We have found the Whirley Pop with Peanut Oil to be the best combination for taste and minimizing extra un-popped seeds. We recently decided to explore a healthier alternative than using Peanut Oil so we converted to Oliver Oil. It works well and yields similar results. We purchased this air popper to see what it is like to eliminate the oil and found it to be terrible. It was like eating paper. Plus their were many un-popped seeds and many pieces flying out of the shoot and not landing in our oversized bowl. The air pop recommends that you melt butter to add to your popcorn. We tried it and came to the conclusion that we needed to add more butter (fat & calories) than needed when making popcorn with the Peanut or Olive oil."},{"rating":"1","title":"This popper is a pain!","review":"I ordered this popper because of the price and the air-pop instead of oil feature. Unpopped kernels fly out of the opening and I have to hold the popper back at an angle to prevent so much of the kernels flying out. Also, there are too many kernels unpopped. I will keep it because of the price and the fact that I can get some popped popcorn out of it if I hold it right but I am not too happy with this popper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work as I expected","review":"I followed the recommendation of another reviewer and let the popper heat up some before putting the corn in. Unfortunately, the airflow was so strong that half the kernels got blown out before they could get hot enough, so half the corn was left unpopped. Also, the plastic top part of the popper got too hot to handle.

I just got the air popper today, and after trying it out, I'm extremely disappointed.

Also, it set off my smoke alarms, despite unplugging it the minute the popping was over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"After reading reviews on this popper we bought one at Walmart. We had to search for a box that wasn't damaged and when we unpacked it at home we discovered it did not sit on the counter without rocking. We looked at the bottom and the plate was all bent up. We should have returned it right then but we were anxious to try it out. We used Orville Redenbacher as recommended and followed the directions for how much to put in. It literally threw unpopped kernels all over the kitchen!! At least 1/3 of the corn would not pop. What a mess. I'm still finding kernels in nooks and crannies clear across the kitchen. Presto used to be a trusted name and I believe the popper I had back in the '80's was a Presto and we just loved it. What a disappointment. We boxed it back up and took it back.

That is the machine you want because it has the chamber with the air vent slats in the lower part of the cylinder....coffee beans do not shoot out of that model, and the coffee beans can be stirred as they roast...which is good.Now for the model I'm reviewing, I HAVE NO IDEA HOW WELL IT POPS CORN, but I'm sure much better than coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap","review":"Made very cheaply and popcorn goes everywhere when popping.

We got about 1.5 years out of the popper, which I think is not enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"This popcorn popper was a real letdown! It does pop the corn and it looks delicious with almost every kernel being popped, but the popcorn itself is extremely chewy instead of the light fluffy popcorn I'd grown accustomed to from a microwave... it's truly disappointing! I've since put it away never to be used again and gone back to microwave popcorn again! Btw, I was using Orville Redenbacher's Gourmet Popcorn too, but I'll try another brand before it's forever exiled to the kitchen cabinet never to be seen again! Addtionally, as a Prime Member it took 8 days to actually receive it... Another disappointment!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"Got it about a month ago and we've been using it almost 2 times per week. The popcorn itself (without any seasoning) is very healthy and low calorie, I can eat it plain like this without any problem. My kids like to favor it with butter splitz and some popcorn seasoning. We normally made half of this plain, and the other half with seasoning.

The unit begins and ends working when you place or remove the plug from the socket.Additinally, the plastic guard and hopper can be easily displaced while corn is popping, if it was not seated securely. Good luck trying to recover from that.Just as an asside, I've used butter flavored PAM spray instead of melting butter in the measuring cup, so I can't tell you whether the unit develops enough heat to melt butter.All in all, this is a useful product at a nice price"},{"rating":"2","title":"good popper","review":"it's easy to clean and comes with very simple instructions. however it would be nice if it had an on/off switch instead of having to yank the power cord and beware that popcorn flies everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popcorn maker","review":"Works well and makes great popcorn.

Very easy to clean and use. The only downsides are that there is no actual on/off switch--you plug it in and it starts, it's slightly bulky, and the popcorn does not hold salt on its own. You have to add butter or popcorn oil after popping in order for the salt to stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this purchase","review":"This makes the fluffiest popcorn and even has a little butter melter.

Either the popcorn was all over the floor or else was loaded with oil from cooking it. The Presto Pop-lite is the best one by far makes nice fluffy popcorn with minimal seeds left over and the spout puts most of it in the bowl. Would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes chewy popcorn","review":"I asked for this popper for Christmas based on all the good reviews it got. I have tried more than one brand of fresh, brand new kernels in this machine while following the directions to a \\"T\\". Every batch comes out chewy, not crunchy or fresh as it should. Even the bagged popcorn tastes less stale than popcorn freshly popped in this popper. I was looking for an alternative to microwave popcorn because of the reports lately that the bags release some kind of chemical into the popcorn and also that the microwave bags emit a chemical into the air when popping that can cause something called \\"popcorn lung\\" -- there is actually a lawsuit pending over this against Con Agra foods. Anyway, this popper did not end my search for a quality popcorn popper. I will stick to organic pre-popped popcorn you can find in the chip isle until I find one worth its salt (and butter). A real shame. We'll be selling this popper at a charity garage sale in a couple weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"The popcorn from this machine is great...

I could not be happier. Unlike the Toastmaster, this one actually pops the corn you put into it. There are very few unpopped kernels. The popped corn generally goes into the bowl instead of flying around the room, and it's very fast.If you are comparing hot air poppers, this is the one to pick. I've tried a couple, and this one is the clear winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Popcorn!","review":"We needed a new air popper after we left ours with a family member.

However, I can't recommend this popper for that purpose.With the Presto, the hot air blows at the bottom of the bean chamber with such force that the green bean were flying out of the popper. I added more beans, which kept the air velocity down to the point where the beans stayed in the popper (more or less). The problem with this fix is that the beans in the air flow cooked in a flash, leaving the rest of the beans in the cooking chamber uncooked. I have been using a Poppery II for a few years and wanted to add another roaster to the stable so that roast day went a bit faster (roast one batch while cooling beans and loading the other). I'm going to locate another Poppery II. The only good news is that I can pop some popcorn with an air popper that isn't coated with roasted coffee oils."},{"rating":"1","title":"A crime against man and maize!","review":"I can't believe they still make this atrocity from the 70s.

Blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for roasting coffee beans","review":"I purchased this popper because I wanted to try roasting coffee beans. I realized this was the wrong style of popcorn popper my first attempt at roasting the beans. This style of popper has the air vent at the bottom of the container instead of around the sides. Coffee beans went everywhere but a few did remain and roast. I have since purchased the other style with the side vents...works much better. I will use this popper for....POPCORN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome popcorn popper","review":"I bought this popcorn popper bc I was looking for a wholesome and no fat snack. Thats just what this popper does and more.Theres virtually no cleanup and it pops quickly using fresh popcorn not the box stuff with all the fat and additives.There are 2 cons though: this machine has no on off switch-just plug it in and it is dry popcorn, but what I do, is use the Spray coconut oil found at health food stores about $5 and the \\"all natural\\" Himalayan Sea Salt not the conventional processed sea salt that ain't good for ya.There is a little measuring cup you can use on the popper that will melt butter in while it pops the corn if you decide to go that route. Just remember if kids are involved the popper at time may throw out a HOT kernel, do not pick it up right away bc its HOT! I sent 2 of these as gifts during the Christmas season, can't go wrong! I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blew up after less that ten uses (five days)","review":"This is the second time this happened, in different houses. I bought the second unit, thinking the first must have been an anomaly, and because the popcorn was good. If you like burning electrical wires inside the popper, followed by it's death, you'll love this item. I will never purchase any Presto product again.

It was extremely bland even after adding loads of salt which defeats the purpose. I used some melted butter which helped flavor but within minutes the popcorn was soggy...again not good.

When you pop the corn, 3/4 of it flies out of the popper before it even comes close to popping, due to the fact that the spout doesn't slope downwards enough. You will end up with unpopped kernels everywhere, which are very hot. This thing is cheap for a reason. I really have no idea why it has gotten such good reviews. I beg you: do not buy this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What could go wrong?","review":"What could go wrong with an appliance that's just a heating element and a fan? Well, Presto has found a way.I got maybe 15 pops out of one I bought a year ago. I replaced it - identical model, fool that I am, but it was the only affordable popper on Amazon - and it got only one pop. I had to make it on the stove the old-fashioned way that nightThe popper I replaced about a year ago had worked about five years. It was a Presto, too. But one night it got over-enthusiastic and jumped off the kitchen counter. Shattered the lid, it did.We really like air-popped popcorn. Eat it maybe once a month. I guess I'll try a Discount Tommy's popper next. As for the Presto company: Watch me disappear - PRESTO!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this popper because you can prepare popcorn without the butter or transfats and be guilt free on a diet. My method of making this popper work is quite simple. I put the popcorn into the popper, put the lid onto it, use a very large bowl to capture the popped kernels and plug it in. When it begins to get hot, the air blowing out of it can cause unpopped kernels to blow out into your bowl. Simply tip the front of the unit slightly backwards and let it rest on its back feet. Once it gets to popping pretty steadily you can set it back down and then at the end of the popping cycle, tip it backwards again. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"small disadvantage","review":"Overall I am glad with the Presto 04820 PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper. But there is a small disadvantage that applies to all hot air poppers. Since oil is not used, salt does not stick to popcorn. Then you shoud have an oil spray to aply before pouring salt.

I do not like adding butter to my popcorn, so it works well for me.

I've used it lots since I've got it and each time it makes great popcorn with very few unpopped kernals left over. I recommend to use white popping corn, as it makes a lighter and fluffier popcorn than yellow popping corn.

It popped more kernels into the bowl than my old popper but it was OK.What earned it a one star review is that the motor died after only a year. That's too flimsy.The popper that gave hot air poppers a good name is the Wearever Popcorn Pumper. That product is no longer manufactures but you can find it used on the web. I just got mine and wow! What a difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for an air popper","review":"This is good for an air popper but don't expect the same as oil popped.

Boy what I would give to resurrect the old pumper!! The first problem is that this popper is built with the airflow straight up so it blows unpopped kernels out into the bowl. The second problem is that it has such low airflow (necessary due to the direction) that it doesn't get the popped kernels out into the bowl so they build up and scorch. Add to that the fact that, again due to the airflow direction, it pushes a large number of unpopped kernels out with the popped corn. Then add that the butter melting container is also the corn measuring cup, so you need to stop and wash it between every batch. The butter melting cup is plastic, instead of aluminum like the WearEver, so it doesn't have good heat conduction and won't melt butter that isn't already half melted.Overall, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor caught on fire after only one month of use!","review":"Buyer beware!

This one is incredible, in fact, we purchased 3!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"The quality of the popped corn is ok. However, getting to that point is annoying. It has no on/off switch, it is controlled by plugging in the unit. Before it reaches a temperature that starts the kernals to pop, the unpopped kernals are being spit out the tube and thrown all over the kitchen. If you have cats it keeps them entertained. The heat is not limited only to the inside of the unit, it radiates a lot of heat. If you're looking for an air popper I suggest you keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"presto air popper","review":"The air popper works like a charm. The popcorn is fluffy and like the ease of use. I give these as gifts too. Stores easily and doesn't take up much room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Although some debri flies around a bit at first, this popper is soooo simple, and it definitely has less kernels in the bowl after it is done. If there were complaints it would be that there is no power button, and I am not sure why the design is to plug the cord in to turn the unit off and then to pull out the cord when you are done popping. In theory I guess that could be a safety hazard for keeping sure that the popper is not on and popping when you are asleep or not home, but most items have a power button and some sort of safety shut off.Still, WELL worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice!!!","review":"Bought for my husband at Christmas. He loves it and uses it very often. Nice and very easy to use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally - a popper that works!","review":"I am an avid backyard birder, and my outside birds love popped popcorn. Purchasing microwave popcorn was getting expensive, so I purchased one of those microwave popcorn bowls. The bowl lid burned after one use, and the bowl became horribly stained - not to mention that half of the kernals were left unpopped. I purchased the Presto 04820, and I was so relieved at how efficiently it worked, with nearly every kernal popped! I have used it on average of four times per day since I purchased it, and it keeps on delivering time after time. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Customer!","review":"My old popcorn popper used to pop about 50% of the corn kernels.

I will never buy microwave popcorn nor will I cook it again on the stove. Even without butter and salt the popcorn is tasty. Very healthy and money saving. Excellent buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after 2 uses","review":"I bought this item due to the reviews here. We had considered the Cuisinart popper, but it had horrible reviews. Well, the first time we used the Presto, it was fine although VERY loud! Because of the reviews, I was prepared for the popcorn flying out, so we used only 1/3 cup of kernels and the resulting popcorn was great. Second time, perhaps more unpopped kernels, but still the popcorn was good. Last night my husband plugged it in and no bueno. The thing is dead. Good thing it's only $20 or so, but what a piece o' crap! Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto PopLite Hot Air Popper","review":"I purchased this product and its performance has been above all my expectations.

We used to always eat microwave popcorn, but after hearing that the butter in the microwave popcorn is not healthy. I was looking for a popper.

Now I can enjoy the movie with healthy popcorn,"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorite kitchen gadgets","review":"I looove this. It's so easy and fun to make beautifully crisp and healthy popcorn this way. I use an oil sprayer to add a little something for the salt and seasonings to stick to.

Everyone needs one of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"solution for one conn to this popcorn popper.","review":"there are a couple of conns to this product in which were already discussed in the previous reviews. now this is a really good popcorn popper and I do like it, but the the problems it has are a little annoying.tilting the the machine and covering the funnel with a kitchen towel work perfect for the flying kernals. even though it's something you shouldn't have to do, it's not that big of a deal since it takes only a minute to pop the popcorn.however not having an on/off switch is. at first I thought it would go off automatically but it doesn't. I let it run way past after the the popcorn was popped. so I bought a single outlet with an on/off switch (make sure it handles the volts and wattage) that you plug into the wall, it cost $3.00. it would be a wise to do, I don't think it's to safe to unplug anything while it's still running."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost perfect","review":"Does what it is supposed to do for a low price. Makes great, healthy popcorn and is super easy to clean up. There are quite a few more un-popped kernels than I had expected. The air is strong enough that when only a few kernels remain, it blows them up and out of the chamber. Otherwise, it is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution!

I was looking forward to using this and not having to worry about the dangers of microwave popcorn that have been on the news recently. We followed directions and tried to pop our corn, but to no avail, the popper did not pop! We called customer service and they said we received a broken machine. Such a drag! I hate having to pack everything up and go to the post office. I thought that was the point of shopping on line...to save time. Not so!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, SAFE popper!","review":"This 80s-style popcorn popper is pretty awesome. For starters, it does not catch fire and you don't smell burnt plastic when you turn it on (unlike my last one.)

Finally, it churns out a great, healthy bowl of popcorn in a quick and easy manner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor burned out after 6 weeks","review":"The motor burned out after six weeks of use. I probably used it about 10 times. When it was working it worked well but it should last much longer. It seemed cheap when I bought it so I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Popcorn popper","review":"Works well and efficiently. Just plug in and it'll pop on its own. The reason its a 4 star and not a 5 is because the top butter melting cup does not work very well. Luckily its microwavable and that'll melt any pieces of butter. Also, if you are only trying to pop a smaller bowl, a lot of kernels will come flying out without being popped. I'd say under 1/4 cup of kernels inside will lead to quite a few shooting out unpopped. Anything more pops greats, fluffy, popcorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"The top melted.","review":"My partner and I were looking for a healthy alternative to cook our popcorn without oil. We bought this unit about less than a month ago and noticed that the top plastic part was warping. Eventually, the top portion including the butter tray bubbled and melted. We followed the instructions and never used less than the measuring cup provided. Now, I'm wondering if all the popcorn we ate was tainted with plastic.

They can be worked around. I have the Presto microwave popper also. I have to say that the microwave popper produces more moist popcorn. I use it more than this hot air popper because it pops a serving size that suits my needs. The price is great for this air popper. I do use it once in a while if I have the need for more volume in the case that I'm making it for more than one person. Just beware of the screamin' hot kernels that it can unpop out."},{"rating":"2","title":"workd great","review":"Poplite Hot Air Corn Popper works great.

( and I shop online A LOT)! it was shipped it it's actual box only, nothing to protect it, so to no surprise the box is tore open! For the eight bucks they charge for shipping it was a joke! I'd rather pay more so they can spring for at least bubble wrap and masking tape! Just received it today so I have yet to see if it works. It would be a miracle if it does! We got it for a gift, I am embarrassed to give a box looking like this, so to avoid the hassle of returning and hoping I get the gift in time I'm heading to Target! Be wary ordering from here, unless u enjoy getting broken items in the mail. I'm giving it 2 stars on the chance it may work when I plug it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice popper","review":"We had this same Presto popcorn popper before and it was great. It simply died out after four years of solid use. It works well, pops most of the kernals, and keeps the popcorn in the container as long as it's big enough.

I am completely happy with the popper...does what it is supposed to do. The bad reviews were mainly about corn flying everywhere...you need a large, deep bowl to catch the corn..then you won't have this problem...I think it even states this in the directions. Other reviews complained of the plain taste....this is an air popper...that is the point...to be able to pop plain popcorn without all the oil and butter...if that's what you want, you might as well stick with microwave popcorn. I spray mine with low cal. butter flavored spray and sprinkle it with salt....doesn't taste like movie theater popcorn...but it is a tasty, healthy alternative...and that is what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows Unpopped Kernels Out","review":"I ordered this based on the claims that it leaves virtually no unpopped kernels. Well, it blows quite a few out. I returned it. I did try the instructions in the most helpful review and I still got unpopped kernels. If I use the large, expensive, gourmet kernels, and hold and tilt the popper back while it's on, it does pop more of the kernels. But, that's a pain, and the unpopped kernels start flying at the end of the popping, when there aren't as many popped kernels to keep them from flying out.Also, why does this popper shoot air up from the bottom - which makes the kernels more likely to fly out - instead of having the air come in from the side, as other air poppers do?I'm going to try buy an old black & decker model on Ebay where the kernels pop in a container with slots that keep the kernels from flying out. PS. I bid a lot on one auction that ends dec - 21."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great popcorn, don't understand other people's problems","review":"This is a great, inexpensive hot air popcorn popper. Measure your popcorn using the built-in scoop, plug it in, wait five minutes, eat popcorn.We do not have very many unpopped kernels. Nor do we have popcorn flying everywhere. We use Safeway-brand popcorn, which happens to be the cheapest stuff on the shelf .Some people (including the adults in this family) prefer kettle-popped corn. If this is the case, look at the Stir Crazy brand-we have the 6-quart model available here on Amazon. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is that we prefer kettle corn-it is, well, crispier and crunchier. But our daughter likes hot-air popcorn. So if you like hot-air popcorn, this is all you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"This machine never popped one kernal.","review":"I preheated. I measured. I timed. I tipped to 30 degrees and waited. I waited. I waited more than 5 minutes and NOTHING happened.The machine became a bit warm on the outside but never hot enough on the inside to pop anything.Nothing.

At least I can return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of popcorn","review":"We LOVE that it can make so much popcorn at once and all of the kernals popped.

I am not as fond of pouring it onto the popcorn afterwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burns out easily","review":"Pops popcorn great. Only problem is...we just bought it 2 months ago and it burned out. We had the same one before and it lasted about 3 months. Not sure why it does that. 2 in the last 6 months is ridiculous. We don't use it daily so it should last much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S SO GOOD I CANNOT STOP EATING POP CORN","review":"Yes this pop corn popper is very, very, very good. And the price is unbeatable! I am going to try to stop making pop corn every night. That is how good this machine is. I wouldn't be making it every night if it were not a good machine. Every time I make it, it comes out perfect. And only a kernel or two are not popped. It is just a fantastic machine. But I got to try to slow down on making pop corn and eating it. I've been doing it each night since I got this popper in the mail. Don't buy it if you don't want to be addicted to pop corn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light & Fluffy Popcorn","review":"I love this corn popper. It produces great popcorn without the greasy calories and yucky, oversalted taste of packaged microwave popcorn. Since the corn is basically taste-free, I have the freedom to dress it up however I choose. It's fun to make different flavors; barbeque spice one day, onion salt the next. I've even drizzled on a little melted caramel and sprinkled in a few nuts to make caramel corn. Have fun experimenting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until it burned out...","review":"Bought this in September 2010, and now after probably 20 uses and 10 months later it's dead. Like others, it nearly caught fire and had a burning smell upon entering its death throes.CAUTION: I think that what kills this obviously cheap product is putting too much popcorn into the unit.. it seems to be very unforgiving about this condition, and I think that may have contributed to the problem. Then again, could just be that it's plain flimsy and prone to dying. Going to go with a different brand for the replacement. Recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like Chewy Popcorn","review":"Not as good as the reviews tell you. We were excited to receive this product and the popper works great in one department i.e., it pops all the kernels very quickly. A half cup unpopped kernels produces a large bowl of pop corn which is good. However, all the popcorn is extremely chewy. We tried 3 different brands of kernels include organic kernels but every batch was so chewy that it was in-edible for us. Moreover, once the corn pops, since this is air popped, there is no way to add salt or condiments that sticks to corn - hence resulting in bland chewy pop corn how much ever salt you try to add. An oil popper is better in this respect since salt and condiments can stick and pop corn is much crispier. We gave up and ended up returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun popcorn for the children!","review":"If you enjoy popcorn and like good family fun with the kids, then this is a must buy product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what we wanted","review":"Popper works great!

There's got to be a better product out there for the popcorn enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing has a mind of it's own","review":"After seeing how many stars this product got and reading some positive reviews, I was surprised at how well it did NOT work. I've only used it 2 or 3 times and each time at least half of the kernels came flying out of the machine unpopped. Very hot unpopped kernels and popcorn go flying in all directions.

Oh, or perhaps your wife or husband... and family, if you have one. The reason I don't use butter is because butter is made of approximately 15%-20% water. That's why buttered popcorn is always soggy. I know, that soybean oil isn't the healthiest stuff in the world. I said nothing about health... I only said it would taste good.

The kernels were fresh, naturally moist, we store them in an air tight container or the refrigerator so they don't dry out.

You have to plug it in to turn it on and unplug it to turn it off - that just seems antiquated to me. I do not recommend this popcorn maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is melting","review":"It makes great popcorn but the yellow part is melting with little bubbles or pebbling texture.

Great job, Presto!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes \\"chewy\\" popcorn","review":"I bought this air popper due to all the 5 star reviews, yet am disappointed in the texture of my popcorn. Everything about this machine is fine, but half my popcorn is unenjoyable due to it being \\"chewy\\". I've tried other brands of kernals, but it comes down to the popcorn being air popped...it dries out the popcorn after it is popped or something. Does anyone else have this issue, or are you just not as picky about your popcorn? I like my popcorn to \\"melt in your mouth\\" after the first crunchy bite. Cooking it with this popper however, flattens and compacts it into a small hard bit comparable to cardboard. I never had this problem cooking the kernals on the stove top in a big pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed!","review":"So many good reviews, but I was disapointed with this popcorn air popper.I bought organic popcorn from Trader Joe's which is a great popcorn.But in this popper it looked good, but went flat when we started eating the popcorn!It was Chewy, full of air, and did not have that crisp bite taste like the movie popcorn,orthe other type of popper that cooks on the stove.Soooo Chewy it stuck to our teeth!I returned this Poplite air corn popper.I'm now thinking of buying the one that I would put on the stove, and turn the handle thatAmazon sells."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peice of C","review":"I had another make of air popper for decades until the motor wore out.

Then poof, it was blown out....faulty wiring?...I don't know. I owned a hot air popper before, so I knew how to use one.

I think it is a good value. The only problem I had was that the top flew off the first time I used it (without butter in the top), and seemed a bit loose, so I have since weighted it down. I have not had any problems with popcorn going anywhere but into the bowl. Really fast results. I have had no leftover kernels. Air popped corn is certainly not as tasty as oil popped corn or microwave popcorn, and salt does not cling, but it is obviously healthier and has nothing to do with this machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"The corn popper is great!

I agree with other reviewers - you have to be careful as hot kernels do jump out at the beginning and end of popping.It is smaller than previous poppers I've had which is nice.

She has fond childhood memories of a Presto air popper and was quite gleeful when it first went into action.The device does exactly what is expected to - it makes boatloads of popcorn and without needing anything but electricity.If you put a full measure of kernels in this thing by the way, make sure you have a darned big bowl handy to catch the results - or a spare. We usually under measure a bit, as it is very easy to make more anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Popper","review":"After 18 years with my last air popper, it was nice to get this great popper.

So I figured I would buy a hot air popper to get away from the all the microwave crap. I bought this along with some organic popcorn and it was delivered today. I wanted to try it out, so I just put a little bit in. It did spew out some kernels while heating and then again during the popping process and left a few unpopped. No biggie. Try some organic coconut oil in lieu of butter and you have a tasty, healthy snack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"After doing my due research, and seeing the positive reviews Amazon had on this product, I purchased it for my wife, she and I are both very happy with it, it pops a full 1/2 cup of kernels very quickly ~2 minutes. excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto doesn't disappoint :-)","review":"Just got this today and what I don't understand is how the price changes almost by the hour(?).

Firtst day I had it out and made popcorn. Now I take popcorn to work everyday to snack on so I don't eat chips. Love the no salt, no butter snack.

Glad I thought of the air popper because I missed eating popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick; Tends to Dry Out Popcorn","review":"This popper can quickly make a large batch of popcorn. Kids love seeing the popcorn flying out of the popper and into the bowl! Cleanup is a snap; just dump any unpopped kernals into the trash. It uses no oil, resulting in more healthy popcorn. However, I think the hot air tends to dry out the popcorn a bit. It's nothing a little butter can't fix, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for an easy everyday snack","review":"We began cooking popcorn on our stovetop to save money and avoid buying processed microwave popcorn. As this is our go-to snack, we bought this thinking it would be not only a well used appliance, but also a time saver. So far, it has been both. It does not have an on off switch--you just plug it it to start, but this doesn't seem to be that much of a problem. The built in butter tray, we have only used once, as we typically don't add butter to our popcorn. For the sake of the review, we did try it and found it less useful. You have to have room-temp butter to start or it will not melt quickly enough. We ended up finishing the butter melting process on the stove. Again, not much of a problem for us, but if you like butter popcorn, it is something to consider. The appliance is very light weight and fairly small. It is also very easy to wash. Over all, we have been very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"The Presto PopLite Hot Air Corn Popper works just as advetised. We have used the popcorn maker five or six times so far and it has worked great. The butter melter on the top even works, which I never thought it wood. It pops almost all the kernels leaving only one or two unpopped. I would recommend the Presto Poplite to anyone who likes popcorn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, cheap popcorn maker","review":"I used to have the microwavable popcorn but after reading a book about the dangers of microwaving food, I through my microwave in the garbage. Plain popcorn with a small sprinkle of sea salt is a somewhat healthy snack and it's very filling. I like to eat popcorn 2-3 times a week as a nighttime snack and this popcorn maker has worked great for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Chemical Odor","review":"As soon as I unpacked it, the smell hit me . . . like chemical-coated plastic. I washed the plastic parts and let the machine air out on my counter for a few days. When I used it, it worked great. All the popcorn popped. No problem. But the smell had transferred itself to the popcorn so you could taste it. And the odor lasted for hours in my house. If you want popcorn made in what smells like a toxic waste dump, go for it. I'm returning mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just adding another positive review ~","review":"Works great. I've never had any issues. Just make sure to empty any unpopped kernels afterwards. I wish there was an on off switch, but I think you are supposed to turn over and shake out any kernels after each popping, so you really need to unplug it anyway. If you could just leave it in one spot plugged in, then maybe some people wouldn't turn it over to empty them then burn the next batch.Just wait until the unit is warmed up (2-3 minutes) then put in kernels and unplug once there is about 3 seconds since the last pop. Usually 3-6 kernels will be left. Oh, and beware. One scoop of kernels makes a LOT of popcorn. Make sure you have a back up bowl ready just in case! (First time I popped, the bowl filled and then popped kernels started going everywhere! My Corgi benefited from it though! And he likes the popcorn apparently).Great way for a vegan to enjoy popcorn without using oil! Oh, and Earth Balance melts just as well as butter in the little plastic tray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like I remembered...","review":"Other than being a bit quieter, this air-popper works just like the one I had 20 years ago - great! Now we can eat fresh popcorn that is much healthier and cheaper than that microwave stuff, and add the toppings just as we like! You can use the little cup on the top to melt the butter while the popcorn is popping, but it takes too long in my experience. I just use the cup to measure the popcorn kernels, and then I do microwave the butter in a separate cup! Tip: if you get a lot of kernels flying out uncooked in the beginning, just drop them back in the hopper - they will pop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just as well as any popper I've had","review":"Works just as well as any popper I've had. Works just as well as Orville Redenbacher Presto but for half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works!","review":"It's a great little popper but there is no on/off switch so you have to plug it in each time you use it. The measuring cup on the top should only be used for measuring because it won't melt butter. I just melt butter in the microwave while the popcorn is popping. Air-popped popcorn with butter and salt is delicious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto 04820 Poplite Hot air corn popper","review":"Does a great job. Love it because I do not want to use oil. Much healthier.

Its even great if you don't care about the low fat. Pops almost every kernal and they are twice the size of oil poppers or microwave methods. The longer shoot also keeps the popcorn in the bowl where it belongs. Plus its done in minutes - quicker than the microwave! If you bag it or place it in tupperware it keeps fresh for days...so fresh I've had people comment \\"Who just made popcorn?\\"Since its so light & fluffy its also easy on sensitive teeth too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great air popper for no oil popcorn","review":"If you are looking for a way to eat no fat popcorn, then this is the popper for you. I had the previous model; it lasted for years after several uses a day. This is usually not the case for economical appliances that get very hot, but this one did. It makes great air popped popcorn which is much healthier than it's oil based counterpart, although at first it might seem a little dry. All in all, this is a great air popper for a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, economical popper","review":"It pops your corn kernels. Actually, it does a pretty good job of it - there are not many unpopped kernels left. My biggest problem with it is the lack of an off switch - you have to unplug it to stop it. Also, make sure to not overfill the basin (there is a line marked inside, which makes it very easy) - the popper will overheat and shut off. The first time I did that I thought I broke it, but once it cooled down it work again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went Back To Using A Simple Popper","review":"Recently I purchased this unit at a local store to replace my ca10yr old, inexpensive, Nordic Ware microwave popcorn popper. Probably because of overcooking during those years, the inside bottom started blistering.

I tried using a more expensive brand of popcorn, but that didn't help any.Have boxed up the air-popper, and purchased another Nordic Ware microwave popper. The microwave popper doesn't pop all the kernels, but it's popped corn sure tastes better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates a mess when used","review":"Wish this was designed such a way that the pop corn fell straight into a bowl.

It's really simple to use and makes light airy popcorn every time. Also, compared to other options this is much tastier and healthier since you make the popcorn without any butter and oils and you can control how much is used in it. Another advantage is, compared to microwaveable popcorn, the cost is much cheaper to make per serving, especially if you pick up the kernels on sale.Tips:- Keep the machine running until you stop hearing the popcorn pop after a few seconds.- Make sure you don't put too many kernels in or else the air won't be able to push them up and the kernels will burn. Put a max of the top cup in.- Personally, I don't use the top cup to melt the butter, if you use butter put in a microwaveable dishwashable bowl and pop in the microwave while it cooks. That way cleanup is easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Engineering Design","review":"The fan is so forceful that half of the kernels are ejected before they pop!

I have not used another electric sharpener, but it beats using a sharpening stone and sharpening stick because it resharpens the blade and alters its cutting angle while simplifying the whole process. This sharpener is not difficult to use, but you have to \\"find the groove\\" when you are running your knives over the stones. As you use it, it resharpens your blade to a perfect edge. This is great, because many knives do not come with a properly angled blade out of the box. As instructed, I run the blades through each slit 3 or 4 times.

This is a great sharpener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"I've used it on maybe a dozen knives and it has worked well and produced a nice sharp edge.Some knives it works better on than others for some reason.My only wish is that there was a better way to ensure that the exact angle was consistently used.It's kind of up to you to hold the knife well aligned with the slot.Without consistency you may not be sharpening the actual edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is AWSOME","review":"For our wedding we got a really nice kitchen knife set, but then a few years have gone by and I have not always had the best sharpening ritual. It got to the point that most of the knifes were useless and I had considered doing what my parents have done and get them professionally sharpened until I saw the price. I saw this online with great reviews and took a chance and I couldn't be happier. My knives went from useless to brand new in just a few minutes. I have recommended this to all of my family members. Don't hesitate to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good","review":"I've used this only once to sharpen all my knives and they are sharp.

Absolutely great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Budget brilliance.","review":"A great sharpener for the price. I turned an old, dull and even deeply chipped knife into a fine piece of cutlery as if it were brand new and even better. It has also worked great on a few pocket knives and a thrower as well. 4 stars has been given because it will slow and even stop with quite a bit less than heavy pressure applied.

Don't use it on serrated knives as it's not meant for that. Use it on smooth knives. It works really well but you must be patient as you sharpen as it does take a little while to do each knife properly. If you rush it, you may stop the motor (not good). This will save you money in the long run as your knives will have extended life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharp Knifes!!","review":"It does take a bit more metal off than I would have thought but damn are my knifes sharp!!!!!

While I experienced the motor stall \\"issue\\" it really is because these people aren't using the product correctly. The knife rests right in the slots no pressure is required, if you push down it will stall. After my first try the usage was pretty apparent and it performed well. I sharpened 10 knives in around 10 minutes and they went from completely dull to able to cut tomatoes with little effort.Definitely worth the purchase if you need a sharpener for your lower quality knives and you don't want to spend a lot of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knife sharpener","review":"It's exactly what I wanted.... reasonably priced, takes up very little space, easy to use but most of all works very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"the Best!","review":"I ordered this item for my daughter in law.

It work great but constant use took its toll. Last week I tried to use it and the motor wouldn't turn. Investigation showed that vibration in the engine had caused it to break two of its 4 mounting points. These are just simple screws into very thin plastic. Thus one of the grinding wheels was touching the internal casing. It must have been coming loose for a while as the vibration had bent the shaft slightly which means the whole thing runs out of balance.

The box was slightly crunched. It works perfectly. You have to go slow, hold your knife level, & don't use pressure making smooth passes for it to be effective.

Perfectly affordable and it gives you a big bang for your buck. You'll drag out every knife and sharpen everything in your house after you use this thing once. It has a primary sharpener on the left to really grind down the edge and then on the right you have a finishing sharpener to really fine tune the edge. It's nice and small as well so it doesn't take up a lot of space in your kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Awesome Awesome!!!!!","review":"After reading countless reviews of every kind of knife sharpener i decided on this one for my dads birthday. For dinner that night we had ham and Lamb. All my dads knives were dull and had not been sharpened in years. So needless to say before we cut the meat we sharpened his knives. This took no time at all even though they had not been sharpened in so long. WOW what a difference. It sure is a lot safer cutting anything with a sharp knife than it is with a dull one. My brother in law who cut the meat was so impressed he is going to buy one and i am going to pick one up also. For the price vs peformance you can't beat it. This is one of those products that after you got it you wonder how you did without for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amaizing sharpener","review":"I love knives and have owned several types of sharpeners from whet stones to hi tec diamond ones. This one really worked great and doesn't even cost much. After using this one I threw out my other sharpener. It gets the knives razor sharp in just a few minutes -- just as the other reviews say. One warning though is that the slots for the sharpener are great for kitchen knives but larger hunting knives will not fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everdull unless you want to do more work.","review":"Got this sharpener as a gift just recently. Was looking for something to sharpen a few knives quicker than using a stone. Well I have to say it works to get the edge ground but the fine wheel is way too course. I sharpened my pocket knife per the instructions and it has a good rough edge at a good angle but now I need to work it with a stone to finish sharpening it. If I have to use a stone to finish what was the point of the sharpener. My recomendation is the sharpener should have a much finer finishing stone. It is a good product for getting a knife started but not for finsihing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto 08800 sharpener","review":"Works good for the price.

I read the directions prior to use and decided to sharpen my knives. When I was done, I think my knives were sharper before I sharpened them.

Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get such great reviews?","review":"This is one of the worst sharpeners I've ever used. Just about any pressure at all stalls the motor, so it takes a lot of patience to sharpen any knife, and in my opinion a novice with a stone can do a better job. As a matter of fact I got one of those tri stone sharpeners here and was able to do a better job on a knife in less time. I also have one of those very simple sharpeners that you just scrape down the blade and that does a better job in less time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this lemon","review":"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this sharpener over the Thanksgiving Day weekend thinking it would sharpen my Henckel knives.

My only complaints are un-uniform edges (IE, the end wasn't as sharp), but I think that has more to due with the operator's experience (me) instead of the device itself, because as I've tried it again it's getting better.It takes some getting used to how to \\"properly\\" run knives through it.At any rate my knives are sharp as could be.

I even tried it on one of my $$$$ knifes I was a little worried about doing it but took a big chance and this sharpener worked fantastic on it. I've read some reviewers saying that the motor will stop when sharping well that's because there is to much force being put on the grinding wheels. you only need the weight of the knife against the wheels any more then that the wheels will stop. the motor on this is very quiet running and seems well made this is the best money I've spent on a sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as hoped","review":"I have had this sharpener for a little over a year. I was hoping that I would get better at using it or that it would \\"break in\\" so to speak, because I could never get the great edge I wanted with this. I hate sitting around sharpening my knives on a stone or using leather just to get the cheap kitchen knives sharp again, so I thought this would be faster.Perhaps the grinding wheels on my machine are not matched up to the right angle or something but my knives never get that sharp no matter how careful I am.The basic premise of this type of sharpener is that you use slot 1 to get a good coarse sharpness and then you move over to side 2 to really touch it up. When I use side 1, I get a pretty decent \\"file type\\" edge on the blade but then when I move it to side 2 it seems to clean up the edge a bit but also leaves it duller than side 1.I'm going to order the accusharp hand sharpener and see if it works better. It's alot cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great. Could use a little more power, but it works great.","review":"Sharpened up our knives as soon as we got it. It worked great.

This is an absolute piece of garbage and unless you want your knives to be destroyed stick with hand sharpening or find a better auto sharpener."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is brutal...sharpening or cutting","review":"I bought this knife sharpener after reading so many positive reviews. Using electricity was also a good appeal to me.When I tried this sharpener with my German knives... the sharpener cut (and removed) so much of the blades. It's not sharpening... it's cutting the blades. Now my German knives have blades brutally damaged by this sharpener. I stopped using this sharpener and put it inside my kitchen drawer.If you're sharpening cheap knives, this is a good choice. Each time, you simply cut more and more of the dull blades to make them sharper. If you want to sharpen more expensive kitchen knives, look elsewhere. Chef's Choice 464 will be a good alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"Works pretty good and quick.

This middle grade sharpens no better than the cheap ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool guy's toy","review":"Fact: motorized knife sharpeners appeal to males in a very primal manner. The face of every dude I've shown this thing off to has lit up as soon as I fired it up and brought back to life a dull, unused knife that had been collecting dust in the drawer. Let's reflect on the product's guy-appealing virtues: it's an electronic gadget, it fixes things that would otherwise need to be discarded and purchased anew, & it involves knives. So, bro and dad loved it; mom and sis could have cared less. No, it doesn't restore your knife to it's fatory-fresh sharpness--you'll need to take your knives to a professional for that--and it'll only sharpen a very specific type of serrated knife (those 'ever-sharp' kind with the tiny teeth cannot be worked on by this machine), but this little guy does what it's supposed to do quite well. This machine pays itself back after a few sharpenings and more than justifies its cost due to its gadget factor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpens Poorly","review":"I'm not sure whats going on here. Maybe I received a bad sharpener with bad wheels. I used this on some old dull cheap knives and it did nothing to improve their edge.

Now I can enjoy cooking pretty much anything no matter how much chopping/cutting is entailed.I have some very nice higher end chef's knives because I assumed they would keep an edge for a long time.

We're not professional chefs, but we cook every night, so having sharp knives is quite nice. I have no complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband loves this thing!","review":"Great buy. My husband love to sharpen knives. This was a gift for him. He keeps my kitchen knives sharpened now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Razor sharp","review":"Great knife sharpener. Quick and easy to use.

Delicious animals beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Pro EverSharp Electric Knife Sharpener","review":"The wife is delighted with this sharpener. Goal number one thereby accomplished. She reports that knives sharpened with this sharpener are very sharp. She finds it easy to use. I noticed it was fairly quiet. The compact size means it is easy to store when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"presto knife sharpener","review":"I bought five for Christmas presents, and my friends are really happy, as most do not have a good knife sharpener. They tell me for once, they have sharp knives in the kitchen. I replaced my 10 year old presto sharpener with one of these, and it works good, but be easy on the pressure, because this sharpener will remove some steel from your knife, quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy","review":"I never write on these but do not buy this. There's no power behind it I placed my knife in it and it stopped the wheel"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruins knives","review":"This electric sharpener seemed to bring some life back to my knives (which were badly dull), but I noticed recently it left a ripple pattern along every blade. This is affecting my ability to sharpen using more conventional needs. I would stay away from this product and get an inexpensive manual sharpener instead - your knives will be just as sharp without marring your blade's edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destroys your blade","review":"For old knives in desperate need of a completely new cutting edge, this works fine. For anything else, this absolutely destroys your blade. Followed the instructions extremely carefully, using only the fine sharpening side to do some touch up work on some of my Ginsu knives. Literally took an 1/8\\" off the blade. You can see the ridge where it slopes in from the back now, as I couldn't get the very last end of the blade through the wheels. My knives have never been the same, I'm probably going to have to get new ones. Take the time to sharpen by hand; your steel will thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite right","review":"I purchased this product based on the reviews here at Amazon. My knives are sharper, but not AS sharp as I would like. They don't squish tomatoes when I try to slice them anymore though... so I guess I am happy enough. They're just not razor sharp. I would still recommend this to someone who wants a decently sharp knife and does not know how to use a sharpening stone or steel (I never had much luck with them.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it me or the machine","review":"I bought this machine due to good reviews. My knifes are more worse than before. It ruin one of my knife. I followed and read the instructions over and over(there's not much to read). I tried to sharpen again and again, and nothing works. Finally, I gave up, and had to return for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infant tested and approved","review":"Followed all the directions multiple times and, though I didn't think it was possible to dull my knives any more, I was sadly proven wrong. If you need to kid proof your cutlery this will do it. Gutless motor and not worth the cost of returning it. Even if I was of a mind to slit my wrists in frustration my knives are now all so dull that that wouldn't be possible. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, Why send me a broken beat up box?","review":"I bought this product for my husband for Christmas. I know that the product already works well so I knew it was a good deal. It finally came in the mail today, a day late and when I opened up the Amazon box everything was in great condition but the box to this product. And when I mean dented it looked like someone threw it around and stomped on it. I am so disappointed in the quality I received for a present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I know there are lots of reviews for this product. I have a hard time believing the really good reveiws.My expectations were low, but this machine suprised me still. It stalls out frequently when trying to sharpen. Mine shut itself off and wouldn't turn back on after ten minutes of total use. I had to take it apart to repair it. It is very cheaply made. It does its job, but it is extremely cheap.Buyer beward"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go ahead if you want to destroy your knife","review":"The quickest way to destroy a decent knife is by using this \\"sharpener\\".

I'm thinking the reviews must be a fraud because I ruined some really nice knives using this piece of garbage. A complete waste of money at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even for amateurs","review":"This was an impulse buy, and as most impulse buys, was not a good choice. I can sharpen knives on stones fairly well, however I bought this contraption, thinking my wife can use it in the kitchen, saving me the aggravation of sharpening her knives. The stones in this machine are farily coarse and because of that, leave a ragged edge.

This sharpener works great! Knives are now sharp like new! Because my knives were so worn, I had to run them through several times, not the 3 or 4 times like the directions say. Works exactly as I expected - and much cheaper than buying new sets of knives.Note - the device is supposes to catch the dust (metal, stone) from the grinding so that you can pull out the plug on the bottom and dump it. I noticed some gets on the countertop near the sharpener too. Just FYI - move food away and wipe up when you are done."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"This knife sharpener works like a dream.

I love this thing!! It is a bit noisy but I don't mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly acceptable to sharpen straight edge knives","review":"As stated by other commenters, if you pressed too hard to stone will stop. But you don't have to press hard, just enough so that your knife is steady. I have sharpened one cheap knife and one more expensive one and they both turned out pretty good. Beats carrying a knife in your purse to the sharpening shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I Expected","review":"I was skeptical about the edge this (or any) machine could produce on my kitchen knives. However, this machine operated as advertised and I am pleased. Some reviewers mentioned that it was easy to slow or stop the grinding wheels by pressing down on the knife; however, only gentle pressure is recommended (and the motor handles that nicely). I suspect the designers deliberately designed the wheels to stop if heavy pressure is applied in order to prevent overheating the knife blade and ruining the temper. Patience is the key with this machine. Six or so passes on each of the 4 wheels gave my knives a very acceptable sharp edge. As good as I can do with a wet-stone? Well, no, but in a fraction of the time and with no oil or messy stone to deal with. As the users' guide and other reviewers have noted, be sure to wash the knife blade and the counter surface to remove the fine dust that is normal residue left after sharpening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magnificent Pinnacle of Vampire Anthologies!","review":"Delicate and intricate as hand woven lace, or a black widow's web, Dreams of Decadence is a work of art. 21 stories and 19 poems expose us to the eternal night of the vampire, but these are not typical Anne Rice vampires or cookie cutter Count Draculas. Every single story gives us some variation on the undead mythos. This anthology contains vampires that are very ancient and some newly born; vampires made by birth, virus, and even bites; vampires that can walk during the day and some that can only come out at night.If you wish only to read about the vampires featured in popular role playing games and television series, or the vampire of the Anne Rice mythos, then look elsewhere. However, if you want a wide variety of thrilling, beautiful, and interesting tales than know that the cost of this book is a small price to pay for this gossamer glimpse into the midnight realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book","review":"This book was fun.

It harkens to the 60's and 70's. It is well done with interesting back-up that says the musicians are mainly country oriented. She shows potential as a performer.

This album very well put together and has a nice mixture of fast and slow songs. Puff Daddy (and B.I.G.) were on to something when they found these guys. They are really good together. Please, don't mess things up and try to go solo. Some things are better left alone. Adding the hip hop style to some of the songs (Lil'Kim and 8-ball & MJG) was a nice touch.

Songs Deserved More Airplay","review":"112 did a good job with this cd. The best songs are \\"anywhere\\", \\"stay with me\\", \\"someone to hold\\", and \\"all my love\\". It's such a shame that the only song they released on the radio was \\"anywhere\\" and that other song featuring Mase.

While songs like the overplayed \\"Love Me\\", \\"Love You Like I Did\\", and \\"Your Letter\\" are off the hook they cannot make up for the mediocre \\"The Only One\\", \\"Anywhere\\", \\"For Awhile\\", \\"Whatcha Gonna Do\\" and the seemingly endless Interludes. Many of the songs where poorly produced, in my opinion, using the Sugar Hill Gang's \\"Eighth Wonder\\" as a sample for \\"Never Mind\\" was a terrible choice. I can't wait for the follow up album in hopes that it will be closer to the first album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Bad!","review":"This album was not very good at all. And it wasn't as good as there 1st one. Not that the first one was that good but it had a few good singles. This one is so bad that they needed a Mase featured song as their 1st single.

The song I am talking about is of course, \\"Crazy over You\\". Bad Boy would be crazy not to ship this song to radio and later to retail. It will be the biggest crossover hit of the year. Mind my words. People will be singing this song everywhere they go. Thats what I do!! Bye the way, I am looking for a job at a record label. I study marketing in New York.

When I first fell in love with them, was when I could relate to\\"Cupid\\", and then all of their songs start matching to the things I was going through in my relationship. My favorite song on the new CD is \\"Crazy Over You.\\" I would really like to meet them some day beacuse I am really crazy over them. I just lay in my bed at night listening to their CD, I don't think I know no other songs but the ones sung by 112. I am truly their biggest fan.

It sounds more like a whisper than a grinder. Love that! The only thing I don't like is the retractable cord, or how you operate it. You can pull it out, but you have to twist the top to wind it back up, and you have to work with it a bit if you pull the cord out too far. I wish it had a pull release, but that's just my preference. Overall, it works perfectly well. Easy to clean, and did I mention how quiet it is? WOW!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Grinder","review":"Pros: This grinder is cheap, at only $13.99, and it looked like it could hold about a cup of grounds.Cons: This grinder is a piece of crap; the on/off mechanism is the smallest, cheapest piece of plastic I've ever seen, it will definitely be breaking soon. It doesn't hold enough coffee either; it holds less than a cup of coffee (needed for brewing a 1/2 gallon of coffee).Would not purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and dirty","review":"I bought this product 10 months ago and I am replacing it with another brand.Things I like: I only need it to grind coffee and it works for that. It is very inexpensive.Things I do not like: The grind is uneven. At the bottom of the jar the grind it is very fine but it stays course on the top so it is difficult to judge. The most annoying thing about the grinder is that the tab to turn it on is not fixed so keeps popping off. The grinder has lots of grooves that collect coffee and so it is impossible to keep clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD PRODUCT - DO NOT BUY","review":"This product broke on the second time we used it.

I was strapped for cash, & bought this Proctor Silex for the price.It does NOT grind my coffee beans FINE enough. If you are looking for a coffee grinder, do not buy this one. Get the Mr. Coffee one instead (it's not that much more, http://www.amazon.com/Mr-Coffee-IDS77-Electric-Cleaning/dp/B000BRLXUI). It grinds more beans & grinds them finer.

I say this because the blades are so sharp that they could cut a cloth or your fingers.It's not very loud, compared to some grinders, but it might wake people in the morning.Also grinds spices!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit smaller than others","review":"Although this is a mini grinder, compared to others that I have used, it seems to support an even smaller volume than other mini grinders. As such, I usually run 2 loads instead of one. Other than that, this is a good product. The feature to wind the cord back inside the base of the unit is nice for storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for seeds & spices.","review":"I use it for grinding chia seeds, star anise, whole nutmegs, blue green algae tablets and other stuff like that.

I personally don't drink coffee, so I bought this along with a french press for when I have coffee drinking company. Imagine my embarrassment when not only did it stop working, but also sent out quite a large spark when it did work! I nearly electrocuted my boyfriend!

All I used it for was grinding 3-4 tablespoons of coffee once a day, so I don't think that I overused it or did anything that explains why a coffee grinder would break after a month of grinding coffee. Like another reviewer said, it's not worth the money to pay for shipping to have it replaced with another poor quality grinder. I guess I can't be too upset since it was only $13, but I would have expected it to last at least a year. I was trying to avoid having to buy a more expensive grinder, but now I have to do that anyway and wasted my time and $13 on this. I would recommend buying a higher quality grinder from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grind far too coarse - worthless grinder","review":"I'm not a huge coffee drinker but even I was able to tell that this grinder grinds beans far too coarsely. LISTEN to the large number of reviews that repeat this fact. I thought the grind was coarse and all I get is watery results. Nothing I can do will make the grind more fine - and I'm drinking coffee, not espresso. As far as the rest of the unit goes, I rated it a 1 because if it can't grind beans properly, what do I care about the rest? Fact is that :(1) There isn't enough area to grind enough beans for just four cups of coffee, which is standard.(2) The retractable cord is laughably short, measured by a few inches. One would have expected at least a full foot.(3) As I said, grind is so coarse to make this product worthless.

I LOVE the retractable cord...and this retractable won't break because you retract it manually (you twist the two pieces of the grinder. If you had one of those push buttons retractables, then that would be one more piece of equipment that would be prone to failure at some point. The motor is strong, and it works really well.

The only thing I have used in it is coffee, so I can't attest to how it works anything else. However, I do think it was a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"works below expectations","review":"Have only had the grinder for a few weeks and there is definitely some issues. First of all there is not a tight seal from the lid and the rest of the appliance, so when you pull the lid out it will always spill coffee grounds on your counter. Also, was using it the other day and it froze up mid-grind and quit grinding for a few seconds, definitely not a good sign.

Also the top doesn't hold enought coffee grounds so it's easy to spill some grounds when you take the top off."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product","review":"Inexpensive, does the job, nice look, the only thing is that the chamber is a little small and I wish I could ground more at once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little capacity; uneven grind","review":"I bought this grinder as a replacement for my Michael Graves grinder which quit after 4 years. I have an old (10-15 years!) Braun which still works well but isn't pretty as a backup. I liked the looks and features of this Proctor Silex & bought it. Too bad I threw the receipt out as after a week we haven't had a good cup of coffee yet. Not only is the top small, but the grinder blades seem to be too high and too straight--Braun is far superior to this, and at about the same price. Mine is going to Goodwill since I threw the receipt away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little spice grinder","review":"Let me first say that I don't drink coffee.

Have had it for 5 years and it finally conked when someone helpfully washed out the element. You've got to be careful not to use any liquid in the grinding (otherwise the cap jams and won't lift off. The blade, too, is effective only when the compartment is dry.) Never wash this grinder, just wipe it dry. Apart from these minor constraints it's a hardy and nifty object. I just bought my second one today. 11 bucks! You can't go wrong..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great every single time.","review":"Got this grinder in sept 2011 and have been using it everyday for last one month or so.

It works very well and is simple and easy. However, it does not hold a great deal of flaxseed -- just barely enough for my purposes -- and I need to shake it a bit to ensure everything is ground.Also, if you twist the entire top, it wraps up the cord. But this wrapping requires twisting hard, so much so that I just leave the cord out.But, these are minor complaints given that everything else works well and it was cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value & quality","review":"Bought grinder for grinding flax & sunflower seeds.

With this one I have to pulse for about 30 to 45 seconds to do the same and yet 2-3 of the almonds are not crushed at all. It seems like this grinder has a very weak motor.Am very disappointed with this product and would not recommend this to anyone - not worth spending the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for flax!","review":"I bought this grinder specifically for grinding flax seeds. It works wonders! I didn't want to buy a grinder that was too big because I only needed to grind up a tablespoon or 2 of flax, and I work a lot of seasonal/temporary jobs so I'm moving around constantly and didn't need to add to my collection of stuff. This really is a perfect size for small grinding. If you are making coffee for just 1 person in the morning, I imagine this would work well for that too. It has a retractable cord so that's just an added bonus. This probably isn't big enough for grinding more than 1 or 2 servings of coffee so keep that in mind. But it makes a nice addition to your kitchen if you need a grinder for flax, or small servings, or some other substance that you don't want mixing with your coffee grounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad little grinder","review":"Doesn't hold enough beans, the grind is too coarse to make strong coffee, and it makes a mess.

Then it stopped working after a week of daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Grinder","review":"great buy for an excellent price! and you can grind so many things, as peppers and many other spices.

It was laughable and insulting to consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be ZERO if it was possible.","review":"In order to function you must push a small plastic piece that doesn't stay attached to the machine. Needless to say, that was lost in no time and the grinder is no longer functional.I have had a similiar grinder for 30 years that never had a problem.

It chops the coffee beans into chunks, and that's all it can do. It would probably chop up nuts to about the right size. In addition, its capacity smaller than the last small grinder I had. Not even enough for a full pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord too short","review":"As a grinder, this machine works as described.The issue I had was with the cord on this thing. It is windable into the base of the machine, but getting in out is a little tough. It didn't help that the cord is about 1 foot long, and I kept thinking there was more. The outlets in my kitchen are at \\"normal\\" height, and the cord is too short for me to grind while keeping it on the countertop. I have to hold it up close to the outlet and grind. If only the cord was a couple of inches longer! Or even better a couple of feet longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a wimp!","review":"First of all, the capacity is very small. Second of all, it is just plain weak in the motor dept. It just grinds and grinds and grinds but never gets the coffee fine enough. Do yourself a favor and spend a couple extra bucks and get a Krups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. I really hate this grinder.","review":"First of all, it barely grinds anything. The most I've fit in for grinding is four tablespoons. So I have to keep emptying and grinding more and more to make a full pot of coffee. The grind itself is horrible - big chunks. Hard to get even coarse french press grind. Really hard to get fine grind for automatic drip. The retractable cord is deceiving. You have to retract it yourself by turning the grinder over and over. I thought that part would be electric. Lastly, it is extremely messy. There is no way to open the lid, after grinding, without spilling coffee all over the counter. I think I'll go back to my cheaper Toastmaster grinder that far surpasses this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm telling you not to get it","review":"had it for 2 months. Used it once a week. Be careful overfilling it. Last night it started to make a half-muted sound while vibrating a lot. the blade slowed down and it smelled of burning. Not just-bought wearing in burning, this was an overload, too many beans, I had enough I can't take it anymore, the hell with this coffee-grinder life, I'm out! burning smell. Garbage. I'm eyeballing my Proctor coffeepot right now.

It has a cheap plastic latch that gets jammed up with coffee grounds or something, you end up having to pull really hard, and it never really grinds very fine either. I'd go for more expensive and better options, in the end this one is penny wise and pound foolish and I regret going cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating lid","review":"The main reason I don't like this grinder is that I find it very difficult to get the lid off after grinding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee Grinder for Excellent Price!","review":"For 10 bucks and some change, you really can't beat this deal on a coffee grinder. I've had it for a little over a month now and use it everyday. I grind coffee for a drip machine and french press; it works well for both. The grinder's capacity is perfect for my 4-cup drip machine and the french press. The grind is very consistent, no chunks or chips. The beans I use are oily, so it's understandable that some grinds stick to the bottom, but with a chopstick or other utensil, they can easily be removed. I also super love that the cord winds up so neatly...makes for convenient storage! This coffee grinder is a great investment for coffee lovers and I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"can't go wrong","review":"For the price of this little grinder you can't go wrong. Does exactly what it's supposed to. Plug it in pour in what you want to grain hold the button for 30 seconds and you're set. I've used it everyday for about 4 months and haven't had any problems, and I don't really take great care of the thing. It's small it probably can only grind about 1/2 cup of grain/seed/coffee etc at most at a time. Still I dont think you will end up regretting this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small, cheap and works great","review":"It's small and cheap but gets the job done well, evenly grinding things up. I mostly use it for flax seeds and spices. The cup is pretty small so if you need to grind large quantities of coffee I would not recommend this but for smaller grinding jobs I definitely would recommend this. This is the first coffee grinder I have owned so I am not comparing it to anything but I am really happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"caffeine is on the way...","review":"This is a basic coffee grinder. You put in the coffee beans, grind, and turn it upside down to empty the grounds into a conveniently sized lid (which has a line around it that equals the exact amount of coffee I need. It also has a cord that can be manually retracted by spinning the grinder around it's base. I didn't give it 5 stars, because it does have a habit of allowing the grounds to stick to the side and fall onto the counter - not a major issue, easily cleaned with a quick wipe of a towel, but still worth a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This works very well. The instructions for brewing definitely depend on your blend of coffee. I use 1/3 cup of coffee beans to make an 8-cup pot. The top to the grinder is plastic and I suspect it would not take much more than being dropped on the floor to crack it. So take care in using it. The cord wraps up inside the base so it stores easily. I would definitely recommend this coffee grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC FOR FLAX SEEDS","review":"This is a fabulous grinder for flax seeds. My mother and I both have this model. Just shake and wipe it clean after each use, so no flax \\"powder\\" or oil residue remains. All told, grind & clean takes 30 - 60 seconds. Works fast, cleans fast, and has a terrific retractable cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak motor, low capacity","review":"Bought this after our beloved Braun grinder's top broke. Very disappointed in the product. Round and round and round it ground--and the beans were still in chunks, insufficiently finely ground. Not enough capacity, either, so that the semi-ground coffee spilled onto the counter when we opened the cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased this to blend my own cosmetics. The first time I used it, I felt like I kept having to put more and more ingredients in to get the color right. Finally I dumped everything out, only to realize that the majority of the powder had somehow gotten INSIDE the body of the grinder. When I shook it, powder came pouring out of the hole where the retractable cord enters the grinder. More than half of the product I used ended up inside the grinder rather than in the top where it should have stayed. I only used it once, and now it's completely useless because it's full of powder.I can't imagine that it would be quite as worthless for just grinding coffee or herbs, but my guess is that no matter what you put in it, a portion of it is going to end up inside the machine. This is by far the most disappointing purchase I've made on amazon.com so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proctor Silex E160BY Fresh Grind Coffee Grinder","review":"The unit is preposterous. Its power cord is only 6\\" long, way too short to reach any electrical outlet. You literally have to plug it into an extension cord to use it. Now I know why it's so inexpensive- it's useless. Stay away from this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess..","review":"While this little thing gets the job done as far as grinding up coffee beans, it makes an absolute mess doing it. I usually have two rounds of grinding to get the right amount of coffee for my coffee machine.

I thought this was a normal sized coffee grinder, and it's not. Buyer beware! Also squeezing in the side button to activate the grinder is a bit of a nuisance, usually you just push down from the top with other grinders. It is difficult to open and close the top when loading/unloading coffee.

It takes much longer than other grinders to get a really fine ground; I've found that shaking it a lot while it grinds seems to help. Definitely don't recommend it if you intend on using it mostly or only to do really fine grinding. I'm also perpetually afraid that yanking out the cord like that is going to eventually break it. It's nice that it has that storage function built in but I much preferred my last one, where you could just wind the cord around the bottom instead of yanking it out and twisting it back inside the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it worked.","review":"We bought this coffee grinder for our office since it got great reviews. It worked well for a few months, but it has since stopped working well, and I suspect it will soon stop working at all.

We have to shake the case into the garbage, roll the cord in and out, and do crazy maneuvers to try to get it to work in the morning.

What a downer, I don't consider this fine literature no matter how well written. I was appalled to see these reviews and realize that it is on reading lists for students - what a shame!

It just babbled on for 303 pages about how a family grows up. By the end, you've heard the story from each family member's prospective. Over 300 people in my school had to read this book and not many liked it. Some of the parents who read the book pitied their children who had to read it. It was like watching an old black and white documentry about WWII planes all day for a week straight.

Later, we see how the children relate to one another as they grow into adults. One one hand I can not say this was a personal favorite of mine. But I do not deny the fact that it deserves a place in the museum of women's writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Written Disappointment","review":"A very well written disappointment. I read to the last page, eager to see the storylines resolved, only to be abandoned by our writer, our tour guide; who seemed to jump ship on us. I was interested in the characters, so the author succeeded in that. But that's only half the journey. I can only guess that the characters are symbolic of extremes within ourselves, from oblivious, to bitter to codependent. The lesson might be that each extreme brings its own brand of sorrow, with a study of these extremes in character form. Or maybe not. But it takes the disappointment out of reaching the last page without resolution. I love Tyler's work and admire her skill. But if I'm going to read half a story, I'd like to pay half the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"This is Tyler's masterpiece! This novel exceeds every expectation.

It's always interesting to read the same tale from different points of view. Anne Tyler makes the Tull family jump off the page and (sometimes) into your heart.

Very readable and a page turner, I am passing this along to my aunt and mother."},{"rating":"2","title":"reading between the lines","review":"When I finished this book I had a sort of let down feeling. Is that all there is? But her prose is so beautiful, I went back to read the final paragraph aloud to my friend at breakfast the next morning. I discovered her mastery at saying profound things while telling a seemingly ordinary story. How many of us carry the perceptions of our childhood, of things that happen when we are perhaps 6 or 8 years old, for the rest of our lives and allow them to mold and shape the entire remainder of our lives? Perceptions that may or may not have been true, or perhaps were true then and are no longer. This book, as have her others, moved me and taught me great lessons.

It took a while to get into it, then I kept reading, hoping I'd feel better about the characters.The writing and descriptions are great, but overall I was disappointed in the characters and the story. You get to see the characters from different viewpoints, but they never really change. The family members don't see much of each other, and when they do, there's always a disagreement.

I didn't grow to like ANY of the characters or care about what happened to them.I have very much enjoyed Anne Tylers' other books and recognize that she is a major talent. Her observations are keen and her prose is flawless, but not even she could bring this family of bickering, simpering and aimless people to life for me.I will confess that I didn't make it to the end -- I listened to the audio version and made it to the 6th tape before realizing that life is too short to waste on books you don't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting tale of the dreams and nightmares of a family.","review":"This was required additional reading for an undergraduate developmental psychology course at George Mason University in 1984. Fifteen years and two academic degrees later, I am still haunted by this story. Tyler's portrayal of a child in a dysfunctional family depicts more danger to the human spirit than being homeless in the dead of winter. Having been a single parent of four wonderful daughters has made me appreciate what Anne Tyler brought to life in \\"Homesick.\\" I almost felt guilty for being so lucky by comparison. I've since read other Tyler \\"monuments to humanity\\" and was finally able to enjoy a comparatively happy ending in \\"Ladder of Years\\" (which was recommended by a member of my fiction-writers monthly critique group). Although real-life happy endings are often mixed blessings, this long-overdue conclusion left me glad for the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Just Boring","review":"I am surprised at how many people loved this book and found it great. I found that I really couldn't get involved with any of the characters, and worse yet, Pearl was so downright annoying.

The camera quality is decent throughout and there are a few real world scenes. Mostly it is the host/developer woman giving an intro then explaining (and thankfully re-showing sometimes) signs. She teaches as though it were in a classroom almost and is very interested in teaching. Lots of real life situations are covered at a pleasant pace. It is certainly not part of a signing course but she covers a good bit in the 45 minutes or so, including alphabet/numbers, greetings, emergencies, etc. I found it very helpful, although I had a somewhat exposed background in ASL already."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a God, after all.","review":"In this country, I look for the least sign of God.

When I asked my husband to look inside to see if there was a loose wire or something, we discovered that the screws holding the bottom plate on are not something the average screwdriver can remove. We took it to a friend's automotive shop to see if he had the proper screwdriver, but even he couldn't remove the screws! Obviously, the consumer is not meant to gain access to the inside of the toaster.

This material was recorded around the time of Roger's last Columbia record. On this tour, (and also on the record) is Rick Vito. I had not heard of Rick before McGuinn hired him to play on his record. He plays many great solos, and even sings lead on a song. He even plays Clarence White tribute riffs here and there. Rogers voice is better here. On some of the late seventies live stuff he did, his voice was rather hoarse sounding.If you want to catch a transitional period concert of Roger, you may find a place for it in your collection.Fans of Rick Vito may want this DVD too.

One of Richard Matheson's better screenplays, and that is high praise indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC OF THE GENRE.","review":"Despite the stupefying title, this is a keenly observed exploration of contemporary witchcraft. It's set on a college campus where the faculty wives know a lot more about the petty academic turf wars than their allegedly smarter husbands. Professor Norman Taylor (Peter Wyngarde) is in line for a big promotion. His wife, Tansy (Janet Blair) is sure her husband's charms and spells are responsible. The costumes, acting style, and attitudes are a cinematic primer on late fifties sexual conflicts and idenities. Stereotypes of male rationality and feminine intuition are sharpened to wicked points. In manner, dress, look, and bearing, Wyngarde is presented as a thoroughly - ah - masculine character. Although the conflicts are a bit slow to develop, the story becomes really involving half way through - and it maintains the suspence until the terrific ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fun, fun","review":"This is not something in he curriculum for a Masters of Fine Arts.

(An earlier film version, WEIRD WOMAN, is fun but has little to do with the novel.) The basic gimmick (a strictly rational scientist is forced to confront genuine supernatural happenings) is standard for the genre, but there are several interesting variations here. The climax is chillingly suspenseful, and the acting, direction, and photography are first-rate. The fact that the two scripters, Charles Beaumont and Richard Matheson, were the authors of many fine horror/fantasy short stories, also helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly effective","review":"I bought this movie expecting some good campy laughs. And while a couple of visual effects were lowbudget, the suspense was actually valid. Some of the camera work was artsy for its time, and the music fit the mood. There was much dialog, but it wasn't too talky beacuse it was dead-on and realistic. The actors/actresses gave anything but campy performances; facial expressions and emotions were professionally portrayed. What an overlooked gem! Great \\"Midnite Movie\\" fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unheralded classic","review":"Aka Night of the Eagle doesn't seem to get shown on television very much, which is really strange as its a cracking supernatural thriller. Peter Wyngarde (remember Department S?) stars with Janet Blair as Norman and Tansy Taylor. Its made clear right from the outset of the film that Norman is a sceptic and doesn't believe in the supernatural. Unfortunately Tansy does and is heavily involved in it.The film was clearly influenced by Night of the Demon and it very nearly matches that film in most respects: The lighting and sound are excellent, its only 84mins long, so there really isn't a wasted minute, and the two leading performances are memorably good. Perhaps the only area where its a little weaker than Night of the Demon is the absence of any of that films occasional black comedy moments.In short if you haven't seen this, then you've missed a minor classic that I believe will hold up to repeated viewings."},{"rating":"2","title":"pulled in","review":"Accomplished instrumental cd from band I know nothing of but recommend to those who enjoy \\"ambient with a little bite\\" !

This model's handles don't crack and fall off like the newer stainless steel models do. It is not big enough for a family, but great for a side dish or for a couple to use. It is lighter and does not get as hot outside like the newer models. However, cleanup is awful as the lid gets cloudy with time and the interior is tough to keep clean as the stoneware is welded in.

I would give this book 2 stars. I didn't enjoy reading this book because I thought the story was poorly written, and the author didn't put enough description in what the people looked like. It was also confusing. One thing I did like about was that the author put a lot of thought, and told what the people were doing and how they felt. I would not recommend this book to anyone under the age of 12. The story was about a boy named Nate. He hurt his leg and he couldn't help his father on the farm anymore. The family had to get a orphan boy so the work would get done around the farm. This is my opinion about the book but you will have to read the story yourself to find out weather or not you like the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I really loved this book...great story on how two boys come together after coming from different places.

Yesterday, when I tried to blend some very ripe papaya in the blender, the blades just wouldn't turn! I made sure that everything was assembled correctly, and made sure that the base was turning when the jar was not in place. I verified that I could manually turn the blades in the jar by twisting the attachment under the jar just as the base motor would have done. The problem, I eventually discovered, was that the base and the jar were not mating properly! The star-shaped rubber thing that turns on the base had shrunken so that it could spin freely without turning the blades in the jar!

For that, it may be worth struggling through this poorly written manuscript.Mr Merrill is not expected to be much of an author, and should rely heavily on his editor to tighten up his anecdotes into a readable, coherent, flowing manuscript. Mr. Dent has failed him miserably here. It's as if the editor read each anecdote separately, and forgot about it once he turned the page. Spelling and typos were ATROCIOUS.In short, this book would have been much better if it were edited down to about 2/3rds its size, and nothing of value would have been lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Effort","review":"An insiders view of baseball is something I am interested in and attracted me to purchase the book.

That darn book was pretty booring.","review":"What was billed as a wildly hysterical look at major league baseball through the eyes of an umpire turned out to be a rather booring couple of nights of reading. If you want real humor, check out Ron Luciano's efforts. If you want \\"ol' boy, down home country lingo\\" this will do. The foreward, written by Ken Griffey, Jr. is banal and self-serving. The book itself does little more than proclaim baseball analyst Tim McCarver as a jerk, superstar Reggie Jackson as the \\"second coming\\" (presumably because he professed to enjoy the author's fried chicken) and Merrill himself as a blind supporter of his fellow umpires. Funny,,, Merrill referred to former umpire Nestor Chylak as \\"Nestor Shylock\\".Didn't his editors check this out beforehand? That's reason enough for me to ask for my money back. If your looking for baseball humor, try Luciano - and leave this book on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merrill is hilarious.

As a 31 year old high school baseball umpire and a Christian, Durwood sets a great role model for me. I hope I can teach my kids the values he brings to everything he does. The world needs a few more Durwoods. The only sad part of the book was the sections on Steve Palmerio. Steve was a great umpire who has tragically had his career cut short.

What it basically contains is 150 pages of some half-assed mostly lucid dreams with the author's incoherent and off-topic remarks in between that hardly add to the clarity of his descriptions, but rather serve as a filler in an attempt to mimic other similar, but much more interesting and original books. The techniques themselves were laid out in the end on 7,5 (!) pages only. And even those are copied straight out of dozens other books on the subject.All in all: this book is simply an account of half-assed lucid dreams that the author pretentiously tries to picture as full-fledged OBEs in an attempt to catch the fame.

Such spells as spells for ecenomic improvement, spells for dealing with work and employment, romance and marriage. Also spells used for protection from harmful people, and protection of ones home, and living situations. I have to highly recomend this book, as I would all of Draja's small but great jems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair spell book","review":"Not sure what this is good for. Spells are just so so.

However, said follow up is not available as of this time.As for this book, I found it as good or even slightly better than the original. Sequels have that \\"start from page one\\" familiarity to them that makes them so much fun.Again in this book I felt there were times I wanted to know more about a character, or situation, or plotline... so I can't give it five stars, but overall definitely worth reading. (I know an author can't cover everything, but the feeling was of something missing more than simply wishing there was more.)I would buy the next book in the series the day it came out.Hopefully that helps to explain whether or not I liked this one. =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied customer","review":"I was not at all satisfied with my purchase I emailed for a refund as soon as I seen the product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy Doesn't Work!","review":"We couldn't wait until our daughter was ready for a walker. Unfortunately, after countless times of putting in new batteries, we realized that the toy didn't work. I immediately contacted Kolcraft and they are sending me another toy. I also wished I had gotten the one with the mirror, instead I have the one with the spinning toy and my daughter keeps hitting her forehead on it. And to add to that, she only stays in it for about 15-20 minutes. Other than that, I really like the walker! lol :} I think it will be better once we get a new toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unavaility of walkers","review":"I tried to buy a walker for my grandson and all the walkers were unavailiable.

The front wheels turn all directions but the rear wheels don't. Just like a car, it can only go forward and backward, but not sideways. Sometimes my baby turns her upper body to the side and tries to reach something on her left or right but she can't push the walker that way because of the design, and she gets frustrated. If both front wheels and rear wheels were the types that turn any direction, it would have had much greater mobility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spinning Disaster!","review":"I bought this product for my son because he is in love with the sesame beginnings videos. He loves the soft toys on the side and the buttons along the toy bar. However, the spinning toy with mirror on the middle of the toy bar is very unsafe. More than once he has bumped his forhead or mouth on it. Once so badly that his lip was bleeding and he was screeming in tears! There has to be a better walker out there than this one. Don't buy it just because it is sesame street like I did. It is a waist of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"walker","review":"I recently purchased this walker. I'm not saying the other reviewer is wrong but, there are 2 different sesame street walkers. This one doesn't have any paint on it and the baby couldn't get their fingers caught under the toy bar.

It has a mirror on the toy bar and she likes to look in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just use the softeware which comes with the PLC","review":"I was very excited when I found this book and read the reviews. Chapter one was a small intro to visual basic. The first half of chapter two explained how to input and output with the serial port, great. Then I get to the second half of chapter two and I read that all I need to do is go and get a PLC interface. Why bother with the book then. If I'm going to spend hundreds of dollars on a PLC interface, just buy one which has software, and use the software which comes with it. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure for someone who already has a PLC and needs to revise their programs, this book would be valuable, however for the person who is interested in using the serial port to acquire ideas and tips for simple input/output application around the home, it is frustrating. Maybe the title should be Programming for the PLC in Visual Basic 6. That would be much more appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for home automation...","review":"Great job! I found this book to be very useful for more than just home automation. I have read several OEM protocol manuals in attempt to learn PLC communication. Leonik's book truly cleared the water for me. The principles of serial communications are explained clearly and I was able to apply the examples even with my limited knowledge of Visual Basic. Although the book focuses on the Alan Bradley protocol, the clear explanation helped me to understand other protocols such as DirectNet and Modbus as well. I'll be reading everything Leonik writes from now on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Book","review":"This is an awesome book. It shows how to render external events into a Visual Basic window. It even implements a communication link to an Allen-Bradley micro plc using only VB. There's nothing like it. Great Job, Tom Leonik. I even adapted the software to communicate with an AB micrologix 1200 and it worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home Automation for people with too much money","review":"This book will leave you scratching your head. Do not pay too much for it and you won't be disappointed. When it gets right down to it you might as well look for a plc with o.e. software because that's what you will need. Nice discussions on electrical basics and interfacing but just not practical or user friendly.There are just too many different devices to chase down and no real guidance as to where to get them. Writers should have non-technical people read their material before they publish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a copy of AB manual","review":"After reading the authors review I bought this book.

This book is a basic book not for advanced users."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading","review":"This book has a terribly misleading title. From the synopsis and the title I assumed that it was a book that dealt with cogitative properties of the brain and how it organized data and understood information. On top of that I thought that it would have something to do with E-Commerce, like how to take advantage of the way the brain works to make a more useful E-Commerce site.

I hand washed and towel dried, and only used the knife on plastic cutting boards. It's incredibly dull now. I bought a Shun Elite chef's knife the same day as this ceramic knife, and it's still razor sharp.The Kyocera was very sharp fresh out of the plastic package it came in, but now it's dull and the only way to fix it is to send it to Kyocera along with ten bucks to have them sharpen it. I wouldn't say it was any sharper than a high end steel knife. Plus, on a steel knife you can steel the edge to maintain it in between sharpenings. The ceramic knife is a nifty parlor trick when it's new, but buy a steel knife if you actually want to have something useful down the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent","review":"There is a notion in the Buddhist tradition that there is no such thing as a self. Given that this book is totally self-indulgent, and about Buddhism (I think), then there are some paradoxes here. It is written in that absurd opaque self-referential style characteristic of bad post-modernism, and is basically for the author's own self-delight. The rest of us are doomed to stand outside for a moment, watching the juggler of notions in the dime store window, looking at himself delightfully in a series of distorting mirrors -- then, shrugging our shoulders, we head out into the business of life once more, carrying our much worn copies of \\"Being and Nothingness\\" in our knapsacks as we trudge along."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back.","review":"The book reads like an academic journal whose audience enjoys reading in the jargon of its highly specialized field.

It does not toast evenly (unless you toast in two stages and turn and flip over the bread). It's very slow. And, this is the best part - when toasting one slice, sometimes it can launch the toast out of the toaster - usually landing in the sink. My mom's 30 year old cheap-o Toastmaster works a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups Lasted Less Than 2 Years","review":"We wanted a toaster that would last. We paid extra for the Krups Sensotoast Compact (two slice) but, it didn't last any longer than cheap ones.We were not happy with performance either - I don't know that it ever toasted evenly (hmmm, ... maybe when it was brand new it did)"},{"rating":"1","title":"krups toaster is krap","review":"I think Krups should stick to coffee makers. After reading reviews I bought the toaster. For the price I could have gotten two cheaper toasters that would do a comparable job. It does not do a good job of toasting evenly and you burn your fingers getting the toast out because the finished product sits so low in the slots. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last","review":"When the toaster was new, I'd give it 4 stars. Unlike some of the other reviewers, we found it toasted fairly evenly. However, if I'm spending $80 on a toaster, I'd expect it to last. Since it's been two years since we got the toaster and now it only lightly browns toast on its highest & longest setting, it's time to shop for a new toaster. We WON'T be buying Krups again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for only two pieces of taost at a time.","review":"This toaster is fine for me as long as I don't need to toast more than two pieces of toast or one English muffin at time (and I need to limit my consumption of bread to a reasonable extent), which I don't now, generally, and which doesn't matter that much in any case because it doesn't take much longer to toast more than that, when I need to do so. I have a limited amount of space on which to put things in the kitchen, and this toaster does not take up an inordinate amount of space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the spirit of the series","review":"A gory story of exploding bodies with the witness of the phenomena becoming the next victim has Kolchak on the case. This graphic novel (basically a comic book with professional graphics and high quality paper) recaptures the spirit of the original series, including its humor. The running gag has Carl with a cold receiving advice from everyone he encounters about the best treatment. The main story is well told and paced with the ending being just a bit loose. Fans should know that this issue, and I believe the others in the Moonstone series, do place Carl in a contemporary setting. So while Carl and the rest of the cast look like they did in the 1970s TV show, the 21st century Carl writes his reports on a computer not his familiar typewriter from the series. Overall, I believe fans of the show, and even those unfamiliar with it, will enjoy this read."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for photos...not so great for design info","review":"Because of the small amount of work that Bart Prince has produced over the years has resulted on very little articles of his work. This book is packed with great photos of his most prominent work. There are even a few sections and details of some. The only quarrel I have is that the first 3/4 of the book is just pictures and the last actual text. What little text there is talkes little about him, his family, and the history of the area the majority of his buildings are located. The book doesn't actually mention much if any on the design, process, or construction of his art. I still rated the book a 4 because you can still learn alot simply through the great photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST ONE LISTEN...","review":"That's all you'll need to appreciate Ms. Kanaan's vocal stylings!

This just might be the first of many successful steps in this artist's developing career..."},{"rating":"2","title":"delightful time","review":"These quartets were recorded in Paula Robison's early career and suffer not a bit for that. They are played like much of Mozart should be played - with a spirit of joy in the sound of the music itself - played for its own sake without any philosophical agenda. Her technique is clearly appropriate and this work presages her later exploration of seemingly all the flute repetoire there is. The Tokyo String Quartet plays quite adequately and adds to the sense of joyful exploration that characterizes this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"I bought this for my Sony TRV110 camcorder. The camcorder would not play it as required to clean the heads. When I tried to eject it, it would not come out. I had to remove the tape carrier cover and manually release it. Also most of the cleaning tape was out of the cartridge. Now, my camcorder will not load certain tapes. Other tapes have an intermittant tracking problem. This cleaning cartridge ruined my camcorder.

Eject!","review":"So my 8mm Sharp Viewcam needs a cleaning and I go to Walmart and several other stores and I can find no store that has 8mm cleaner. I go to Amazon and I'm amazed at the price Sony wants. Something like 39 bucks plus shipping and I'm thinking,\\"Jeez,we're talking a sizable investment for a dumb cleaner.\\" Outrageous. But then my eyes see this Dynex cleaner at what is closer to non-gouging price. So I buy it and with shipping I'm getting under 10 bucks.Arrives okay but I put it in and the dreaded Eject message flashes and it won't accept it. So I'm out 10 bucks. The cleaner may work on some 10 mm camcorders, but not Sharp. So I get a Q tip and I dip it in some alcohol and dab here and there following the path of a tape, not sure where I'm suppose to clean. And then I wait 5 minutes for it to dry and pop a tape in. Voila! It worked. Total cost...about 13 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cynical masterpiece","review":"This collection contains one of my favorite of Dostoyevsky's works,Notes from the Underground. With that beautiful air of complete cynicism and hate for everything in ones life, told ironically by the narrater who partly resembles all of us in this society and still means as much now as it did when it was first published. It has influenced so many writers, musicians, artists and us average ants, and really could not have been translated better.Now the Double is probably the reason why I didn't rate this five stars. It has some interesting ideas and does show a young Dostoyevsky maturing into the writer he would become, but I do find it a bit lacking in many aspects, but it certainly can be forgiven, it does make me wonder why they would put these two works together as a whole collection though.I would recommend it for Notes on its own, and the Double is interesting to get a glimpse of the young hero of russian literature to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crime fiction","review":"This is the 8th book in the series, I think.

I have noticed how he continues to improve his writing, and that seems hard to happen, as the first book and each subsequent book has been great! His mysteries are always complex and it is always hard to figure out ahead of time just exactly what is going on...but this last book beats them all in complexity. Kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SERIES","review":"I found one of the Archer Mayor series at our local library and really enjoyed it. The continuing character, Joe Gunther, is an honorable man. The series is set in the northeast--often in Brattleboro, Vermont--and it is interesting to read about the history and economy of that part of the country which has been woven in to the stories.Mr. Mayor began writing the series when publishers didn't know they had to get all the rights, so he has published these himself on Kindle. I was happy to find them, because only the six or so newest books are available in the library and I wanted to read the books in order."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ragman's Memory","review":"This is another Great Mystery from Archer Mayor's fabuious mind.

But I quickly discovered the larger heating element at the bottom heats my water for my morning tea faster than my smaller one did. And it has the versatility of being big enough for cooking more things. Its very light-weight. It saves on energy too, using 110 and bringing two cups of water to a boil in three minutes.It does not shut off once it reaches boiling. You have to unplug it. But I installed an on-off toggle switch at the outlet, which the Hot Pot plugs into, so I just hit the toggle switch to shut it off rather than unplugging the Hot Pot. The switches are readily available at hardware stores and are inexpensive.I would still prefer a smaller one for travel, but this actually isnt all that less convenient to pack: just stuff a shirt inside it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a way to rate it less than one star?

The lid falls off when the pot is tipped up to pour out the last of the water, which is certainly a hazard. Holding the lid on isn't advisable, either, because it heats up along with the water, and becomes too hot to touch.

As a film, it is a tour de force of editing and montage - the cinematography for the time is absolutely stunning, and is set among scenes that give the film its mythic properties. However, the score by Sergei Prokofiev wobbles from very good (nearly as compelling as the ballets) to laughable. It's the film's overwhelming political context that kills it, however.Eisenstein made this film to please Stalin. As such, it is xenophobic, Rus in the extreme, and portrays the Russians as surrounded by hated and unredeemable enemies. This is the usual us-versus-them that justifies dictatorship. The speeches and posturing are all you would expect of government dominated art.this review also submitted to netflix"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALEXANDER NEVSKY!","review":"SERGEI EISENSTEIN's first SOUND FILM tells the epic tale of the great ALEXANDER NEVSKY, who led the people of RUSSIA against the Tutonic Knights invading from GERMAN!

Not that they were the only ones: LAURENCE OLIVIER did the same thing with his version of \\"HENRY V\\"!

Two things come to mind when I reflect on this film. First the dark bass line that plays whenever the Teutonic nights appear in their demonic and inhuman horned helmets. Second, the battle on the ice, with horses slipping on the frozen surface of the lake.

The image was so jumpy I could not watch it more than a few minutes.There are at least two versions of this movie with English subtitles on VHS. Both are worth watching. Some are older and have the \\"mistaken\\" music track. A new version was released in 1995 with new subtitles and a newly recorded score. There are editing changes in the 1995 version as well.I see that there is a version of Alexander Nevsky that is part of a 3-dvd set.But at this date (May, 2002) there doesn't seem to be a single dvd of Alexander Nevsky that is worth watching.There are Russian versions without subtitles and a few versions with English subtitles.

This true masterpiece of cinema is presented in a poor print with a muddled Prokofiev score on the DVD. Image should be praised for releasing such classics as F.W. Murnau's \\"Nosferatu\\" and several of Eisenstein's classics on DVD, but it is truly disappointing that this DVD version of \\"Alexander Nevsky\\" is not preferable to a VHS version already available. I was very excited when the DVD was released, but when I put it in my player and played the Battle on the Ice to see how good it would be on DVD, I was absolutely depressed after having seen the beautiful print and new recording of Prokofiev's score that BMG had used for their VHS version. Hopefully, BMG releases their version on DVD someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not 5 but 6 Stars !","review":"Now that (09/99) Hollywood is in pursuit of flooding the market with even lower quality productions with the mentality that 'people will watch these movies since they will not find an alternative,' I am delighted to spend more time to watch Eisenstein's films.I am not so sure what to write since Eisenstein is probably the greatest director and his films, including Alexander Nevsky is among the very best produced in the history of cinema.I would not comment since I am not a filmmaker or have any experience in that area yet one thing is certain.

Today the Soviet Union is a country whose economic achievements bear comparison with those of the United States.\\" This was in 1989, just shortly before the Societ Union collapsed.

I have recommended the album to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I saw Cry Cry Cry in concert at the University of Washington in early December, and it blew me away. Every song raised a physical reaction in me--be it tears, shivers, or an intense need to dance. I was mainly there to see Dar, but Richard Shindell and Lucy Kaplansy's vocals impressed me greatly--especially Shindell's rendition of Dodge in \\"Cold Missouri Waters.\\" The concert was a rollicking bit of fun (Sherman Alexie was there!) and soon after I bought the CD. It hasn't left my player yet. Except for the slow and flat \\"The Kid\\" the songs are thought-provoking, beautiful, and thoroughly well-performed. Two thumbs up, and kudos to the artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"More! More!","review":"I came across this, like so many others have, by accident. Late one night, I heard \\"Shades of Gray\\" and then I had to hear it again and again. Mechanically, the story is one of the best told in modern folk music and stands reminiscent of Bobbi Gentry's \\"Ode to Billie Joe\\". The rest of the CD is of similar caliber and shows that yes Virginia, there is intelligent music out there. The great irony is, the same depth that makes this CD so sweet is precisely what will keep it off pop radio, but I am thrilled by this trio and their voyage on the musical road less travelled. It is uniquely their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"fave album of '99, great selection of songs","review":"I'm a tough critic. This album blew me away.

The webcast was of a low quality so I didn't know what to expect. When I finally got the album, I was blown away. The combination of Richard's, Lucy's and Dar's voices was beautiful. I'm not sure I will ever hear three voices compliment each other as much as theirs. And, the solo vocal performances are excellent, too. Not all of the songs are top notch. There are a couple that us grown-ups might not care about too much (\\"The Kid\\" and \\"I Know What Kind Of Love This Is\\"). But, the rest of the songs are either pleasing (\\"By Way Of Sorrow\\" is one) or keep you listening, like a good story (\\"Cold Missouri Waters\\", \\"Shades Of Gray\\"). This one's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Blend Harmony","review":"The harmony among the three Cry,Cry,Cry singers, combined with clear, ringing, well-recorded music and a great selection of songs -- like \\"The Kid\\" -- make this a go-back-to-again-and-again like of recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best folk album of the year!","review":"As a Dar Williams fan, I was excited for this new album featuring not only she but also Richard Shindell and Lucy Kaplansky.

This is one cd not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Lacking","review":"I was amazed at how little I enjoyed this cd. I love listening to Dar Williams, and I have heard some Lucy Kaplansky songs that I truly enjoyed. In addition, all of the songs on here are great songs. Unfortunately, great songs and great artists do not always make a great record. I actually went and found the original versions of the few songs on this album I had not heard before, and enjoyed them more than the album. The harmonies are lovely, but I think the passion is lacking. These songs deserve more than nice arrangements; they need to be sung from the heart. The overwhelming production glosses over the beautiful edges of these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just keeps getting better the more you listen","review":"I bought this for \\"Cold Missouri Waters\\" but the entire CD has since become one of my very favorites. It's a testament to the depth of the artists that the songs not only grow on you, but become more interesting and complex the more you hear them.

It's a very small fill area, and water always ended up all over the counter!Of course there were other problems... I ended up giving it away...and went back to my BRAUN, which, I still love after 10 years of usage... Just need a new pot..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks alone won't cut it with me...","review":"This is a stylish looking coffeemaker and it has all the features expected in a premium product of this sort. However, it is a VERY flawed design. The carafe is \\"guaranteed to drip\\" on counters; it is difficult to fill the reservoir and it will drip down the back; the carafe must be \\"locked\\" onto the base; the \\"cone shaped\\" filter holder is actually an oval which won't accept permanent filters and does not correctly saturate the grounds and hence makes substandard brew; the clock is miniscule. Mine was white and the white plastic lid stained in a week. These are popular, but when I see them in people's kitchen's, I think \\"Another sucker for slick styling\\" that got stuck with a design lemon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Form over function","review":"This is a novel looking coffeemaker but it's usability is hampered by several design flaws. The water resevoir opening is small, and if care isn't taken when filling, it dribbles down the back and onto the counter. The spherical carafe is difficult to pour without dripping and costs over $20 to replace, holding only 10 cups. The brew basket is not a standard shape, so no permanent filter can be used and the brewling process is uneven. The carafe must be \\"locked\\" into place on the warming plate. Yes, it looks good, but I expect good usability from a German design; this made in Mexico model disappoints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but... coffee was not so great","review":"I am a coffee snob -- I admit it. I loved the look of this coffeemaker and really wanted a maker with a timer and not too many other bells and whistles. This looked great but the coffee it made was nowhere near as good as what I already had. <sigh> I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and Usage Developed Failure","review":"I too was swayed to buy Krups. Read some of the background and felt the Engineering would be faultless. Overtime my Model 466 began to leak. Small amounts but a coffee mess and mild stain under the coffee maker. The filter (internal) seemed to be used up so I discarded it as I currently use filtered water. During the steps required to set up the coffee pot, the handle on the Carafe became strained and broke in two places. Fortunately the Carafe was empty so no injury. Apparently, over time, heat causes the handle on the Carafe to become brittle. Maybe I was asking more out of a $50.00 coffee pot than I should. It did consistently make good coffee. I used the pot several times a day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Very Good Coffee","review":"I replaced a Braun (it finally wore out) with this model and have used it for 4+ years. The only complaint I have with it is the propensity to drip if you try to pour too fast (why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5). As I really like good coffee, I overlook this little shortcoming - this Krups model makes a VERY good cup of coffee for an auto drip machine. Better than the Braun and much better that the Melitta Fast Brew and the Mr. Coffee we used at work. I've brewed just about a pot a day since I've had it and have yet to have any structural or electrical problems with it. Mine doesn't have a shutoff timer, but I'm drinking my 3rd mug within 30 minutes anyway, so I just shut it off after I pour. As I said, this thing makes a great pot of coffee and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two problems","review":"The absence of an auto shut-off can be a problem. Especially if you are used to a coffee maker with more features.The unit does tend to spill easily when filling with water and pouring. You have to be sure of a lot of room and to pour very slowly when filling. I agree with earlier raters who mentioned this.The design is very nice, but some work needs to be done on the spout/pouring problem. It does make excellent coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Have a Rag and Some Liquid Cleaner","review":"Makes Great coffee...... BUT................... You better have a rag and a Jug of Fantastic because every time you fill it up or pour coffee it slips out the side of the Carafe. Although the Unit looks Great, Every time you Por it gets all over.

Dont buy it and if you do save your receipt and all packaging materials...."},{"rating":"1","title":"one bad coffee maker","review":"Folks, this coffee maker had to be the worst one ever one. A few reasons why:1. Coffee is never hot enough 2. I constantly spill water while trying to fill it up because of the small opening. 3. The lid to the carafe was terrible. I would constantly spill the coffee when trying to pour. Come to find out that the lid was recalled and they sent me different one. Regardless, not this coffemaker is not worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The unit makes good coffee but the features make it not worth the price. Two years after purchase I find that the water filters are no longer being made (so I can't believe they're still manufacturing it). The rounded carafe is pretty but it means that the thing has to be upended to pour - which isn't a good thing when the carafe lid had degraded and is almost in two pieces - as mine is. The markings on the main dial have also worn off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Design Flaw","review":"I love the water filter and the sleek style of this coffemaker, but the carafe has a fatal design flaw. When the lid is on the carafe, coffee will spill out around the edges of the pour spout and trickle down the side of the carafe and miss the mug. I now just remove the lid from the carafe entirely to avoid a mess, but the coffee doesn't retain as much warmth as a result. I've talked to other folks who have had the exact same problem with this coffee maker. Its a pretty machine, but it isn't as functional as it should be for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good home coffee maker","review":"For drip coffee at home, you can't go wrong with this unit. It's simple. It filters the water, and it's easy to use. It doesn't leak all over the counter or have a grinder that clogs. I've had both these problems with other, more expensive, models. By contrast, this coffee maker is a jewel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee Never Hot Enough","review":"I purchased the Krups because I hoped it would be a quality coffeemaker and I would have been completely happy with it had the coffee been hot enough. I set my machine to stay on for 5 hours but after I add some cream (just a little) to my cup of coffee, the coffee is not hot enough and I had to nuke it each time to be able to drink it. The carafe never leaked or dripped and I truly loved the look of this machine and how it worked but the heating element is just simply not hot enough. I wrote to Krups customer care and they had the audacity to tell me to take it to my nearest repair center and PAY THEM to repair the element! I took my Krups back to the store where I purchased it and got a refund. I am now shopping for a completely different coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GLASS WILL BREAK","review":"I paid 50 bucks for the Krups coffer maker, which you can now get for 30 bucks. However the Carafe still cost 25 bucks to replace - when it breaks. And yes, your cute little round pot will break with the slightest pressure. Speaking of, I'm under pressure to replace the Carafe since the pot (aka: Brittle Carafe) looks so darn cool. Hum. Looks or quality? I'm going back to quality. I learned my lesson.

Besides the fact that Eric is incredibly boring and stiff throughout this video, the materials he covers is very introductory. If you are a beginning rock guitarists, this might be helpful for you. Unfortuantley, I don't think many new guitar players today will probably discover Eric Johnson until they have been playing for a while. By the time they get an appreciation for his abilities and decide to buy this DVD, they will have probably already learned most of the content in these lessons.

If you love book reading, book education, book banning, book burning, and books-within-books, then this is the novel for you. Of course, this is no easy read, with literary allusions disperseded throughout and in-depth analyses of \\"Lady Chatterly's Lover\\" and \\"Women in Love\\" that seem for all the world taken from the author's doctoral thesis and fail to add much to the storyline.

There is nothing desiccated about Byatt's imagination. I couldn't get through *The Satanic Verses* by Rushdie, Roth's *Operation Shylock* was narrative torture. Byatt doesn't do that to us. She has weird surprises for us but is never self-indulgent. Confusion for confusion sake ain't her favorite means of showing how \\"profound\\" she is. This is how Dickens and George Eliot would write if they were fused into one person and brought by time machine into the present. Think of an Atwood without the nostalgia for Fellow Travelers or all the feminist paranoia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Redefined Language for Me...","review":"It was fun to read but around the last hundred pages it just got a bit dense, especially the obscenity trial with the flow of experts. The ideas came too fast, too briefly, too *much*, though this may be an intentional effect, considering the title of the book. I loved the way the disparate ideas all connected to language... the entire book is one huge musing and exploration on language. My favorite fragment is the paraphrase from Nietzche, where language is not simply an expression or a container of thought but thought itself. All this, and a cool plot, too. Byatt is a reader's writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it would never end -- utterly tedious.","review":"I'm not sure who Byatt had in mind as a prospective readership for this novel. I read a lot and am not a stranger to the world of literary criticism, but this tome was virtually unbearable once I hit about the halfway point. The first half was somewhat interesting and I had high hopes. But as the book quote-unquote progressed, there just was more and more nothin'. Endless, lengthy quotations and, frankly, boring observations. I'm not sure I have anything of value to comment on, specifically, but I would like to forewarn readers: this is one of the most trying, pretentious, uninteresting books I have ever read, and I think it would not likely appeal to the vast majority of readers. It could conceivably appeal to lit crit buffs but even then. Yuck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vast - overrated - dull - affected and utterly boring","review":"This book is a bore.

It was Raffel who finally enabled me to read and savorDon Quixote, and I'll always thank him for that. Now I also owe him thanks for making Stendahl's uneven but nonetheless great tale of Julien Sorell so engaging and readable.If any reader out there can make any sense of the mystifying jacket photograph on this book, please share that sense with us.

And it doesn't skimp on the color pics either. Ridley Scott' epic GLADIATOR is given the full epic treatment here, with accolades aplenty and no shortage of impressive obstacles faced while making the film. I love all of Scott's films, from The Duelists to the recently released Kingdom of Heaven. But sometimes the accompanying books don't quite match the majestic tone of the films themselves. This is different. Walter Parkes' treatment is fair and doesn't fail to connect with the reader. Showcasing all the necessary film techniques and humorous asides along with abandoned concepts, this also contains cast and crew thoughts and praises Scott for his remarkable visionary touch.

Again, I love that it's small enough for what I need it for, and doesn't take up much space in my suitcase. But upon using it for only the 2nd time, the thing leaks all over the place. It mostly leaks through where the cord enters the kettle, but also a little water is dripping through where the bottom of the pot is vented to allow air to cool the motor. So, it doesn't seem safe to use. Mine is less than a year old, so I'll try to return if there's any sort of warranty, but I'm not too hopeful.

Soon after I started usingit, white flecks of unknown stuff started appearing in the water. Atfirst I thought it was due to our hard water, but I've read this is acommon complaint.Despite this, it heated water up quickly and seemed to work fine..until recently. It began giving off an odd burning plastic smell andthe heat was much weaker. I checked to make sure it was dry and noloose wires, but it seems physically normal. In any case, I'll notuse it again as it could become a fire hazard. Get a better model.

It was good for making Top Ramen (directly in the hot pot), or boiling water, etc. Lately it has started making odd buzzing sounds and then it started leaking the hot water all over the countertop, so it's going to be thrown away. After only about 10 uses, I will have to buy another kind of electric kettle. It could just be that mine had a defect . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the rust issue mentioned","review":"I just had a Rival hot pot that I have had for 15-20 years finally give up the ghost, so I wanted another one just like it. Well, I bought this one, thinking it was even better since there were no exposed elements. The covering of the elements appears to be plastic so that water stays where the unprotected elements are and it showed rust around the rim of the black plastic circle in the bottom the first time I used it. I thought oh, well, a little rust won't be too bad. Then, the next time I used it, there were 2 rust spots on top of the black plastic (in other words it rusted through the plastic, not just around it). So, I'm sending it back, but it appears from correspondence I have had with Beach Camera that I will be liable for the return shipping which I don't think is right since the product is defective. I'm going with another brand and with amazon free shipping on the next one - taking no chances!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Heat element erodes: Temperature settings too abrupt: Plastic interior = bad","review":"I wanted a plug-in pot because boiling water on the stove heats my whole kitchen. This thing works but I'd recommend getting a different model (steel preferably).There are NOT 7 heat levels. The dial makes it look like there's a continuous adjustment of the heating, but there are only two states (on and off) in my pot! As you turn the dial from one side to the other, the heating goes from hottest (always on) to periodic on/off.This not a problem if you just want to boil water, but might be bad if you're trying to cook something. I was trying to cook peas, the hot state made it boil over even if I was on a lower level.Also, the heating element discolored over time (erosion? rust?)... which means I've probably ingested some unwanted stuff. Not to mention boiling water + plastic is rumored to be bad news. So I'm not using this anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"The hot pot is good in that it will bring water to boiling rapidly. I have not used it to heat anything else so I won't comment on how easy it is to clean or resist stains. It has no on /off switch, the there is a control that can range from hot to hotter to too dang hot, there is no automatic shut off, it may get kind of Western if it boils dry. My biggest complaint, and one of safety, there is a large spark created when unplugging the thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful Hot Pot, quit after 3 months","review":"I purchased this hot pot for office use due to the non-exposed coil and portability. It worked as intended for about 3 months and then it began to turn itself off after about 30 seconds into the heat process. I think there might be a flaw in the safety feature that tries to auto-detect when it has been left on for too long, because it will just auto-shutoff and then won't come back on even if it is unplugged and plugged back in. It has to cool down totally and then it will heat, but shuts off again way before the H2O simmers. I purchased a more expensive model and it has worked perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years old and still going strong...","review":"I have had this cheap little kettle for more than 10 years and it still works great.

Most of then are years old, stemming from 2003, etc. The reviews that are more recent are from people saying that they've had their Rival pot for years.It appears that many of the design problems are in more recent models (from the past few years) - the rust, the plastic taste, the leaking....It is entirely possible that this Rival pot used to be of amazing quality and incredibly durable, but you know what they say... Some things ain't what they used to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang for the Buck","review":"This kettle heats water in a matter of seconds and you absolutely can't beat the price. We have been using our 5-6 times a day for months without a single problem. My only two complaints are that you can see the plug spark when you unplug it. I have never had it do any more than that but it seems a little scary and there is no way to avoid it since there is not an on/off switch. The other thing is that the lip around the spout is oddly shaped and if you are not careful you wind up spilling a little water as you pour. The drawbacks are very minor in my opinion compared to the heating efficiency and the low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has quality gone ?","review":"I've been using one of these for several years now, so long in fact that the cover eroded away and the handle broke. Finally, I took the time to order a new one and pitched the old one away.The new hot pot was in use for 2 months before it began leaking. A quick disassembly shows that the metal heating element is simply pressed on the plastic bottom and if not assembled properly will eventually leak.I won't take a chance on purchasing another one - time to try a competitors product and see if their quality control does a better job than Rival's."},{"rating":"1","title":"The delicious taste of... plastic !?!","review":"I purchased this unit at my local Linen&Things; to heat up water for tea. It has the right price point (ok, it is cheap), looks decent, the flat heating surface is easy to clean and it heats water quickly, unfortunately the water tastes like plastic. I've had it for two days now, tried to heat up water repeatedly (9-10 times so far) but still the same strong plastic taste.

Yes, it has auto shut off, and you can see your water level and it sings to you when you are done making your tea in the morning (Just kidding about that last one). After using it for a week or so, I found I preferred my little short and stout Hot Pot. It boils water much faster, it's easier for me to grip and pour the water out as well as fill it up.

The product does not have a on/off switch so you have to constantly plug/unplug the device. This caused much concern because it proves to be a fire hazard (which in fact it did). All in all, the product heat and boils. However, the rust build up is a great health concern.

Whenever I'm feeling too lazy to leave my room to go to the kitchen (I live on the 4th floor, and the kitchen is on the 2nd), I use this pot, and water boils in a matter of a few minutes. It's super quick. You can even MAKE ramen inside the pot and control the heat knob. Just make sure you unplug the pot when you're done boiling though, otherwise you can boil the water dry, and that's not good.I'm really glad I bought this pot though. It's a college survival essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rival Hot Pot","review":"What can I say, Put water in, turn it on, and faster than a microwave you have boiling water.

Its great for heating water, but i submitted a user image showing the interior to show why I'm not using it as a crock pot. Instead of the non-stick interior I was expecting, its plastic with a non-stick heating element embedded in the bottom. So if I heat up soups/sauces in it, I would expect some staining of the plastic that would make it unpleasant for tea kettle duties. Works fine, no leaks.

I recently bought a replacement for it from Target. It did not have the Rival name on it but it looks exactly like the one in the picture and it has what I assume is Targets brand (Chefmate)on it. This item heats great but I have noticed that it will inadvertantly cut off and after several uses the large round heating element inside the pot will separate from the plastic, surrounding it, resulting in leakage from the bottom of the pot. This is a defect that needs to be corrected before a serious incident results from what is an obvious design flaw. How it got past quality control is a curiosity. obviously this product is a result of someone making a decision to cut cost by making an inferior product.

Just tap on the lid, remove it, and dump the ground coffee into the filter. (If you don't tap the lid, you'll get more of a mess on the counter.)When it dies, I'll probably replace it with a mill grinder, but 13 years of service for <$20 is a pretty good deal in my book.The motor did freeze up once several years ago.

I do not recommend this grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice grinder","review":"I like fresh coffee in the morning and nothing beat grinding your own coffee.

Definitely a 5 star for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds coffee well, but there are quality control problems with the lid","review":"I have no qualms about the grinding capabilities of this machine. It does its job adequately. The grind is fairly even, it works pretty fast, the motor is relatively quiet, and we don't have problems with static buildup that you see in some coffee grinders.However, the lid is just slightly too big for the grinding chamber. You must push down hard on the lid to get a snug fit (which is required to run the blades). Taking the lid off is worse--you must jiggle it back and forth while pulling relatively hard. When the lid does come free, it often goes very quickly, resulting in scattered coffee grounds all over the floor. We have tried cleaning the lid and the chamber thoroughly before and after each use, and, although this helps, it does not solve the problem.I am hoping that repeated use will wear down the plastic a bit, which should make taking off and replacing the lid a tad easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"good item","review":"This is just what my wife wanted.

Based on the comments I thought it would be teriffic. I just used it for the first time, and I'm really freaked out. After pushing the button for about 5 seconds, the sesame seeds that I put in for grinding were perfectly pulverized, so it worked for that purpose, however smoke started to come out from the bottom of the machine, and it smelled really bad. I pulled the plug quickly and stepped back, waiting for the thing to explode (which, luckily, it didn't)... It's now around an hour since this happened, and it still smells burned. I will never use this grinder again, and don't recommend it to anyone.

The price is good, with free shipping, and the grinding compartment seems superior to my old Cuisinart. With my old grinder, the mostly plastic blade disintegrated after limited use. Nothing worse then ground plastic in your food. As with every grinder I've used, for coffee or spices, there's a static buildup and the grounds prefer to stay in the grounds compartment. Not really sure how to prevent that. A paint brush type of tool helps to remove all of the contents, but some do tend to remain. As such, I would not use a grinder for both spices and coffee. The blade seems to be mostly metal, which hopefully translates to an extended blade life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's designed for coffee, but I use it for other things.","review":"I got this product for grinding dried hot peppers from my garden.

Admittedly, this is a coffee grinder and not an oat grinder, but I do not see how oats would affect its performance in such an negative fashion.

Imagine both of our disapointments when we found the grinding assembly was not assembled properly. The grinder would not turn because a part was missing and the grinder rubbed against the side of bean holder freezing it in place. The bummer is that I tossed the return slip before I checked it for flaws and now have waited too long to return it - so I have to eat the cost.

The metal bottom is not airtight sealed inside the device, so water can actually get under it. I couldn't figure out why my ground seeds, and coffee were always wet. Also not an issue with other cheep grinders I've bought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Grinder!","review":"We ordered this Coffee Grinder after our previous one finally quit working.

It was actually an old one of my mother's and the top was getting a little ragged, chewed up. But this week we came back around and ordered this grinder. You just can't beat its simplicity. I like being able to measure out the exact amount of beans and grind it to my own preference. The burr grinder relies on presets for how fine the grind is. You also are trusting that, when you set it to grind 10 cups' worth of beans, that's what you will get. After a while those things start getting a little wiggy on you.But not this unit. It grinds exactly what you put in and it grinds it coarse or fine, whatever you want. There's very little to go wrong because there's not much going on. No fancy dials or knobs.

I tried a couple of other grinders before purchasing my new Krups thinking that surely advances had been made in coffee grinders in the last 25 years. Boy, was I wrong--one grinder spewed ground coffee all over WHILE it was grinding, and the other grinder had a cover so tight and badly designed that I had a really hard time removing it to get at the ground coffee. Lesson learned, and I ordered another Krups (identical to the first one I had except for the color), and I am a happy coffee grinder/maker/drinker once again.Krups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Black"},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups coffee grinder","review":"Product works well for a small grinder.

I did want to share my secret on keeping it clean, though. I found that a cheap basting brush (or a large stiff paintbrush) does a fantastic job of brushing out all the leftover coffee dust. You can get under the blades and around the inner rim. I do this each time I use it and then about once a week I will wad up a damp paper towel and do a quick wipe down.

Not as bad if you aren't grinding many beans, but if you're brewing a full pot of coffee and need fine grounds, this product would literally 'stink' while it grinded. Not sure if it's a model issue or a 'dud' from a bad batch.Very intermittent use since that time frame as I was a Starbucks addict, but now finding it cheaper, more convenient and better to just home brew. After using it more frequently, I've noticed the cord is extremely short, only a 1 year warranty....i'd probably invest in a better grinder that would look better, be of better quality and possible a better warranty on my next buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice little grinder","review":"This grinder works very fast and can produce a very fine grind in less than 6 seconds.

It doesn't have the automatic timer but it is easy to just count to 10 for a single cup (or whatever level of 'grind' you wish).3. It is easy to clean out, especially if you get the brush designed for this task, though I just use my finger after unplugging the unit. Unplugging is probably not necessary since the 'switch' is part of the top of the unit, but I am just cautious about putting my finger in anything that can chop up coffee beans thoroughly!All in all, it's a good buy for those of us who aren't willing to spend the big bucks for a 'real' coffee grinder.Krups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Black"},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups fast touch coffee grinder","review":"Great little machine, had mine for years.

I use it for so much though: black pepper, red pepper flakes (really brings out the heat), spices that I've toasted whole, super-fine sugar and salt. The only draw back I've noticed is that to get all the chunks out of your spices you really have to grind them for a while. If the motor runs for more than 5 seconds or so it starts to smell a little funny and I'm afraid I'm going to burn it out. To avoid this, I usually pulse my spices to get them really fine.Tip for getting your spices out: turn the whole grinder upside down, tap the sides to loosen the spices, and let it sit upside down for a minute to let any dust settle (really important if its black or red pepper - not trying to breathe in that dust, ouch). Then remove the cap and its must easier to use what you've ground."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value grinder for spices","review":"I use this as a spice grinder, not a coffee grinder.

The only downside is that you have to practice the knack of when to stop grinding due to the lack of coarse control, but it makes up for it with ease of use. In my mind the quietness, ease of use and ease of cleaning (the black model is easier to clean than white) make this a must-have for coffee lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Espresso grinder!!!","review":"Do not buy this for a french press.

Krups told me to send it back for assessment and that it would take 2-4 weeks, but what do I do in the meantime?!! Ridiculous; returned it and bought a Cuisinart instead, let's hope it lasts just a wee bit longer. Why aren't things made to last anymore? Such waste for the world we leave in. Oh, gave it two stars since it worked fairly well while it did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and Easy","review":"Works great.

I've had no problems with its breaking or malfunctioning but it's impossible to clean to my satisfaction. It's also difficult to add beans without my ending up chasing them all over the kitchen floor.

You can't remove the bowl for cleaning. So you just end up wiping it down--wasting a paper towel or dirtying a hand towel each day. Not only is this wasteful and inconvenient, it also imposes unwanted flavors into your cup of coffee, whether it be old stale coffee or spices you have ground in it.I am returning this item and will continue on my quest to find a common sense grinder--which I don't think exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor bean feed","review":"While the grinding action is satisfactory, I find myself jamming beans into the grinder with the handle of a wooden spoon every time I need to use this grinder.

I moved into a new place with stainless steel and black appliances and wanted to get the same style grinder in black or stainless to match. It arrived today and much to my dismay, the electrical plug in cord is too short! The white one I have is 40\\" from base to end of plug. This new black one is only 29\\", which renders it basically useless for me. I usually grind my coffee, and then pour it directly into the top of my coffee maker. The shorter cord means I would have to unplug the grinder each time, which is a real hassle. I don't see anywhere in the description a mention of the length of the cord. This is a classic example of a simple design flaw that renders the item useless. I am going to return it. Bummer, it was perfect otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaster - it burns","review":"I bought the Krups based upon the reviews I read on this website. It was a disaster. First, it arrived with a chip in the plastic container. Undaunted, I decided to try it. Within 3 seconds of starting the grinder, an electrical burning smell came forth and permeated the kitchen. In addition, it does not grind coffee for 15-20 cups as advertised. If you get 8 cups, you would be very, very lucky. Moreover, the coffee it made was very, very hot and weak. I returned the grinder and will look for a higher quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kick butt coffee grinder","review":"This thing works great for the price.

I'm not sure if I would buy another one, if I do I will go to the store and get it myself. That way if it is defective I can take it right back.Well I have been using this to grind my flaxseeds at least twice a week and I have not had a problem.I don't know what the burning odor was, but now it's gone. 7/21/12"},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups 203-42 coffee grinder is not for everyone","review":"We use our's for grinding coffee beans! WhatI have noticed is that this grinder does not provide a consistant grind for most beans. A large portion of very fine coffee lays and packs below the blade which makes it difficult for a complete grind. Once done grinding I have to use a little brush or my finger to dislodge those extra fine bean particles, I find this irritating. I will keep this grind until it breaks, which I hope will be soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"This grinder does its job - it grinds coffee very well, however the negatives outweigh the positives.1) There is no easy way to clean inside the grinder, so if you also need one to grind spices, I would say you'll have to get a separate unit for those tasks.2)Every time I lift up the lid, the tiny coffee grinds spill all over my kitchen counter top.I guess I'll get Mr. Coffee IDS77 for my coffee and will use Krups for spices and nuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Krups grinder-- broke after < 1 year","review":"I bought this grinder after reading many reviews for various grinders. I did not wish to spend more than $20. I purchased in Dec 09, and it stopped working in Aug 10. I am disappointed, but thankful I didn't spend more. I contacted Krups (manufacturer) as it is still in warranty, but I would need to ship it back to them for repair. For an item that costs <$20 new, it doesn't really make sense to ship it back... i'm sure i'll probably have to spend at least half as much to ship it.. We typically used it for seeds and spices. It stopped working while trying to grind cashews, which were soft enough.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little grinder. Great value.","review":"I've only had this grinder for three weeks, but it sure seems like a winner so far. It is quiet and fast. And I really like that it is compact. Maybe too small for grinding beans for your high volume drip machine, but it sure works great for any variety of small machine. It is easy to judge the grind by the sound. For espresso grind it works quite well.

There's nothing fancy about it. No settings to mess with. Just a simple grinder. I got this one after my Cuisinart \\"burr\\" grinder died after just 6 months. This grinder has a solid well made feeling to it and hopefully will last a long time. For the price I'm very satisfied with this purchase. Especially like how solid it feels.

It quickly makes a pretty fine grind and I don't think you could get a consistently coarser grind by shortening the time.Taking off the lid and dumping grounds into the filter is not nearly as messy as the Braun. Like most grinders it leaves some grind residue in the bottom but that's to be expected.

But guess what: The second one is no better than the first. Everything remains the same, so I'm working on becoming ambidextrous so I can grind twice as many beans... no, that's not true, except it is the same, a really fine machine. I fill up the well and get enough grounds for a couple of days, which is all you really want to have unless you like your grounds stale. I might point out that my coffee maker is Krups and so is my personal size espresso machine.

After six months of use, the blade in this grinder became really stiff and stopped turning. For a while, I could fix it by manually turning the blade until it loosened and then plugging it in and turning it on. I noticed that the chamber would also sink and I would have to lift it up.

This little guy is very satisfactory!It doesn't make a perfectly homogeneous grind but it's much more even than the similarly priced Braun I had before. It's quieter than the Braun. It's easier to clean out (with a soft brush) than the Braun. And unlike the Braun it can grind a single cup's worth of beans as evenly as it grinds a full capacity load.Great for the price. The only thing I really wish were different was the cord: a place to wind it in the base would have been really handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oval design not the best","review":"The combination of value and quality definitely makes this a grinder worth buying, but it ranks behind the Braun KSM2 because of a peculiarity in the Krups design -- its oval shape. That causes grounds to clog at one end of the grinder, where the blade juuust doesn't quite reach. You can even hear the point at which the clogging begins to affect the action of the blade. Getting the grounds out of there requires a little extra work beyond simply inverting and tapping. It's only a minor annoyance, to be sure, but it annoys me every time I use the Krups, and for that reason, I recommend you look to the Braun KSM instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a little grinder","review":"This grinder served me well for 3 years and then one of the metal blades chipped, leaving me to wonder if bits of it went into my coffee grinds-? No settings for fine or coarse but for common sense: the longer you grind, the finer your ground of beans. Easy to use, coffee spills all over when you uncap it but it's no different from all the other grinders I've used in this price range so no points off. A decent product. Nice oval shape makes it easy to grip.

And without question the grind is far superior on the Krups. I didn't know any better because the Cuisinart was my first grinder but hands down the Krups is better. I DO NOT like the small bowl on the Krups nor do I like not having a removeable bowl, so it is much more of a pain to clean. Hopefully it will last much longer than 6 months. I guess we'll see.

I put in a full scoop of whole beans (Kirkland 100% Columbian) and press the top and count to 5 seconds. If you grind any longer the grind will be too fine that it will clog up your paper filter and take longer to pass through. The amount I grind yields 3-4 cups of robust coffee. Once a week I use a damp paper towel to wipe out the residue grinds. The grinder is designed to grind coffee beans and I don't recommend using it to grind harder beans or grains.

The stainless interior begins an inch down from the rim. It should have been all the way to the rim. It doesn't fit tight against the sides and whatever you grind gets caught in between. You can't wash it properly because you cannot put water inside it (will leak in that same gap and ruin the innards) and you cannot ever wash the bottom side of the blade. The first time I used it to grind aniseeds, the whirling seeds cut into the clear top and permanently scratched the whole thing. Also, don't plan on using it for more than one thing.

Daily is my first choice. Actually the size of this grinder helps me to do two things...I'm just one minute away from preparing a pot of freshly ground coffee and I have found that the waste of coffee from the grinding process itself is curtailed to minimum over time which is important from a cost-saving framework.

I use a damp paper towel and this seems to work ok since the only removable part is the clear lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Things Are Boss","review":"I use mine for light and medium roast coffee beans. Can be loud. But, filling beans at level with blades, unit gets the job done. Results will make paper filter drip more slowly. But, a little creativity and I get it done quickly. I would prefer some expensive burr unit, but those are out of my range. Bought several Krups 203-70s for back-up, as I have broken numerous cheaper units. So far, Krupps has not broken (although dropped lids will chip and crack on hard floor). Finally, I grind fresh peanuts to make delicious peanut butter (the results are not liquid paste, so add a few drops of salad oil). Otherwise, great peanut grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent in every way","review":"I loved this product. Works great! I use it for coffee an spices...I'm tempted to use it a a blender...but I won't!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Krups grinder","review":"My son gave this grinder to me about 10 years ago. I love it. I use to grind coffee daily. I don't clean it out unless I am going to grind spices. I wipe out the bottom till it is free of coffee and the top I clean with a scrubber. No, the top never gets perfectly free of the coffee stains but I don't care. It grinds cinnamon sticks and cloves on a regular basis and works great. I don't clean it after grinding spices because I like the spice taste in the coffee for a few days. Anyway it works great for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dependable gift","review":"Old dependable standard, helping set up a new household with the basics of decent coffee, for economy and getting the most out of the beans one chooses/can afford.

I make our baby's food and I needed something to grind the rice to powder to make rice cereal with. I also wanted something for grinding spices. I did some research and debated between getting one where the grinding chamber is removable and thus easier to clean. However, based on my research, it sounded like those grinders are not as powerful as one where the grinding chamber is a part of the unit. So far I have only used with rice but it has worked well and makes the rice a nice powder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little grinder","review":"We use this for grains and spices, and it does a wonderful job.

With this KRUPS its only a quick buzz for a very adequate grind & I really like the angle where the clear lid attaches that makes a pour spout. I didn't know I wanted this feature till I first used it and realized how helpful it is to have aiming assistance before that first cup of coffee in the morning:) The motor does have a little odour for the first while but this is normal for breaking in new electric motors from what I've read. (they have oil that gets on some parts during manufacture & needs to burn off)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good execution of a poor design","review":"I use a french press and so want my beans ground consistently coarse. It is not possible to achieve that with any blade type of coffee grinder. I used this for several years and from a functionality standpoint it is a solid product. It was not until I switched to a burr type coffee grinder that I realized how poor a job this product was grinding beans to a desired level of coarseness. If you are grinding spices or do not really care about a consistent coarseness of your beans, then this product will do a good job. If you want more control, look at a burr type of grinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality - excellent grinder","review":"We tried another grinder and had to return it because it couldn't grind the coffee fine enough.

Can't go wrong with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grind away","review":"The grinder works as it should. Some coffee's will stick to it and you just have to scrape it out with whatever. It's also somewhat of a pain to clean since you can't get it wet. It's a fine grinder, I'd buy another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really does the job","review":"This little tiger can turn coffee beans into powder if you wish. It only does about 1/2 cup of beans at a time, but has them reduced to fine granules in 10 to 20 seconds and a powder in not much longer. My only complaint is that some of the ground coffee sticks to the sides or bottom (about 1 teaspoon of it). Tapping the unit helps but still leaves some. I usually give it a quick wipe with a clean finger to free up the coffee that has stuck. I expect it has to do with moisture in the coffee beans. There's a stainless steel bowl in the bottom and plastic sides so I don't know what more could be done about this problem. Of course, it's not much of a problem and I would guess that most compact units like this, if not all of them, probably have the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken!","review":"Worked fine for about a year then it just quit.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Broke!!","review":"Most of you gave this grinder 4 stars. However, I used mine just 3 times to grind spices.

It does grind fine but...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blade broke off","review":"Well is was only $20 but I expected more from Krups. It was very lightly used, maybe ten times over about a year. It has only had coffee in it and Im a very tolerant and careful user. I tried it last week, it made an godawful noise which turned out to be the blade impacting the metal lining. It had seemingly worn through the lining. The blade then broke off on the second attempt. Hard to clean anyway as the blade it not removable, so its an excuse to buy another. Wont buy Krups anything again though. At $2 a grind I may as well go to Starbucks. Complete crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product","review":"It works well.

Does a decent job, but my main beef is that due to it's oval design and circular blade, coffee grounds end up stuck to the sides where the blade can't reach.

I tried the easiest recipe in the booklet first, which was the orange sorbet. I followed the instructions perfectly and froze the base like it said. I boiled the ingredients, cooled them, and even left the cooled ingredients an extra day in the fridge so it would work better. I put the mixture in the machine and waited 40 minutes, and it was still liquid! I froze the base with the liquid inside for a little while, and thought that would work, and it's still liquid! It's pathetic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"This machine is great for ice cream. Especially various flavored chocolates. What works best is to return the bowl to the freezer for between 2 to 24 hours for the ice cream to set. It's hard to screw it up, unless you're subsituting milk for cream. Spend the money and buy the good stuff, instead of cutting corners using milk. If you like soft serve, then more toward two, hard pack, 24.Sorbets can be tricky, and the book even alleges as much. Having given visitors tastes, I find people confuse sorbets and sherbet a lot. They eat orange sorbet and expect to each orange sherbet."},{"rating":"1","title":"terribly flimsy (re)design","review":"Years ago, I bought the predecessor to this model. It was maybe not the most beautiful-looking machine, but it was solid and it worked very well. Alas, I dropped the bowl and broke it, and could not find replacement parts.So I decided to buy the new model. To my utter disppointment, the current model is an extremely flimsy redesign. The lid is hard to fit, the paddle doesn't fit snugly in the bowl, and doesn't scrape the sides very well, nor is it very good at stirring up the ingredients.I have used it once, to make sorbet, something that was always a cinch with the old model. With this model, the result was a disaster. I am returning it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheezy!","review":"This item is difficult to assemble for use and does not hold up well over time.

We do not recommend this freezer unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks goo","review":"I used this about 4 times before the (toxic?) gel inside started leaking out into the mixing tub.

The ice cream was good when I got around to making it but the reason I'm writing my first ever amazon review tonight is that I want to warn you the parts are iffy. First the paddle snapped - it was still usable, but broken. Then the top broke in the dishwasher. And as I was cleaning the base, I just noticed goopy liquid leaking out of the seal around the base. And I'm not banging the stuff around I swear! Quite disappointed really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good ice cream but badly designed","review":"The ice cream this machine makes is just fine, very good in fact as everyone has said. However, I agree with other reviewers that it is poorly designed. I have been using this machine for 1 1/2 years, approximately once a week. It has always been very loud, so much so that I have to put it in a cabinet to muffle the noise. (My husband hates it.) The other thing is the lid. It worked fine at first but it's been at least a year since it worked properly. It just doesn't fit properly, and I run the risk of it popping off when I'm making ice cream which would ruin the ice cream. I love ice cream, and it occurs to me that I shouldn't have to deal with these trials and tribulations everytime I make it. So I'm thinking of getting the Cuisinart although I'd like to know more about how it holds up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst ice cream maker ever!!","review":"I owned mine for about 1 1/2 years before I just had to put in into the trash!!

Horrible Waste of Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor design, warped canister","review":"The way this ice cream maker is put together, you must balance the dasher carefully in the vat of ice cream mixture and work quickly to attach it to the lid and motor before the mixture freezes so hard that the dasher can't turn. The contraption is tricky to put together so make sure you do a few trial runs first. The worst part, though, is that the canister became warped after a few uses, making it nearly impossible to fit all the parts together. The only redeeming part: I've never had trouble with the canister not freezing enough, but I suspect that's more to do with freezer temperature. I love not having to mess with ice and salt, but I recommend you choose a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performer, great product for the money!","review":"This is a superb product for the money! After reading a couple of the negative reviews, I was a little skeptical, but since purchasing the product I have been extremely pleased with the performance.Some critics write that the ice cream is a little too soft after making. If you want great homemade ice cream, buy this product. If you want frozen ice cream, then place it in the fridge for a few hours OR don't buy the product and continue buying ice cream from a retailer for $2+ a scoop.With reasonable expectations, you'll be totally satisfied with this product. Krups got this one right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped lid or something","review":"After a few years of very occasional use, the last two times I've tried making ice cream I find that the lid (which is very hard to wrestle down in the first place) pops off midway through the process. This is basically a disaster because once the lid pops off and the paddle moves out of alignment you can't really get it working again because the ice cream freezes over the spot the paddle should fit into. It is intensely frustrating. After reading the reviews here I realize I'm not the only one this has happened to. It's a relief because I thought I was somehow doing something wrong. Do not buy this machine, buy a cuisinart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gel leaked out after 3 years","review":"Like many other reviews, the gel leaked out after 3 years, making the freezing bowl useless.

Unless you use the recipes provided, and unless your base is VERY cold, the ice cream will not become thick enough to hold on a spoon.

I'm hoping for better luck with another line..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware, beware!","review":"The frustrations others have expressed about this product are (sadly) true. I really cannot say anything positive about the Krups ice cream maker. It's too bad, because the first few times I used it, my ice cream turned out great. But little by little it became harder to use, until now the top attachment is impossible to fit onto the bowl, the motor is extremely loud and makes awful grinding noises when it runs, and sounds as though there are multiple parts loose inside... all this despite taking very good care of all the parts. I assume at least some of these problems have to do with the bowl expanding or warping as it gets cold... but that aside, the motor is clearly shoddy too. With a lot of patience it is possible to get it working even now, but I'm still ready to chuck the whole thing.

I didn't use it until just a few days ago. When I opened and read the instructions, I discovered that I would have to put the bowl in the freezer for at least 8 hours, and that's only if my freezer is set low enough to freeze the teats off of a polar bear; otherwise, it can take up to 24 hours to completely prepare the bowl.I have used it maybe seven times. The last two times, the machine HAS NOT worked. So, the ice cream fixings I made will end up in the freezer not completely made into ice cream.Although it claims to make 1.5 quarts, the instructions tell you to put only enough in for 1 quart.Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken after 2 use","review":"The bowl started to leak fluids after only 2 use.

I'm having trouble finding Krups customer service, so I think I'm going to throw it away go with another company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than 3 hours of elbow grease in a rock salt bath","review":"Easy to clean, slow to prep (cylinder needs 2 DAYS in the freezer), and the half dozen of included recipes are tasty but with vague directions. Does a great job of mixing evenly and getting a good texture and consistency with most ice creams being ready to eat after 20-40 minutes of hands-free mixing. Being a geek I felt a cost justification on this was in order, and most recipes weighed in at half the price of premium store-bought brands (vanilla was the exception because the beans are so over priced). Highly recommended accompaniment is the book \\"Frozen Desserts\\" by Caroline Liddell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great .... when it works","review":"We loved this ice cream maker -- the ease of use, delicious results and quick cleanup were terrific. The only drawback was the unnecessarily difficult lid. However, after three months of occasional use we found that the paddle no longer will fit into the machine, so the lid won't lock down. We either have to stand there holding the lid down ourselves, or replace the machine. It has been difficult ... no, impossible ... to get support from Krups. We will try a Cuisinart machine next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in Concept, Not So Great in Use","review":"Once I was able to get all of the parts to fit properly and the lid to lock in place, this machine made great ice cream. However, getting the equipment to work correctly was an exercise in futility.First of all, the instructions don't explain that you MUST have the blade in place before adding the ice cream mixture, else it will freeze right to the bowl, making it impossible for the blade to fit or turn. Once you make it past this hurdle, you move on to the challenge of putting the lid in place (there was a great deal of swearing in my kitchen the day of this machine's first use). On about my fourth use of the Krups machine, the blade cracked, which makes the process even more laborious. When I attempted to use the machine about a month ago, I found that I couldn't fit the lid in place at ALL, rendering the machine completely useless.I would have a hard time recommending this product to anyone. I'm going to give the Cuisinart model a try next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprising poor quality for Krups","review":"We own several Krups small kitchen appliances, and had been happy with all of them, including initially this ice cream maker. After a few uses -- properly cleaning and drying all parts after each use -- however, the tub corroded and the freezing gel leaked out. I called Krups customer service, who expressed surprise, but offered no resolution to the problem. I note that several other reviews here report a similar experience with regard to the leakage.

You turn the dial all the way up, put your meat in, and your food is not even cooked yet and time's up. They say it will drain the \\"fat fluid\\". NOPE! Not tilted in any way for the excess fluid to go. It all stays with your meat. Double grill? Na-ah. Fold the other half and your grill is going to tip over. Plus the 2nd half does not even have a place for your fluid to drip. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hinge Pin Brakes Easily","review":"This grill broke on the first time we used it. The culprit is a very weak hunge that is molded in the grill so that it cannot be repaired easily. Using the grill once the hinge is broken is hazardous; the grill gets very hot and the top flops around. I don't recommend it to anyone even at the drastically reduced price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs removable grills","review":"I like the grill a lot. A temperature control would have been nice, and removable cooking grids would make clean up a lot easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good buy","review":"This is a Very good buy, the only problem with it is that u cannot detatch the grilling surface for cleanin."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this grill","review":"I had one of these in my former home and when I moved, one of the first things I did was order another one. I love the ease of cooking, the evenness on both sides, the fact that it opens up into a larger grill if I so desire (for one sided cooking), the sandwich possibilities, and the clean up. I have no complaints at all about this and highly recommend it. It's probably one of the most use appliances in my kitchen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"This is a great first album.R.Pinto, sorry you had a bad experience with it. I invite you to check out the drummer on either the new CD or on some of the more recent shows (which can be found on archive.org) -- Albro (drummer) has improved VERY dramatically in the past, oh about, year or so. The difference is like night and day.I love this album, and still listen to it a lot. I feel that it is, truly, a Sweet Oblivious Antidote (which is the actual name of it, don't know why Amazon has it spelled differently...)Do yourself a favor, and check out PGroove - you just may like it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"I just purchased this knife to slice up a rump roast. My hands are not small, but trying to get a grip on the handle and push down on the on button is difficulty. I had to stop and rest my hand once in awhile. Also the motor got very hot. Will look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Bought this one at a local store because we had two choices: cheap or cheaper. This was the more \\"expensive\\" of the two. Blade is sharp but motor is weak; doesn't slice whole wheat bread very well at all. Handle is uncomfortable to hold. I won't even bother to try it for carving turkey. Miss my old electric knife that lasted for nearly 15 years!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap China made with poor warranty, avoid","review":"I bought this product less than three months ago for $9.99 and the units trigger got stuck and would not squeeze to start.Upon contacting the company ProcterSilex/Hamilton beach they said it is covered under the 2 yr warranty and they would be willing to send the replacement only if I sent back the defective item or its cutup blade and paid them the return shipment which would cost me more than the original price.I called up the support again to reason but she only cited me their policy. I mentioned that I would not be buying your products in future with this policy to which she responded \\"okay!\\"You decide if you want to deal with this company or their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good design","review":"The design features for the on/off switch is a good idea if you have dry hands and are prone to dropping things. Otherwise, the on/off switch is not good at all. The button is hard to press down and is a trigger type switch that does not allow for the blade to be left in the on position. You actually need to keep a lot of pressure of the switch to keep it going. The blade was sharp for the one and only time I used it. I took it back right after Thanksgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Junk","review":"This knife is nothing but a piece of garbage. The button which activates the knife won't remain pressed easily. The duel blade aren't aligned well, so whatever your slicing gets caught between the blades. The knife gets very hot, and I imagine it will stop working soon, even though I just bought it, also it is quite a bit heavier than my old electric knife. This knife is truely a waste of money, no matter how cheap it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Useless","review":"This knife is actually worse than useless. The design is dangerous. The blade release button is on the top of the mechanism near the top of handle (area close to the blades) while the on switch is on the bottom of the device, directly underneath the blade release button. It's very easy to grip both at the same time.In addition, this knife lacks either power or sharp blades (can't really tell which). I've tried to use it to cut bread. The blades just dance around on the crust of the bread, imperiling my fingers. It doesn't even make it completely through the crust. I have to follow up with my serrated knife.Horrible product. Don't purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned the product !","review":"This was supposed to be a new item. It definately wasn't. The Proctor label on the handle was worn and the blades were dirty. I was very disappointed!The switch doesn't have an on/off feature. You have to hold it on while you're using it. That's not good for people with hand trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proctor Silex easy slice electric knife # 74311","review":"This knife is too large and too heavy for my hands, it hurts my wrist to use it. I don't like it at all. I'll throw it away as soon as I find a smaller one that fits my feminine hand. I avoid using it. A reminder to the manufacturers, it is not only big fisted men that use a knife. I avoid using it whenever possible. Does anyone know of a small electric knife that fits a small hand?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacement","review":"I purchased this electric knife to replace a 30 year old Hamilton Beach knife that stopped working. I have found this knife difficult to use. The handle is to large and bulky to hold onto easly and the on/off switch is in a bad location on the bottom, making the hard to keep running and guide at the same time to cut nice even slices. I cannot get the same quality of slice thickness with this knife I could with my old Hamilton Beach. My old knife had the on/off switch on the top under my index finger which made running and guiding the knife at the same time much easy. It gets the job done but is not an easy applience to use. I will continue to shop for one that is more like the one I had. I will never understand the reason for redesigning a product that worked great. They only made a worse product not a better one. \\"If it ain't broke don't fix it.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Proctor Silex Electric Knife","review":"I have/had this knife. I got it as a bonus product for buying a roaster. After only using it for two Thanksgivings we pulled it out this year and it was dead to the world. We tried wiggling & changing everything we could in desperation with a house full of people with no luck. What a bummer and embarrassment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My daughter's new favorite book","review":"Emma's Eggs is the cutest story of a chicken doing her best to please her owners. When she sees one of her eggs get scrambled, she tries to scramble the next one herself. Problem is, the farmer and his family are not pleased with her efforts. So it goes with each of her eggs, until she finally decides to sit on her egg and refuse to give it up. You can guess what happens with that final egg. The best line in the book: \\"Emma fitted on her nest like the lid on a cookie jar.\\" The illustrations are wonderful; the expressions on Emma's face are priceless. This was an instant hit with my daughter, and she giggles every time she reads it. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great ending to a great series (positive)","review":"I thought Cowboy Bebop was my favorite anime ever, and when I saw the ending to the series ending, it only strengthed my belief. It answers all the questions that you may have wanted the answers to and some you didn't want the answers to. There are even answers to questions you didn't even know existed. That only begins to tell you the quality of the product and the series. To sum it up it one word: beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"AlleyKat-Payson AZ.....I received this item today and I am very disappointed. The sound effects are poor, the music is tinny and has a canned sound, the few jingles are useless, the words are hardly phrases and I doubt I will ever use any of them. I would like to return this item, but I have opened it and tried it out; I doubt it would be returnable. I feel like I just wasted $29 and about an hour of my time checking it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I've never been motivated to write an online review before this, but the terrible plotting, non-existent characterization and inane action sequences of this book pushed me to it. This book is one of a select few that I actually didn't bother finishing. It shares this 'honour' with Battleship Earth, if that gives you any idea of the awfulness.Don't buy this book. Don't encourage David Dunn to write a sequel or anything this bad again.Mike Barnard"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tight thriller","review":"By about page 20 or so you know that there is going to be a major confrontation between Garth Frick and Sam Wintripp. These two don't like each other and through out the book we witness Frick steadily lose control and Wintripp decide to do something very violent in response.THE BLACK SILENT starts out with the bad guys holding all the cards and the good guys playing catch up.There are plenty of action sequences, daring escapes and the steady revelation as to why Frick is so desperate.There is a good balance between action and intrigue, and it is this balance that keeps you turning pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and Tiresome","review":"What a job it was to read this tale of endless chases.
