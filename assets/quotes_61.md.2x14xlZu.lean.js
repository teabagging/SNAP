The premise was great. But the novel was so obviously written by someone not unlike the Imani character. Someone who looked at the recording world, but was not at part of it. Only Ms. Kennedy could not make even one of her characters mean anything.

Interesting enough to roll through this book in under 3 days. Love 'em or hate 'em, Ms. Kennedy really showed what made 'em tick. Ms. Kennedy had a lot of story to tell and managed to get it done.

It seems as if the writer just strung together a bunch of stereotypes and real life situations (names changed to protect the guilty)and called it a book. The writing seemed fake and titling the chapters after rap songs was just corny.

I realized I was half way through the book and characters were still being developed. Without question it is a quick and easy read despite the number of pages.

It didn't for me, at least. I also wanted to try to identify who in real life the characters were based on. I didn't particularly like anyone-- and the epilogue was written as though the author just wanted to hurry and finish the book to meet a deadline.

The coverage of the Pope's early life up until his ascencion to the throne was very interesting and pretty well-done. Once he got to the papacy, there were two significant problems. First of all, there were whole sections that dealt with the CIA and other government agencies and didn't talk about the Pope very much. More troubling was what the authors did to the story after the fall of communism. It was like a totally different book. The immediately began using words like \\"angry\\" and \\"snapped\\" and \\"reactionary\\" and \\"militant\\" to describe the Pope's stand on moral issues. After championing him as a her in the fight against communism, they made him seem like a grumpy old man who can't keep up with the times when he dared to take a firm stance against abortion or the ordination of women priests.

The other reviewer calls O'hair's death \\"poetic justice\\". Very Christian like, indeed.In these times when religion and state are all too intertwined we could use another O'Hair, even with all her faults. We may not be able to stop Bush's mixing state and religion at the poles but Madalyn may have stopped him through the courts.Unfortunately, for those of us who are curious rather than vengefull, this book doesn't sufficiently recount the tactics O'Hair used to get prayer out of schools.What it does point out, perhaps inadvertantly, is the bias that officials showed whenever it came to performing their civic duties as they related to O'Hair's predicaments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating story!","review":"I wouldn't classify this as a \\"biography,\\" but it was a very interesting tale of O'Hair's life (and death).

Hey, it's hard to portray as a saint a woman as wicked as her.

I would not beg anyone to read this book if my life dependened on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly realistic.","review":"I am currently reading this for the third time of a number of years. As a 27 year old who has been hospitalized for this exact reason about a dozen times in my youth, I found this book to be surprisingly realistic. It's not as deep or as profound as some might like, but it paints a great picture of what treatment is like. The different girls and how they interact with one another, group time, individual time, and even noticing patients from other wards really brings me back to how it was 10-15 years ago. I highly suggest reading this if you have had any previous experience in being hospitalized as an adolescent."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"GREAT BOOK WAS A GIFT BUT WAS TOLD IT WAS WORTH THE MONEY LOL SHE PICKED IT OUT HERSELF AN A BIG BOOK READER"},{"rating":"1","title":"McCormick falls short.","review":"The beginning of Cut by Patricia McCormick , is the only interesting , exciting and intense part of the entire novel.

I just would like to say that Cut is good for people who want to know about cutting. I also reccomended-don't care if that's spelled incorrectly either- it to someone who is struggling against cutting. Personally, I don't think I'll ever stop cutting, even if I read every book out there, I just like it too much, but if your aim is to stop cutting, the book will be okay. The first half won't help very much, it might even make you cut more, as I did, but the whole thing will help you understand why you cut. I have no serious family problems as does Callie, but you can still, paraphrasing a professional 'review-writer', \\"relate to Callie's struggles\\".

I was disappointed in it then, and I am disappointed in it now.I have been a cutter since I was about 12. I am 21 now, and I don't do it anymore, but the impulse is always there.The author doesn't really seem to get cutting. I agree with another reviewer, another former cutter, when she says that the author has never seen blood seep through her skin, has never waited in that impossibly long moment between cut and release. She has never known all the pain inside of someone who does it.It shows.This book could be about a girl who simply stopped speaking because something bad happened to her brother, she'd still have ended up in the psychiatric unit eventually, believe me.I'm just so disappointed in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Cut was a great book.

Altough it was never as good as GO Ask Alice it came very close. Cut explores the world of a cutter in rehab through her eyes and words. I find that this book could pass for a real life story but it lacks in true feeling about the subject, in my opinion. I can not understand why she cuts herself in the first place, the book doesn't talk about why she feels so bad or her life before Sick Pines very much. Maybe it's just me and I can't understand it but there was no reason for her to cut herself.

Great influence Patricia McCormick, I should sue you. This book offers no solution whatsoever, it glorifies the sin and makes you sympathize with the character rather than see the problem for what it is.

When I finished reading Cut, I realized that I had actually learned something about a common condition. What made this book even better is that it gave you information in a discrete manner. It didn't just give you facts about people that cut themselves, but it gave you perspective into the life of a girl that was cutting herself. This book takes you through the life of a girl that ended up in a hospital for people with different disorders. It shows you what some people have to go through to get over their conditions and to get healthy again. Almost every book has its weak points and dull moments, but this book kept me interested through almost the whole thing.

But I always do.I REALLY LIKED THIS BOOK!It really shows you how the life of someone who self-harms truly is. You go through the struggles with her and you really feel for her. At the end of the book it says that the author, Patricia McCormick went and talked to girls in a hospital who self-harm. She really did her research, and it shows in the book.

This book thought me that talking about your feelings can be very helpful because keeping them bundle up inside could be harmful to your health. It also taught me that parents are an important source in making sure a child has a healthy childhood becuase there are parents that are in the child's life but do not see what is going on.

She doesn't speak for a long time until someone with the same problem comes to Sea Pines. Everyone is shocked when Callie speaks, once she starts speaking she finds out that she really likes the girls she lives with.As I said before Callie cuts herself, never enough to die, just enough to feel the pain. Callie is most likely cutting herself because she is feeling angry or depressed.I recommend this book to people that like realistic fiction that are in the seventh grade or older and aren't looking for a flowery book.If I had to rate this book on a scale of one to five, I would give it a four out of ten because it could have been longer. It left me hanging a little bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell!","review":"I read the summary on this book and thought it would be a good read. I was wrong way wrong. Its about a girl who cuts herself and does'nt talk to anybody. She she in some kind of mental institution with other girls with problems. I started to read it figuring out why this girl cuts herself and doesn't talk to anyone. The ending was very dissapointing. The whole rreason she was doing this to herself is because she thought it was her fault her brother got sick by yelling at him. And she thought of herself as a bad person. That was it. Seriously thats why she was cutting herself. What a lame ending. It would have been better if she had a good reason for cutting herself. Like if she was abused or raped or somethi. But no she cut herself because she thought she made her brother sick. Luckily i was able to get this book for free.

I really tried to get into the story, but it was just so boring. Through out most of the book nothing really happen. I never read Patricia's work before yet still I expected more and was extremely disappointed. There was this whole long part in the story where the main protagonist wouldn't speak, so there wasn't a whole lot of dialogue.

I found the book dull and bland, with one-dimensional characters, making them difficult to relate to or have any empathy for. There are many other books containing similar stories that prove to be insightful, touching and funny, but this isnt one of them. I imagine that the book wasnt researched extremely well, as if the author had had more knowledge of the subject matter, she would have been able to write it more effectively and convincingly. I would recommend autobiographical books on subjects like this as they give more insight into the issues involved while still being entertaining and funny reads, as the authors can draw on their own experiences rather than plucking stories from thin air, which, as demonstrated in \\"Cut\\", does not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"As it's written from a 'cutter's' perspective, I was hoping for a little more insight.

This was before I ever started the act. I thought that this is how it was, and that you didn't go through much, but that is not how it is at all. There are so many things rushing through your head and so many feelings. This doesn't happen with Callie. They never really even give a reason for Callie's cutting, so it just seems sort of wasted and purposless. I know you do not always have to have a reason, but there was more information about the other girls than the main character. I don't know anyone who could relate to this book, and if you are a self-mutilator, you want to read books that you can relate to and make you feellike you are not alone.

Second, she never really goes into the actual cutting, explains the emotions, or educates in any way - which only shows her lack of research. I found this unbelievably disappointing - being a recovering cutter myself, I found it interesting that somebody would go to all the trouble to write a book and not make it accurate.I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody who's looking for an idea of what cutting is really about, or to educate themselves about this disorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cut by Patricia McCormick review","review":"Hey hey hey, I definitely recommend the book Cut by Patricia McCormick to anyone who is or was having troubles in their lives.

Patricia Mccormick's writing style is childish at its best and she lacks a real connection with a fifteen year old (translation: the main character comes off fake and more like a robot than a real fifteen year old girl). This book has single handedly become the suburban mom's guide to her child's issues. Having been a fifteen year old self injurer I was almost offended by the ridiculous portrayal of a painful and shameful issue that I myself had to struggle through.

At the time my best friend was a cutter and I thought through this book maybe I could find some answers as to why people cut and how to help them. Actually I found the book to be more story-telling than informative on the subject of cutting but from Callie(the main character)and my friends perspective, I discovered that cutting is something very deep and personal. I also found more importantly that it's something that you can overcome.I decided to write this review because I was searching through my book shelf recently and discovered Cut. I read the book again in one sitting and I had the same pleased feeling as I had when I first read it. I think of my friend now, who is doing much better and hasn't cut for a while now.

As someone who was once a cutter, it really doesn't address the issue of cutting as well as it seemed it should have. I was under the impression that it was a novel for adults on the issue of cutting, but it was written more on the level of a young adult and didn't really dive much into self-injury as an issue. It made cutting seem as though it was something you can turn on and off, just as Callie's talking was something she had the control to turn on and off. Unfortunately, cutting is nothing like that. Yes, McCormick does touch on the emotions associated with the act of self-injury, but she doesn't make known the need for those feelings, or the cycle of emotions that a cutter goes through before, during and after commiting the act. It was an easy read - I read it in one sitting, but not what I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not written from experience..","review":"Although I do see how Cut would be appealing to curious young teenagers, I found the plot behind Cut to be very weak. Cutting doesn't seem to be that huge of a problem for Callie, yet she gets sent to Sea Pines/Sick Minds for it, whial realistically, people go for years without being discovered as a cutter, and when they do, they usually only get the help of a psychaitrist, not a full blown mental hospital. Some of the emotion was genuine, like the desperate cutting with the plate, and giving herself up to the nurses. But in general, the characters were weakly developed. I have yet to read a book that captures the emotions behind cutting accurately, though.This is worth redaing, as many people enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but unsatisfying","review":"I thought the story that happened at 'Sick Minds' was good, but the main character's story was bad.

In addition to her hidden scars (and the overwhelming desire to cut her arm on anything available, from a broken pie plate to a paper towel dispenser), Callie has become mute. She has no desire to speak, yet even when she desperately tries to form words, she can't make her body respond.Slowly, Callie learns to like, and to learn from, the other misfits she shares a wing with in the Sea Pines facility.

Her parents had just gotten a divorce and moved with her mother. Carmen \`s mother was an anorexic and bulimic who weighed 87 pounds when she went to the hospital for her condition. Eventually, that started to rub off onto Carmen and she began to stop eating and throwing up whatever she did eat. Later on, she began eating again and started to become healthier, but her mother did not and was still obsessed with her weight. I thought this book was tremendous and very powerful. I would recommend it to everyone.Sierra E."},{"rating":"2","title":"so good!","review":"this book was amazing in my opinion. i pretty much loved it. I think all teens should read it and this is because if something happenes with your family you cant blame yourself for it. the book is so detialed i thought that i WAS Callie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Voice in the Same Spirit","review":"I'm a cutter, just like Callie, the main character. And I, have also experienced Callie's footsteps in a mental facility with others. I have to say that the book was pretty much accurate but the emotions were a bit teetery... First off, the plot is pretty bland at the beginning and I had a hard time searching for the real main conflict. What's really clawing and eating Callie? Why does she hurt herself? At the end, the resolution threw me off and I searched the book for hints that could've lead the reader to predict this resolution. I found about one or two but they were really vague to my mind. Second off, the story doesn't give too much about what goes on inside Callie's mind but more of the world around her. More of the physical and less of the emotional. I'd recommend this book to 11-13 year olds but I think a much more intense book about cutting could satisfy the interest of those older."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I read this book because someone told me to. me, being a former cutter, was greatly disappointed by the book. Calllie a girl at seapines cuts herself. There are other girls too with eating disorders and drugs issues, but they arne't mentioned enough for them to have an actual meaning in the book.It's a quick read, but once I finished the book i was greatly disappointed. It had such a lame ending, there was somethign missing from the ending, liek the main reason for her cutting. Nothing intense happens in the book either, and the way she describes cutting herself isn't as great as i thought it would be.This book seems to have a high rating to mostly those who haven't experienced cutting thinking that that is how it actually feels to cut. but there's a lot lacking from that, there's not much of an emotional side to it just the action."},{"rating":"2","title":"I, a cutter....","review":"This book is real and in your face. It describes the feeling. The releif of a cut. The joy in the feeling it allows you for your split second. The addiction to it, and the withdrawl of it. I don't suggest this book if you still cut, or think of it. I had a relaps in reading it myself. This book was wonderfully written and perfectly described. It wasnt just a scientific analogy of what type of chemeical imbalnce in your brain bla bla bla. It was the feeling, the confusion of why. The triumpth of stopping. And the consequence of not. READ THIS BOOK. You'll be glad when you do. good day."},{"rating":"2","title":"~~*Cut*~~","review":"This book is great, it specifies Callie's thoughts and idea's. This book is very descriptive it covers everything from breathing patterns to questioning herself. Callie is a typical teenager, but Callie has a problem. She's a cutter, the rush of bleeding without pain. She was put in a rehab center called Sea Pines a.k.a. Sick Minds. Sea Pines cover all types of teens from eating disorders to drug problems. Cut is another book about another teen in a state of drama. Read this book, it's great. I'm just a 15 year old and I would recommend this book to anyone who can read. Who knows, it might just change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing first person view...","review":"Cut is an amazing book that shows what a cutter goes through.

I'm not saying it was a bad book, it kept my attention the whole way through, but I was REALLY disapointed.. I cant really explain it, but dont expect too much from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but triggering","review":"Well, this book was good, despite the lack of detail, but my major problem with it was that it is incredibly triggering. If you are a cutter or a recovering cutter, be very very careful and read this book in a safe place.It is the story of 15-year old Callie, who is in a 'Residential Treatment Facility' called Sea Pines (but fondly dubbed Sick Minds by it's residents). Callie is a self-injurer (she's in good company; so am I) and is attempting to recover at the hospital. She is at first unresponsive to therapy, but the book chronicles how she opens up to her therapist and herself. As the story unfolds, we begin to understand the issues in her past that led her to cutting and how she oversomes them.All in all, a good book, but don't forget that it's triggering!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review on Cut","review":"If you like books that you can get caught up in and never put down you would love Cut. It is a very detailed explanation of a girl who cuts herself and her struggles on the way to caring and her road to success. This book about Callie likes to cut herself because it seems as though it washes away the pain. Although she is put into a treatment facility she still sometimes has the urge to just make a little cut. This is an incredible and exciting book.I would recomend this book for teens and young adults, like myself, who like realistic real life stories that are exciting and a little mind boggling at times to think a person would do this. This is one of my favorite books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Early Gems From the Master","review":"Even though this album was released in 1963, these comedy pieces more than stand the test of time.

Some of the best bits are the Noah trilogy(tracks 4,5 and 6),TOSS OF THE COIN(track 2) and KARATE(track 12). SUPERMAN is quite humourous also. On HOOF AND MOUTH,Cosby tells about the Paul Newman movie \\"Hud\\" which was in theatres at the time of this recording. On KARATE,Cosby mentions Jell-O,which he would begin speaking for in 1974. At the time of recording,Cosby was dating Camille Hanks who would later become his wife.

I would not recommend it to anyone unless you want a book you have to pick up the pieces evey time you want to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good plot, poor writing.","review":"While a plot-intensive story, the writing, itself, leaves a lot to be desired. Frequent misspellings, grammatical and punctual errors, incorrect usage of terms, as well as abrupt changes of the reader's point-of-view make for an arduous read. As enjoyable as the plot is, I think Mr. Reid should contact his editors for both reimbursement of past funds, and to inform them they will not be working on future projects. The quality of the text in this book is roughly equivalent to a non-edited, non-proofread fanfiction, and I feel a bit short-changed for having spent money on this. I can only hope that Mr. Reid improves the quality of his books in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Drive replacement for mac","review":"I put this in an older Powerbook and it works great.

With heart, wit and humor she tells the story of seven \\"Nice Jewish Girls\\" who were childhood friends (or enemies) summer after summer at camp and are now 30-somethings in and around Manhattan. The voice of each character compells you to laugh with them and at them as you watch them fumble through life, re-live and heal old wounds, and eventually (in some cases) grow up. This novel is funny, sad, ultimately moving, and completely addictive. A great summer read that you won't put down until the very last word."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising book that falls flat","review":"When I saw this book in the store, I thought it looked promising, a nice light read. However, after finishing it ( which I had to force myself to do) I found I cared little about the characters or their situations. Rose seems to draw her characters flat, making what happens to them pitiable, but you find yourself wondering, who cares? Whatever humor was attempted in the book comes off awkwardly, and you wonder why you bought the book in the first place"},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid","review":"I took it out of the library, made it halfway through and am quickly sending it back. I found it totally insipid and found the author's portrayal of Judaism vulgar and offensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Definitely not light, fun, beach reading. The story was disjointed, and I didn't like any of the characters. I struggled to get to the end of the book, and when I reached the end, I felt I had wasted my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"very funny and surprising","review":"I started this book expecting a fun read. I got that and much more, a very funny, very surprising, utterly engrossing story, more Mary McCarthy than Helen Fielding. A sometimes scathing, always witty, and ultimately very moving look at a \\"group\\" in a period in time and their struggles with love, marriage, children and identity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Summer Read!","review":"The best part of this book is the chance to get beyond the exterior of the characters and though they may all be \\"Japs\\" they are clearly very different women who each face obstacles in their lives. Anyone who has gone to an overnight camp or been in such close contact with a group of girls, whether Jewish or not, can relate to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Book about Young Girls and their Camping Experiences","review":"This is a fast paced book about young impressionable teenage girls who go away to sleepaway camp.The author is telling the story on how the experience of sleep away camp and what happened one summer affects their lives as they grow older.The girls come back to their camp for a reunion, and each girl in the bunk is highlighted and \\"their\\" story is told for theanniversary edition of the Camps Anniversary story.Each girl has their own problems to deal with as they leave camp and grow up.The most profound thing I think that I got from the whole book, was as cool as the author thought all the other girls \\"were\\", and she wasn't- all the girls when they told the \\"writer\\" \\"their\\" story of their camping experience and their life and how they felt- they all felt the same way- they didn't fit in-I really enjoyed this book- it was a quick and fun book to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All What I Expected","review":"With its bright colors and fluffy preview on the back, you would think this would be a light, fun read.However, it is not, and I just cant understand how other readers can say that it is. If you are expecting a fun Shopacholic-like novel, or even fun interesting charachter novel, it is quite a dissapointment. It starts off innocently enough with one girl not seemingly to fit in with the others- havent we all felt that way? But instead of just being picked on, which is painful enough, she is actually abused by fellow campers. It goes on from there with stories of gang rape, sexual abuse, molestation, and neglect, with more than a few disturbing images. This book is packaged as one thing, and it in the end is quite a different thing all together. While it is well written, you can't help feeling at the end that you are glad its over, and that you were somehow tricked into reading it. Not a feel good novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Disappointment","review":"From the cover, I was expecting a light, fun, and funny book. As it turns out, The J.A.P. Chronicles was dark, depressing, insulting, and at times, vulgar and disgusting. The book seems to make light of issues such as gang rape, molestation, hazing, neglect, and abuse. From personal experiences, I do not believe that this book portrays at all what \\"jappy\\" sleep away camps are really like or what happens to \\"jappy girls\\" when they get older. How others could say that this is a \\"quick, easy, and feel good book\\" is beyond me. I agree with PaperBackReader's review, \\"You can't help feeling at the end that you are glad it is over, and that you were somehow tricked into reading it. Not a feel good novel.\\" I would not recommend this book to anyone that I know. It was truly a total disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it.","review":"Totally disappointing. I was looking for some easy reading chick lit, saw the cover of this book, scanned the back, and checked it out of the library - thankfully I didn't spend any money on it. I hated it - around page 38 I was pretty sure this wasn't what I'd hoped it would be, but I finished the book because I at least wanted to know what happened. Turns out, nothing worth reading happened.On top of that, it's felt like there was a lot of gratuitous sex and bad language. The writing isn't great, and there's not a solid plot line - just a bunch of stories that are somehow tied together because the girls all know each other and some of them are in contact with each other.Don't waste your time - find another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great plot - bad execution","review":"Being a camp girl, I was really looking forward to reading this book and imagining what my former bunk mates are up to these days. I just finished studying for a major exam and was ready to get lost in a book. The J.A.P. world is not one I'm familiar with so it seemed all the more perfect escape. However, after an initial good introduction, the characters' personal demons overwhelm the book and the author does not do a good job bringing the unearthing of these demons back to the point of the book...the post-camp life defining moment in the women's lives. The individual women's stories get lost in too many details - often sordid - so the reader is left disliking everyone. Unfortunately, Ms. Rose doesn't give us much to like about anyone or anything in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depraved!","review":"Although I literally couldn't put this book down, I spent the whole time reading it with a sick feeling in my stomach. I, too, saw the cuteness of the cover and thought this book would be light and fluffy. Wrong! Each character faces a most horrid reality and the reader plods on - hoping for a bit of sunshine to break through. Just when you think the story couldn't get any worse, it does... Despite the author's talent for writing - it was almost as though she was desperate for shock value. I know Stephen King wrote a book entitled \\"Misery,\\" however, this novel would be more suited for that exact label!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan!","review":"I got this book, thinking it would be lively and funny..... but it just took a weird turn and I stopped reading it. I hardly ever stop reading books (it makes me feel so guilty!), but I just lost interest once it got a little strange. Maybe if I had finished the book, I'd have a different opinion..... but to be honest, I couldn't even bring myself to pick it up and continue. Since I pride myself on finishing most of everything I start (including bad books), I really felt that this book was just not my cup of tea! AT ALL!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good start, then went downhill fast......","review":"I heard the first song (Giving it all away) on the radio and was blown away. Ordered the CD from Amazon.

I would like to have heard him sing more. The spoken lyrics are poetic and ponderous, but I like his singing as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start somewhere else","review":"Cockburn is a brilliant artist; this is one of his weaker albums. There are too many spoken word pieces. He has made them taut and effective in the past (\\"Charity of Night,\\" \\"Birmingham Shadows\\") but here they are limp, wan, unfinished-seeming--piles of words not turned into lyrics, musical backing not made into song. Blunt, unpleasant images abound, from the newborn baby sliding out of the nurse's hands in the opening track, to the judge and the hookers in \\"Let the Bad Air Out.\\" The decent image in the \\"Last Night of the World\\"--that all the singer would need is \\"champagne and you\\"--is wasted in another half-baked song and track. The down-tempo \\"Blueberry Hill\\" is just depressing. Cockburn fans have all bought this anyway, but if you are new to him start with a masterpiece: \\"The Charity of Night.\\" Then get the raucous live follow-up, \\"You Pay Your Money and You Take Your Chance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked The Charity of Night you will like this too.","review":"I am a recent convert to Bruce's music. The Charity of Night album absolutely blew me away! I went out and bought most of his earlier stuff and although there are certainly a few pearls there, I don't like it nearly as much. He has been through so many phases, I was afraid that his new album would be yet another direction. I was very pleased to find that he has continued with the same kind of music as Charity. To my ear, Dinner in New Orleans is not quite as good as Charity, lacking the definitive, killer cuts like Strange Waters. Still, almost as good as The Charity of Night is plenty good enough since that is one of my favorite CDs. This is another great collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Just when you thing it can't get any better than, it does. There's a new surprise on every track.Cockburn shows himself not only to be a superb lyricist, but an innovative musician with a fine mix of talent backing him up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Cocburn's best, but still a gem","review":"While, it may not rate as Cockburn's best effort, \\"Breakfast...\\" is an excellent work. The guitar work, both acoustic and electric, bears his signature finger-style-with-flair approach. His lyrics on this project are more reflective of personal and emotional issues than they are political commentaries. While some may miss the political commentary, Cockburn's unique and refreshing bent on personal and emotional reflections is always insightful and enjoyable. Cockburn also masterfully blends spoken lyric with sung lyric on a few of the songs, which serves to reveals Cockburn as the top-notch poet that he is. This effort is sure to please long-time Cockburn fans as well as those who have recently discovered this talented musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyric brilliance backed by strong music","review":"A prolific producer of fine, lyric-driven music for nearly 30 years, Bruce Cockburn is consistently able to turn his life observations into striking and thoughtful songs. On \\"Breakfast in New Orleans\\" this alchemist's gift is applied to topics ranging from the ecological (\\"The Embers of Eden\\") to the philosophical (\\"When You Give It Away\\") to the personal (\\"Isn't That What Friends Are For?\\").Cockburn's gritty singing style is most effective, often touching listeners as though sung only for them. And although some dislike the talking-style technique he uses with some songs, it fits well with that personal and poetic approach. While the musical styles vary - Cockburn's fine bluesy guitar instrumentals sit alongside a laid back re-make of \\"Blueberry Hill\\" and some African-tinged pieces - most will seek out this album for its lyric brilliance. The fact that the musical quality is so high is a bonus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly poor quality textbook","review":"I purchased this text for a class taught by Joy Laskar at Georgia Tech. I was very dissapointed with the last of polish the book had. The author, Laskar, is very knowledgeable about his field, however the text he provides lacks most of the nuance you would expect from a textbook. Many portions read more like excerpts from published papers, complete with the lack of in depth examples and explainations, and while references are plentiful, it would be preferable for a student to have the example or worked out problems mentioned present in the text instead of located in a trade journal somewhere which one may or may not have access to.Additionally, the images throughout the book were horrible.

I tried to adjust the strap and was able to loosen it enough to get my feet into them. This is the 2nd time I've order this brand of sandal and was unsuccessful in getting them on both times. I was impressed with the quality of the product but felt perhaps they were made for a very small Chinese foot. I had to return them both times and as a result will never order them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Fit","review":"Found these uncomfortable, hard to adjust, and just wrong for my feet. I thought they would provide support, but they just rubbed in all the wrong places. Returned them for a full refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Finally, a Firewire cable that is long enough to plug into the back of your Mac and have easy access at the front of your working area!Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Knife","review":"This knife is an all around good knife for hunting and farm chores. The balance is fantastic. It is quality unsurpassed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it would Be","review":"I received the book in good condition, but it was completely different from the original book I purchased in the 80's. I thought it would be the same book but it was not. I guess they changed it for the better but I wasn't pleased with what I saw. I like the book I purchased originally. Having said that, however, I think this is a great book to learn how to save thousands on your mortgage and pay it off sooner. If more homeowners take the time to learn these strategies, there would have been no crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have contained more secrets","review":"Pretty much everything that was said in this book was in my first choice (Invest in Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life). If I would have known the book as going to be more than 80% tables, I would have never ordered it. Most of the information contained in this book can easily be found on the web. Needless to say, I was very disappointed with this book. I guess that's what happens when you buy online as opposed to in a bookstore. I could have flipped through this book in 20 or 30 seconds and realized that most of the pages were tables that needed more detail. What I found funny is that I received this book 2 whole days before I received my first choice and that's because my first choice supposedly was shipped before my second choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a secret","review":"Here is what this book says. Paying your mortgage off faster than your payment schedule will save you tens of thousands of dollars. True, but what is the time value of that money you spent on your mortgage? Could you have \\"made\\" more in the stock market or somewhere else?Yet the author belabors the point ad nauseam, giving examples about how much you can save paying a little more per month.Basically, he does not give the full story. When you pay off your loan early, you are also paying a net higher interest rate. Scim this book at the bookstore. The best secret is not buying this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bankers have only 1 Secret?","review":"Disappointed, this book does discuss paying your mortgage off early and gives you the technique to accomplish that, but a whole book for this one technique? I wouldn't purchase it again, skim it at the bookstore. Discuss the method the book gives with your mortgage holder - some won't apply your money in the way the book notes. They don't have to, if you signed a paper at closing in which the bank stated a different method of applying your extra money. Remember that stack of papers you signed, look through them and see if there is one that shows how the bank will apply extra payments, even ones marked principle only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy the audio tape of this book!!!","review":"I'm an avid audio tape listener and purchased the audio version of this book. It came in a generic case (like you'd buy to copy your own cassettes) with shabby wrapping and a couple of black and white stickers on it. It was so bad, I sent it back to Amazon. It may be worth $1.29, but not $12.95!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel Miller Has Nailed It!","review":"Mr. Miller has concisely and convincingly made his case for decriminalization, and in this writer's opinion, for ending abolition. I strongly recommend this volume because Mr. Miller defends his stance without sounding like a drug seeker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong size shipped twice!!!","review":"I ordered this for my son for Halloween. I ordered a large. When it arrived, it was a medium. I returned the wrong size and requested a replacement of a size large. When I received it the second time, it was a medium again. Apparently, someone cannot read. I was very irritated. Ended up having to run to the local store and buy another costume which was not what he wanted, but did not have time to wait for them to ship me the incorrect size yet again. Absolutely ridiculous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hawk \\"Black\\" racing brake pads","review":"These guys know their stuff.

The hems were frayed and coming apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughs for the entire family","review":"We just received this book and already have been having a lot of fun with it! The jokes are appropriate for an entire family - even young children will find many of the jokes funny. Some of the jokes just make you smile, while others make you laugh til it hurts. My kids (ages 8, 10, and 12) enjoy telling jokes and they have been reading through this book on a daily basis to find new favorites. My youngest enjoys the play on words the most - for example, \\"How do you put a baby astronaut to sleep?\\" (Rocket). Or \\"What did the baby light bulb say to its mother?\\" (I wuv you watts and watts). The book is broken down into different categories/chapters, so you can find jokes and riddles easily. Overall, I think this is a fun book to have around the house for kids to peruse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seriously laughing out loud!","review":"This book is pretty punny. Some of the content had me in stitches and tears (not from laughing my pants off!). With 3,650 jokes, puns, and riddles, there's something for everyone. I like that most of them are puns!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Stop Punishing Me","review":"I've made it fairly deep into this book and it is filled with puns. The title claims Jokes first, haven't found one yet. Puns are not that funny. I should have downloaded the sample and tried that first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Count on more than 3650 laughs!","review":"You can count on more laughs than there are jokes and riddles in this bountiful collection, as you'll want to tell each funny and punny joke over and over again (and scoring a guaranteed laugh each and every time). The jokes and riddles are refreshingly family-friendly, yet they will bring howls of laughter from toddlers and geezers, as well as people of all other ages. Get ready for a knee-slapping good time whether you read this alone, with friends, or even to strangers. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"These headbands work great!","review":"This is the second headband I have purchased for my daughter and it works great. They are easy to use, dry and store. We use them for my youngest daughter as she has tubes in her ears to prevent ear infections and these have really helped. We use them with the ear putty for extra protection. I was kind of disappointed that this one didn't include the ear putty like the first headband did, but that was just a freebie and doesn't take away at all from then headband itself. We use this for both swimming and bathing so rest assured that these are functional and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very inspiring and educational book.","review":"This is a great book. Very informative and inspiring. It gives details and tips to enhance your technical experise, and your lover's pleasure. It has worked very well for me and I highly recommend it (especially for the price)."},{"rating":"1","title":"haayyyyyyyted it!","review":"okay maybe that is a little harsh, but i was not inspired to read this book. i thik the best part about it was the advise on doing pelvic floor exercises.How to Be a Great Lover: Girlfriend-to-Girlfriend Time-Tested Techniques That Will Blow His Mindis a MUCH better book infact it's great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informative book","review":"This books will give you information on what men like and dislike, what they find sexy in a woman, and a couple of sexual and massage techniques.

Perfect to mellow out to on those long train rides or drive home from a long days work.Jane's vocals are downright ethereal. Erin's bassline are smooth and fluid.Ryan's guitars add some amazing texture.Jim's electronics(forgive my biased nature having worked with him)are beautifully delicate and add the icing on the cake.If you like this EP be sure to check out their \\"Like a Dream\\" Remix on Stephanie Dosen's latest relese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Department 56","review":"I am aware of the difference between the Dept 56 reindeers which were produced prior to 2006 and the new Patience Brewsters reindeers which are being produced NOW. I specifically ordered these from you because you stated they were Dept 56 and I am trying to complete my set of DEPT 56 Krinkles Reindeers. Your advertising is very misleading and I was disappointed to receive the newly distributed reindeers. There are slight differences other than the boxes and I am trying to complete an ORIGINAL DEPT 56 COLLECTION...that is why I purchased these from you. I expect that you will correct this situation so that I don't have to contact Amazon and point out your misleading advertising...as there is a difference!!I look forward to a quick resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best for poetry, relaxation, and ethereal music.","review":"This is one of the best albums ever put together.

'Listen to the Warm' was my favorite.. I still have my records and a turntable but the grooves are worn out!'The Sea' transports you to a simpler time and is a great way to find some relaxation, even for today's generations. I would love to have 'The Earth' come out as a CD to hear \\"Sunday.....it's so hard to believe it could be so quiet after such a noisy Saturday night!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A rich,highly textured composition for the mind's eye","review":"In the late 60's two people had accounted for more than 40,000,000 popular records sold in the United States. The two were Anita Kerr and Rod McKuen. Their combined talents persuaded Warner Bros. Records to allocate to them 10,000 dollars for a project.For all those who like to relieve stress by dimming the lights,putting on a CD,closing their eyes and allowing their minds to wonder along beaches,conjuring up white sands, grassy dunes, soft summer rains and waves exploding along the shorline chasing the seagulls to a fro this is an album for you. The fact that some of Rod Mckuens words for \\"Stanyan Street and Other Sorrows\\" as well as \\"Listen to the Warm\\" are set to Anita kerr's supple music is simply a consolation.So, slip this CD on,dim the lights,close your eyes and take your favorite person's hand and walk along the shore line for a while. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not French!","review":"I've only ever ordered two items with Amazon and both vendors were highly rated. The two items were the same thing. I wanted a particular CD and listened to a sample to make sure it was the right thing. When I received the first CD it was what I ordered except it was sung in French. After numerous e-mails my account was credited for the charge. I went with a different vendor and repeated what I had done earlier but even went a step further by explaining what had happened earlier and wanted to make sure the CD was shipped in the English language. The CD arrived about three weeks later (they claimed they had misplaced my order) and when I opened it, it was in French!!! I've sent numerous e-mails to the vendor and to Amazon without receiving any replies."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAVE ORIGINAL RECORD","review":"I HAVE THE ORIGINAL 33 LP RECORD.

Each individual will take away his or her own inner feelings of things past and present. I know of no other poet who so totally grasps our hearing sensory and yet continues to give more each time it's heard. His words, along with the Strings, rushes over in ways no other artist in my life has been able to accomplish.

My favorite is The Storm on The Sea Album. Unfortunately, I let a friend borrow all of the albums and never got them back, so I am so happy to find The Sea here.

I have 2 copies - but no turntable now. So imagine my delight when I found the CD. I suppose I have lived in a hole, but didn't know there were other albums.

Years later a friend and I discovered our mutual love of his albums. I have managed to save all my albums and a stereo turn table to play them on. The Sea is my favorite, but The Earth is a close second. I also enjoy New Ballads. I'm not sure if the present generation would appreciate his music, but there are many of us older generations that would fall in love with his music all over again if it was rereleased on CD - all of them. I keep checking sources hoping someone will. Until then, I'll just keep the records playing and listen between the scratches!

What really gave the book a bad effect was what LaVaughn finds out about Jody. I think that kind of ruins the book. I was very sure that she was going to talk to Jody, or something, but after she finds out the true thing behind him, I think it was a total waste of writing. I don't really reccommend this book to anyone, it had a nice writing style, but the actual writing wasn't that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't we heard this story before?","review":"it seems that as long as reguritate the dominate social narrative of an oppressed/underpresented group the work is considered a \\"masterpiece\\" and \\"touching\\".

It related to the way that all young adolescents feel everyday. When we all started to read this book, we thought,\\"Oh no, not another boring, dull, school book.\\" But as we all started reading it we realized that we three totally different students could come together and share the things that go on in our lives as well as La Vaughn's (main character). Issues such as sex, boys, family, and friends are topics in the book and in our lives. We all would recommend this book. It's a good laugh, a cry, and we promise you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Believer Review","review":"The book true believer was fantastic. Once I started reading the True Believer i couldn't put it down. I thought to myself as I was reading that the things that happened in the book actually happen in today's world. I am sympathetic towards the main character in this book (LaVaughn). She goes through so many hardships that people should never have to go through. She is just a normal teenager that has a crush and goes to a school she despises. I like True Believer because I could relate to LaVaughn as though she were me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked True Believer","review":"The story True Believer is a wonderful story of a typical young teen that tries to juggle friends, a job, and home life. LaVaghn leads you though her feelings of caring for a young friend with two children, wanting desperately to please her mom, and wanting the boy across the hall to fall for her the way she has fallen for him. LaVaghn doesn't understand why he is so friendly and flirty, but doesn't seem to return the love she has for him. She soon finds out when she decides to visit him unexpectedly one day. You will not be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfully written book!","review":"This is a great follow-up to Make Lemonade! I couldn't put it down. The 'stream-of-conscience' writing is continued in this book, and makes it even more interesting. Unlike Make Lemonade, we learn much more about the narrator's (LaVaughn's) life. Virginia plunges into many, somewhat 'risqué' (as far as chidren's novels go) subject matters in this book, and keeps you guessing.Many familiar characters pop up throughout the book, as well as some new faces. Some of the characters from Make Lemonade, such as Myrtle and Annie, have more clarified and defined roles. This is a great read. Virginia is also working on the third book in the trilogy, which I am greatly looking forward to. I've had the privilege of meeting the author more than once, and I'd like to say she has a wonderful personality! I recommend this book to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book","review":"The story was strong and the characters were all very relatable... I definitely reccomend this to anyone of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and astounding","review":"True Believer is a really great book that all teens will enjoy. I recommend it to anyone that likes a book that you can never put down.This book is one of those books that anyone can relate to. This book talks about trouble that most teens go through or will go through. The main character is a very funny, normal teenage girl. She will go through hard times in school, at home, with friends, ect. but make it into a joke. Anyone who picks this book up will enjoy a wonderful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not ever buy from these people","review":"Do not ever buy from these people. I had a problem with my purchase.

To my dismay, all the original artwork illustrations were badly reproduced and in a yellowish tinge therefore rendering any references to uniform colors totally pointless.

I love it for it's beautiful lyrical quality and the subject matter. Who doesn't love a good retelling the fall of Troy. So romantic and yet not entirely about the romance. It melds the mystic with the historical and with a surprising realism. It was definitely refreshing for me throughout the years of shallow, pure paranormal romance young adult novels. I recommend :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written novel","review":"Greek mythology has always fascinated me, and though I was familar with the Trojan war, I had not yet experienced the tale from the Trojan's point of view. I was immediately impressed with how the author managed to keep the reader intrigued, all the while remaining historically accurate.

This novel of love, war, and intrigue will be one hard to forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeehhh....","review":"This book wasn't all that good. One of it's main failings is that it is written largely from civilian perspective. If you're interested in reading a not that exciting book about how terrible the Trojan's women's side of the war was, then this is the book for you. Another way of saying it is that this version of Troy is a good one for the ladies. there is practically no actual conflict and an excess of passion. the narrative is largely from girl's point of view, and the actual Trojan war is mostly in the background, with a few of it's key elements thrown in to keep the story going. this is definitely not a cross gender book. On the other hand, Adele's way of including the gods was interesting, but not worth reading the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I thought this book was awful! Plain and simple. In the book, there is a war going on and the author obviously didn't research it enough because she hardly ever mentions any of the battles. Now, I'm a girl who loves romance and all that, but the relationships between the characters were so unbearably unbelieveable. I bought this book, and it's sequel \\"Ithaka\\" because I love ancient Greece and the whole battle of Troy. I don't even want to keep this book, but it's so bad, that I don't want to sell it and have other people waste their money on a stupid badly written novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Side-Story in the Epic of Troy","review":"The book, Troy, was written in a very different style than I'm used to. It centers on two sisters: Xanthe and Marpessa. They live in Troy, Xanthe as nursemaid to Lord Hector's son, and Marpessa, an attendant to Helen.The story tells of the events of the sisters' lives before and after the Greeks destroyed Troy. Some parts were very evocative, and the plot was very interestingly portrayed. Adele Geras's setting very vivid, and her characterization was well done.Though I really disliked many parts, the story was well written, and at times leaves you to imagine what's going to happen afterwards, particulary in the end.I'm still undecided whether this book makes my top ten list of books, but it's still a good read, and I enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troy: a novel","review":"Xanthe, an adolescent living in the city of Troy, is struggling to find herself as the war rages on and on outside the walls. Join her and those around her as they live their lives in the final days of Troy.The book, Troy: a novel, written by Adele Geras is a romantic war story about the life inside Troy before the great city crumbled. Opposite the Iliad, it shows the war of Troy from the perspective of the Trojans. It shows \\"the other side of the story\\". It will take you in and will not let you go until you have read every last word. I give it a perfect ten and if you're going to read any book, make it Troy: a novel. Perfect for reading over and over again. An epic story, an instant classic, and a best seller for young adults.DM"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction to mythology","review":"This novel is an excellent introduction to mythology. While a student may not at first be interested in reading Homer's epic poem, The Iliad, the student may consider reading this paperback. Though some of the events seem improbable...anything is possible when Greek gods and goddesses intervene. Readers will end this book wanting to learn more about Eros, Aphrodite, and others. Obviously, readers will want to know more about the legend of Troy as well.It was interesting to view the story of Troy through the eyes of four teenagers who are common citizens who had to endure the siege that not only limited food resources, but nearly reduced everyone to the same level. This story includes passion, action, violence and sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Book","review":"I thought that this book was really well written. It explains everything in full detail so it's easy to know what events are taking place in the book. The way how the author wrote the book keeps you guessing whats going to happen next. Xanthe is the main character and she likes Alastor, but he likes Marpessa, Xanthe's sister, and Iason likes Xanthe as well as Boros, and Xanthe's friend likes Iason...it makes you wonder if this book will end with a happy ever after or not. The battles are detailed in a way that you could close your eyes and see it happening if you really think about the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mediocre retelling of the Illiad","review":"I hate to go against the barrage of praise for Geras's Troy, but I found it to be somewhat disappointing despite all the nice quotes on the jacket. As a novel, and even as a young adult novel, I feel that there is more than can be reaped from the tale than just a recital of the facts of the Trojan war and a somewhat one-dimensional love story. The pivotal points of the story have been reduced to one or two sentences, the most lengthy being only a paragraph. It seemed a little bit like a Cliff's notes with some extra adjectives thrown in. Although I have to admit the book was sometimes a pageturner when it came to the soap opera like story of the sisters, I can say that the depiction of the war could have been done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to usual Timex quality","review":"I bought two similar (60 min.)

Sadly I should have read the 2 and 1 star reviews. They have all said it better than I could. The book is plodding and not very well paced. The universe it inhabits is poorly explained and confusing more times than not. Its also hard to keep up with as the author switches focus on a dime before the reader can get an idea of what is going on. Save yourself the time and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did it win the Hugo?","review":"What did I miss? This is just a below average SF book, easy to put down. But I finished it because I want to read all the HUGO winners. I gave it 2 stars because the \\"networked packs\\" and the children were interesting; otherwise, reading this was a chore. If I recall correctly, this tied for the 1993 HUGO with Connie Willis' \\"Doomsday Book\\"--a much, much better book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid the Kindle Edition","review":"The story makes for a fine read, but the Kindle edition is utterly trashed. Someone had the bright idea to add 1,522 \\"Notes\\" that litter the text with the aesthetic appeal of thousands of plastic grocery bags blowing around Yosemite. If I wanted a book with someone else's (even the author's) highlights and notes, I would have gone to the used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"100 Words or Less","review":"I loved the opening chapter ... and then came the doglike telepathic symbiotic warriors?Ugh. I suppose those aliens are as good as any, but from that chapter I knew exactly where this novel was heading. Okay, maybe I didn't know exactly, but it was enough of a disappointment for me to stop reading.I just have no patience for the \\"children among aliens\\" plot devices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing, Hard-to-Read Scifi","review":"Vinge's way of creating a huge universe that's beyond human comprehension is by not explaining the most important terms and concepts in his story. Unfortunately, this places most of his story beyond human comprehension. The alien dog-like race is interesting and appealing, but the human characters are not. Vinge makes the error of placing Johanna and Jefri in peril and killing off their parents far too soon (this is not a spoiler; it happens by page 25), before we've had a chance to know them and care about them. Nor does the appeal of Vinge's writing come close to that of Bester, Heinlein, Asimov, or other noted science fiction writers. If this book represents the best of modern science fiction, as the blurbs and some reviews claim, modern science fiction is in bad shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars.","review":"This book, always mentioned with breathless awe on Slashdot and other geek-oriented sites that I frequent, joins a very small number of books that are so truly horrid I haven't even bothered to finish reading them. I made it about halfway through before giving up in disgust.In a nutshell, this book seems to me to be what you'd get if you'd give a group of average fourth-graders the assignment to write a science fiction novel. It's poorly written and juvenile. The \\"plot\\", and I use the term loosely, is really a semi-random mechanism for connecting poorly-drawn and disjointed vignettes. The characters are the shallowest sci-fi stereotypes imaginable. The author clearly has no understanding of basic physics or astronomy and instead just makes stuff up as he goes along.This just may be the worst book I have ever tried to read. And I've read a lot of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Awful, plodding, too many complicated characters who don't matter. Some interesting, well thought out ideas, but at the end, I didn't care what happened, I only wanted to finish the thing and donate it to the used book fund at the library. The worst Hugo winner I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is considered \\"hard\\" SF, it's a sad day for SF","review":"This is bad science fantasy. I almost stopped reading after the hilariously bad introductory section (I had fun reading it aloud to my boyfriend for comic effect), but bravely plowed onward into the trite and poorly written remainder of the novel. The communal \\"pack\\" mind concept betrays the author's utter ignorance of how real animal pack structures work. This book is going to the used bookstore ASAP and I'm going to find some _real_ hard SF to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful and boring","review":"I bought A fire Upon The Deep when it first came out in the UK - circa 1992. In the intervening nine years I have tried to get past page 20 about six times. On each occasion I have failed - primarily becuase I couldn't follow what was going on. Vinge switches focus so often, and with such abruptness, that the reader is left wondering if this book was written for the author's own amusement, rather than the enjoyment of the paying audience. I'm sure that the legion of Vinge-lovers will hate me for disliking AFUTD and will probably try to claim that I'm a bit thick. Duhhhh! Good night children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Book","review":"I don't remember why I picked up this book in my library...but I did...and it was certainly worth it. The characters are well drawn...and the Skroderiders and Tines are great aliens. In fact, the Tines are the reason I gave this book four stars instead of five...I found them extremely engrossing, so engrossing that when Vinge switches to his human characters I didn't seem to enjoy it as much...also, with the human characters Vinge shows his training as a computer scientist...he tends to focus a bit much on computer systems in the \\"human world\\". This doesn't mean the \\"human stuff\\" isn't good, it really is...Pham Nuwen is a great character, full of depth and well...character (which is probably why Vinge uses him in the prequel, A Deepness in the Sky). Overall, the book is definitely worth reading...and the prequel is even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not the \\"classic\\" it's cracked up to be","review":"I enjoyed this book, but wouldn't place it in the elite class that so many others seem to. There are many interesting concepts, but they are overly drawn out. The book reads very slowly at times.Vinge is an impressive intellect, but isn't nearly the writing craftsman that Dan Simmons, Gene Wolfe, or Iain M. Banks is. If you like pure \\"space opera\\", you'll have some fun with Vinge. But this isn't great literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for any science fiction fan","review":"I learned of this book through a friend's recommendation, and as a science fiction fan I am eternally grateful (I was recently able to return the favor by sending my friend a copy of Vinge's new book in the same universe, A Deepness In The Sky).The book is of epic scale, and combines an extremely original concept for an alien race with an extremely original concept for a universe and (careful not to give anything away!) probably the best conclusion I've ever seen to a book.I've given away more copies of this book than of any other science fiction book, and had to buy an extra one myself because the copy I lent out wasn't returned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vision vision vision","review":"There comes a mind with an original idea occasionally. This guy has more than a few. I love his idea that the laws of physics are in themselves somehow tied up with gravity, which sort of folds relativity in on itself. His views of the nature of intelligence as transcending the physical bounds of the individual are manifested in several contrasting \\"entities\\": the Tine packs, the \\"normal\\" civilisations and the Higher Order beings of the Beyond, which draws religious thinking of Good and Evil into the universe in a natural way. I love this universe. And they use a FTL version of the Internet!

Can't really recommend it; there were good parts though..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost worth the chore of reading it all","review":"I truly wanted to like this book, and eventually I did, but not very much. Every week I plowed through another several pages--not in anticipation, savoring the temptation of teasing myself with only reading this little bit more, as I did with Winter's Tale or Soldier of the Great War, but because I thought that surely, surely there would come a crescendo, a climax, an emotional involvement, even. Alas, there was not. A grand vision, not realized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone else is ga-ga, calls it a classic. I don't see it.","review":"I had had this book suggested so many times. So when I finally got around to reading it, I was set up for disappointment and didn't finish it, not enjoying it at all. So when I came back to it much later and decided to give it another chance, I hoped for a turnaround. Not to be. Vinge is a smart smart guy, and clever. He builds some great threads into this book, which has been aptly described as space opera. I was looking for more of a philosophical bent, I guess. It's not that I wanted the book to be more serious - - I just kept getting the feeling that Vinge's tendencies for fairly traditional SF space-y tropes don't fit my liking. This didn't live up in the face of the likes of Bester or Haldeman (or even Heinlein, yikes), which is where I'd turn if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire Fizzles","review":"Some of the subject matter and ideas, especially pack-consciousness and gradient zones of galactic consciousness, have real intrinsic appeal, but the development here is unfocused and cobbled, and eventually, after a long long, take your potted plant for a walk, long time, fizzles with a whimper.Hugo or nogo, \\"Fire\\" reads like a careless and bloated first draft: way too much undramatized exposition, i.e. telling about what the characters are thinking and doing and feeling, telling about every thing that's happened elsewhere and else when, even on occasion witlessly telling what is going to happen; sliced onion plot layers--all tears no taco; a perfunctory ooze of sentimentality which slathers further insult on the redundant, extraneous, cliched characters. And, by Yoda's grizzled jowls, turning telepathic puppies and sentient shrubbery into tiresome house guests is...well it shouldn't be done.If you're not primarily a sci-fi fan, you may find a modicum of arsenic to be more efficacious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs feministic fiction?","review":"Truly it is just a fiction.. Too much of feminism leaves the science out of V.V. books. Don't buy if you want to read a true science fiction. Golden Age has a lot more to offer. Read Stanislaw Lem instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity in outer space","review":"I have long been a science fiction fan. Starting with Asimov sic fi has been my passion. I only read sic fi. However, in the case of this book I felt dirty upon finishing. This was not sic fi. This was mediocrity incarnate.

On the strength of his Hugo Award and the good reviews this work received on this website, I decided to give Vinge's \\"Fire Upon the Deep\\" a try. And was bitterly disappointed. Vinge writes like Jeffrey Archer on a bad day and his characters have the psychological depth, and are about as interesting, as Jackie Collins'. This is not Space Opera, it is Space Soap Opera. Seriously, chuck this one in the fire, and order a few of Iain M Banks' early ones, or Dan Simmons' Hyperion/ Endymion, for a display of the beauty, scope and insight that really good Science Fiction can offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vinge is beyond the transcend","review":"Great book with some novel concepts presented in a thoroughly enjoyable manner.

Very fascinating, and like-able creatures added to the overall Sci-Fi lexicon.+ Thought-provoking concepts of long-time plans. These are plans that unfold over millenia.

Unfortunately, I couldn't make it beyond the first few chapters. The idea of a planet inhabited by intelligent wolves is intriguing. However, I couldn't figure out why wolves that walk on 4 legs would use weapons such a bow and arrow that are designed to be used by an animal with 2 hands. They end up having to \\"team up\\" in order to operate the bow. Why wouldn't they just develop a better weapon more suited for a dog? Just didn't make sense and I couldn't dedicate my time to such nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that exciting","review":"This book had interesting potential, but it failed early on. The character development was laborious and in the end, I really didn't care too much about anyone. The idea of physics as being mutable over distance does not correspond well with the hard-science misnomer given to this story. At some points, it almost seemed that the author was giving grandiose explanations that really explained nothing. I don't know if the author was trying to inspire thoughtful reflection on possibilities or wax poetic. Either way, it is a miss.The idea of the Tines was probably the best aspect. Group thought and individual interaction on that level is quite interesting, but nothing to hang a story on.If you want hard science/action, try David Weber. If you want philosophy, go to Dune."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Did This Win An Award ???","review":"I cannot believe this book is as bad as I thought it was (see all the positive reviews).

This is a wonderful \\"old school\\" space opera that contains all the necessary elements, i.e. space battles, alien races, great characterization and ancient civilizations with a little medieval action thrown in for good measure.Usually, reading about alien, animal cultures is something that I try to avoid, but I was amazed by the complexity, depth and integration that Mr. Vinge has achieved with this subject. I had a little difficultly with the first fifth of the book due to the concepts of the \\"Tines' mind speak\\" and the \\"galactic zone\\", but the understanding is well worth the effort.This is a stand-alone book, so few out there now, but it was so well written and entertaining I have ordered \\"A Deepness in the Sky\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book of 2 tales","review":"Two stories:1) The children on the Tines world - excelllent, original ideas about alien intelligence .. 5*s.2) The space race to stop the blight - seemingly, purposely confusing and an average storyline .. 3*s.A little disappointed with the ending. Too many things remained unexplained, for example several references to the fungus inside the spacecraft which never played any part in the plot that I could tell.The device that destroys the blight, is revealed only in the last chapter and not really explained - it's like the author just ran out of ideas and decided to kill the story.OTOH the doggies (Tines) are excellent and well thought out.

What a fantastic piece of thought and imagination -- and nothing ever got so complicated that I felt I needed to be an engineer to follow the science/space theory. The ideas of Transendence, the layers of space, were very nicely laid out.So many cool races, so many histories, so many things that had happened and yet to come. It reminded me - with the children - of Philip Pullman's stories - between world's, between people.Looking forward to reading the \\"prequel\\" of sorts A DEEPNESS IN THE SKY."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Galaxy Spanning Adventure","review":"This was a great science fiction novel. It is a story about a \\"virus\\" that infects the galaxy and the quest to retrieve the \\"antidote\\". But there is so much more to this epic. There is a deep space setting, and a setting on a primitive world inhabited by packs of sentient, dog like creatures. Vinge expertly plots the story and brings the two worlds together in grand style. It is a long book, but it is well paced and suspenseful most of the way. The characters, both human and alien, are convincing. An amazing trip through the deepest reaches of the galaxy, I consider this one of the top sci-fi novels of the past decade. Like all great science fiction, it stretches your imagination to the limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite memorable!","review":"I read this book about a year ago. I read alot of books and don't remember many of them. I remember this book vividly because it was so different from the other sci fi I've read.It's set into the far, far distant future and was so different, it was a bit hard to comprehend at first. The nonhuman races were unique and very believable. It was interesting to see humans viewed as \\"dumb animals\\" by a wolf-like race of beings but it wasn't a Plant of the Apes kind of thing. The characters were very interesting and very diverse. As some reviewers noted, this book doesn't really focus on the technology as it's all \\"old hat\\" for the characters that use it.For something different, give this a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The end was worth it","review":"There were a lot of fantastic ideas in here, but for some reason I can't put my finger on, the first 2/3 of the book went by rather slowly. It's not that nothing interesting happened. It's not that it was bad. And it wasn't enough for me to stop reading altogether. But for some reason I just couldn't get excited about it. However, the last 1/3 of the book flew by, and left me with an overall great opinion of the book. A bunch of unique concepts and generally good storytelling, make me give this 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed and totally enchanting","review":"Having never read any of Vinge's works this came as a total delight. From the very first pages, there is excitement and action. From those first pages, the reader is crash-landed into an alien world along with the central characters. The books ability to then transport the reader through this alien environment is unsurpassed and central to the enjoyment. I would truly recommend this book for anyone interested in action-packed escapism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful ideas, shoddy construction.","review":"The author has some very creative and powerful ideas and language, and the book never gets boring, but the implementation seems forced.

As it is it is still very entertianing."},{"rating":"2","title":"uneven but valuable","review":"This is a collection, and the quality of the articles varies widely. Some of the folks are, to be blunt, poor writers of English and could have used some serious editing. On the other hand, several of the authors have the kind of solid understanding of the technical issues -- electromagnetic theory in this case -- that a popular journalist rarely brings to the table. The book starts with a huge chronology, which is of course a bit dull to plod through, but contains a number of remarkable revelations -- e.g. the first ideas about radar are much earlier than you would have thought! There are a couple of interesting discussions about Maxwell and his work, which conveniently provide his actual (scalar) equations in modern notation. Features are also provided on Heaviside, Hertz, Tesla, and other luminaries.

It also grovels at the feet of James Clerk Maxwell, which is out of place in a book of this sort.I was so turned off by these things that I (literally) tossed the book aside and have not read any more of it.

Maps of dangerous areas can mislead, for example, by giving the impression that a danger is especially great in one area because it is concentrated there, even though it may actually be worse elsewhere where population density is greater.

My advice; don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Twain Software","review":"The camera seemed nice, but the Twain software included with it did not work on Windows NT4.0 like it was supposed to. Tech support couldn't help either, suggested that it just won't work on some computers. I sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful software makes camera useless","review":"It can take hours to get a few random pictures to download from the camera. Software support is unreachable. The little documentation provided is poor.Every time I turn on the camera it behaves differently, so it is impossible to reliably take a picture and get it on the computer. Sometimes the buttons work, other times they do nothing. If your are lucky enough to get it to download it is then difficult to get the picture in a useable format like JPG or bitmap. Often turning the camera off makes it lose all of its pictures.Save your money, time and sanity by buying some crayons and an art book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I had this camera before and It was good for the price. I threw this camera away because I thought it was bad at the time than I bought other cameras in this price range and this is the BEST ONE, others you can't take a picture because its too dark ( even though theres a lot of light!) This has a flash so no need to worry. Great camera for the price. Buy it if you want a camera with SOME clarity, ( NOT the best) but good for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time digital camera owners.....look somewhere else","review":"I bought this camera to post pictures on a woodworking bulletin board I frequent. Every picture I took needed to be enhanced dramatically. The flash on this camera usually over exposes some of the picture and when you take the same picture without the flash it's under exposed, thus the need for photo enhancing.Do what you can to get a 1.3 Megapixel or higher for your first digital camera. With the prices getting lower, I just don't think cameras under 1 megapixel can compete with the first time users picture quality expectation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very frustrating camera!","review":"This camera was purchased with ebay listings in mind.

It is all true!! I was part of the U. S. Army Chemical Research Development Engineering Center at Edgewood Arsonal back in the late 1980's. I assisted with the testing of the xm-22, xm-21, cadnet, nbc recon. vehicle (a m-113 that got its butt kicked by the then west german fuchs vehicle) and other systems. There were times that you just had to shake your head at the way the officers and civilians conducted some of the tests. The Col is right on the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference","review":"A very interesting book that not only details certain aspects of the defense procurement culture, but also goes into the politics of some of the different services. While the focus is primarily on the Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, there are other great bits of information (such as the creation of the F-16) and amusing stories (any involving the \\"Blitzfighter\\" aircraft).The DOD politics that the author experiences are fascinating, and remain relevant today. One example is the discussion of the A-10, its amazing record in the 1991 Gulf War, and how the Air Force really hates it and the close air support role it plays (today the Air Force is moving towards replacing the A-10 with higher flying, faster planes for the close air support missions).Overall this book is an important read for anyone interested not only in defense procurement, but DOD politics and modern warfare as well. A good book to have as a reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Good.","review":"I've owned these headphones for about 6 months. I liked them so much I bought a second pair and I keep one at work and one at home. I primarily use them to listen to classical piano and orchestral music, but occasionally listen to rock and jazz.They are well made, although made in China. Construction quality appears to be top notch. They are very comfortable for extended wearing. They have a 55 ohm impedance, so they should have fewer problems than Grados for amps that have coupling problems with low impedance phones.They are large, and not suitable for extreme portability, and as another reviewer noted, semi-open, so not the best where noise isolation is desired, such as on an airplane. At home and in the office, however, these are my first choice. I've seen them priced between $40 and $200, so it pays to shop around.They also appear to have been discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something's lacking","review":"This CD features what might be called elevator polka music. It would be good Muzak in an office full of polka lovers. An electronic organ by itself just doesn't cut it, even though today's instruments are a far cry from those played in the 50s by Ken Griffin. A real bass fiddle should replace the organ pedals, with perhaps a trumpet and some vocals added as well. Listening to any of these tracks reminds me of the \\"real\\" versions I have heard by other artists, even when there have been several \\"real\\" versions which have not reminded me of each other. Better choices would be CDs by Frankie Yankovic, Jimmy Sturr, or Joey Miskulin, or by Fred Ziwich and the International Sound Machine (you'll have to browse by the \\"polka\\" keyword to find the latter). The Happy Organ needs a little help."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you","review":"It would be a mistake, I think, to sign on here after one or even two times listening to The Else and write a review. When I first listened, I was disappointed. I really liked I'm Impressed and The Mesopotamians, but in between, I worried that TMBG might be losing their touch. Nope - I just hadn't grown into this CD yet. Now I really enjoy about 9 of the 13 songs, and only dislike one. It is an excellent entry into the catalog, and may they keep producing this great music which I love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compared to the previous 11 releases....","review":"...it's just ok. I first learned of them when my college roommate played me his \\"They Might Be Giants\\" album (the debut) back in 1987. I loved it. When \\"Lincoln\\" came out, I was *really* hooked. I've managed to find something I really liked on all their releases...even found stuff I liked on \\"Mink Car\\". I also realize that it takes 3-5 compelte listens before their stuff starts to stick. I've listened to this one 10 times and only like 2 tunes, \\"Climbing The Walls\\" and \\"Bee of The Bird of The Moth\\". \\"Take Out The Trash\\" is just awful. I can't help but agree with the \\"it is over-produced\\" comments.Heck, maybe after a few dozen more listens I'll finally get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst yet","review":"I thought The Spine was their worst album, but it has been defeated by the dismal The Else. Past albums have had a blend of fun, witty, often-educational lyrics with decent-to-great music. This album has uninspired lyrics that are upstaged in the mix by bland music. Top it off with a mere 38 minute run-time and you've got a horrible value. To add insult to (metaphorical) injury, I did not get the bonus disc (which I probably would have liked). The ONLY good song on the album (and the only reason I'm giving it two stars) is The Mesopotamians - good music and a fun lyrical concept. The rest of the album, well, isn't. I am sorely disappointed. After 20+ years of listening to TMBG, this will likely be the last album of theirs I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"After 2004's dismal The Spine TMBG are back to add insult to injury with this logical extension of that impression of a high school garage band discovering modern electronics. The drum parts are relentlessly rudimentary miring these songs in a mid-tempo plod that is the antithesis of the playful peppyness these guys made a name for themselves with in the 80s and 90s. The Else is pretty indisputably the band's least melodic album, as well as the worst produced, every instrument compressed into a muffled mid-range \\"i just got protools and i don't know wtf i'm doing\\" drone. Possibly Stephen Hawking could shed some light on how the band that wrote Put Your Hand Inside The Puppet Head, Birdhouse In Your Soul and Dr Worm could take any pride in a single song on this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Might Be Gods!","review":"John and John have done it again. Not just one, but two discs full of TMBG greatness. Just when you think they can't come up with anything more crazy than before, they release songs like \\"Why Did you Grow a Beard\\" and \\"The Mesopatamians.\\" Sometimes I wonder where in the world they get the ideas for these songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Scoop","review":"This is a good, not great, TMBG CD. In my view, the best songs are The Mesopotamians, Bee of a Bird of a Moth, The Cap'm and Upside Down Frown. All of these are absolutely great and, themselves, worth the price of the CD. The Cap'm really grew on me and is fantastic live.People seem to want something \\"new\\" from this band. Not me. If the band can continue to put out great TMBG songs that would fit in equally well on Flood, Factory Showroom, or The Else, that would be just fine with me. And for those who malign The Spine, Memo to Human Resources ranks with the very best TMBG songs of all time. Keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sponge-worthy Else","review":"I'm never disappointed by TMBG's albums and the Else is no exception. The mood is set right off the top with I'm Impressed and continues through The Mesopotamians. I do think there are standout songs on this album, especially Withered Hope, which I found myself listening to on endless repeat in the car yesterday. The arrangements on this album both harken back to other TMBG music and look forward. I've seen many, many concerts by the Giants and can't wait to hear Withered Hope and Cap'n live!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best","review":"I've been a great tmbg fan ever since Flood came out, but this one never really caught on with me.

It's a good thing there is a tiny light on the part that fits into the cigarette lighter receptacle, otherwise one would never know if it is getting power. I haven't owned the cord for very long and just recently thought about checking the fuses in my car to see if any were burned out. I replaced the burned-out fuse and tried it again. It only lasted two times before blowing the fuse again. Needless to say, I wasted big bucks on something that looked good, but didn't work worth a darn!

In this case, the story involves a young couple hoping to expose a underground religious cult as fraudulent. Marling, who co-wrote the screenplay, does a superb job of portraying the leader of the cult, Maggie, who claims to have come from the future. Whether she is actually a time traveler or some kind of fanatical zealot becomes the central question of the film; one which Marling never explicitly answers, preferring to let the audience draw their own conclusions. This is hardly a slick production, but I prefer this type of film to much of the fare being produced by the big studios today. I predict we will continue to see growth and good things from marling in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enyoyeable but questions linger","review":"Good acting and dramatic scenes.

There is some cushioning in the insole. I ordered a pair in Black Multi, in my usual size. They fit well, and are \\"true to size\\". I love the style, and the heel height is great (not too short/not too tall), just trying to decide if the black-multi print is too \\"young\\" looking. If I don't keep this pair, I will at least swap it for another color."},{"rating":"1","title":"none too pleased","review":"This shoe sure looks good, but the insole is so slick that your foot keeps sliding into the shoe. Plus, for some reason the 'last' does not seem like it was made for a real woman's foot. But I was desperate for a gray shoe. Until a better one comes out, I'll be using this one and complaining that my feet hurt throughout the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"These shoes were ok. I almost returned them and then decided to hold onto them thinking maybe I would change my mind--I haven't. The fit is tight (esp. width) and they're just really uncomfortable.

When I came across this book I wasn't sure if I could adpat them for the age group I teach. Was I wrong!

If you need to teach science to children this is the book to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid-friendly science experiments","review":"This book was very helpful in developing a unit about the scientific process for second graders. It has great visuals and child-friendly explanations and directions. The materials are not difficult to obtain. The way the book is published (spiral bound & hard covered for a very reasonable price) is durable for repeated use by teachers and students."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Science Experiment Book!","review":"I purchased this book in the last month to use in our homeschool curriculum and it has exceeded my expectations! The directions, pictures, explanations are easy to follow and the book uses common household products to make the experiments listed. My husband was home yesterday d/t holiday and even got in on the experiment we did yesterday (deep sea diver) - for a density experiment - all involved had an absolute blast. My kids are 5 and 3 that are utilizing this book. It is a book that can be used over and over as my children grow and wish more in depth explanations. I have never been disappointed with any product put out by 'priddy books'. I recommend this book highly! :) I paid $10.17 for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to buy in bulk","review":"These are a great basic paper towel. I usually purchase these at my grocery store for $0.99 a roll, but I was sick of buying them individually. The 15 rolls at a time is much more convenient if you have a place to put them. I haven't found a warehouse store that sells Marcal and I prefer this brand because they are recycled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their recycled toilet paper","review":"Marcal makes a great recycled toilet paper. It's all we use. But their paper towels are pretty pitiful. Try to tear one off, and it rips jagged, not on the perforated line. I prefer seventh generation recycled paper towels. Once I get through this case of Marcal, my next will be seventh generation. Mind you, recycled paper towels of any brand aren't as \\"nice\\" as Bounty, Viva & such. But still, I'd use even these lousy ones over non-recycled any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Make it Better!","review":"I bought this item since it is recycled, but it is too thin and doesn't obsorb much. The plus is that it doesn't have much lint either.

This book is a must read book for the ages of 12 and up. It containes a large amount of adventure and a little romance but not much. The author has expressed the life of the past in the way of Dugeons & Dragons. The book is revolved around a man named Theylvin Fox Eyes, even though that isn't his real name. He is an orphan that comes from an un-know race of warriors that have remarkable abilities compared to no other race except the immoratals. I give this book a rating of 4 because it has a large amount of fantasy, suspense, mystery, and adventure. The other reason is simply based because I have read many books and this book is a excelent book to read! I hope you like the book if you will or have read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea, colors and sizing a bit off","review":"Awesome concept and my daughter did not seem to want to take it off, except that the band was much smaller than expected. I measured her head and compared it against the product description. I got her the band at 13 months but it was already on the very end of the velcro. I will have to return it for a medium.

I can not tell you how very sad, angry, and disappointed I was when I opened this today. It was meant to be a birthday gift for a very close friend of mind in 2 days. I can not give her this horrible piece of carnival trash. I would be at a loss to explain just what it is. I will be returning it tomorrow, and requesting the full amount of the product, and the 20.00 shipping fees. That's to ensure the promise it arrives not broken. Wish it had broke....

Like most things Vitiello touches, it sounds convoluted, dull and flat. Perhaps, he's a good scholar, but his own poetry in English is as dull, flat and convoluted as all of his translations. The other translator would do well to stay away from him as he gives her work a bad name. He simply doesn't understand English and its idioms well enough to do a good job of translation.A reader from Paterson Community College"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought everybody knew this stuff...","review":"I was disappointed in this book; very little in it was not common sense.

The title should have been something like, \\"A Lady Does or Does Not . . . .\\" The book gives many \\"lady\\" imperatives, but does not give as many specifics on \\"HOW to Be a Lady.\\" An example is the imperative, \\"A lady knows when it is acceptable to drink through a straw.\\" That's it; there is no further information as to the next obvious question: When is it acceptable for a lady to drink through a straw? Also it bothered me about some incorrect grammar. I know that \\"a lady does not correct another's grammar,\\" but in these published words, someone fell down on the job of editing. There were several instances of incorrect subject-verb agreement. One would expect a lady to know better or know that she needs aid in the written English before putting ink to published page. Overall this book is too simplistic and does not live up to the title of \\"HOW To Be a Lady.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and to put it politely, \\"it stunk!\\"","review":"This book was trite. I bought it with high hopes and it did have some worthwhile pointers, but it seemed to be disorganized and the information wasn't laid out in a way that you could refer to it. I read through the whole thing in a couple of hours and the one pointer that came up about 3 or 4 times was how it was not lady-like to leave sanitary napkins in other people's homes if you are an overnight guest. This struck me as strange not only because it was mentioned at least 4 times, but I cannot imagine \\"packing-out\\" my trash like this, especially if I were a guest for a number of days. It also mentioned what a lady does when she's had to much to drink, I think that it is not lady-like to have so much to drink that you cannot get home, etc. it probably should mention that over-indulging is not lady-like.

As a collector of style and etiquette books, I thought this book would be one that I would really enjoy. It turned out to be a disappointment. The advice was vague and obvious and it wasn't all that much fun to read. An interesting note: Brooks Brothers has started selling this book along with several other similar ones at their stores. I bought one called \\"how to raise a lady\\". It was also a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The book is written on a phrase-by-phrase basis about simple, common-sense issues.

While requiring understanding of the basics of the software, more advanced features are expertly covered and demonstrated with tutorials. The book is not just a technical manual, but a great guide to trueSpace4 and 3D modeling in general; moreover it contains several elements relating to the artistic design side of 3D graphics. If you use trueSpace4, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sure I've seen these before","review":"And I have. Frank used to run a tutorials site which contained a large portion of the content of this book FOR FREE. Many of the techniques for character modeling were outdated years before this book was even published. The section on special effects using spheres is especially disheartening, since trueSpace has had many plugins available for some time that were created for particle effects and other special effects. This is a decent book for a beginner, but to REALLY get to know the program, and if you can get a hold of it, pick up Peter Plantecs' trueSpace2 Bible. Since most of the features in trueSpace2 are in trueSpace 4, you can get that book cheaper and it's written MUCH better, and many of the tutorials in Inside trueSpace4 were written FOR trueSpace 2, you'd be better off"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I really liked this book. As long as you are familiar with truespace this book will be very helpful. The only problem is that it covers a lot of info in a very short time. It covers many different modeling techniques and the tutorials come out to be only a couple pages long. If you can get over that it will be a great referance for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional tutorials and easy to understand writing.","review":"So far the best book on Truespace.

Don't buy this book. Put the money in a fund to purchase better 3D software. I have abandoned Truespace entirely as I believed most serious 3D artists had. It's not the author's fault. It's just outdated software which might explain why no one has written a book about using it in over 4 years even though newer versions keep coming out.

I had no idea however that she was a musician with 2 CDs out too, and I was blown away when I started to listen to Seastories. I was immediately hooked. She has a bittersweet style that is gentle, melancholic, and completely real and grounded (a surprise for a big actress). I've been listening to the CD for the last couple of days and can't get some of the songs out of my head. They are like ear candy--pleasantly melodic with an emotional presence that hits the spot perfectly. I can't believe that this album--with its folksy/dream pop/atmospheric sound and slight country tinge at times--was made by a British actress!

Probably because the media spotlight has always been on her and her story has always been so mysterious.

The book takes it's information through interviews and other books (about the Presley's). The only thing that would be better is if LMP would write an autobiography, but maybe a few more scandals and mishaps later, she might.

And, with each category she says more.

The plot is predictable and dull, not to mention the characters are native and annoying. Alex is the type of girl who still believes in cooties, while Stacey is annoying just for the sake of it.

As the story continues, Stacy tells Alex that it's obvious Simon has feelings for her, and not just student-teacher feelings. Alex starts to believe these lies though they aren't true, and Tim, Alex's best friend believes them too and gets jealous. Alex starts to be suspicious of Simon's actions especially on a class camping trip. When she visits Stacy's house and finds out a little bit about Stacy's family, she realizes she has made a terrible mistake - but it's too late.

I read the manual and it said replace cartridge or clean. So, thinking I may have gotten a bum black cartrige I wasted another 21 dollars on another black cartrige, but the light keeps blinking. I even cleaned the new cartridge as indicated in the manual.If printer manufactures are going to make junk printers to sell over priced ink then they should make them to last at least one cartrige change.This printer will go into the garbage. I guess I will try a Cannon next, since within the last year I had to dump an Epson because it was hopelessly clogged. I wish I had my old ten year old inkjet printer that just kept plugging away. I changed out for speed, but instead got one of the new throw-aways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast but drinks ink like a fish.

Sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't. Tech service was no help. My biggest complaint is the ink! The cartridges for this thing are the most expensive HP offers and there are no generics out there yet. To make matters worse it drinks ink like a fish! I think HP is trying to make too much money on the ink these days. My next printer will not be an HP."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP 6540 Printer","review":"This is one of the few printers compatible with the MSNTV2 Internet system.

Copies (both black and white and color) are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet printer","review":"I use this at home for printing the occasional paper, directions, or rarely photos. It does these functions very well.One thing I always shop for is the size of the ink cartridges and this printer is capable of taking huge 20+ ml black cartridges, which really cuts down on the cost of running it. I've had it for four years and I replace the cartridge once or twice a year. Printing photos tends to eat up the color cartridge, so I do that sparingly or have them done at a lab. I find the tricolor cartridge actually makes nicer pictures than the photo cartridge. Never tried the grayscale.It works great in draft mode. I almost never go for normal or photo mode. It's fast too.There are newer versions of this printer that cost less, have ethernet and wireless. If I had to buy it again I'd probably go for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of Junk, HP cheaps it out again","review":"This printer will fool you into thinking it is a \\"robust\\" business class machine. It isn't, the retaining clips on the springs for the cartridge holders make chinese toys look like Tonka toys. It's an obvious flaw that's designed to last about long enough to get through the warranty period then leave the user with a $125 paperweight.I haven't seen such an obvious piece of designed weakness since the HP2000 series, oh wait, that was another HP business class printer wasn't it. HP are resting on their laurels as far as actually producing a quality small business machine. Do Not Buy This Junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Brittle Ink Cartridge Holders","review":"The ink cartridge holders are very fragile. There is a tiny plastic stub that holds a giant spring that senses that a cartridge is in place or not. The stub on the black ink cartridge holder broke, so the printer would sometimes not sense that it had a cartridge in it. More importantly, the loose spring soon poked a hole in the printed circuitry that connects to the cartridge, so it broke completely. This seems like a poor engineering idea, to have cheap printed circuitry (like metallic ink on heavy paper) next to a sharp spring.I have read reviews of the HP Deskjet 6940 (the new version of this printer), and it seems that it has the same exact problem.While the printer was working, it printed with good quality. However, the printer would stall often. It would start a print job, and then get confused or something and would just stop. Sometimes, it restarted the job and finished properly, but sometimes I had to manually end the job and just reprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't recommend this printer","review":"I haven't written many bad reviews on amazon because I usually research products well and rarely have problems with what I buy. This printer was, sadly, my first and last HP product. I bought it just about three years ago online and am now about to put it up on craigslist for free. In short, the light for the black ink cartridge started blinking and when I went to replace it I noticed that a small plastic tab for the spring which aligns the cartridge was broken. Without this plastic piece - the spring can not hold the cartridge in the correct position and the printer won't work. I live in New York City and can not find someone who can replace the housing the cartridges sit in. HP tech support was little help and so, after less than 20 printing jobs (I rarely use a printer at home) I'll have to get rid of what appears to be a perfectly good machine. Hence, I can not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pooped out after changing color cartridge","review":"I had the same problem as another user of this printer only it was when changing the color cartridge. I worked with an HP technician and they could not help me. Basically the printer melted down after I attempted to change the tri-color cartridge. It would no longer recognize the cartridge even after cleaning the cartridge and the printer contacts. It will not print correctly with the black cartridge either now.

To my displeasure, I found the novel wanting. It was lacking in suspense; both in plot and in character development. The main character 'aged' 20+ years throughout the course of the novel, but his outlook remained stagnant. Some readers/reviewers might consider his laconic and meandering personality to be refreshing, charmingly hard-boiled or amusing. I found it to be boring.

My brain was sensing the movement but the stomach was calm. My next experience was on an airplane flying home in some turbulent weather. Although it was a scary experience, my stomach did not get the nausea signals from the brain at all. This is a remarkable product.

It's easy enough to figure out by the actual pop ups and the geometric ratios provided. There were some elements I have never seen before and a lot that I had seen before. It was nice that there is a lift up flap in the back where you can observe the inner workings and easily take it apart if needed.It's a nice reference book for all kinds of folds and pop ups plus some fun motion type cards that don't actually pop up but move. If you are already comfortable with making action cards or pop ups, you will enjoy this book. If you are a newbie to this kind of card, you may be frustrated by the lack of measurements and instructions to make each element. Don't buy the book if you need someone to dictate exactly how to make the element."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book plus author's website has bonus dies to download","review":"I love this book. It's an excellent learning tool. The almost explosive front pop-up incorporates all the elements in the book, then each one is explained and demonstrated separately. I particularly liked the noise making pop-up, which had a saw-toothed mechanism. In visiting the author's web site I found he had dies (pdf models to cut out) for the elements in the book under \\"surprise\\". I think, considering the hand made nature of the book, and production costs, its price is not unreasonable. Another good book for learning paper engineering in which you construct the models isPaper Engineering for Pop-Up Books and Cards"},{"rating":"2","title":"For the beginner and then some","review":"This book is wonderful.

Jerry, Bobby, and Pig Pen all have their time on lead vocals and each have strong moments. The re-working of Not Fade Away is just great as Bobby's vocals and Jerry's guitar bring the song to new heights not acheived on previous versions. Then the jam and the intro to Going Down The Road Feeling Bad just sounds so darn creative. Bertha is performed with such spirit that you tend to overlook Jerry's technical flaws in the vocal department. The feeling he puts into the song overides any moments that he wavers off key. Me And Bobbie McKee is another finely reworked cover with some excellent drum work by Bill Kreutzman. The Other One is a bit dull in spots but otherwise this is fine recording of the band at its best, which is Live In Concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Princess Diaries: Princess in the spotlight","review":"I think it is one of the best books I have ever read !

That explains the book perfectly. Let me tell you, I just got done with this book 5 minutes ago... and I enjoyed every second of this delightful reading! This book it so cool because it's a story about this girl (Mia) who is actually the princess of a whole country! As many people saw the movie that Disney came out with, you'd probably know that already. But besides the whole princess thing.. Mia is just a regualar teenage girl! And while she's stuggling in school - algebra to be exact, her algebra teacher and mom are dating! And as if that wasn't enough.. her mom became pregnant! And then.. she almost got on of her teachers fired! When will Mia learn to think before she talks?! Well.. at least in this book, she doesn't. The words come out of this book like a rush of water!

And I think the book was not appropriate for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"My ten-year old daughter brought this book home from her school library. After I showed the principal the text on page five he pulled the book from the school and destroyed it. If you'd let your daughter watch an episode of Jerry Springer and call it educational television, then this is the book for you. Not only is the story pathetically lame (to the point of boredom) and chock-full of neurotic characters, the author has filled page after page with filth. I'd love to print what you'll actually see in the book, but am afraid they wouldn't be able to post my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR YOUNG ADULTS.","review":"The content of this book deals with Adult problems. To say this book is recommended for a Young Adult is missleading.

Very Dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crude","review":"While Princess in the Spotlight is a well-written, somewhat interesting story, I will not give it to my 9 year old to read. I haven't decided about whether I'll toss it into the trash or donate it to the library. It's an entertaining, light read. The characters are quite flat and the plot is predictable, but if you want something mindless for a blue day, you'll probably enjoy this one.Princess Mia isn't terribly bright, and I'm not talking about her algebra grades. She does strike me as the perfect stereotype of a thoughtless and crude teenage girl. Fortunately, not all teenage girls fit this cookie cutter. If you would prefer that your daughter not conform to the dubious \\"norm\\", I would not recommend this book. It can hardly be considered a classic, and there are much better uses for her time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic and Funny","review":"This book follows the plot of the first book, but Mia gets forced to do an online interview, while her mother is pregnant and engaged with Mia's algebra teacher. Very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Princess in the Spotlight","review":"This book was a great continuation to the first book and motion picture The Princess Diaries. Between her mother's surprising news, e-mails from a secret admirer, and failing algebra, you discover Amelia's life as a princess isn't as easy as you may think in this modern day fairytale. This young adult fiction novel will appeal to all the preteen and teen princesses at heart. As a teenager myself I laughed along as Mia and her friends shared many of the same experiences that are similar to ones I have had in my own life. The diary format of the book makes you feel like you're at home in your room reading your own diary. This is a book that will stick to your fingers like superglue; you definitely won't want to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want more!","review":"When I finished reading this book, it left me wanting more. And those are type of the books that I like to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, light read","review":"This book was cute but incredibly unrealistic. I mean, a princess? One that appears on TV and everything?*SPOILER ALERT*The secret admirer thing was cute, but it totally couldn't have been Michael. I'm suprised that Mia didn't figure that earlier either. It kind of disappointed me a little bit at the end because Mia hooked up with Kenny. He's seems sweet, but she doesn't like him! The whole thing with Hank and Lilly, and he being an aspiring model was not necessary, in my opinion. I suppose it might have been some light-hearted humor or something. It also kind of pissed me off how, IN THE END, Michael complimented Mia, you know, after she said 'yes' to Kenny. God, what's wrong with boys...some are too shy and some are too arrogant.Overall, 'Princess in the Spotlight' is a quick, easy read if you're looking for and entertaining, enjoyable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!","review":"You usually think that sequels to books suck (with the exception of harry potter of course). This book proved that wrong. Meg Cabot obviously doesn't get lazy on the job. There was not one boring part of this book. it curioisly kept me hanging on every word. girls whether 9-90 should read this book because it has all sorts of characters that you can relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-centered, intolerable Princess Mia","review":"I have a soft spot for good young adult fiction and this is not it. I cannot understand the popularity of this series. Mia is not just self-centered and whiny, but she is incredibly judgmental of everyone around her, including her mother and best friend. She seems to be stuck in one gear: complain and tear everyone else down. She comes across as a brat to the core in a way that has nothing to do with being a princess! I agree with other reviewers who said that the soapy drama and focus on emerging sexuality are not appropriate for 10 year olds--and this book came home from an elementary classroom. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good book by Meg Cabot!","review":"There is some bad language in this book, but what do you expect? It was very humerous, and I liked this one a little better than the first. I suggest starting out with the first Princess Diary book, Volume 1. My favorite part in this book, is when Martha Stewart fashions a crown and wand for Mia. : )Have fun reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy sequel","review":"All I can say is, if you enjoyed reading THE PRINCESS DIARIES, then this one's bound to be a hoot for you too. In PRINCESS IN THE SPOTLIGHT Mia's adventures continue, but we have more of the same snideness and wittiness typical of America's Royal (as Mia is known). She's really funny, and not your typical princess that it's quite a bit of fun to stay tuned to the unfolding story of her life.I didn't quite like the turn of events at the end, but hey, that's what Book Number Three is for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as great as PRINCESS DIARIES, but still good.","review":"I read this book in two days.

I can't wait for PRINCESS IN LOVE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"The Princess Diaries\\"","review":"This book is more bittersweet and realistic than volume 1 because this focuses a little more on Mia's personal life than her royal life. I loved this book but recommend it only if you're over 12."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!","review":"I've been waiting so long to get this book, and what I read did not disappoint. Mia is such a lovable and realistic heroine. The book started at a fast pace and kept going until the last page, leaving plenty of room for a sequel. We finally get to see Mia's father show some backbone to Grandmere. Mia's unrequited love for Michael Mascowitz remains unresolved though at the end of the book. This book was brilliantly written, in the refreshingly real style of its prequel. I think that Princess in the Spotlight has truly liven up to Cabot's first book. I only regret that it wasn't longer, and that I couldn't have read more about Mia's escapades.

Now there is also the compnent of a secret admirer. Who could it be? I liked this book because it took away some of the stress in my life by letting me examine other peoples' problems.

It works with the Dowelmax, which as far as I know, is the only doweling tool that accomodates it. You really need a doweling tool if you are going to mess with doweling, so don't buy the bit unless you have the Dowelmax. It creates a slightly larger hole than 3/8\\" (by 0.2 mm), which is actually the perfect sized hole for doweling, permitting your glue to squeeze out around your dowel and speeding up the whole operation. The extra diameter will not result in a weaker joint; they are still snug when the glue sets. The bits themselves are sharp, inexpensive, and so far have lasted through hundreds of dowel holes in various hardwoods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching Reading - What do I do?","review":"Regie Routman knows what it is to be a teacher - harassed and overworked and at them mercy of politicians and departments who think they know better.

I own several Larin products and am very pleased with them. However, i was very disappointed with this dolly set. The metal is rather flimsy and bends rather easy when the weight of the ATV is on them. The weakest part i would say is the casters that the company has chosen to use. I had two casters fall apart before i even got a chance to use them, all of the ball bearings came out and had to replace the units myself. My first attempt to use them resulted in one of the casters snapping in half and shooting bearing all over the garage floor. That was the last straw that i was going to take and i sent them back.

With the variations of subject matter in a dictionary, each article needs attribution.The editors shoot themselves in the feet by admonishments of a sectarian nature.Also not acceptible in an academic instrument is the use of BC/AD. This is disrespectful to those who use the dictionary who are not Christian. The accepted practice in academic circles is BCE/CE.

I was digging through some old vinyl recently and came across 'It's a Beautiful Day' which sent me spinning off into all those forgotten/lost/lent LP's. The tracks from BST still come clearly to mind to this day - and I'm about to try and place an order for the CD. I'm no jazz fan, but something about this album really had me spell-bound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Band... ever","review":"If you have even an iota of musical taste, this CD is beyond essential. B,S&T changed the face of music more than any other group in the last 50 years, including the Beatles.This CD is espescially important, as it opens the sound that was muddled by Al Kooper in the first, and the hornline truly gets to rip. The solos are top-caliber, the vocals inimitable, and the sheer musicianship unmatched by any band since. Some tunes such as \\"Smiling Phases\\" and \\"More and More\\" are the greatest jazz/rock on the market today.If you love jazz, rock, or ever listen to music, this recording is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It Never Gets Old","review":"I've been listening to this music since it came out as an LP. It's a great collection of songs four or five of which are among my all time favorites. It Never gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"one for the ages","review":"This great masterpiece defies categorization. It has clear classical roots, with themes derived from Eric Satie. It has clear jazz influences, and blues. And at the same time, it delivers hard driving rock and roll, powered by the man with perhaps the greatest voice in rock history, David Clayton-Thomas. The brass are fabulous (the revolutionary concept of having a rock album with brass providing the basic orchestration directly foreshadows the group Chicago), the singles are fabulous (You Made Me So Very Happy, Spinning Wheel), the remake of the Billie Holiday classic God Bless the Child is a revelation, More and More is just fun driving rock, And When I Die is a satirical masterpiece. Do you get the feeling I like this album? And to top it all, it sounds just as fresh today as thirty years ago. A desert island rock CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest here...","review":"OK. Just because people have the ability to play intruments does NOT mean they are talented musicians. BS&T create songs that make you want to crack your skull open and scoop out your own brain, just to escape the stupid melodies, rhythms and lyrics. \\"Spinning Wheel\\" is nothing short of ridiculous. Everything else is nauseating. I'm not trying to be negative or anything. These guys quite obviously have the ability to play their respective instruments. They just fail miserably at making good music from that ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful, Relaxing and Fulfilling","review":"Unlike some of their later efforts, this one really sounds as though all the musicians were in it for the love of the music, and were enjoying themselves.This album wreaks (in a nice way) of laid back jazz. Obviously, by the late 60's most jazz had taken a more rock based route than before. However that's not to say that bands like BS&T;'s and Chicago sold out at all, just that they were following the trend of evolution- one thing giving way to another.This may be more rock based, but the Jazz soul is still shining in this music.If you have enjoyed another of BS&T;'s album you should love this. If you've enjoyed another similar band like Chicago then once again this should be for you. And if you like 'proper' classic Jazz, I should say you'll enjoy this. If not, you can always write a disgusted review about how great classic jazz was in comparrason.Anway, I'll say (or rather write) Toodle Pipskie (Is that how you spell it?) now- Toodle Pipskie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Updated BST (2)","review":"This is a nice update of BS&T's second album, originally released in 1969. It is the first one with David Clayton-Thomas as lead singer. This new CD is digitally remastered, and seems to have a technically better sound than the original. I particularly noticed crisper highs. Also two previously un-released live tracks - \\"More and More\\" and \\"Smiling Phases\\", both recorded at the Cafe Au Go Go (NYC) in August 1968, two months prior to the studio recording for this album. Both arrangements are quite different than the studio versions, and fun to listen to. If you like BST, get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blood Sweat & Tears - Timeless Entertainment","review":"Years earlier, I had a cassette tape of this album and loved every cut of it. Recently, I purchased the updated, remastered CD and relived the enjoyment once again but in an updated format that really brings out the music like never before. The instrumentation and lyrics combine in a crisp blend of rock, jazz and even classical music and the strong voice of lead singer David Clayton Thomas completes the production with beautiful results. If you like contemporary rock music with a strong brass section (like Chicago, for example), you can't go wrong with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I had not listened to a lot of Blood Sweat and Tears until purchasing this album and instantly it became one of my favorites.The clarity of these MO-Fi Gold disks is fantastic,the Horns and Percussion just come right out ,I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down","review":"I finally got my switcher, reset my tv and cable box and the thing would not work with my TV.

And after this purchase that still remains the case. The switch works perfectly and looks and feels very well constructed. I have seen some people complain that there is no on/off switch but it doesn't really matter. There is no real need to turn it off. This thing at the worst is gonna cost you about $.01 a month if left on at all times. The only cons that I could think of is that unlike all the other PureAV products I have purchased, this one was a little more on the high side compared to similar products.

Even though Mr. Tyler's erotica has explicit details, the book read like a list of sexual acts instead of a sensual poetic expression of feeling. I felt no connection to the writer or the subject of the poetry. I think most of the women who enjoyed the book so much, have met Mr. Tyler personally. These ladies would probably agree that he is fine with a capital F, and that fact adds to their appreciation of his poetry more than its literary value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Book","review":"This man has a special gift.

This wonderfully quaint literary work will encourage and inspire women who may feel there aren't any good men out there not to give up just yet. Tyler reveals in his intimate, thoughtful and tastefully erotic collection, that there are men who know what a woman wants to feel and will stop at nothing to make sure she feels it. Tyler's sneek peak at his own intimacy will encourage all women not to settle for less.. so kick back and let your imagination explore I Thought About You Today, and I promise after reading you will be reassured--- there are still men out there somewhere who can ignite your soul......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yeah!","review":"I began reading this book and had to put it down. This brotha has put together a book that will inspire, excite, arouse, entertain, and delight EVERYBODY. I recommend this book to women, couples who want to add to an already sizzling relationship, couples who want to spark the flame again, and couples whose flame has gone out. I will also recommend this book to the man who needs help in the romance department. This book will guarantee a romantic evening. Just let your imagination take over and throw caution to the wind.

He has been blessed with a wonderful gift. For those of you who only read sex in his words.....you've definitely missed the boat. His words invoke romance, passion and longing. Although the poems are explicit, they are certainly not vulgar. They are definitely for the mature audience. Mr. Tyler words takes women on a journey of creative expression and bodly goes where most men fear to tread.....male sensitivity and vulnerability. C'mon fellas, get out your pens and pads, the game has just been raised to the next level. Hats off to Vincent Tyler for a splendid work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think not","review":"Sigh. I read this book as part of celebrating poetry month. Thank God that I've had other exposure to poetry or else I'd have been turned off forever to the genre!I Thought About You Today is a very graphic and explicit account of sex acts. It is the written equivalent of the Spice Channel. It did not spark my imagination because nothing was left to the imagination. The language was often coarse and didn't flow well. I just couldn't get into this. It didn't draw me in to a world of sensuality and passion. It reflected a lust and just \\"doing it\\". By there way, there's more to pleasing a woman than just downtown action. I thought the book was boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Thought About You Today","review":"He's got me thinking or should I say dreaming! I definitely recommend this book. There's not a woman alive who can't be touched, aroused, courted or romanced by the words so deliciously written in I.T.A.Y.T. Its not just erotica, the pages are filled with wonderful words describing the beauty in women intellectually, emotionally and physically.For those of you in the dark you may need to set the mood a little bit. When you're in the need for a little romance, light yourself some candles, get a glass of wine, put on relaxing music and allow your self to be touched by Vincent Tyler. If you 're looking for a snack, I recommend \\"Chocolate Cookies\\". If you're looking for a real treat you should HEAR HIM READ.."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought about you today","review":"Ladies, if you crave romance with a dash of eroticism, \\"I Thought about You Today\\" is a must for your library.

I found it quite difficult trying to go from one page to the next. It was a hardening task trying to envelope myself into his work. I was unable to ride the waves of his words; there wasn't a natural rhythm that is so often involved within the lines of poetry. The flow was stagnant.Tyler's poetry was unable to captivate and deliver the essence of eroticism. The lines of poetry lacked that of romanticism. Tyler did however display images of foreplay and intercourse, But it lacked feelings. I was unable to feel what Tyler wanted to deliver on paper. I was unable to visualize the scene, but most importantly I was unable to hunger for more. Tyler failed to conceptualize the very core of an interlude. When reading about sexual relations the direction should always mirror back to romance, that of which \\"I Thought About You Today\\" failed to deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"MMMM, MMMM, MMMM","review":"Vincent is a poet and you know it.

As this novel aptly attests, smart financial people don't necessarily make good writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow characters, thin plot,, poor grammar, a real yawner","review":"This book was primarily an essay preaching Mr. Cook's doom and gloom view of the economy, using the pretense of a fictional novel. Character development was poor to non-existent. Grammar and punctuation was poor, and dialog was choppy and shallow. Many little vignettes with characters and situations totally unrelated to the rest of the \\"story\\" were included for some reason, but they did nothing to bolster the story line.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot is OK, writing is bad","review":"The plot was plausible, but characters are shallow and not developed well enough to be interesting. Token inclusion of sexual innuendos and scenes were trite, distracting, and unnecessary. A far better depicture of a collapse is \\"Patriots: Surviving the Coming Collapse\\" by Rawles. I would [buy] this book in paperback and throw it away, feeling fine. After spending [the money I did], I feel cheated. If [one is] going to charge as much as a proficient writer, [one] should write as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"The plot was plausible and interesting, even if breezily carried along. The editting left something to be desired and the writing was only one step above Larry Burkett's fiction attempts on economic collapse. I did not care for the shallow attempts to fill out characters by having them swear or describing their lewd stares at women's body parts - I started to view it as a sophmoric writing assignment. The main gist of the plot was good, and entertaining; it was just cluttered with faults and lapses in writing ability. I'd spend $8 on a paperback version if it were available, but $23 was way too much. A much better fiction account, with far better character and plot development, on an economic collapse is Rawles' \\"Patriots : Surviving the Coming Collapse\\" for $13."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic...","review":"Although vetiver is a wide common (and very popular) scent for eau de toilettes, eau de perfums, colognes and even deodorant sticks, is a little bit difficult to find a decent deodorant SPRAY with such aroma.

Why not five stars? Because of its price.

It vibrated a lot. Don't they bother to even test these before shipping them out? I thought I'd try to remove the wheels to see if it was a bad wheel or the grinder motor. The small wrench they supplied to hold the shaft so you can remove the outside nuts was at least one size too big. It wouldn't hold the shaft. I called the company, and their suggestion was to jam a piece of wood between the wheel and tool mount. That worked, but it was almost impossible to get the left nut off.

I explained its like new because I haven't used it but he said he couldn't do anything without a receipt. This warranty station is the same place where they warranty Dewalt and the Dewalt guy said if it was a Dewalt they would have covered it.

For one, they left a burr on the arbor that caused the left wheel to tilt noticably - not very good at 3500RPM! Also, both wheels were labeled identically, even though they were obviously different grits, and different colors. Needless to say, this unit went back, and my desire for Delta gear has lessened.I will say that the dual-speed option is very nice. I almost kept it to make it into a buffing station, but figured I could save several dollars by not buying wheels or guards.On another note, I purchased this to use with a Wolverine sharpening system. None of the current Delta units will work with the Wolverine since the mounting holes do not allow one to center the Wolverine base unit centered directly under the wheel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok grinder, speed controller quit working","review":"The grinder itself is a solid piece. No problems. Unfortunately, with only about 2 months of light use, the variable speed controller quit working. I have since had to move and it's likely no longer under warranty (been in storage.)

The shroud had to be removed to install this to me convenient accesory.The most agravating thing was the amount of spacers and ingenuity I had to invest to make the arrangement work and maintain the \\" tool less \\" capability to be able to quickly switch to a buffing/polishing wheel.

A must read book about good people!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is bad and wrong","review":"This book is bad and wrong. Full of misinformation and shaky characters. First it is hard to understand why the uptight nervouse freak of the mom and the free-spirited daughter would ever like each other even in the slightest. No child would come back home with a mom that crazy. And any nervous freak of a mother would commit such a child to an insane asylum just to keep her hold on her. And any child with a brain would blow off such an insane character of a mother. Second the colors of Wesleyan University are red and black not blue and yellow. Third, there are no valid and honest relationships in the whole book. The characters just use each other for their own hidden agendas which they are not even ever brave enough to voice but just silently torture and starve any humanity out of the other characters to death with. The writing absolutely stinks and there is no purpose to the book at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glyph Glitch","review":"Glyph was a disappointing book. For one thing, it was not as represented. The \\"satirical\\" premise, narration by an infant prodigy, might have been sustainable in a short story, but extended to book length, it grew tiresome.

She has smooth legs so she's easy to dress and her shoes are the best ballet shoes I've seen on a Ballerina Barbie since (maybe before as well). She has flexible joints for dancing which I loved as a kid. I've had her for the past 15 years(?) and she's still in nearly perfect condition even after being played with day after day all day for ~4 years. I bought another copy of her so I'll have a spare when I pass her onto my own kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing and Destructive","review":"I bought this book because it was required reading for a class at my university and I LOATHED it. This is a book about spiritual direction for CONSERVATIVE Christians, not all Christians. It exemplifies the very kind of patronizing, demeaning we-know-better-than-you attitude held by people who set themselves up as \\"experts\\" at spirituality, those who have the \\"right\\" beliefs about how to live. This attitude can be destructive to those who are in crisis or are spiritually vulnerable.There are so many good books on spiritual direction. This is not one of them.Try Henri Nouwen or Norene Vest's edited book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrash is back!","review":"Sadus features the workaholic Steve DiGeorgio, who also worked for Death and Iced Earth. this is old-school thrash at its best. thrash has not died, and Sadus is the key to bring it back! what new surprises come out for 2007 for the thrash metal genre? find out for yourself. on this album, all the tracks are worthy of a standing ovation, and if The Rock were still in WWE, the track \\"Smackdown\\" would be a good entrance theme for him. other bands to consider if you enjoyed this album are Kreator, Sodom, Destruction, Slayer, Demiricous, Testament, Overkill, Megadeth, Exodus, Flotsam & Jetsam, Rumpelstiltskin Grinder, and other great present-day thrash bands.

The details about making jewelry were fascinating, and there are plenty of interesting characters and plot twists to keep the reader intrigued. However, I didn't really sense that much attraction or commitment between Allegra and Todd, and it is this lack that left me feeling vaguely unsatisfied after finishing this book.

Rabinowitz is a superb writer but she makes her living working for the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, which is quite consciously a propaganda machine with no respect for intellectual honesty or even simple consistency. Rabinowitz is the very person who wrote the article accusing the President of the United States of committing rape on the basis of evidence much, much weaker than the evidence mustered by the prosecution in any one of the cases described here. The difference, needless to say, is that Rabinowitz didn't like the President. Her prejudices, rather than any respect for the truth, is the driving force behind this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another backlash book","review":"A far \\"Crueler Tyranny\\" is the victimization of a child by a trusted adult (priest, rabbi, teacher, coach, scout leader), and the subsequent revictimization by a society that abhors child abuse in the abstract, but tolerates it in reality.This is just another backlash book from an author who never met an accused child molester who she thinks wasn't railroaded into jail. While the jury and the prosecutors found the evidence compelling enough to convict, Rabinowitz states that one of the reasons she believes in \\"Tooky's\\" innocence is that his fellow inmates think he's innocent - that they really know who's guilty and who isn't. Someone needs to rebut this book, and challenge her in open debate, because of the harm that this backlash is doing, especially to discourage victims from coming forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable Research","review":"Read the Wenatchee portion of her book and realized she did not ask any hard questions of the people she feels were wronged.Actual statements of some of the accused as reported in the newspapers and in court of appeals records raises questions about Ms Rabinowitz's conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written but too brief.","review":"I have the greatest respect for Dorothy Rabinowitz and the work she did reporting on these stories; I credit her as much as anyone with the Amirault women being freed from jail. However, since I had read the articles she originally wrote about these cases, I found very little new in this book. I would have liked to have learned much more about the parents of the 'abused' children, the prosecutors bringing these cases, and particularly about the 'expert' witnesses who brain-washed the supposed child victims into making the accusations.I believe this is an important book, a permanent record of truly heinous prosecutorial misconduct. It could have been more, however, and I hope that the rest of this story will eventually be told."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"A gripping tour de force of the hysteria surrounding child sexual abuse cases in th 1980s by a veteran WSJ legal reporter.

Wait, Meg already is dead. Okay then leave the Earth for good. Only, someone wants to stop her and make sure she can't get to heaven. Find out if Meg will make it on your own by reading The Wish List.The content of the book kept me reading it, and I would often read it morning and night. It is well organized and makes sense in the order it's in. The content may not be one of those read-for-hours-on-end books, but it is good enough to make me read it.So, you still want to know what happens in the book? Well I'm not going to tell. Read the book for yourself and then you'll agree, the book deserves 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good v. Evil, and the consequences there of","review":"This book kind of had a Five People You meet in Heaven feel to it. Of course with all of Colfer's work it had humor and wit mixed in with it. The story is a pretty easy read from time stand point. You should be able to finish it on a rainy afternoon.As always Colfer delivers the unexpected, and he does not pull punches with the characters. There are some great themes this book sets forth. The idea for paying for your consequences is lost in today's society, and this book kind of sets that straight.Like the Supernaturalists I think this book hits about the Middle Grade kids. Anyone younger than this can expect to ask their parents a lot of questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"This book, while not a heavy hitter, was a fun read with some poignant moments.

In spite of the fact that I'm a Christian, I didn't find it offensive in any way, and the ideas were imaginative and great!I was worried that I would be disapointed, after loving the Artemis Fowl books so much, if 'The Wish List' wasn't very good, but the last thing I was was disapointed.I found the characters believable and funny, and the plot utterly fascinating. In spite of what other reviewers said about Meg, I thought that she was well-developed and realistic. Perhaps she seems more realistic to a teenager?I think this book is more for teens than adults, but should be enjoyable for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, although irreverent","review":"I was a bit skeptical about reading this, as a Christian, but I have thoroughly enjoyed Colfer's other books. I listened to this on CD twice in one week and it had me laughing out loud each time. Although the book is expectedly and limply resting on a secular, conscious-easing and commitment-reducing view of the afterlife, many of his off-the-cuff comments were surprisingly sincere. The reader makes each character delightfully unique (the accents are wonderful). Don't take it too seriously, but enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wish List","review":"This is an unusual book and shows again the fabulous imagination of Eion Colfer. It may be a childrens' book but it is gripping and entertaining - especially to someone in their second childhood!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Chris","review":"This review is mainly for people who were fans of the first three books, based of course on Artemis Fowl. The Wish List truly let me down. Expecting more originality and inventive plot twists from this author, I read the first 50 pages (or so) and found myself getting through it slower...and slower...and slower. I simply don't want to read about religious things; there is SO MUCH out there that a kids' author can build on with a little imagination, especially consider our growing base of science and technology. I sincerely do not feel that frightening children with the uneducated myths of older generations is what a kids' author should be doing. This is not recommended for fans of the first three books, as the originality (even for all the somewhat cliche' fairies, etc. in the Fowl books) has taken a downward turn. We can only hope that he returns to what he does well in his next book"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good book","review":"The Wish ListMeg yet again finds herself in a horrible twist, the choice between good and evil. Meg is about to be thrown into complete darkness. She is forced to go fix her mistakes after being killed in a huge gas explosion. In this story Meg is her own antagonist because of the foolish mistakes she made in her past. To fix her mistakes she must go and help a old man fulfill a list of bizarre wishes. Meg's goal is to do this before time runs out and she is sent into complete darkness. Eion Colfer writes a suspenseful, action, and emotionally driven story that makes you want to read it over and over again. This story is definitely plot driven because of Meg's goal and all the obstacles in the way, and all this just to get to heaven.Mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"amusing and undeniably pleasant","review":"I'm seventeen and I read this book at the urging of a friend...to my surprise, I found it to be highly enjoyable. I will not say that it was \\"great\\", exactly, but it was very pleasant, almost sweet in places, funny, ridiculous enough to make it light-hearted and yet still able to convey a deeper meaning. I particularly enjoyed the strange relationship between \\"Bub\\" and Peter...the whole thing reminded me quite a bit of Good Omens by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett, actually, although The Wish List was directed at a younger audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book, could not put it down.","review":"This was a very good book. In this book Meg Finn is stuck between heaven and the other place. To be able to get into heaven, she must help out the last person she robbed, Lowrie. One interesting thing is that the author has her fight to be able to get into heaven, the longer she waits the closer she gets to the other place. Because of this the author seems to be saying that if one just waits around, they wil get closer to the other place. It does change many things, such as St. Peter having a cell phone.It s avery clever and good book hat I would recommend to all 12+. It has many twists, and I Enjoyed it very much"},{"rating":"1","title":"bleh","review":"One of the audio tracks I burned on one of these cds will not play.

First, the back light only weakly illuminates the tiny LCD window, so if you use this window to display the date, you can't tell the time in the dark without pushing buttons to switch this display to time. Second, the band has a plastic spacer between the case and where the titanium part of the band starts.

Here is what got me: \\"There's plenty of culinary firepower in this group to be sure. But Carey's got some cooking chops of his own, plus an enviable attitude about why Creole food needed some contemporizing by his distinguished friends.\\" And later: \\"All in all, it's quite a collection: And future cookbook authors take note: this book's all-star cast approach is one worth exploring on other topics.\\"It is a great concept and I am happy to have recipes all in one place from the best chefs in New Orleans."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally one that i like","review":"I am so pleased to have finally found a Creole cook book that was written by a professional chef for serious amateurs or other professional chefs. Chef Carey's recipes are new and refreshing while still keeping in touch with classic Creole dishes. This book gave me a greater understanding of cooking Creole cuisine by using classic techniques that he emphasizes in each recipe. While reading and looking through the book I felt like I was in the kitchens of the French quarter restaurants that he highlights in the book. This is because of one of the unique features of the book, lagniappes, which are tidbits of information for each recipe. These lagniappes are great because they gave me a greater understanding of the recipe itself.

However, the novelty of this parody wore off quickly, and the humor was much darker than I had anticipated. I'm not sure that any book advising suicide (even in jest) would ever appeal to me.

I picked up a jar of this stuff and it's like magic! I rub a tiny film on the aching joint and the pain is nearly instantly gone. Depending on the intensity of the ache, sometimes a dull ache is left behind, but it's a huge relief from the crippling arthritis pain.The scent of the product is something like chai tea mixed with a bit of menthol. I was worried a bit at first that people would think I smelled weird, but I've come to like the scent, and my friends have assured me it doesn't smell bad. Also, it's not greasy. The balm has a redish tint to it, so I rub it into my skin until the tint is gone and it's like my skin absorbs it. There's no grease or film left behind to rub off onto clothes or anything else.I can't believe how quickly and how well this stuff works. I now keep the jar in my purse to use whenever I need it, and I'll continue to buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice toy that lasted only 1 season","review":"A fun toy, but slow, not very responsive and certainly not durable.

The ink flows evenly and does not smear once you let it dry for a few seconds. The ink can be applied to clear and opaque surfaces. Of course, since the ink is permanent, you cannot change any errors that you have written. The pen is small enough to allow some intricate designs. In general, I'm sure that this pen can be utilized in other manners of permanent labeling and for writing on CDs, it fits the bill nicely"},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I was surprised that the author is a historian, because the book struck me as a bit amateurish. The writing was contrived in places, and elliptical in others. I agree with the previous review's comment that there were too many names tossed in and it was hard to keep them straight. I also think the book presumes a more detailed understanding of French history than non-French people will have; notes would have been helpful in some places. I have enjoyed the books of Fraser and Foreman and will probably rely on them in future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good novel about a very powerful woman","review":"The tremendous research done to write this book is obvious.

For software such as dos, a reader needs instruction to be clear and concise. The content of this book was not clear nor concise. Rather it was obvious that the author was trying to squeez out as many pages as possible to fetch a better price. Furhtermore it was evident that the editor did not take much time on this one due to may mistakes resident in this text. I can't blame that person, in the ocean of needless words its hard to understand what she is trying to say, let alone figure out if she is right or wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definatly not worth buying","review":"I had to use this book for a beginning dos class. This book is extremely poorly written and over explains everything. The author spends entire chapters explaining each command including the very simple and basic commands and fails to thoroughly explain the more complex commands.

The only disadvantage of this video is that some of it is in Chinese and you have to wait and listen for the English translation before you really understand.

Looking at his autobiography of having published over 300 books on such a vast spectrum of subjects, I tend to believe \\"both\\" is the case.For brevity I only confine myself to pointing out that he cites Kharazmi, Biruni and Avicenna, all renowned Iranians, as great Arab scientists, perhaps because they wrote in Arabic.I have only read those parts of the book that were brought to my attention, needless to say that I have not bought the book.

Why were certain US government officials so determined to put forward, publicly, weak evidence of weapons of mass destruction, despite warnings from their military and intelligence experts that the interpretation of the evidence was not clear?It is clear to me that these issues will recur in the future.

I use it piped into my original factory auto level system. The factory system used air shocks. This allows me to pick from a better variety of shock absorbers. I picked Bilstein shocks and have loved them. My exhaust runs very close to my rear coil springs and I think it was the heat the caused one of my bags from 2006 to fail. It also failed in 90+ deg. F heat while running up a mountain pulling my travel trailer. Extreme conditions and it failed the test. One likely reason it failed is because the heat shields that came with the kit had rusted away and were no longer in place. I've fabricated my own heat shields this time, we'll see how they last. I think if I keep a close eye on my heat shields to protect them then these bags will last much longer.

Of course, the character of Brenda is the centerpiece, but I think the best part of the show is the development of all the quirky traits of all the supporting characters and their interactions with one another and Brenda.

All the rest comes afterwards, regardless of note values, as small note values.It is almost unbelievable.If you want to listen to Jacobson rather than Buxtehude, this is your chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Fourth Book of Mary Poppins","review":"Mary Poppins In the Park is not actually about the fourth visit of Mary Poppins (because there wasn't one), but rather a collection of stories that happened during her first three visits. I enjoyed this one, though perhaps not as much as the first too. It was just as good as Mary Poppins Opens the Door though, and some of the stories were more meaningful and deep than from the previous three volumes. For example, the first story Every Goose a Swan, about who people really are, rather than their illusions about themselves. I really liked that one.P.L. Travers paints the same world in which anything is possible- at least when Mary Poppins is around. I'm glad that I finally got to read this one.

Never be satisfied with a straightforward word when a pretentious one is at hand; and, if you know a thing, make sure not only to say it, but also to explain it for the benefit of your simpleminded reader.

The novel dramatizes the lives of many generations of townspeople, including Shadrack, the outcast war veteran and the promiscuous Peace family, along with many others. As Sula goes through the adventures of growing up, she befriends a girl named Nel and the two become best friends, two parts of one whole. Things change for the two friends when, after being away at college, Sula returns to Medallion, and is greeted by hatred from the townspeople.

But if I did not understand it, then I cannot recommend it. One major positive aspect was the beautiful imagery depicted by Toni Morrison - very descriptive style of writing. But when it came to writing about the characters, specifically Sula, I did not understand what Morrison was trying to say. Sula was a very mysterious enigmatic woman who lived her life like no one else and dared to do things she wanted to do. She did not put herself through the experience of childbirth or stay at home tending to others like her childhood friend and all other women mentioned in \\"Sula\\". I didn't know what to think after the ending. What was the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and gripping!","review":"Having read The Bluest Eye, I felt compelled to read another Toni Morrison book. People have mentioned Morrison's powerful poetic undertones in Sula -- I couldn't wait to read it. This is one of the most powerful and gripping novels I have ever heard. The story follows the path of best friends Sula and Nel. They grow up in a poor black neighborhood with eccentric and suicidal characters. Sula and Nel grow apart. Sula wants to see the world, Nel settles for a married life. Will Sula return to her roots? If so, how will she be received? And will she be able to reconstruct her friendship with Nel?I marvel at Morrison's gorgeous language and quirky symbolism. Her work is thought provoking and realistic.

Sula is a very interesting book in many ways & it made me want to read a lot more Toni Morrison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly constructed","review":"What a disappointment. Self-absorbed writing that sometimes serves no purpose for the story. The writing often seems nothing more than an attempt to write poetic prose. Character development is inconsistent. Morrison makes grand statements about characters that are not only unsupported, but she has actually provided evidence against her assessment.I don't mind vulgarity in writing if it serves a purpose. The vulgarity of Eva's scene with her infant son's constipation, however, was completely unnecessary. Is was just plain gross and out of place with the rest of the story.Just because it has Morrison as author does not make it good. Even the best miss the mark sometimes. Morrison's Sula misses by a mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep Reading","review":"It is a bit difficult to get into at the beginning.

I just did not like this book. I found all the character's despicable and for that reason could never connect with any of them. This is a short book but I had to really push myself to finish the book. This was my first try at Toni Morrison and probably will be my last. I see where her prose is a big hit but if the plot and characters are no good then no amount of prose can save a book.Sorry, no Toni Morrison fan here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmmmm.....","review":"I chose this book because it was on the reading list for a very well known University and is part of Oprah's Book Club. However, I honestly didn't care for it! None of the characters were developed to the point of being able to relate or connect to any of them. The literature was contradictory in that Ms. Morrison writes beautfully but at the same time includes language and depictions that are very unbecoming and unnecessary. I almost felt like she was writing for shock value. I can definitely understand why this book would be good for discussion in an English class - it evokes a wide range of emotion. But the story itself was slow and ultimately, I just couldn't relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"gritty, disturbing and good","review":"This is my first Toni Morrison novel. Ms. Morrison's writing sometimes comes across like complex artwork, I enjoyed re-reading certain passages for their beauty and eloquence. The character Sula's dialogue after returning to town was the highlight for me. The exchange with Eva and later with Nel had me riveted on each sentence. Friendship it turned out was the main theme, and the ending I'm not ashamed to say, produced some unexpected tears from this reader. For that achievement alone, I'll give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Sula Really Evil?","review":"The first time I read this book I was amazed by Morrison's manipulation of the English language. But I had trouble with the idea that Sula was inherently evil. Granted, she did some evil things but what is more important is perhaps to look at the idea that she had no other way to live her life. Her role models weren't exactly upstanding individuals. Eva and Hannah both were free with men and perhaps that is why Sula does not understand Nel being upset when she sleeps with Jude. Mostly I think Sula is misunderstood. The novel is a beautiful one that expresses Morrison's ideals about women and the friendship that can occur from two adult women."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointing book","review":"When I first began to read this book, I was expecting some empowering and life changing novel. Instead, what I got was 174 pages of complaints about how tough life is. The novel had portions that were actually disgusting to me. It was extremely poorly written and if it wasn't for Oprah no one would even bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morrison's Story of the Quintessential Bad Girl","review":"I read this book in a creative writing class and man did it ever give me a look into truly what a dysfunctional family was. This book is another must read and honestly you could read this in a day. Sula is a no nonsense woman about town who even causes disturbances in nature when she comes around and even sleeps with her best friend's husband and doesn't even apologize. Talk about Springer material! But in the novel, you gotta envy her tough approach and how if she wants something or wants to go somewhere she does it with absolute reslove. Great novel and one of Morrison's shortiest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Toni Morrison has an iconic status in the literary field. So, when I purchased the book, Sula, I thought it would live upto the expectations of her status. I was disappointed to say the least. The book meanders from one end to another and is replete with offensive sexual innuendos. Like her constant use of the infamous F word is quite appalling. To the reviewers who gave this book glowing reviews, I dare ask, would you have a younger relative read this book? That aside, her racial epithets like the N word and the H word shows a total disregard and respect for the ethnic groups in the country. But then again, I doubt if a caucasian could freely use the N word without being censored in the country for lack of tolerance. The story has no plot whatsoever and her style of writing while rich at times could be confusing probably due to her inclusion of ebonics. That said, I am being fair in giving this book just one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"It is amazing that a novel so poorly written could be published. This book is not worthy of anyone's time or attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't last long enough!","review":"This book moves quickly. Morrison is a master of words and it really shows in this book. For any fans of Black literature, this gives the reader an idea of the superstitious aspect of Black life in a way that only Toni Morrison could give. A must read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a very good novel that doesn't live up to all expectations","review":"My biggest mistake in reading this book was doing so directly after i had read the incredible 'beloved'; 'sula' was written much earlier, while morrison's style was evidently still developing. nonetheless, it is an excellent book--well defined characters, endlessly intriguing themes, and written in a fascinating style. often it seemed that morrison should have made this book much longer- she seemed to draw many implausible connections that could have been connected with more explination. for example, she constantly talks about what wonderful friends the two women were, rather than show why they were so close. but don't be put off by my rambling. read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book","review":"There are a lot of things about this book that I enjoyed. For example, I like how the author designs Sula in such a way that the reader characterizes her themselves. In addition, Morrison did a great job on exploring the theme of friendship between two women. Finally, the novel ahows the effects of racism upon black American life and I feel this is important in understanding our whole American culture. I would defintiely recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"One-of-a-kind","review":"What I love most about a Toni Morrison novel is that you know not to expect anything typical or tidy or even morally satisfying. You're going to get something real and gritty, laced with pain and complication. I read Sula three times, and each time I took more from it. The story is dark, but the read is beautiful with its poetic prose and magical realism. This novel demands you open your mind or you'll miss the power of her storytelling. Sula is the kind of character you'd probably dislike if another writer told her story, but Toni Morrison has a way of setting aside narrow definitions of good and evil and presenting pure, take-it-for-what-it-is humanity. Her wisdom reaches so far outside the box, when I read her work, I almost forget about the box altogether, and briefly experience the view from this one-of-a-kind, brilliant mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Toni Morrison Book","review":"I have read most of Morrison's books at least 2-3 times and this one is by far my favorite. I gave this book to many of my closest friends and to my younger sisters. Sula is a book I hope my daughter will read as a teenager, again as a young adult, and then later in life. It is a book rich with meaning. Like all of Morrison's books, you get more from it every time you read it.It has a couple of my favorite quotes, which I will share here.\\"I don't want to make someone else. I want to make myself.\\" - Toni Morrison, Sula\\"Being good to somebody is just like being mean to somebody. Risky. You don't get nothing for it.\\" - Toni Morrison, Sula"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Book","review":"Sorry to say that although this author is one of my favorites, I couldn't get into this book. Boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book makes no sense.","review":"This book from beginning was unclear. Toni seems as if she had nothing better to do when she wrote this book. Her writing was unclear. What was the meaning to have Sula turn out just like her mother. The whole book was just stupid.I didn't like it and would not reccomed it to anyone. Its a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not her best work","review":"Toni Morrison has written some fine novels, such as \\"Beloved,\\" but this isn't one of them. \\"Sula\\" seems to celebrate negativity. If Matthew Arnold were alive today, he would say the book doesn't animate. Neither does it awaken a feeling of pleasing melancholy. (This is not to say we should judge the book based on Victorian standards; merely that he used the best words to describe one's reaction to the book.) The early scene in which the two friends dig a hole is so un-subtle that it destroys any pleasure to be derived from its symbolism. The ending, as in so much contemporary fiction, simply fades out rather than establishing any coherence."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is with this book?","review":"I just finished this book for my U of Chicago Humanities class. I am now writing here to avoid having to write the paper. I hate this book. It is so completely full of the pretension that Toni Morrison's books are always full of. She pretends to be so deep and so in tune with the common man/woman. The truth is, she has a degree from Howard, teaches as Princeton (one of the most elitist institutions in the country) and sometimes a course at my school, and is making millions off being in Oprah's book club. She can go bore someone else with her \\"getting down to her roots.\\" This book and her other books disappoint me. People look at her works as being representative of African-American lit. For god's sake, read Alice Walker or someone WORTH reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading Toni Morrison's Sula.","review":"I had heard wonderful things about Toni Morrison's writing, so when I needed to choose a book for my English class I decided on Sula. I was extremly dissapointed. The plot lacked taste. How could a reader sympathize with Sula? She had watched her mother burn to death with a sickening interest and slept with every man imaginable including her best friend's husband. The character Eva wasn't much better, she torched her son, Plum. The whole book left me unsatisfied. Also, her style of writing was too wordy! She'll go on and on without ever reaching a point. I do NOT recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Disappointment That MAKES NO SENSE!!","review":"I just read this book for a paper I had to write for my Women's Literature class. I have never read anything by Morrison before, but as an English major I was open to anything. This was a confusing, incoherent, and pointless work. What was I supposed to gain from this piece? Many students in my class were just as baffled (and frightened; we were being graded on this. . .) as I was. I would have preferred the classics like Wharton, Austen, and the Bronte sisters--I leave their works with complete satisfaction that I gained something from them. After all, isn't that what literature is all about? If you're curious, try to check it out in the library; but don't buy this book. If you want to buy a good read; get anything from Shakespeare--he'll never disappoint you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Open One's Mind?","review":"Such prose is not southern gothic - it's simply nonsense. Do not mention Faulkner in relation to this author - that is insulting a literary treasure. In fact, novels of this mediocrity should never be discussed as literature at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"why do these reviews need titles?","review":"This is a dreadful, nasty, unpleasant book about dreadful, nasty, unpleasant people. I couldn't finish it. I know Morrison can write, because her criticism is fine, but this...avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opposites Attract?","review":"(Originally reviewed May 1999)Medallion, OH \\"the bottom\\" is the setting for Sula, a story of two girls from vastly different backgrounds become friends. Nell coming from a household where the father is never there and the mother is uptight Creole woman who avoids chaos at all costs. Sula on the other hand is raised in chaos where the women of the house are the head and the tail. The novel not only speaks of friendship, but also love won and lost, racism, mental illness and drug abuse. A lot to cover in a relatively short novel but Morrison does it well. This is one of her easier reads, so if you haven't read it yet, don't miss out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"I won't repeat what others have said about Morrison's lyrical and literary prose style (good) or her lack of character development in the novel (not so good). Rather I would caution potential readers not to attempt the audio version of this book. Morrison herself is the reader, and her breathy, whispery style does not translate well to listening in the car. Her voice drops off at the end of most sentences making it almost impossible to hear all her words. Very frustrating, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lack Luster!","review":"I thought the book was a really easy breezy read. However it lacked depth to me.

It was just \\"Okay\\" to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT \\"LISTEN\\"","review":"Loved this book.

Sabu's first big performance with a cast of professionals. A good story of early British presence in the reagion (India). Clean screen image, but clearly dubbed from a tape, not a print of the film. Quality suffers a bit; images are soft and low contrast. No noise, no other faults. Just not the best possible source (maybe the film isn't availale to copy any more?).

It is rife with grammar, usage, and punctuation errors.But more importantly, the style of writing is as close as fiction can get to non-fiction. Just take a non-fiction and put \\"Christina thought that...\\" in front of each sentence, and you have this book.The information the book imparts is good stuff, and I may have bought a non-fiction book on this topic, but the authors just didn't do a good job making a story out of their knowledge on the subject.

Don't be fooled by heavy metal ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flashlight!","review":"Really BRIGHT flashlight, solid construction and easy operation.Gives impressive light using four AA batteries. It's made in plastic but does not feel fragile at all and the flashlight's shape makes it very comfortable to hold in hand or attach to a glove. The on/off switch is a large lever, easy to use underwater, even using gloves. Altough when not diving the lever looks a bit overkill.Love and recommend this flashlight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Brightness, Great size, But broke after 7 dives!","review":"I love the size and brightness of this flashlight! The intent was to use this as a back-up light, but it was so handy and bright, I used this on one lobster dive trip (7 dives) exclusively. BUT, I have to return it because of intermittent light now. I diagnosed it to the flex-circuit in the head of the light where the LED is attached. Pelican is great about warranty. They will take back anything for life. But, you have to pay shipping both ways. They tell you what the shipping cost is before you send it, when you get an RMA number, and they usually just send you a new light within days and the return shipping cost rate is better than what I pay. If this happens again, I will give up on the light altogether, but the hope is it was a singular flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pelican Nemo 2410","review":"When I purchased this light I decided to leave in the clam shell plastic (batteries were included). It stayed in it's original wrapping until I reached my dive resort. The light worked on my first dive but konked out on the second. Much to my dismay the light leaked and was ruined. I checked to make sure everything was tightened and found that where the on and off switch is was corroded with battery acid. Found my leak. Here's my problem besides the obvious, shipping both ways and at least half of the cost will not be reimbursed making it not worth shipping it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great handy gadget with loads of functions","review":"For the price, this gadget is of great values given the broad variety of functions that comes with it. On top of the traditional organizer functions (phone book, memo, scheduler etc), it comes with a currency translator, handy web site addresses for travelers, mileage calculator, check book function, currency, and calories calculator. What I really like is the translator feature which can translate from English to Spanish and French. The key pad is also separately laid out which makes it easy to use it as a calculator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Organizer","review":"I am not super thrilled with this because the screen is hard to read.

The latter is no success: only one line is available to store the complete address. As a non-USA resident storing e.g. a USA address is not handy.

The packaging indicates that the organizer is from 2007.I've had the Royal organizer for a week now, and the battery is still working.I am thrilled to have this organizer, since it does a lot of things you find on a smart phone, without the expense of the high monthly phone bills.

To argue that the Elian Gonzalez case reflects the views of the Cuban American community is, in a word, ignorant. Many Cubans in Miami in fact reluctantly favored sending this unfortunate child back to Cuba, in part because they understood that Castro would make political hay from the case. And he of course did. The recent spy cases, including the four \\"diplomats\\" sent back to Cuba this week by the US Government, underscores the extent to which Castro has infiltrated the US communities. Some of the most vociferous folks arguing to keep Elian here were in fact Castro \\"plants\\" who knew the impact and value of this issue to Castro. Most of the 1 million Cubans in Miami understood the politics and obviously were not among the 100 or so who paraded and hung out outside the house of Elian's uncle.

This book is only worth purchasing if people are really interested in mind/body connection, are concerned about aging and are self-motivated. no one holds your hand to make these significant changes. I'm pleased her book has motivated me to change some really bad habits!I haven't found a Dr who is as thorough and passionate about bio-identical hormone replacement therapy as Dr Scwarzbein, but I'm determined to keep looking.

However, I have been following her eating plan for about 5 weeks now and I feel better than I have in ages. I have so much energy. The best part is eating real food -- butter, real sour cream, real cottage cheese. I haven't eaten these foods with the fat since I was a kid!

It does not focus on weight loss, but instead focuses on what food does to our bodies on a cellular level, and how food either builds our body or damages it. Eating properly according to this book will reverse many of the diseases that plague our modern times and help us achieve our ideal body weight and composition. If you suffer from diabetes, heart problems, high cholesterol, other illness, or are overweight, it would be worth your while to read this book.

Every body is different, but I am giving the plan a try to see if it brings down the levels for me. Most of the book is scientific background and case studies. It feels light on the diet itself, 4-week menu plan and sample recipes. (Maybe the diet is just that simple?)

All the years that we have been bombarded with low fat, low calorie, heart disease and other information have brainwashed most of us into doing the wrong thing...you don't have anything to lose by reading this book.. and even if you don't like her way of eating, you will learn an incredible amount of useful info about your body, cravings, addictions and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"This eating plan is great for PCOS women","review":"This book makes a lot of sense! Even though she disagrees with many of her contemporaries, Dr. Schwarzbein explains how high-carb, low-fat diets really affect our metabolism. Frankly, everything she says makes a lot of sense. This isn't a fad - it's balanced, healthy eating. I have PCOS, and I think this is perfect for a person like me, who is Insulin Resistant.

It is very discouraging because, although I realize that years of low fat dieting have destroyed my metabolism, I expected that I would see at least a little improvement, when I compare my situation to some of the example patients in her book. Although my blood sugars are normal, I had three gestational diabetic pregnancies. That was when I first began to gain significant weight, not before. Dr. Schwarzbein does not address this subject in her book, and I wonder if I am eating too many carbohydrates on the healing plan. My OB-GYN considers me a \\"borderline\\" diabetic, but Dr. S. says there is no such thing- you either are or aren't. So does a history of gestational diabetes, with normal readings between pregnancies, make me a diabetic?

I purchased this book online, hoping to find a healthy way of eating, and hoping to lose 10 pounds in the process. I read the entire book (I also purched the vegetarian cookbook, although I eat fish and chicken), and it seems that the plan is very healthy, but it would not work for me for several reasons. I am 24, and I do not make the kind of money one needs to live on this sort of diet (free-range animals and organic fruits and vegetables). I also do not eat eggs, which makes following the diet impossible. Does anyone who works 40 hours a week really have time to cook breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day? Basically, after having read about exactly how unhealthy and destructive my eating habits/lifestyle are, all I am left with is the feeling that the only solution to dying young is to quit my job so that I can spend all day thinking about what I'm going to eat for the next week. Very frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it so much, I bought it twice.","review":"A great-looking summer piece, this watch complements both the \\"mod\\" and \\"global\\" sides of me. It has a distinct sixties appeal when paired with simple, slim or boldy graphic apparel. But it takes on an earthy, natural character when accompanied by a long skirt in rough-hewn cotton, boho embroidered blouses, etc. I actually purchased this watch early in the season at a local store--then proceeded to lose it during a night-time beach excursion. (Dont' ask!) I was so heart-broken, I bought it again at Amazon. Another reason I love it: although it has silver-tone fittings, the warmth of the bone color bracelet and face complement gold-tone jewelry, as well. So it's ideal for women who like to keep their accessories closely coordinated. One practical caveat: due to the design and close positioning of all three hands, this isn't the world's easiest watch to read.

It's Hard, Eminence Front, Sister Disco and Love Reign O'er Me are standouts. The only bad thing is the mix, Pete's guitar is often lost in the overall sound.But Roger's voice is great, as is Entwistle's on the songs he sings. Definitely worth adding to your Who collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio is terrible","review":"The audio on this concert is horrible. It sounds as though a microphone was placed in front of a TV and recorded. I could do better with my old stereo from 1985.If you want to compare, listen to the bonus live tracks on the remastered It's Hard CD. The tracks are from the same show. On It's Hard's version of Eminence Front, the guitar solo is piercing and you can hear each of the members of the band clearly. On Live from Toronto, it is a muddled mess.I have to believe that Pete Townshend or Roger Daltrey did not play a role in this release, because it is third rate. This concert was on HBO in the early 1980's, and I was looking forward to its release. Now, I am disappointed I made the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful sound quality","review":"I have the dvd of this particular concert and was very excited to see that the audio had come-out on cd. However, the quality of the cd is horrible. I was really hoping to have a good quality cd because I had seen them on this tour. It's as if someone had simply recorded the the dvd from their tv set onto a cd. I can't imagine that personnel from The Who endosred this poor sounding cd. I also noticed that the cd wasn't even on MCA records (The Who's label). Clearly there was no re-mixing or preparing the audio for typical cd quality. It sounds nothing better than a run-of-the-mill bootleg. I was very disappointed when I played this on my stereo. If you have the dvd, just stick with that. As much as I love The Who, this was a total waste of money. It's very unfortunate that MCA didn't record this specifically for a cd at the time (in December 1982). It was a great concert from their last great tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set List and show but no post production quality sound:::::","review":"This is the WHO concert featured on the King Biscuit Flour Hour in 1982.

They did a very good profesional and competent show. On some songs like \\"Dangerous\\", \\"Squeeze Box\\" and \\"Naked Eye\\" they sound great and loose. On others, they sound profesional but something is missing. This is a rare set with THE WHO playing 3 JOHN ENTWISTLE s'songs (DANGEROUS, BORIS THE SPIDER & THE QUIET ONE\\"). The cd does not include \\"CRY IF YOU WANT\\", a song they played and you can hear on the expanded version of \\"It s Hard\\" cd.

The arrangements are a bit sappy and the energy a little droopy, something that seems to happen whenever Day is allowed to the slow the temp and indulge herself in ultra-soft warbling. What really bothered me about this recording which was sold by a flagship seller and fulfilled by Amazon is that I received a copy marked \\"Promotional only - Not For Sale\\".

I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book because he kept it real--he was honest about the good and not-so-good things he had done in his life and throughout his football career. He gives readers insight into a player's frame of mind before and after games, and the drama that can sometimes occur between players in the locker room. I was a little disappointed that he didnt address some of the rumors that he has to know we have heard, but I liked that he wasn't afraid to give his opinions on divisive issues like race and religion, even though I didnt agree with some of them.

On the one hand, he criticizes society for holding professional athletes in high esteem. In the next breath, he proceeds to lecture you about racism, money and sports, education, and a host of other topics - as if, as a professional sports athlete, his opinion matters more than others.If you want to read a book on sociology, there are hundreds of books better than this. If you want to read a book that provides personal insights on Robert Smith's career at Ohio State and with the Minnesota Vikings, you won't find one here. Smith details the first half of the biggest game he ever played in (NFC Championship Game in 1998) in one paragraph. And he totally ignores the most criticized decision in the 1998 NFC Championship game - \\"the knee\\". It's like he didn't actually see the game.Save your money.

Kane's account of Lennon is both intimate and revealing, yet he has respect for John Lennon and the people in his life. He tries to give a fair, well-rounded portrait of a complex man, discussing his strengths as well as his faults.He is also fair and objective when talking about the three most prominent women in his life: Cynthia, Yoko Ono, and May Pang. Often Yoko is villified but the author recognizes her positive influence on John. He is also kind to May Pang, who has been dismissed by Yoko-Sychophants as nothing but a fling, recognizing May's value and influence on the rock star as well. He feels that all three contributed and influenced John's music, which is refreshing. Other biographers tend to bash one or more of these women, producing a sometimes unfair and distorted view.The book is well-written and enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it, cheaply, for the DVD!","review":"What a waste of time!

Badly edited.","review":"I was hoping that this would fill in gaps left out of other Lennon biographies. It does take some stands on issues such as Lennon's supposed homosexuality (this author votes \\"no\\"), but the poor writing and editing hurt this biographer's credibility. Not knowing the difference between \\"waste\\" and \\"waist\\", and using \\"compliment\\" when it should have been \\"complement\\" makes the author seems like something less than a seasoned journalist. These are freshman-level grammatical errors that proofreading should have caught.Books on the life of John Lennon seems to have taken a cottage industry status these days. No single one of them is truly complete, but the lot of them makes a sloppy, overlapping patchwork quilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"John would have laughed","review":"Lennon once made a comment to the effect that every two-bit hack associated with the Beatles would eventually get one book out of the deal, and in this case Kane is already on number two.

This is not the book. One has to wonder what, if anything, Smoley beieves is actually true and historic about Jesus and Christianity since his writing clearly indicates he feels the bible is all myth and legend. I'm not a fundamentalist, but I also don't accept that the bible teaches us nothing more than how to relate to our inner being through some pretty far stretches of interpretation. Psychologists who are willing to endure a ponderously written text in order to learn how to write off every significant aspect of Christian beliefs, without threatening their clients, may like this.

This is not what I would call a tactical holster, or one you would want to depend on in a situation where a quick draw is essential.

The whole wretched thing is so badly filmed through hand cameras that it makes the original Blair Witch Project look like an expensive big budget film by comparison, so the technical qualities of this film are not even worth discussing.They even managed to be in poor taste, intercutting with lame fake TV commercials, one of which seems to make fun of Stephen Hawking's physical disabilities.

I wouldn't drop it from a foot above the floor, but for those little dings, it does a good job of protecting it.One caveat though. Be careful as you put the Touch into the skin - the silicone tears fairly easily when stretching it and I now have a one inch gash that extends from the right side pushbuttons on the Zen. This slightly affects the fit of the skin on the Touch and definitely affects the asthetic appearance but I can live with it.

The plot is set in motion when a nobleman wills his fortune to his male heir, but wills his title to his daughter. Not possible. Titles were never at the disposal of the holder. There were very rare cases, such as that of the first Duke of Marlborough, when there was no male issue, and the family was well connected at court, when a daughter's son inherited the title by special dispensation of the Crown. The second absurdity is that we have a countess, the widow of a wealthy man, left virtually penniless. English law prevented such a thing. No man could die in England without leaving his wife a specific and quite generous proportion of his estate. If he wrote something else in his will, the courts overturned it.The book is also poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acronyms in Paradise","review":"If you believe that a Computer projection of Hurricane's behavior is better than human evaluation,then this is your book.Jack Williams of USA TODAY gives us a dumbed down version of science that his newspaper specializes in.Want a terrible sounding MEOW?Well, a computer can do it for you without any reference for historical record.I recommend reading Dunn's ATLANTIC HURRICANES or even Hearn's CHITA so you can start evaluating Hurricanes on your own terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review on the book -- not on Mandelbrot","review":"Mandelbrot is the person who introduced the fractal theory to the world in its present form.

It does scare you, though. I personally thought the Medusa episode was the best, though; very effective at getting across the characters of the main victims (as I like to call the poor souls who go in Count D's shop-what other name is there?)

I do a great deal of ironing and am more than willing to pay the price a quality product. I go through spray starch by the case with all the ironing I do. But, with this iron, spray starch is a thing of the past. The steam is sooooo powerful, wrinkles disappear quickly and easily. Ironing is a breeze and my time is cut in half. The steam button is handily placed right under the handle and can be used efforlessly. Also, it holds lots of water. I am so tired of constantly having to refill the iron. Love it love it love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold up","review":"I have own this product for nearly 2.5 years and just threw it away. Despite following care instructions explicitly, this iron developed problems fairly quickly. The steam adjustment function stopped working first so that it was almost impossible to vary the steam quantity. Then, about 1.5 years into it, it starting having problems keeping the steam pressure. I had to turn the iron off and on again to rebuild the steam. Then, about 2.5 years into it, it started leaking hot steam and water out of the steam chamber...almost scalding my hand. They apparently want to charge a fortune to fix this problem...I can easily replace it with a different brand. I have had similar problems with Rowenta irons...dripping and spitting, steam not adjustable, etc. even when you use bottled spring water (recommended by them) and clean the items on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time with this iron.","review":"First the good news: When this iron works it is great. Now the bad news: The iron rarely works. I received this iron ten months ago and have had it in three times for repairs a month at a time. The steam stops working all of the time and they keep sending back the same lemon iron to me. For all of the money that I have paid for this it's costing me more than $1 per garment for ironing! My $9 Sunbeam from the drug store works better than this iron ... at least it turns on! Rowenta says that they will give me no warranty credit for the time that the iron is in the shop. Talk about NOT standing behind your product. What a waste of time this has been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working-no support from Rowenta","review":"This iron was great for about a year, then it started to spit and leak water.

Finally, I have taken to spraying my laundry rather than steaming it from the iron. A friend abroad had a steam generator iron (Philips) which I tried and which impressed me. When I looked for one here I found several with differing wattage and water compartments. I chose the greatest wattage and the largest steam compartment,as well as a brand I was familiar with. I am having a good experience with the DG-980. I do a lot of sewing. The only warning I would give is:be careful of your hands when the steam is generating. It isVERY hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delivers as promised","review":"This iron is well worth the little extra space it takes up on my ironing board. Wrinkle-removing steam is produced within the 3 minutes mentioned in the literature. I easily glid the iron over heavily creased cotton once and the wrinkles disappeared. Thus far I am very pleased and would recommend this model. I purchased a $100 Rowenta iron in 1996 and it still heats up nicely and am keeping it for messy craft projects. However, I recommend using bottled water in the unit as tap water, particularly in areas where the infrastructure is old, can stain garments and leave residue behind in any iron which is time consuming to remove. I researched other units and the removable tank and the secure iron receptacle on the base are important features to me. The price on Amazon was fair with the promotional $25 discount and free shipping given the unit recently auctioned off on e-Bay for $193 plus shipping. Hope to be using this iron years from now as was the case with my old Rowenta."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO MORE ROWENTA IRONS!!!","review":"I received a Rowenta Steam Iron Generator DG 980 back in 2005.

Now my second Rowenta Steam Iron Generator DG 980 is resting in peace in a dumpster!!!I also own another smaller Rowenta iron and after using this one for a few years the steam button broke all of a sudden. You can still use it but it's not easy to iron now because as soon as you take your finger off the button it comes off. What a hassle!Lately I've been busy researching the web for a new steam iron and I'm looking for a totally different brand (perhaps Delonghi, they offer a 3 year warranty while Rowenta products are warrantied for just 1 year from the date of purchase).

I was told that the parts were on backorder and I could have the iron returned so I could send to another service center. Go figure. Paying for a 15 puond iron to be shipped all around. Furthermore, if one service center doesn't have a part, why would I ship it to another?

The red light indicating it is out of water has also stopped working. Haven't gotten in touch with Amazon or Rowenta yet as it is the weekend. Read on an earlier review a bad batch was produced so maybe this is one and I can get it replaced - if so - and it works longer than 60 days I think it is a great iron steam generator!

The band sound great - kind of rough of times, but it just gives the music more character. It's also great hearing the audience singing along to Jimmy's classics. The liner notes don't give any info about when or where the songs were recorded, and it kind of sounds like it's not all from one concert, but perhaps the best recordings from a variety of concerts. Some of these songs really seem like they were made to be sung live, especially \\"You Can Get It If You Really Want It,\\" which has such a catchy chorus you may find yourself singing along with it. If you're a reggae fan and want to hear something aside from the ubiquitous Bob Marley music, or just a fan of great music, you'll probably love this CD.

Some of his albums with other musicians didn't quite cut it for me (e.g., Journey through the Past). ZUMA is a perfect example of Neil & Crazy Horse doing what they do best: flexing their rock and roll muscles.Forget the crummy cover art. Ignore the throwaway \\"Through My Sails\\" which I think he did only to give the three other guys a little work doing their downturns. This album cooks with gas and nitro. \\"Drive Back\\" is a rocking blues tune, as is \\"Barstool Blues\\". We all know the moody boiler, \\"Cortez the Killer\\", is an overlooked classic. And \\"Stupid Girl\\" probably has one of the most outrageous lyrics in music history: \\"Your such a beautiful fish, flopping in the summer sand/Looking for the wave you missed, when another one is close at hand\\". That got me hook, line and sinker! Pick up this underrated album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Zuma's A Killer","review":"Zuma was the first studio album that was credited to Neil Young & Crazy Horse since his second release, Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere. While various members of the band appeared on albums in between the releases, Zuma contains the power rocking sound that only the complete band could produce. \\"Barstool Blues\\" is an underrated gem that has bluesy guitar riff that pops throughout the song. \\"Drive Back\\" and \\"Don't Cry No Tears\\" have a grungy sound. \\"Stupid Girl\\" is great song with a great vocal. \\"Pardon My Heart\\" is an acoustic based number as is the closer \\"Through My Sails\\" which features Crosby, Stills & Nash and was a leftover from the aborted sessions in 1974 that was supposed to yield the band's followup to Deja Vu. The standout track on the album is \\"Cortez The Killer\\" with its droning guitar solo and vivid lyrics, the song is tremendous."},{"rating":"1","title":"cortez is great","review":"Cortez may be my favorite Neil song but I have had a few of his cd's and this is the one one where I only like one song.

Yay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Cry No Tears and Cortez the Killer","review":"Zuma is certainly one of the best Young/Crazy Horse studio recordings. \\"Don't Cry No Tears,\\" is a great rock song, with lots of sting. \\"Cortez the Killer\\" contains some of Neil's best extended rifs, and the lyrics are among his best: poetic and political at the same time. This recording gets some of my most frequent IPOD replays, and I have most of Young's records on the hard drive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cortez the Killer","review":"Cortez was the first song I heard of Neil Young.

I have alot of his music and i would say that this is his best, but it is hard to rank a Neil Young cd because there are so many great cds of his. But I think this here is def. one the the very best. Cortez the killer is completely amazing and will blow you away in my opinion, also Danger Bird. Corez the killer and Danger Bird are equally great , but they are not the only good songs on this album by far. I feel very sure that if you like Neil Young at all you will absolutely love this cd. And if you like 70's music at all you will love this cd. It is great all the way through and i have not gotten tired of it at all, if anything it grows on me. Very good music, and its highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"How can anyone who knows likes Neil Young not think this is one of his best albums?

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil at his almost best","review":"Sure, this is one of Young's best albums, and it would be superfluous to go into why. \\"Stupid Girl\\" and \\"Barstool Blues\\" are just rock classics. I must reflect that \\"On the Beach\\" - definitely the definitive Neil Young creation - seems to be out of circulation. Just take a listen to \\"Ambulance Blues\\", or for that matter, \\"See the Sky about to Rain\\", and you have the master at his very best. By the way, where is he? Where are the newies?

This book along with Lyne's other book is the only propaganda, not some some massive CIA front. I was once a believer but no longer, UFOlogy and all that Tesla nonesense is just that, nonesense.

It reads like most books on Cuba, total polemic. While some works claim Castro is Satan and Cuba is heck on Earth, this one takes the other irrational side in this silly debate - namely America is Satan and Castro is the savior of the world's working people. You won't find balance here and you won't even remain interested throughout. I at least expected Fidel to be interesting rather than dull. Oh well. C'est la vie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This and trash is the same!!","review":"Here is a book which gives Fidel and his followers carte blanc in all the typical rhetoric that he has been so succesful in mystifying for the last 40 yrs, and half of Latin America and the American Left have fallen for. Now there is Cuba, resisting \\" against all odds\\" vs Darth US and its EEEEvil Empire. In reality is more like the poor Cubans, against the Emperor in Havana, with its Stalinist repressive regime, which has given them, \\"free\\" education and health care in return for \\"exchanging\\" their soul, their food, their underwear, and submitting them to slave labor so that HE can remain in power. All this happens because the EVIL United States???? Have some common sense, please!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jackie Chan's best.","review":"This is without a doubt my favorite Chan movie. The fighting is spectacular, and the comedy is quite good. The main advantage of the American release is the 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen. In fact, it's the only advantage. Rather than buy this version, I got the Hong Kong version, with the original language track (I hate dubbing), and the original music and sound effects. The H.K. DVD is only 1.78:1 widescreen, but I still feel, overall, that it's heads and shoulders over the US release. I still won't take a star off for all the US version's faults, because the movie itself is what counts, and it's insurmountable. If picture is your main concern, then by all means, enjoy this version. But if you want a true moviewatching experience, hold out for the Hong Kong edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMFG Dubs ONLY!","review":"This movie is one of the few I showcase to friends when they talk about how much they love Jackie Chan. I often follow that statement up with, \\"Well, have you seen this..\\" I do love this movie and for every Jackie Chan fan, its one of the movies you need to watch. When my VHS version 'died', I got a copy of this version to find... f***in A, they dubbed it, and dubbed it horribly I might add. I really don't understand why you would want to lobotomize a film like this, or any film for that matter with D-list vocal talent... So my rating is for this dvd release of Drunken Master II, a 5 star movie otherwise destroyed by the stupid dubs. And though that won't matter to most of you, for some it will mean enough to keep many from even thinking about purchasing this release, and that is who this review is for."},{"rating":"1","title":"U.S release doesn't compare to the original","review":"The U.S release is a far cry from the original,and more of an insult than anything else.I can tell everyone though,for a fact that the original theatrical release (spoken in original Mardrin&Cantonese&subtitled in English) is the S&^%!?*^!.It's not only entertaining and hilarious,the fight scenes are absoloutely INCREDIBLE.So,if you get the opportunity,buy the VHS tape.I did about 6 years ago,and although it's not dvd quality,it's still a fantastic film.I suggest checking out EBAY for it on DVD,you may be surprised and find the original out there?This is a MUST HAVE film for any Jackie Chan/Martial arts fan.It's a perfect blend of action and comedy.I suggest staying away from the editied/dubed U.S release,it's been butchered...find the original,it will be worth every penny even if it costs a bit more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Executives must have been drunk to release this lame DVD","review":"Drunken Master 2 is one of the greatest martial arts films ever, especially given that most of its amazing highlights were done without any special effects, only the determination and skill of Jackie Chan and crew. The Legend of the Drunken Master dvd release represents an edited (slight but for any film purist significant enough) version of the film and most of all features NO original dialogue track, only the typically awful English dub. Hold out, and hopefully someday someone will have enough respect for both the film and target audience to put out a DVD worthy of this movie.

The dubbed version of \\"Fist of Legend\\" has the character's saying things in it that were never remotely hinted at in the original subtitled version. This movie, in its original form, is Jackie Chan's greatest film. It goes to show that Jackie can choreograph with the best of them...when he's not worrying about doing some ridiculous stunt. Hilarious and at the same time action filled, some of the best Wu Shu I've ever seen in this movie. The crazy kicker at the end of the film is actually Jackie's bodyguard...now we see why he's a bodyguard. Ti Lung as the father and Anita Mui as the step mother put in very good performances, as well. ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful movie.","review":"The comedy, and Jackie Chan's attitude were fantastic in this movie! All of the characters were so likeable. The martial arts are amazing. You even get to watch Ken Lo \\"Supakicka\\" fighting Jackie Chan in the final scene. You've never seen legs move so fast.

I must have watched this 4-5 times since I bought it.I even took this with me as i went to babysit, two very lively boys, who watch cartoon network, fishing channel and sports. This one really got their attention, and gave me 2 hours of peace, as they laughed at the jokes and awed at this movie.I think this can be appreciated by anyone. I loved Anita Mui, she played Jackie's step-mother, she's funny, and she can fight, watch out for her.The humore here is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Light Comedy","review":"I'm not a fan of Chan, but boy can Jackie Move! Jackie stars as: Wong Fei Hung the son of a respected Chinese herbalist/doctor.Wong Fei, in an effort to save his father some paying taxes on his imported herbal medicines, Wong Fei, puts an expensive parcel in the baggage of a Chinese Official. Later, when he goes to retrieve it, he inadvertently steals an ancient Chinese relic, embroiling Wong Fei, and his wacky family, in a ton of trouble. (It was a stretch to believe Jackie was a YOUNG man, but the plot was amusing and funny, that this discrepancy could be overlooked).Chan's moves, and facial expressions were great as the inebriated Wong. His parents were amusing and well portrayed. I admit I had no clue who the minor characters were- (this must've been covered in the first film which I missed), however this didn't really matter so much.... Overall, an amusing movie. Great Martial Arts action! sure to be enjoyed by fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very great kung-fu martial arts movie","review":"This movie is, in my opinion, one of the best Jackie Chan movies ever made (at least in the fight scenes). This movie, like most of Jackie's movies, focuses less on plot and more on action! If you watch Jackie Chan movies for the fist fights, then I highly recommend this movie to you. You will be amazed by the final fight sequence between Jackie and his real-life bodyguard, Ken Low, with whirling fists and lightning legs! I was truly astounded by the way Jackie started fighting after he was drunk! He lunged wildly and wasn't fazed by any of Ken's kicks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am completely mesmerised by this incredble film","review":"This is truly the best film by Jackie Chan.

Keep up the good work Jackie, we are always behind you."},{"rating":"2","title":"best chan movie.","review":"This is Jackie Chans best movie period and is also one of my favorite movies of all time....I can't stress how good the fights are in this movie,this and fist of legend are the two best \\"on the ground \\"kung-fu movies with no wires,and I even prefer this movies choreography over fist of legends....I think the main reason I liked this movie so much was it was the first movie where Jackie Chan actually seemed \\"cool\\" and not just a silly guy who knows how to fight,I think that is what makes Jet Li movies so popular,is the fact that he carries \\"coolness\\" like no one else and Jackie finally pulls off the same charisma here even going a little berserk and looking flat out vicious when he gets drunk.This is definitley one of the best Wong Fei-Hung interpretations of all time and is a must own for any kung-fu fan out there,and especially a must own for anyone who thought that he was just a silly guy who knows how to fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am heatbroken!","review":"I was extremely sorrowful to watch the legend of drunken master. One of the best Jackie Chan's movies was ruined brutally. The dubbing betrayed the original meaning and made it so ridiculous. The stepmother in the original movie is a hilarious but righteous and kindhearted woman, but she became annoying after the damn dubbing. Some parts of the movie are robbed away from the original movie. The worst thing that I can't tolerate is that they changed the musical score during the fightings. It makes the movie like meaningless mortal combat.I love the original drunken master II, and I want to kick the butt of whoever came out with this damn \\"The legend of drunken master\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from the Disney DVD","review":"I won't say anything about the movie itself ... just advise people to stay away from this Disney-released DVD (unfortunately they acquired worldwide rights for distribution). Dubbing is extremely poor to the point of being an offense to the buyer. Needless to say, the original (cantonese) audio is not included. The movie's original score has been replaced by a completely new one as well. The hilarious last scene of the movie has been cut completely.

I admit I was not really a Chan Fan because most of his movies were silly slapstick that became annoying at times. But it works in this movie. Jackie kicks some serious xxx in this one. Especially the scene when he has to fight what looks like about 100 axe-wielding thugs. Good story line & actors also( Ti Lung, Anita Mui). The end fight between Ken Lo & Jackie is one of the best ever filmed. Very recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles, please!","review":"This film was a major disappointment to me. First of all, even if this is a martial arts film, it should have subtitles. Dubbing in any movie (except maybe something on the level of Godzilla) is unacceptable. Secondly, Anita Mui, who plays Chan's stepmother, is annoying beyond distraction. She ruins every scene that she's in with her vaudeville shtick. I love Jackie Chan and he goes to extraordinary personal lengths in this film to deliver an exciting product. However, the great fight scenes aren't enough to overcome the limp humor that plagues this film. Even Jackie lacks the charm that usually infuses the comedy in his movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest martial arts movie ever, second to none","review":"The movie continued the great saga from ther orignal movie.

When it was re-released in the US, I never had an opportunity to see it on the big screen, but remembered all the good reviews. I was really looking forward to a good movie, but was very disappointed. Although I realize that Jackie Chan movies are somewhat comical and campy by design, this movie suffers from bad acting (the stepmother is horrible), lame dialogue, ridiculous story line, over-the-top bad guys, etc. Although the fight scenes where well choreographed as you would expect, they are inserted around so much garbage that it cannot salvage this turkey. 2 stars out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"orriginal soundtracks on DVD's PLEASE!!","review":"Fantastic film, but why oh why dont they ALWAYS put the orriginal soundtrack on DVD's :o("},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I am not in a position to get out and shop anymore.

Most of the other songs just kind of blend in, it's kind of like they used the same formula for every song. Part of that can be blamed on the fact that they use those really high clashing notes in 10 out of the 11 songs if I counted correctly. Guys, those notes sound cool when used in moderation, but seriously, every song? It makes all of the riffs sound the same. The keyboards are cool though, I will admit that. Also, for some reason it bothers me that some of the songs clock in at no longer than 2 minutes, it makes them seem like random parts thrown together rather than songs with actual structure. Don't get me wrong, I'm sure these guys are cool dudes and I know they put on a good live show, I just think that what this cd needed in order to be strong is distinguishable songs rather just a mesh of high notes and open palm muted chords."},{"rating":"1","title":"wow. how original.","review":"so this is probably some of the least original music i have ever heard. the main vocalist sounds like a constipated baby, and every song consists of drop D breakdowns, a plethora of sour notes, and typical repetitive pinch harmony based guitar riffs...the only reason im giving this a 2 is because their are some plentiful keyboard segments (the guys good at piano) and he has a relatively nice voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"okay. so basically this cd is the best! these boys are the nicest boys you'll ever meet. and to top it all off, their music is absolutly awesome to the max! i love kyle, danny stills, aaron rothe, danny, and jake! i love u boys and congrats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Core protocol for Lyme and other tick-borne diseases","review":"Solaray is a low-priced yet decent quality brand of herbs.

It immediately fell back down to the main lava ball and nothing ever separated again. We left it plugged in for 9 hours Christmas day only to see that 1 lava ball rise up.

We do not live close enough to a major home store (Menards, etc.) for me to check their inventory during the work day, so I put a 25 watt bulb in the lamp (based on a previous review indicating that a 15 watt bulb is not hot enough).

Second, the whole thing is very flimsy. Don't even consider moving it unless it's completely cooled. The \\"base\\" was especially annoying to me, as it is totally hollow.

I looked at all the different versions of this piano music (big note, easy, and this one) and this looked like it was the most advanced. In looking at this after it arrived, I think it will be very simple, possibly sight-reading material, for my daughter, who has been playing for 8 years.

Fresh from retirement his voice is a bit rusty but still sounding beautiful. There are three cuts that deserve attention. One is Anka's second anthem \\"Let me Try Again\\" which was actually an Italian melody for which he supplied lyrics, as he had done in the case of \\"My WAY\\", a french melody for which he supplied the lyrics. The second special cut is his classic rendition of \\"Send In The Clowns\\", which he later rerecorded with just piano supplied by Bill Miller. The third and my favorite cut is the haunting \\"There Used To Be a Ballpark\\". It goes beyond being a beautiful recording and enters the realm of social commentary addressing subject matter rarely found in a popular song.For those of us who remember,the song will hit home. It should be part of your Sinatra collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra Comeback","review":"I used to have this in cassette form, but lost it somewhere along the way. I think the \\"Send In The Clowns\\" on this CD is the better version than the one he sings with piano. It's the orchestra strings. They add to the emotion of the song. The first two songs on the CD are also beautiful. I've heard a lot of bad reviews for this CD, but I am pleased with it, as it's the first album he did as a comeback, and he sounds so emotional in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!!!!

Included is \\"Expecting To Fly\\", \\"Cinnamon Girl\\", and \\"After The Gold Rush\\", as well as \\"Ohio\\", \\"Heart Of Gold\\", and \\"Cortez The Killer\\". But \\"Neil\\" isn't about pop songs, and every track here is quality rock. He could easily release another 2-disc collection with all the albums he's put out since. After this, I'd pick up \\"Freedom\\", \\"Mirror Ball\\", and \\"Silver And Gold\\". But first pick this up, and find out where a thousand other bands got their inspiration. This is as real as music gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Neil Young","review":"Decade represents the best of Neil Young's work. The songs were sung when his voice was still strong and vibrant. The album contains some great guitar riffs and the instrumentation makes for a gaggle of great songs. As always Young's lyrics and voice combine for an awesome listening experience, but don't take my word for it, listen to the samples. You'll hear the songs that have been on the radio since the 1960's. Slap Decade on your mp3 player or cell phone and mix it up with some new stuff and you'll wonder why no one makes music like this anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The First Decade, What Next?","review":"Neil Young is probably the finest musician of our time who doesn't have one of those boxed sets or career anthologies out. In fact a lot of his best music remains curiously out of print (On The Beach, Time Fades Away, Hawks And Doves). This album sums up his career up to American Stars & Bars(another out of print) and does a tremendous job. Hopefully, we may see something covering his next two decades of fine music but it would be hard to fit all of those style shifts together in a single package. This was one of the finest hits packages to come from Warner/Reprise, a company notorious for putting out horrible albums of \\"greatest hits\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"As an album it's five stars, as a CD it's 1 star","review":"Decade is the best summation of Neil's career by default. With no word on when Neil's massive \\"Archives\\" sets are going to be available, if ever, and with Lucky Thirteen being the only other compilation available of any part of Neil's career, it doesn't have much competition.Each song was well-chosen, but the triple LP had much better sound and packaging than the CD does--indeed, Neil's work deserves an overhaul. Furthermore, although Young's liner notes are always interesting, there isn't much of a context for new fans to latch onto.Hopefully one day Neil Young will finish compiling his \\"Archive\\" sets and make them available to the public, at which time \\"Decade\\" will probably be redundant anyway. However, until then, \\"Decade\\" will be the best introduction to Neil's music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have.","review":"Can't add much more than what has already been said.

The bread & biscuits recipes all include wheat. I was looking for yeast and wheat free recipes, quick breads, muffins. Didn't find any? Milk free recipes include butter. Most of the recipes are for meals that would seldom, if every, have yeast in them. Egg salad recipe is the most bland stupid recipe I've seen. Eggs, salt, celery, and safflower oil, wow. A granola recipe, no yeast obviously, wheat, barley, gluten, yes.

The wire leading from the charger to the laptop jack is flimsy, and frays very quickly. After a couple of months of normal use, this becomes a sparking fire hazard. Postmortem dissection revealed why this product does not perform like the Real McCoy. Apple uses co-ax wire in which the outer portion is woven into a thickly braided layer. In this cheap knock-off, there is simply a layer of thin, straight, unwoven strands. So while this charger may sport a convincing exterior, its internal structure reveals it to be a shoddy fraud.

Therefore, I always had to keep the computer plugged ito the outlet. The other day, it died out of the blue. First I thought the power in my house went off. I checked the outlet. It was fine. I plugged the computer into another outlet. It worked for a minutes (green light on), then stopped. I felt the adapter and it was burning hot. My computer is 7 years old (Powerbook G4) and otherwise in good shape. Too bad Apple has stopped selling the real deal adapters.

It has a pitifully short chord: unless you have an outlet right next to every desk, chair, and couch in your house, give up on making it work without an extension cord. When you do get an extension cord, the adapter's bulky base will take up at least 2 outlets, if not 3. The wire covering has come off my cord, leaving half an inch of wire exposed. Because the cord is stiff near the end that plugs into the computer, it easily breaks open, exposing the wire.

I got mine in 10/2004 and by 2006 the little plug in (into the MAC) is starting to act flaky (light doesnt come on someyimes, but I believe its still charging anyway).. Posibly there was a bad production run causing all the problems in the other reviews. Still, this does seem expensive. I just bought the smaller disc charger to have an alternate charger (not a replacement).

Apple's own adapter, however, WILL break. The cord is just too cute (i.e. fragile), and if you do anything like what you're suppossed to do with a laptop (that is, if you sit with the laptop in your lap), forget it! Prepare to hand over another 100 bucks in a couple of months. I just got the iGo Juice (which Apple sells on their site) and it works fine. Further, it's actually sturdy, and if a connection breaks I can just spend 20 bucks on a single part. No, I'm not an iGo company shill. I just don't see the point of buying mediocrity because it's cute and has the little bitten apple on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I have called Apple a couple times and told them that my power adapter fried.

Wow.Dear Apple executive, RECALL THIS ITEM.Make something better!This product is also over priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - Have been through two - wont get fooled again!","review":"This is a terrible product - Apple should be ashamed of itself for allowing anything as cheesy as this part to remain in production. I've been through two of these adapters. As many reviewers have previously mentioned, my first adapter broke because of the inexcusably thin wire and flimsy connector that plugs into the laptop. The second Apple adapter I purchased just internally combusted,made a popping sound and quit working one day after three months of casual use. This product is so poor that it puts the entire Apple laptop product line in a poor light. Even though I am a big fan of OS X, I would have to think long and hard before buying more apple hardware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over substance","review":"Everything critical that everyone has written below is absolutely true.

My iBook received fairly \\"light duty\\" tasks, and most of the time I used it at a desk, not moving it, and it has only been on two trips with me. The other day I heard a POP sound, and noticed that the adapter's light was not on. It blew out, or something...who knows. The exact same thing had happened to someone else I know who has an iBook. Also, everything I see online seems to complain about how the cord rips/tears, and how the thing is just flimsy.In the end, if you need a replacement, and you want it to be the apple brand...I at least recommend buying it on amazon, because the price here was a little bit lower than a few other places I checked.No sense paying even more for a useless piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apple got this one wrong","review":"One year and the thin wire got cut.

At a former job, our department lent out portables to other departments for special projects. Over the years, we went through a variety of brands of PC laptops... all of them shipped with the cruddiest (if that's a word) adapters imaginable.Apple portables are called portables - NOT LAPTOPS. They are too powerful and ergo are too hot for use on your lap. If it's on your lap, it shouldn't be plugged in. People wear out their portable batteries by leaving their notebooks plugged in 24/7 until they have to be left in.I like the option to remove the plug (aka \\"duck head\\") and utilize the thick extension cord... and I like the built-in cord-winder for travel. With the recent advent of Apple's MagSafe power adapter, it's easy to look at this older model and criticize it - but with all things Apple, it was the best and most innovative when it was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"One more unsatisfied customer","review":"I was on my second adapter from Apple and it just broke. Granted, it was on its last leg for a LONG time, but I guess the final wire strand just gave out because a bright spark and a loud pop later, I'm on Amazon trying to find one myself another one.I take very good care of my property, too... but like another reviewer said, if you sit with the laptop on your lap while it's plugged in, the cord will eventually wear out at the connector. Not a lot of engineering went into strain relief on this one. Plus, when wrapped up using the retractable hooks, the connector is left dangling at the edge, extremely succeptable to excess bending when put in a bag or even just sitting in a drawer.Overall, a horribly designed and horribly expensive product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The key is the .........key","review":"The lock is solid but where I feel Kryptonite cut corners is the key and inner workings.

They're doing another Scarlett doll when they already did with the Barbie line!?! Well, if the photo boasts of a likeness to Vivien Leigh, it is only because upon seeing the doll, it does look like the actress -- at least captures her charm. The dress ensemble is much diffferent from the Barbie as Scarlett line because of material and detail. Here, you have a full skirt of voile that reaches beyond foot length of the doll; it is generous. The little gloves and lace shawl are also nice additions as is the straw hat with long green ribbon (which unfortunately will be hard to knot at the doll's neck).The boots are ankle boots and are in white, not green as seen in the film. Over-all, this and the \\"On Peachtree Street\\" version as well as Mattel's Clark Gable as Rhett Butler are wonderful likenesses of the actors of Gone with the Wind. A must-buy for the GWTW afficionado!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than the anime","review":"I, like most other people, found out about Excel Saga because of the anime based on this manga. I personally think that the manga is a lot better than the anime. I own up to volume 9 of the wacky series (Japanese manga are published a lot faster in Korea) and there's never a boring moment. If you want some hectic, zany, irrationaly fun, pick it up. It's not for everyone, though; it might seem a bit dorky/too insane/ incomprehensible to some of you.If you liked the anime, give it a try! Even if not, if you could use a good laugh, you might wanna check it out. (I'm not sure how well Excel Saga has been translated into English...

This book has nothing to recommend it. A better writer could have spun the same plot into a decent novel, but C N Bean wasn't up to the task. The book is amateurish. I probably couldn't do as well, but I have enough sense read books rather than try to write them. The prose is completely uninspired, and the plot simplistic. Dust to Dust is a real stinker.

At first I thought it was cool that they did that but then it seemed to bug me. Also there wasn't a lot of screen time for the characters that weren't axis or ally powers.

It was shipped much more quickly than I expected, the bandana that comes with it is really cute, and the artwork on the disk and cover is good quality. As for the movie itself, it is one of those movies you can watch over and over again and never stop laughing. I have watched it 4 times and I am still catching new jokes!The dub and sub are included on the disk, so you get twice the jokes for your money. The dub made the jokes even less politically correct and added accents, so it is not watered down. If you are a parent considering buying this for your teen, I would say about 15+ would be a good age for this movie. My father doesn't even like the show and he laughed at it. Trust me, s/he has heard MUCH worse out of school. It is very light-hearted, funny, and as stereotypical as ever before!

It's probably because it has very enjoyable and likeable characters in it that I even bothered to sit down and watch this movie.I won't tell the whole plotline, but more like the basis of it without spoiling the ending.There are these aliens that turn people into one of them and walk around with light thingies on their antennas, they also paint the world white in which it is boring and depressing!It's up to the Axis Powers Japan, Italy and Germany to team up with the Allies America, Russia, England, China and France to stop the aliens from destroying the world that we live in, and making it out to be very boring!After being attacked, they all had enough and struggle to come up with new ways to take these new enemies on!Also appearing in this would be China's panda, Italy's cat and Poland's pony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A trip down memory lane - its like I was there","review":"Watching these old toon's really takes me back!

These cartoons are a rare mix of good story telling + good artwork that is just gone today. The stuff that they come out with now is just garbage and poorly produced retreads that is just sad. My only gripe is there are no captions or subtitles on any of the shout! factory dvds, G.I. Joe & Transformers at least. Being almost deaf I really need them to follow the stories. Even without the captions, they are worth the money just to get caught up in them one more time.

The actual movie.I don't know why Funimation did it, but they decided to stick random episodes from the first 2 seasons into the movie. At times, there are 2 or 3 episodes in a row. Its very jarring and irritating to see everyone working together, more or less, to fight the Pictonians, then all of a sudden we're in the middle of WWII or France is proposing to England or England is learning about Japanese culture from a kappa. One of the worst instances is where Funimation decided to interrupt the build up to the final battle with a random episode.I don't know if Funi felt the movie was too short, but it didn't do the movie or itself any favors.

The book is full of exaggeration, overstatements and the like. Yes, I am sure that in moderation colon water therapy [colonics, enemas etc.] can be helpful - but - give me a break - it is not the cure for everything.To me, this book lacks all credibility and the missing 4 chapters reinforces this impression.Unless you are seeking an overpriced fly swatter or an example of a medical book without merit, do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware religious overtones of this quack Dr.","review":"After reading this book one paragraph sticks out about the section on the male testicles.

I think Pare the actor has to have even considered participating in this massive clunker.The special effects look like they were created on a child's computer by a child; the script is incoherent and dull; all of the acting is bad; the sound editing is atrocious; people's lips move and they're not in sync with the dialogue, and the addition of the African American celebrity whatever adds nothing to the already horrendous plot.A real stinkeroo..don't waste your valuable time like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very, very, very bad movie","review":"Don't buy it!

Major events - births, deaths, marriages - set the backdrop and are casually alluded to in passing, historical events mentioned almost none at all. The focus is in illuminating interior spaces - hope, loss, resentment, struggle, defeat. The final story - the author's first brush with her own mortality - identifies the connection between the vignettes in the description of how Ontario's landscape was shaped by ancient glaciers moving over the earth. This movement formed a variety of unique, particular, but identifiable formations, separate from each other but connected in their origin by the moving ice, as individuals recognize each other through time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I was very let down with the book.

By applying a scientific and common sense approach to finding and eliminating food allergies, Stitt guided troubled young criminal offenders from repeated, uncontrolled misbehavior into a whole new lifestyle based on providing healthy fuel for their damaged bodies and minds. Her success rate, in a system where twenty percent was average, was consistently over eighty percent, all because she cared enough about her probationers to investigate their eating habits and lifestyles and develop a better way for them to live. This book reads quickly and well; and it is a valuable resource for family therapists, school teachers, and parents who are concerned about helping young people (and themselves!) to overcome destructive habits and behaviors. Very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"STOP Poisoning Your Children!","review":"Are we so caught in the pleasure trap that we will not listen to such important information.

Much more satisfying albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Quite \\"Mystery to Me\\" but a great album nonetheless.","review":"Another pre-Buckingham-Nicks gem from the Mac. In fact, this is the last one. Soon after this album hit the shops, Bob Welch left and was replaced by that California couple.

That, and Lake of the Coheeries...ENJOY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling.........","review":"Helprins' prose is indelibly melodic in \\"Winter's Tale\\" and this book will enchant and intrigue the reader. This isn't a book that can be read and easily reviewed, but one that must simply be experienced. Helprin has created a remarkable character, Peter Lake, aded a city, New York, and entwined them in a timeless fantasy of love and justice, tragedy and remorse, valor and determination. This book is a paean to the human heart.Let me add that any reader who judges a novel by the politics of its' author is no bibliophile, but a captive to their intellectual limitations. Politically left, right or middle, any lover of books, as any lover of words, will delight in Winter's Tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book; terrible Kindle version","review":"The book itself is a beautifully written novel, but Amazon needs to demand better quality control from publishers.

I hope he writes a sequel.-Peter Lake"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe a book for a loooong winter's night","review":"Mark Helprin's book was extremely self-indugent. While some of the writing was beautiful and evocative, the overall feeling that I got from reading this book was that I was on a never-ending trek through a blinding snow storm. I finally took refuge in the warm feeling that there was no requirement to get to the end of this arduous journey.

This was not even in the same league as the latter book. This book seemed to drip with sentimentality and contrivance, whereas \\"Soldier\\" never let the preciousness of the tale overwhelm the moment. I found myself completely bored by the end of the third chapter, and totally unable to identify or care much about any of the characters. It just seems like Helprin was dialing it in, substituting manufactured scenes and saccharine dialogue for the true genius and inspiration that made \\"Soldier\\" such an unforgettable book. Maybe for the true Helprin fanatic, but definitely not for the casual fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great American Novel...meant to be savored","review":"This novel was given to me by a friend several years ago.

Mark Helprin's use of language is rare and beautiful. The fantasy is intriguing. As a writer entranced by the power of words, I can unhesitatingly recommend this book.

Winter's Tale is one of those cases. This is an overindulgent, overwritten, absurd piece of nonsense. I lasted 88 pages and skimmed the rest just to make sure the author didn't at some point come to his senses. He did not. Please don't waste your time on this, all the misguided good reviews notwithstanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the Mighty have Fallen","review":"My first exposure to Mark Helprin was \\"Soldier of the Great War\\", a breathtaking novel of inspiration, beauty, poetry and eloquent writing style.

I was heart-broken by this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I purchased this book because I read a review that compared the style of writing to one of my favorite books, \\"A Trip to the Stars\\" by Nicholas Christopher. I was also impressed by the incredible accolades and heartfelt devotion displayed by so many reviewers. I'm only 150 pages deep into this 700-page behemoth and each page is an uphill struggle with boredom. I haven't disliked a book this much in such a long time and I truly can't figure out where the wide-spread appeal stems from. The only reason I continue to read it is because I want to get my [money]out of it. I fear I'm only torturing myself and paying even more. I don't find the language beautiful,nor is the story compelling. The descriptions are tiresome and I CANNOT stand how the author addresses almost every character by their first and last name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"This guy writes wonderfully, which is why I bought the book...I read the first few pages, however, the story eventually flies into fantasy...I stayed with it, but it is a hefty, heavy thing, and for me, the story went too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Helprin writes huge checks he can't cash","review":"Overall, I found this book childish and cartoonish. Even worse, the cartoonishness wasn't even particularly funny or pleasing. In fact, much of it was extremely trite and facile.The breathless comic book exaggeration with which everything is described gets tiring very quickly.The only people who could enjoy this book, I imagine, would be people who desparately need an alternate comic book description of NYC in order to salve the years of misery they have had to endure dealing with the real thing.There is no narrative, as such, just one more outlandish development piled on after another.I came to this book with only mild expections, but even those were let down.Another book that takes a similar story telling approach is \\"Perfume\\" by Peter Suskind, and that only succeeds for the first half of the book. Sustaining an ominscient view magically-real narrative for even 200 pages is no simple matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"I repurchased this when my first copy disappeared.","review":"Wonderful imagery and symbolic allusion. The author weaves his improbably tale so deftly that I found myself wanting to research portions of the story as if they were true. It is sometimes hard to tell the line between reality and pure fabrication, here. The beauty of the story carries throughout."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Milennium Approaches -- And It Is Grand","review":"An absolutely amazing book. Helprin's command of the English language is breathtaking (keep a dictionary nearby!). Lyrical in its vision and prose, Helprin gives us an optimistic, hopeful view of the coming millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop thinking about it","review":"I read this book in the 80's and I still consider it one of the most imaginative, modern books I've read. Many agree. I can bring up this book into a conversation, and anyone who's read it agrees. Why is this great book not on kindle or nook?What an imagination!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious tripe","review":"One of the biggest disappointments of my literary life so far. purple prose mars an already convoluted story (if i may use that word lightly) and frequently cliched, lifeless characters. Helprin should be ashamed of appropriating the title of Shakespeare's lovely tragicomedy.Useless as reading material, I would nonetheless recommend the the hardcover version as a good booster seat for small children at the dinner table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter's Tale","review":"I keep having to repurchase this book because I give away my copy to any person I meet who loves to eat words.

An amazing love story about the city of New York and the people who lived in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wordy and Tedious","review":"Mr. Helprin has imagined an outrageous premise for this story....and I'm sad to say that he totally loses it in the telling. The authors need for over the top, wordy pages of descriptions become both boring and tedious by the end of chapter 4. I gritted my teeth and finished his book purely to see if, in the end, there were any redeeming factors that would make the chore of wading through all of his prose worthwhile. Unfortunately, in my humble opinion, the answer is no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter Tale","review":"Too many unnecessary words, especially adjectives.

I gave up after 3 chapters and I never do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floundering in a snowdrift","review":"I picked this up based on the New York Times putting this on a list of the greatest books ever. While it starts off being somewhat of a period piece / love story, it degenerates badly into a nightmare of ridiculousness and entire pages of gibberish. Parts or it are beautifully descriptive, but it's not enough. I found it impossible to suspend disbelief and was rather resentful that I felt like I had to finish it after plowing through several hundred pages. It's a matter of taste I suppose. Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish...","review":"I'm sorry I didn't read the sample before I purchased this book. From the beginning on one has to wonder where the author is going with the story line especially after all the rave reviews it received. There are a million similies on every page interjected with unfinished character situations that have one wondering what just happened. Some reviewers have said it's a fantasy and filled with symbolism....but honestly, no matter how I tried, it just couldn't tickle my fancy enough to continue reading. If this is the style of Mark Helprin's writing, I don't think any of his other books will make my wish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge waste of time","review":"It's clear that readers either love or detest this novel. I was swayed by all the glowing reviews, and let's face it, the price is right. I'll admit that the imagery can be stunning at times, but it eventually becomes too overblown for its own good.

I was prepared to employ some \\"suspension of disbelief\\" and was not suprised to encounter flying horses and mythical tribes in the first few chapters. Unfortunately it didn't end there. The story became SO abstract and convoluted that It was distracting. Some of the other negative reviews of this book indicate that the readers didn't finish it. I was determined not to give up and now wish I had followed their lead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost In The Snow","review":"Beautiful prose is not enought to save this book. I enjoyed the first third and was moved by the loss of Beverly Penn, but by the end of the tome I frankly didn't care who lived or died when the Apocalypse arrived. It was a surprise to find out that only middle class urban journalists and their friends will actually go to heaven while the poor burn in their hovels. Having said that, Helprin is capable of writing a great novel; A Soldier of The Great War remains one of my favourites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Don't Get It","review":"I only read the first 20 or so pages, because I couldn't get interested in this far-fetched tale.

It's very imaginative, well constructed and deals with love, God, and human nature. The characters are well developed and the book keeps you involved from start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mystical Read","review":"I am so glad this book took many hours to read. Whenever I read a book I love, I want it to go on and on. Winter's Tale was a book I thought I would like because I loved Helprin's other books. And I was not disappointed. The language is what grabs me when I read Helprin. A beautiful description, an unusual word pairing or a way of presenting an improbable image, is one of my favorite reasons for reading. Winter's Tale does all that. Many reviewers have given the bones of the story so I won't go there. However, the editing just about drove me crazy. I kept trying to overlook the typos-I counted them as I went-but it became so irritating. But I am glad I did not stop reading just because I was irritated with the editor and I would never let it stop me from the many hours of enjoyment I got from reading A Winter's Tale. The poor editing did effect the reading and hence the number of stars. This book deserved the best editing possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter's Tale","review":"Mark Helprin is a gift to readers. This amazingly beautiful story is the best of his works in my mind (although I do love them all). He writes like an angel would speak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter's Tale.","review":"I was pleased with the copy of Winter's Tale and the price was good. I had to change to mylar, but that was ok. I will order again from this vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take off your blinders and enjoy it!","review":"First, I am a Helprin fan and enjoyed this book and his others immensely. I wish Helprin were more prolific. In reading the reviews after reading the book, I read wondering, \\"is it just me? Were others as awed by this book?\\" Most apparently were. What I'm struck by is the references to Helprin's political beliefs in a few of these reviews. As a conservative, I found nothing politically conservative in this or other Helprin novels. My father was sure after reading WT that Helprin was a liberal! It sounds like a few of you, aware of Helprin's writing for the Wall Street Journal and Bob Dole had to hold the book at arms length, assuming from the start that it would offend you. Helprin's novels are about the wonders of life, love, and beauty. If you can't appreciate that, then your the poorer for it. Even conservatives like me, and Helprin if that's what he is, love, cherish children, appreciate beauty, and rejoice in the triumphs and struggles of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure wish fulfillment","review":"I hated this book because I didn't like or believe in any of the characters. Your heart can't soar with the hearts of characters you dislike, especially not for several hundred pages. So for me the book was nothing but a chore. On the other hand, friends of mine have loved it. What it boils down to is your own personal fantasy: if you dream of pulling yourself up by the bootstraps to a place where you consort with the rich and powerful, Winter's Tale will rub you right. If your dreams lie in another direction, it won't. It also helps if you share the political persuasion of Mark Helprin, who moonlights as a Republican speechwriter. The final cataclysm especially reminded me of the cheesy histrionics of Ayn Rand. Obviously a lot of people love this book, just not everybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"After all these years, still magic","review":"I was on a business trip in 1984 when I happened upon this book in a drugstore. It reminded me of The Godfather, the creation of a world so vivid and rich that I could not put it down. Over the years it has become a favorite ritual of mine to read this every January - right after Christmas/New Year when the weather conspires to crush the soul. Many of the descriptions stay with you. It is impossible to read of Peter Lake's visit to the lower Manhattan Oyster House with shells flying overhead that 'reminded some old-timers of the night air above Vicksburg' and not be astounded by Helprin's storytelling skill.I have read this 25 times already and never get tired of it. I always find a new gem every time.Strange - I could never warm up to 'A Soldier of the Great War' - but this work is my all-time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't think anyone could love New York as much as I do.","review":"This book should be required reading for all native New Yorkers, transplants and visitors, especially as we approach the millenium"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked this one...","review":"Perhaps 30 years ago I was entranced by this book (age 18?). Many years later, in a conversation with a friend, the author's name came up and my friend recommended \\"A Soldier of the Great War\\". I finally bought it at a used bookstore some 20 years later and tried two or three times \\"to get into it\\" and put it aside.Finally, persisting past the first few chapters, I read it in perhaps 3 days, and it remains one of my favorite non-fiction books. Several of my close friends (and my father, who lived though it) had a similar difficulty beginning the book, but once they finally read it, they agreed with my assessment.Recently I purchased another of Helprin's books \\"Ellis Island and Other Stories\\" (a collection of short stories). Obviously I am biased, but this author is a master of his art and I highly recommend both of the afore mentioned novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its different !!","review":"Winter's tale is a beautifully woven tale, which make you think about much more than the characters or the story. It is a brave effort by the author to write a refreshingly different story. The novel is weird, romantic and captivating. However, I liked the first half way better than the second half. Towards the end, the story started losing the magic which you can sense throughout the first half. So I would not rate this as an all time classic, but its definitely worth a read. I think you will like this if you like any (or all) of these books: Lord of the Rings, Black beauty, Harry Potter, Jonathn Livingston Seagull, Clockwork Orange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the madness! What the eff is everyone talking about?","review":"A decent book, but grossly overrated by the Amazon community. I'll keep this short.The good- Helprin is an excellent writer. A master of descriptive prose.The bad- He spends too much time mired in elaborate descriptions without adequate character development- As I neared the conclusion of the book I found myself indifferent not only to how the book ends, but also what happens to the characters. Not a good sign in my view- While the cover and the synopsis on the back call for an enchanting description of old NY. I feel obliged to warn you. 1) This book contains a flying horse. 2) Only about 40% of the book actually takes place in NY City.Buy this book if you are interested in fantasy, lore, symbolism and tall tails. Do NOT buy this book if you were looking for Romeo and Juliet meets Gangs of New York, or a flowing story about love and life in the best city in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don' t get it.","review":"There is some wonderful writing and imagery in this book. However, I found this book a long, wandering conglomeration of scenes that seemed to be more of a collection of ideas than the buildings of a plot. The creative language could not make up for the lack of a coherent story. If there was a big message in this book, I missed it. The only reason I even finished the book was because it was a selection of our book club.Maybe the secret is you have to be a New Yorker to love this book...what do I know, I'm from Boston."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please use your imagination","review":"Mark HelprinI am just an average person and I so thoroughly enjoyed \\"A Winter's Tale\\" that I bought it in hardcover because my paperback was getting worn out.

I feel sorry for people who cannot appreciate this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helprin's best...I think","review":"Great story, great language, and a great cast of characters--an uncommon hat trick. Oh, but for the guy who said this was his first novel, it wasn't. That was Refiner's Fire, which was pretty overwrought and not nearly this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter's Tale","review":"I rarely read a book twice; there are too many wonderful books in the world and too little time to read. But I've read Winter's Tale 3 times, and have grown to love it more with each reading. Mark Helprin is a writer's writer. He loves words and is fearless about using them beautifully. His characters are wild and lovable, the plot timeless and entertaining and in between, there are words and words and words to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"Reading this novel was like trying to ski downhill with snow up to your thighs. I kept thinking that I would eventually understand what some of these positive reviewers were going on about. My mother and I read this book at the same time and she finished first. She warned me that if I was confused after the first 200 hundred pages I would not feel any better after 500 pages. I should have listened. Thousands of beautiful words strung together does not make a story great if there is little to no plot, character development or connection to reality. I wish I understood what the author is trying to say but it really shouldn't be that hard. I like challenging novels but I just didn't feel any reward when I reached the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"True poetry","review":"After the first few chapters, I realized that I wanted to read this book aloud to everyone I know. I wanted them to experience Pearly Soames only photgraph, the first time that Peter Lake saw Beverly Penn, or skating down a frozen winter river with Virginia Gamely. I wanted to cry and laugh out loud. Where else can you find Praeger de Pinto, Craig Binky, and Reverend Mootfowl? Who else showed you the new millenium with the perfectly just city?I find myself taking this book with me everywhere, even after finishing it for the fifth or sixth time... and starting it yet again.For me- this is the most beautiful literature on the planet. Thank you, Mark Helprin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I realize I am out of step here, but . . .","review":"I simply did not enjoy this book. I found it too disjointed in plot and character development to hold my interest and make me read on. I literally forced myself to finish because other readers whose opinion I respect think so highly of this book. What I thought was intended to be funny was not funny to me and I simply wasn't overcome by the plot, the themes, the atmosphere, the language (except for limited and brief excerpts) or the characters. I do intend to read Soldier of the Great War which I am told may appeal more to my tastes. I could not decide as I was reading whether I was holding a fantasy, a historical novel or some other genre. As I was reading, I was asking myself why I should care about finishing this book (and I hardly ever fail to read a book to the end.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Book, Amazing Amount of Typos!","review":"This is an important and wonderful book.

It was like being on a train stuck in the mountains. For a while you can enjoy the scenery, but after a while you want the train to move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just when you think this is a book about reality ...","review":"... this author spirits you away into a realm of impossibilities made possible, a time-warped world where magic still resides in the midst of New York City. Mark Helprin weaves literary sorcery like no other author, and his lyrical touch makes every sentence a treasure. A huge, thick, cant-put-it-down read where you can't ever fathom what's next, because all the normal rules are suspended here. The backdrop of Snow-Queen reminiscent winters only increases the magic of this tale. No other style of writing is quite like Helpern's, whose voice is unique and opens the reader's mind when least expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A (long & boring) ode to New York","review":"Winter's tale is a series of connected vignettes taking place in Manhattan and upper state New York, spanning more than a century. It is really an ode to a fictionalized version of New York City, from its slums to the homes of its movers and shakers. It is the tale of the search for the perfectly just golden city, that New York is (unbeknownst to most of its inhabitants) striving to become.Winter's Tale is a maddening book. Helprin is an extremely gifted writer and individual passages are a delight to read. But the story meanders over its 600 pages. There is no coherent plotline. All I can say is that it took me 6 months to wade through it. It is long and it is dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discriptions very misleading","review":"The review said that it is a love affair between middle age Irishman and a dying girl. Well, she died in the first 19% of the book. The rest was about the flying horses and other bizzare events which left me cold. I do not like fantasy books and had I knowm that this was a book of that type, I never would have bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I'm a fan of Helprin's, based on having read and enjoyed \\"Refiner's Fire\\" and \\"A Soldier Of The Great War\\". I found \\"Winters Tale\\", however, to be a big dissapointment. There's a fine story contained in its 700- plus pages, but its buried in so much unecessary and flowery prose that the interesting parts are like islands separated by an ocean of words. Like the two books cited above, Helprin makes use of magic realism here, but while it was used to good effect in smaller doses in those works, \\"Winters Tale\\" chokes on it. Helprin seems to be showing off here, and the writing sounds self-indulgent and calculated to impress the literati, rather than entertain the average reader. A word to the wise: if you haven't yet read \\"Winters Tale\\", try \\"Refiner's Fire\\" or \\"A Soldier Of The Great War\\" instead. You'll be justly rewarded, and come away with a much more flattering impression of this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown Preachy Pseudo-Magical-Realism","review":"I fell for the hype on the cover of this book too, and I regretted every cent I spent on it. The style is like someone wanting to write a \\"great epic\\" but not really having what it takes. Endless, repetitive descriptive passages awash in mushy symbolism without spine may make some readers feel they have stepped into a magic land, but I for one want to say \\"no.\\" Halfway through, I skipped to the end, losing patience, thinking that the book must be going somewhere. But no, the final 40 pages were even less incisive than the first 300. This is not style, it is meandering. And there is not one interesting character. Please don't join the ranks of the purchasers of this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The writing is fantastic","review":"That is why in good faith I cannot give this book less than four stars - the writing is better than so many books that I have read. I am also not sure whether this book can be called epical romance - I would call it fantasy epic about New York. I have to admit that I also enjoyed first part more than the second part of the book. I just felt that exuberant magic slowly but surely changes to religious undertones (and I get that it was supposed to be that way from the beginning), but the more book is proceeding to the end, the more boring and in your face religious preaching gets IMO. At least I interpreted it that way. I do not mind when it is done in the interesting way (twist on the existing religion), but it was too obvious for me and a bit too annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Winter's Tale","review":"Very convoluted, with rampant hyperbole that was to be taken as literal....and too much non-sensical gibberish that I couldn't see how it advanced the story or mood. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shimmering imagery that lives in my mind years later...","review":"So much has already been said, so I won't repeat. Let me just say two things. One, I don't know anything about Mark Helprin being classist or elitist...I've never gotten that. Second, I think if I could only ever recommend one book to anyone to ever read, this would be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and Informative","review":"This is a real page turner. Karen Tintori does a great job of putting her story in context. She gives us a good feel for the mood of the times, and a fine appreciation for the life of a Cherry Hill miner. One fascinating part for me was how a series of small errors cascaded into a full scale catastrophe. Additionally, Tintori was able to interweave many different threads - the activities of the trapped miners underground, of the miners' families and mining company officials in Cherry Hill, and of government troops and experts arriving on fast amd efficient trains - into a cohesive and easy to follow tale. Most interesting of all were the steps that one group of miners took to stay alive. Their adventures, and those of their heroic would-be rescuers, give new insights on survival under all-but-impossible odds. This is a very involving story. If you are not afraid of an emotional roller coaster, then hop aboard for a ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best thing about this book....","review":"Was Tanner. The excellent, witty, sexually inexperianced teen who helps Belle harness her abilities. Rome was a good character and I liked the ex-wife, kid dynamic. It was new and gave the book a little something extra but for whatever reason I couldn't engage in this book like I have her others. It felt long, and really dragged at the end. Usually with a good book I refuse to put it down until I've reached the HAPPILY EVER AFTER but I found myself putting this one down on more then a few occasions and finishing it took FOREVER. I was hoping Gena's next project, The Nymph King, would have her usual flare but based on the sneak preview in Playing with Fire its not looking good. I gave this book four stars because I love, love, love Tanner. His parts made me laugh out loud. Without him the book would get two stars at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing With Fire? STOP PLAYING WITH READERS!!!","review":"Cute, Quirky story - but was released before - the authors and publishing companies have to stop duping readers into thinking this is a new story by placing a new cover on it and changing publsihing venues.

The story was really good, but I found the characters lacking a bit. The author really could of done better in getting personal with the people, Rome really felt like a stranger to me, sure he loved his daughter and seem to be fond of his ex wife ... but what else? He just did not feel real to me.The story itself is really great, I like the thought of \\"super heros\\", but the field could of been more detailed and explored. Like some were made with super powers and some were born, it wasnt explained why or who does what with them.I did enjoy it though, hopefully the second book is a bit more detailed into the race of these super beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"this book was excellent. It was fast paced, steamy, and wwell written. I highly recommend that you give this book a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This one totally cracked me up! The only reason I dropped it down to four stars instead of five was because the main character was a bit too Paris Hilton for me, or, at least she began that way, but there was improvement as the book went along. Rome, Mr. Sexy Catman, himself, was a dream. Tanner, the sex craved teen/pre-adult, was the king of one-liners and completely loveable. I hope this becomes a series because this superhero/comic book revivial novel was a blast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, fast-paced and lighthearted read","review":"Playing with Fire is a nice, quick, paranormal romance read with witty repartee and a lot of verbal and other foreplay. There isn't a lot of \\"physical action\\" other than the foreplay. The characters are reasonable and likable. It is interesting in that science has led the way to the paranormal powers. Of course, the science is sneaky and quasi-government. I really liked the book including the style of the writing, plot and the characters. The main characters are Belle (flighty yet deeper than she appears and genuinely caring), Rome (stern, yet fun loving G-man with a wicked humor), Tanner (puppy-like teen) and Vincent (the main bad-guy). Interestingly, the best looking guy is the bad guy and the hero likes the imperfections of the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"playing with fire","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, especially given the hype etc. Unfortunately it didn't live up to expectations.

Don't think I'll be reading another one of hers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bummer - I'd hoped for more...","review":"The cover is great. The teaser blurb is great. So I expected a book handling the idea of chemically induced mutation and the resulting problems of suddenly acquired super powers in a younger lady.

A neat premise...The hope gets lost in the many long and loving descriptions of hard nipples, how they turn hard, why they turn hard, and what they turn hard for. And respective other body parts.Oh well.... Not going to re-read it to look for redeeming features..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"The book, for me, started out badly. Belle's interactions with her customers were painful. Belle was incompetent, but then seemed surprised when her customers were upset. And the customers were unrealistically rude.Belle's whole attitude bothered me. She was concerned about her father and being able to provide for him, but couldn't keep a job for more than a couple weeks. And her reasoning for her inability to hold down a job - dissatisfaction with her life - was flimsy.I just couldn't make myself care for Belle, and while the storyline was ok, it didn't make up for my annoyance with Belle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little strategy, no technical help","review":"This book is easily read in a couple of hours.

And when I receive them in July and start playing the game, I found out a lot of information stated in the strategy guide is already outdated. I also found out there are alot, and I mean like %70, of the information missing. The description of the skills are too short and simple. There are almost no mention of how two or more effect affect each other. Not to mention missing creature types, item types, etc. After applying Patch ver 1.03, half of the already little amount of information is obsolete.

I was very pleased with the extensive section on the skill trees for each of the five classes. This is the most important aspect of the game, and an appropriate amount of the book was dedicated to it, unfortunately all other areas of the game are described in an abridged fashion. The quest descriptions were complete in the sense that all prudent information was given, but strategy was for the most part ignored. The lists of Unique items is difficult to read and lacks complete information about each item.

The main problem with this book is that it is not a \\"strategy\\" guide, since there is virtually no strategy in it at all. No help is given in the sense of tips for how to create a good character - no information at all on how to best allocate experience and skill points. The multiplayer strategies are about five pages of stuff I already knew. The guide gives you a basic overview of the game, but the original Diablo strategy guide is far superior.Blizzard should have written the guide themselves, or got a better publisher like Sybex, who always do good guides, to do it. The worst part is that in the introduction, Mr. Farkas readily atmits that he only ever got to play the game during his two visits to Blizzard North.

And even the writers opinions were killed because all the changing was to \\"change the balance\\" which makes other things more powerful than before, and some things less. As I write this, I still play D2 (quite obsesively) and we are now on patch 1.09 so even the expansion pack strategy guide, is out of date (based on 1.07) and it is now rumoured that version 1.10 is comming out soon.

A majority of the information is outdated, now that I have the newest patch. I've got first hand experience with the game, and this is really inaccurate. If you want a decent guide for this game, hope Prima makes one. They know how to do it, their Diablo guide was awesome. BradyGames should call them up and take notes. This game guide is missing weapon and monster details. People want details in a game like this. Even the quest section is bad. It gives a brief, ineffective walkthrough.

Instead of swallowing her bitterness, she ingests a constant stream of candy bars. She also points her sarcastic barbs at those around her--parents, classmates and even herself.

On the other hand, the amateurish filming techniques and ridiculous attempts at humor distract from the horror and give the film an unintentionally goofy tone. As the limbs begin flying, heads start rolling, and jugulars continue to spew, any fans with a decent amount of patience and a love for low-budget animal flicks should be able to stick this one out until the end for its cheesy B-Movie charm and cheap gags, but there is no mistaking that this is terrible Horror at its finest.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can it be this bad!","review":"I love werewolf movies but this is a first class joke--after wasting my time I threw the disc away and keep the best part --the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh My Goodness Gracious!","review":"After about 30 minute's or so I actually fell asleep.

Hopefully, now that Shout Factory has taken the MST videos from Rhino, they will do a better job of audio mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Looks like Casual Day at Control Data\\"","review":"Zounds -- the sight of our zoftig hero is enough to make even Luke Skywalker go over to the Dark Side. One of the most deliciously bad movies EVER, and Mike and the 'bots give it the full treatment it deserves. Store these images away for future nighmares: The wild scene with everyone swinging on ropes, while the soundtrack reverberates with \\"Ellie Mae goes to the see-ment pond\\"; Count how many times the Norm Crosby lookalike says \\"little doll,\\"; and finally Batwoman playing the organ (where's Al Lewis when you need him?) in her \\"hideout\\" that looks like part of Levittown. Who knew that drugs were such a problem in Hollywood, so early on? Don't try to figure it out - just let the wave roll over you and swim with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Very good book. I purchased it while doing research for a family history, trying to understand what my great-grandparents were going through when they decided to come to America. I read the section I wanted...and kept reading. Coohill does a very good job of covering the various factions and attitudes, and the feelings of the Irish at the time. Excellent book - I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Preposterous Ray Gun","review":"An otherwise entertaining and fascinating read was butchered by a ridiculous ray gun. The author's insights on the middle-east were engaging, the cultural and historical context of the book was great. Saddly, the weeks of research that went into making an compelling and mature picture of the characters and their situation were ruined by a Star Trek ray gun that blasted through walls and killed someone outright at a mere touch of the beam. Preposterous. I hate Ray Guns. Terrific picture on the book jacket though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The author is full of himself","review":"Although the author is articulate, his ideas are pure nonsense, a blend of pseudo-rational/philosophical musings and New Age gobblety gook dressed up in the name of some long lost Judeo-Christian writings. That does not mean he cannot hold the reader's attention. For dramatic effect, there are, of course, the obligatory evil fundamentalists thrown in. But we've seen all this before.Yawn.I don't know. Maybe it was not as bad as I thought. But at times I just could not get past the arrogance seeping through the author's presentation, as if he were the second coming of God himself spreading the \\"Last Gospel\\" to the illiterate and intellectually inferior masses.The author is full of himself. After a while, I just couldn't stomach it."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEEL-OFF","review":"GREAT PRODUCT!I COULD SEE A DIFFERENCE IN MY PORES SIZE AND SLIGHTDIFFERENCE IN THE FIRMNESS.PERSONALLY I PREFER PEEL OFF MASKS VS FACE MASKS YOU WASH OFF.JOHNNY GARCIA"},{"rating":"2","title":"The real story, at last!","review":"This book is surprisingly even-handed and fair-minded. Jessica Lynch comes off as likeable, a little naive, and brave in a way that's totally different from the \\"Rambo Jessie\\" that the government talked about. (I don't know what \\"griff44\\" is talking about below because Lynch specifically says that she feels uncomfortable with people describing her as a hero.) Bragg is a great writer, and this book is about a person, not a legend or anything like that, so I think it'd be an enjoyable read for anyone regardless of their feelings about the war itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great American Story","review":"Who would have thought that a 19 year old girl from a small town would ever become the symbol of hope for the nation. That is exactly what happened with Jessi Lynch. Her story is one that has left a lasting image in my head. Her book has shown anyone can do anything. She has truly inspired me, and her words fill my heart everytime I think about the horror that she went through. This book has given me the belief that if Jessi Lynch can survive her ordeal I can make the best out of every day at home with my faimly. She does not want to be called a hero, but she is an inspiration. Jessi could have agreed with the hype and the media stories, but she took the high road and told the truth about the captivity. She is and will always be a true american inspriation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellow Soldier","review":"Alright, Everyone needs to give this poor young woman a break! As other reviews stated, she did not assk to be thrust into the public spot light. She was simply doing her job. The code of conduct says that if you are captured that you sshould try at all costs to escape and evade. Although this was impossible for her, she did manage to fight off the doctors who tried to amputate her leg. The author obviously took a lot time in doing the research for this book, conducting what must have been hours upon hours of interviews. For anyone to say that we have made to big a deal over this, I say to them, walk a mile in my shoes. Walk a mile in her shoes. We are just doing our job and it is our job that allows you to say those things. Read the book. It is a great book, welll written , and very herat felt. This review says I am reviewing the audio cd. That is not the case. I did read the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Media Monopoly War Hype","review":"Thankfully, this media-created book is bombing. After two days, and after an initial printing of 500,000 copies, it's only #31 on Amazon and #22 on Barnes & Noble. That, in spite of having 14.9 million people watching the NBC Sunday night phoney docudrama, and wall-to-wall guest appearances on the usual media promotion shows. Hopefully, the several hundred thousand unsold copies of Rick Bragg's latest adventure in creative non-fiction will serve a better purpose being recycled than they would have cluttering up folks' bookshelves and brains. The best reviews of this book that I've seen are on stormfront.org."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hypocritical","review":"I can't believe Jessica says she wants her privacy when she has not said no to being on numerous talk shows, Magazines, Letterman and the Glamour awards. Her actions are very hypocritical. If she feels like the other soldiers deserve the attention then why is she taking all of it? I don't think she's a bad person and I certainly feel for what she went through but she is profitting off the backs of dead soldiers. That's the bottom line. She needs to step out of the limelight and go back to her private life..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books around","review":"This book is just one of the best books I have read in a long while. It really kept me intersted and I felt as if I were right there experiencing every pain and happiness that her family felt through the whole ordeal. I live in the same area as Jessica Lynch and know a lot of people who know her personally, and every word that is in that book about her and her family and the whole community is absolutely true to the \\"T\\". The author did such a tremendous job writing her story. I think anyone who has negative attitudes towards how much Jessica Lynch is in the media and about how she is being called a \\"hero\\", needs to read this book and I think their whole outlook on the whole situation will change. It is a definate must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest review","review":"Take the book for what it is, an honest account of her experience. I don't know why all these over reviews are slamming the war and using the Jessica Lynch book to talk about their opinion of the war. Remember, this is a book review, not an essay. It is easy to sit back and criticize the war and her book when you are sitting safe and warm in your home. Jessica, on the other hand, is going through physical therapy to try to be able to walk down the aisle at her own wedding. Injuries she received serving her country. Give her a break people! Everyone loves free speech until they hear something they don't agree with. Don't criticize Jessica for being honest about how she feels about her experience. She praises the soldiers who rescued her and sets the record straight that she was not the one firing her weapon until her capture. I appreciate her honesty and good morals in setting the record straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Hero..... Never","review":"A disgrace. Lynch is safe at home making money while others are dying on the battle field. This story is written in an overly dramatic tone and reads more like fiction. It appears that incidents are included for drama rather than the truth. Some of the run-on sentences don't fit well. Not a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction dressed as fact","review":"Jessica Lynch is desperate to cash in on her ten minutes of fame.

She isnt any more special than the other pow's. Its real sad to see that America thinks she's an icon when people in the war have died. What about them they deserve to be respected more by media and across this nation. I have respect for all the soldiers that have fought for this great country."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good investment!","review":"I just finished reading Jessica Lynch's book, and I enjoyed reading about her side of the story and about her family. The book has 200+ pages, and I finished it in three days. It was just too good to put down!If you're really into politics, then this probably isn't for you. If you want to read about an intriguing young woman's life, how she was miraculously rescued (if she had been rescued even a few days later, she would have died), and how she's adjusting to her current life, I think you will find this book a worthwhile investment.Jessica Lynch has been through alot in her short life, and I don't believe any of us have a right to be critical of her. She is a very courageous young woman. It takes a strong person to survive on such little hope, but by the grace of God and with many prayers lifting her up, she did, and she deserves our respect, not our critism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"I picked up the Jessica Lynch book on a wim and found the book to be excellent. I had read Rick Bragg's \\"All Over But The Shoutin\\" and loved his storytelling skills. He tells the Jessica Lynch story in a very sensitive and honest manner. Again his storytelling skills are remarkable. I am so glad that I read this book so that I was able to see an entirely differnet side of the Lynch story. the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder if she gave the money back","review":"I just saw on the news that she said this was fabricated. While I think what she went through was horrible, and she did survive it. There are a few issues. First of all she was out of it most of the time according to her. She did not fire a single shot. There were several real herose in the book who endured torture and stuff like that. It was dumb luck and she made money because of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The real story is about the rescuers--and it's not told here","review":"Jessica Lynch doesn't have very much to say, and even with Rick Bragg's help, doesn't say it terribly well. Hers is clearly a passive story of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. If you're interested in the kind of guys who came to her rescue, however, read \\"NONE BRAVER--US Air Force Pararescuemen in the War on Terrorism.\\" It's filled with action stories about real American heroes. Despite what you heard Diane Sawyer say, it was an Air Force PJ who got to Jessica first, who ripped the American Flag off his uniform and put it in her hands, and \\"packaged\\" her to be evacuated from the Iraqi hospital. When one of our people needs rescuing, odds are it's the Air Force PJs who do it. They are true, selfless heroes, living by the motto, \\"These things we do that others may live.\\" NONE BRAVER is the story of their missions in the War on Terrorism. And on Amazon.com, it's a ***** book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"To be able to live being a POW, is just incredible. Jessica Lynch is a true soldier. She is not just a soldier, she is a fighter and she has faith. This book goes into detail about Jessica Lynch and her incredible story being a POW. I give this book 5 stars because it is impelling, it is just one book you cant miss. Very sad story."},{"rating":"2","title":"First World Band!","review":"Year Future, a band composed of determined induviduals has compiled this track listing of which its main ingredients are songs from their first couple of EPs. 'The Hidden Hand' offers a glimpse into what dedicated guitar thrashing and commanding drum beats can accomplish, not to mention the screechingly insane vocals that will leave the listener yearning to hear more. At first they appear to be the typical post hardcore/punk sound but they soon grow on the ear and wrap themselves around the brain...This band has a special sound that cannot be heard by the conventional listener, but once the unconventional listener is grabbed ahold of by \\"First World Fever\\", it won't lack in being spun what so ever. Take a few listens."},{"rating":"1","title":"corelle burner covers","review":"The burner covers are not the same color as my Corelle Heirloom bloom dishes and I expected the covers to be made of the same material as my dishes - I received enameled tin - I would not recommend this product and my true rating is zero."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart of Hope","review":"I enjoyed listening to Victoria's CD.

The premise, a resistance against an evil corporate-government entity is not unique, but this is a well-handled rendering of the subject. The novel is in some ways reminiscent of Marge Piercey's \\"He, She, and It\\" though without Piercey's richness in creating a future world.Ebriel, a French flutist, loses her family in a shocking event which is covered up. She goes on a heroic quest to bring the perpetrators to justice, and her personal experience of persecution and her resulting rebellion are really the core of the novel. As usual, Marley brings her own knowledge of music to provide detail and context to her work, a nice touch as always and gives a flavor to the writing that I enjoy. I just couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hershey's Symphony Candy Bars","review":"I purchased these candy bars to give as little gifts to thank people who took a Salvation Army Angel card at our annual \\"Spirit of Christmas\\" concert.

Bouyed by the strong recommendations by Dr. Charles Ryrie and Dr. John Whitcomb on the back cover, I dove into the book expecting a clear and powerful rebuttal to the Pre Wrath theorists. Instead, I got a very confusing and overly detailed argument that lost me in its intricacies. Furthermore, his arguments against the Pre Wrath theory could be equally, and I believe more damagingly, applied against the Pre Tribulation theory. As a recent convert to the Pre Wrath view of the Rapture, I was not persuaded by Karleen to reconsider Pre Tribulation Rapture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing Earth Shattering (heh...)","review":"This book is overall what you'd expect it to be.

The market value of this book is actually pretty low compared to other out-of-print WEG Star Wars books, indicating that lots of people bought it back in the day.It's vaguely interesting but you probably won't use the information in an adventure.Oh, and WEG can't just \\"reprint\\" this book, because the license they held from Lucasfilm to produce and write Star Wars game material expired almost 10 years ago.

I'd be interested in hearing other viewer's opinions after they've viewed the DVD. It seems like the recipe for humor was lost somehow with this DVD.

But it is quite noisy and difficult to assemble/disassemble for cleaning..however now I do not have to take it apart every time it is used as I did before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds like \\"User\\" issues to me...","review":"We purchased a \\"Smoothie Pro 600\\" for our teenage daughter approximately 5 years ago for around $50.As she is the smoothie queen, she uses it almost daily. I'm sure she's made well over 1000+ smoothies with it. This product just keeps churning and churning and churning. No leaks, no jams, no problems!Today I finally had to order a new blade assembly and gasket which will be delivered in 5 days. Cost of parts...a whopping $9, amount of time to find parts, less than 2 minutes.For all of you folks who claim that the Smoothie Pro 600 is riddled with issues, keep in mind that this is not a $200 model and maybe you should just RTFM and do a little maintenance every now and then.Or, you could just have your kid make your smoothies!So why no 5 star rating? I will concede that it is not the quietest unit on the market, hence the 4 stars. Otherwise, this smoothie maker is a REAL WORKHORSE."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun for children!","review":"We had one of these for our first son until it was run over in our driveway! I knew how much my first son loved his, so I had a feeling our 3 year old would like it, too. I forgot just how easy it was to assemble, which is great for me since I have a hard time following directions. You just attach the handlebar and it is ready for play. The bubbles are optional and definitely a bonus. Since it is getting colder, my son pushes the lawn mower around the house, but when it is nice out, we've added the bubbles and had them come out without issue. I did notice that in order for the bubbles to start coming out, you have to push pretty fast. Once you get some speed going, they come out like crazy and the kids get so excited! They also like the engine sound when pushing, so it seems just like the one their Papa uses. This is a fun toy for kids and affordable, too. It should last quite a while as long as no one leaves it behind a car!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage!","review":"We tried two, and neither of them blow bubbles. I actually had to jog with it and it produced SOME bubbles. My son, however, likes the mower itself so we will keep it. Once the cheap bubbles run out we will try a better bubble solution and see if that works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubbleless and tipsy","review":"We are experiencing alot of the same issues as other reviewers. We switched the solution and still no bubbles. If you have to mess around that much to get this to work, it's not even worth it in my opinion. Very disappointed with this and returning it tomorrow. Not only does it not blow bubbles after switching the solution and following all the directions, but my son can't even push it because it is so tipsy it causes him to fall down when he tries. If you want a sturdy hassle-free toy your child can push around on the lawn, DON\\"T get this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does not work, even when you replace the bubble and rinse it","review":"What a disappointment! We were eagerly waiting until our son was old enough to push this. We tried it with the bubble solution that came with it, and nothing happened. I read these reviews, cleaned it, and replaced it with miracle bubble. Still, nothing! It does make a cool mower sound, but literally produces no bubbles at all. I went through all of the trouble shooting tips that come in the box with it. None worked. This one's going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"my son received this for his birthday. it doesn't work as advertised. makes tiny bubbles and just barely. big waste unfortunately."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work. waste of money","review":"Doesnt make bubbles as advertised.

Such a waste!"},{"rating":"2","title":"mower and no bubbles","review":"Great toy, my 1 and 2 year old love it and they mow for at least 20mins at a time. The bubble part isn't great sometimes bubbles are everywhere and other times it just leaks everywhere. However I don't mind it not functioning correctly cause the kids just want to mow. I bought this one and the pink one and can't believe that they will play for this toy for so long. It was completely worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was so excited when I bought this the other day for my almost 2 year old because she loves bubble. It was really easy to put together, but that was the only thing that was good about it. No matter how hard we pushed, it was really hard to actually get any bubbles to come out. I followed the directions of pushing for about 15 feet but it still did not work properly. I think I wasted almost a whole container of bubble solution (eventhough I know it is really cheap) just trying to get any bubbles to come out. My little one now just pushes it around the lawn or back yard pretending to cut grass. So at least it is useful if there aren't any bubbles."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bubbles","review":"We bought this because my two year old loves bubbles. This this was a complete disappointment and returned it immediately. It only sputtered out bubble solution and did not produce any bubbles. I did try using some other bubble solution from the grocery store and that did not work either. I would NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"so-so","review":"I bought this for my 3 yr old nephew. He loved it when he opened it and insisted on opening it inside. It took a lot of tries to get the bubbles to work, and then they leaked out. He went through the bubble bottle in 5 minutes. Needless to say we had to take it away from him and clean it up. It will make a good summer toy and will be hit or miss with the bubbles. the toy itself is sturdy."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We had high hopes for this toy. It spit out a few bubbles, and then didn't spit out anymore. We went through the trouble shooting part of the instructions, and got a few more bubbles, but since the initial day of play (my son's birthday) we have been unable to generate ANY bubbles from this \\"bubble mower\\". As I spoke to other parents, they say the same thing, that the mower worked once and then NEVER AGAIN. He loves to push it though bubbles or no bubbles. At this point bubbles would be a surprise as I don't think he even knows it is or was supposed to be a bubble mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liquid doesn't stay in","review":"My kids love it, but forget bubbles... we went through the entire solution in one hour because they kept lifting the mower, and the solution was just pouring out... horrible design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubble Mower","review":"Kids and bubbles can you think of a better combination? My son had this a few years ago and I knew my nephew would have just as much fun with it - I was right, he loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Bomb","review":"I got this for my daughter who loves bubbles. First of all just to make the bubbles you have to push hard down toward the ground while pushing forward, which was hard for me and my husband much less a toddler. When the bubbles did come out they were so close to the ground that they almost immediately popped and she had no chance of popping them herself. It does make a type of lawnmower sound but there again you have to press down toward the ground very hard and then push forward while doing so it is just not practical for a small child. It can be pushed around for pretend play, but the purpose was for great sound and bubbles. My daughter does not even want to play with it. I feel I wasted my money and would have been better off donating the money to charity or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE ARE THE BUBBLES?","review":"BUBBLE MOWER, HUH? Like everyone else says, it is a lawn mower and nothing more. You can have lots of fun pushing it around but dont expect more than that. The bubbles dont work at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Just like so many of the other people who have written reviews, I too saw no bubbles come out of the mower. I rinsed it out several times, walked 20+ steps and have even switched bubble solution. My 27 month old son likes to push the mower, but I could have bought any push toy to achieve the same purpose. I bought this mower for the bubble feature because my son loves bubbles. I was very surprised because Fisher Price has such good toys and I have been happy with them in the past with other toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the bubbles?","review":"My 3 year old hates this mower. He \\"pumps\\" the bubble container just like the instructions say but the bubbles do not come out. We followed the instructions but no luck. We are extremely disappointed with the lack of bubbles.Plus, my son likes to check the bubble amount when no bubbles appear and here comes the soap. So instead of a shower of bubbles like the package shows, I get a soapy wet spot. The soap container is not spill proof! Now my little boy pushes it around with no soap.This is a great concept but not a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bubbles from this bubble maker","review":"I had the same experience as the majority of the reviewers. The instructions were very simple to follow, but the toy just doesn't perform the main function we bought it for. After about 10 steps, we'd get maybe four bubbles. My daughter was very disappointed. I will be returning this toy to Toys R Us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it to the Store","review":"This was a Christmas gift for my 17 month old son. We chose this mower versus the others on the market for the bubble-blowing function. However, we took it for a \\"spin\\" and never could get any bubbles to come out. After much experimenting, I discovered that if I had a very long stretch of carpet to push it across and I got a running start, I could eventually get a pitiful little stream of bubbles to sputter out the side and rest along the floor for a few seconds. Needless to say, we have already taken it back to Toys R Us (we received a refund with no questions asked, as usual). This is not the caliber toy I expect from Fisher Price. Too bad, because it is a very cute idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"No bubbles","review":"We also could never get this thing to make any bubbles. No matter what type of solution used, amount of pumps, or how fast/hard it was pushed, the thing just does not make bubbles. It does do a great job of making messes, id never use it in my home with any liquid in it. The only reason I gave this toy stars is because even though there aren't any bubbles, my son still loves to push this thing around. Indoors or outside its a fun toy to just push around and pretend."},{"rating":"1","title":"no go for the bubbles","review":"The lawn mower does not make the bubbles. For the price I do not think it is worth it. My one year old grandchild stops using it very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I never write product reviews for anything I purchase. However, I this Bubble mower was such a disappointment, I feel others considering to buy for themselves should think otherwise. The mower maybe blew 4 or 5 bubbles and would only do that while my son was running at full speed, which isn't the safest situation. Then the bubbles leaked all over, making a huge mess. Luckily, my son never even realized it was supposed to blow bubbles and enjoys pretending to cut grass.Don't waste your time or money buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"who cares about bubbles","review":"first off if your looking for a bubble mower then look else where but if you want a mower that runs over every surface with just the right amount of balance on the front and the back then you found the one your looking for. Grass,thick carpet or gravel this mower plowed over all of it!!! The mower is sturdy and made a hard bright colored plastic, it makes a great mower sound when push and best of all requires no power source to produce the sound. If your wonder about the bubble portion of the mower then read all the other reviews, i've yet to use the bubble portion of this product and to be honest i have no plans to in the near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"I bought this mower for my daughter who is two. I took advice from reviews here when it didn't work, and followed the included instructions (and troubleshooting) carefully. We tried cleaning it, we used different bubble solution, and the only way we could get it to make bubbles is if I pushed down on the mower and ran with it. It took a lot of effort for me (and my husband) to get it work, and there was no way our two-year old could do it. We returned it. Great concept for a toy, just too much trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"My boy loves it, I think it's ok.","review":"My son got this as a gift for his 1st birthday, but didn't really get the hang of it until around 15 months. We've not had a problem with the mower blowing bubbles, but the bubbles don't come out unless you really push hard (at 16 months, he still barely gets bubbles out) so my husband (or myself) has to push it for my son to see the bubbles. My son loves this toy, but it's mostly because 1) he's outside when using it, and 2) he thinks he is mowing like daddy does!I am not the biggest fan... bubbles leak with the slightest tilt; bubbles come out at ground level and don't really float around. But my boy loves it, and it's the first toy he grabs when he goes outside, hence the 4 stars..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck!","review":"We never did get the bubbles to work, but nearly 4 years after we purchased this toy it is STILL something our children play with nearly every day. We oroginally purchased it when our oldest child was 1. After a few years it was gradually passed down to our 2 year old and I'm sure our baby will be toddling around behind it in no time. In the summer, they mow their little hearts out in the yard. In the winter, they bring it inside and mow the carpet. It is hands-down the best toy we've ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, don't waste your money","review":"I have trusted Fisher-Price for many years and bought this brand new for my daughter for Easter. Terrible, terrible, terrible. Bubbles would not blow out and bubble solution leaked all over the place. We thought we did something wrong, but the instructions noted \\"leakage may occur and bubbles may not be produced\\". What is the point? We returned it. I hadn't read the on-line comments before then, but just Google Fisher-Price bubble mower and you will see more negative comments. What a piece of garbage, and it's not cheaply priced!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No bubbles","review":"I bought this toy for my 2 yr old for Easter. It is the night before and just took it out of the box to put it together and NO BUBBLES! I did what the instructions said and the bubbles pop as they are forming.

Basically this is just a toy lawn mower for our kids to play with because the bubble feature is terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"My wife bought this toy for our twin grand-daughters. We tried it out ahead of time. To get any bubbles to come out, you have to walk very fast. They aren't going to be able to push it that fast. Even then, the bubbles don't shoot out that great. A lot of them hit the ground right away. We took it back and got another one, thinking there was something wrong with it. Same result. We even tried a different bubble solution. Didn't they test this thing out at the factory??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corbin's favorite birthday gift","review":"We watched this little boy push around everything in our house, so decided he needed something that he could properly use. Since he also had his Mom blowing bubbles constantly, this was the perfect selection of a gift. Needless to say, it was the hit of his birthday party! Once he opened it up, he was off walking all over the yard making bubbles. He's very posessive of it and this is the one toy he doesn't want to share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bubbles galore!!!","review":"We got this about a month ago for my 2 yo son. From the start, bubbles were there quickly, even with the supplied bubble solution. TONS of bubbles! No problems yet, my son can't get enough of it! Even when the bubbles run out, he still loves it because of the engine sound. Awesome toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It does work.","review":"We have now had this for two years and it does work. I would say one of the most important things is to make sure the wheels are making good contact with the ground and that the grass isn't too long. Some bubble brands are better than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"my son can't get enough of this mower","review":"A friend got our son the John Deere lawn mower after his first birthday. It was ok, but not so much of a success. A couple months later, my mom got this one for him for Christmas. We tried it out and did just like the directions asked. The bubbles didn't come out consistently and there were spills everywhere. So we took the bubble solution out, and just used it as a mower. My son LOVED it without the bubble feature. He takes this thing everywhere he goes. He stopped using the John Deere one so we took it to grandma's as back up mower. Our son will be 2 in a couple of months. He has pushed this mower for blocks on end. Any time we go for a walk around the neighborhood, or to the grocery store (2 blocks away), he wants to take it with him. Bubble issues aside, if you are looking for a mower that sounds great and has some fun buttons, this is the one. If you are just interested in the bubble feature aspect, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising","review":"My [...] received this mower as a gift and was beyong excited to have a mower like Daddy. However the first mower had no bubbles and broke the first lap around the yard and when we returned it and got another the bubbles still have never come out. We did READ all the instructions and my husband used the mower first to see if it would work, but never did for him either. We didn't have the heart to take it away again, so our son plays with a mower that has never bubbled and is disappointed everytime I tell him we can't put bubbles in b/c it doesn't work. When we contacted Fisher Price, they gave a canned response and told us to take it back. What kind of manufacture are they? We are very diapoointed with everything involving this mower and will think twice before purchasing any additional FP toys for our 2 small children."},{"rating":"2","title":"My sons favorite toy","review":"My two year old son loves this lawn mower.

Great for outdoor play."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son hasn't stopped playing with it!","review":"I bought this mower on impulse at a Babies R Us store, thinking it would keep my 3 year old occupied outside while I worked in the garden. Unfortunately, we're on our fifth straight day of rain so neither of us have had much time outside. Our carpet, however, has been mowed more times than I can count! My son absolutely loves this mower, and he adjusts the gears and buttons as though they actually do something. He loves the vroom sound the mower makes, and I have to admit I was pretty impressed it the sound and the mower's durability, having been through two other toy mowers with my two older sons. When my 3 year old found it it makes bubbles, too, you wouldn't think there was a happier boy on earth! I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it... but be sure to buy extra bubbles!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and durable","review":"My now 8 year old grand-daughter received this as a gift when she was two. She used it a bit but this toy has gone on to get much use from my now 5 yo and 3 year old grandsons. The bubbles never worked right but they have had hours of playtime with it. It's been outdoors for most of six years in New England and although a bit faded the boys are happy to play with it again this year. I would highly recommend it to anyone who may be interested.

And you also have to make sure the back wheels are making contact with the ground.I haven't noticed any huge messes with our mower. But we do not bring bubble toys in the house. But, again, if you READ THE DIRECTIONS it tells you how the clean the mess up with a garden hose after use.I suggest you read the directions and look at the box before you decide to buy this.

In the street, it would work if I pushed it and pushed the handle down and forward (awkwardly), but if my son had it and just pushed the mower like any other toy, there would not be enough friction on the front wheels to make bubbles blow out.We went threw 1/2 the bottle of bubbles in 15 minutes because it leaked and then there wouldnt be enough for the wand to get and bubble juice on it.I returned it the next day, Luckily they said others had complained too, and they allowed me to return it used."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bubbles, Don't Buy","review":"This product does make a great mower noise, but that's where the compliments end.

We followed all of the troubleshooting tips, and because everyone in my family is a know-it-all, that means there were three different adults who did the \\"No, let me try it now\\" approach from start to finish.

We had just moved from an apartment to a house. It did take a long while for the bubbles to work with the original solution, which resulted in it getting tipped over and the bubbles spilling out all over. We had to get replacement bubbles and the Miracle Bubbles work jut fine. There is still the problem of it getting lifted up and bubbles spilling out, but really they are not that expensive, just more of an annoyance.The great thing about this toy, is that my son loves it, even without the bubbles. He feels like a big kid pushing it all around our screened in lanai. Sometimes it makes it in the house and gets pushed around too, which is ok when it is out of solution. He is two years old now, and still loves playing with it. He is getting a Power Wheels for Christmas, so we will see if that changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was defective","review":"I bought this for our 17 month old son.

We had a 3 1/2 year old over and he was able to get the bubbles to work, but only if he ran with it!

This mower has cool engine sounds when you push it around and swithces that click when turned.The downside is that when its pushed, it looks like it wants to shoot out bubbles, but never does. It looks more like it is drooling than anything else.Plus if it is picked up it will leak bubble mix all over. Our son bot it stuck when he ran it over one of his other toys, he then picked it up to free the mower and lost about 25% of the mix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for the Bubbles","review":"I bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old daughter because she loves bubbles. I thought what fun it would be for her to \\"help\\" dad mowing the lawn and to create bubbles at the same time.I was very disappointed the mower does not blow bubbles! The manual says to check for adequate solution in mower but does not tell you how. I called the Fisher-Price Help Line and they told me to take it back. Thought maybe they could help to give me some things to check to make sure I put toy together right. (Next time I won't bother making the call)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product. DO NOT BUY IT!!","review":"If you are interested in this toy for your 2+ year old, you better head by the paper towel isle on your way out and stock up. That is if you intend on using this thing anywhere inside your home. Sure this thing looks harmless enough, but apparently it is designed so the bubble solution just pours into a shallow open cup inside. Just a slight jolt of pushing the mower is enough to slosh the solution out onto the floor. We spent about twenty seconds putting this together by attaching the push handle and about a hour scrubbing the spilled soap out of the carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"this really takes a bit to make the bubbles","review":"I WOULD NEVER ORDER THIS ITEM.

It has a horrible design. Whoever came up with this one must have literally thrown it together. I really thought it would be a cool toy for my grandson. Boy was I wrong! I heard that this mower had been re-designed to correct some former flaws. If that's the case, then the first one must have been really awful! As far as I'm concerned, Fisher Price can keep this toy. I am returning the one that I purchased this week. Fisher Price should be ashamed of themselves for selling this item.

I would give 5 stars for the amount of hope I had that this toy would be a hit for my 1-year old's birthday and yes - when he saw it his eyes lit up and he eagerly went over and \\"tried\\" to push it across the grassy yard. However, he was immediately met with disappointment. This lawnmower is very hard to push across grass. It has a lot of tension in the wheels. I guess this is necessary for the bubble-blowing mechanism to work. However, you must also push rather fast for the bubbles to blow so......my 1 year old abandoned this toy after about 5 minutes of trying to push. You can push it easier across pavement but then the bubbles still don't blow b/c he's not able to push it fast enough.

So when my youngest one was given this as a gift, my impulse was to return it to the store. But it was a different model and it was a gift from a very beloved family member, so we tried it out. We understood and followed the directions. It does not work at all. The mechanism inside turns but bubbles do not actually come out of it. I wish we had not put any bubbles in it so we could just let her use it as a push toy inside the house. (It works as a simple push toy and may encourage your child to walk - but for the price you can find something better). The idea is really cute, but it just does not function as promised. Thankfully my little one is too small to have expected bubbles. I can imagine the tears of disappointment if she had known what it was supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loves it","review":"The bubble soap this lawn mower comes with doesn't work to well. I haven't gotten any new bubble soap for it, but I'm sure it will work better. Either way my kid loves to push things around so I knew he would love his own push mower. Plus it is a good price even if the bubbles don't work very well.UPDATE: I got some bubbles from Target called Spritz and they work really well. He loves it even more now. The only thing that sucks is when he goes to turn the mower around it ends up dumping the bubbles out the side and and on my carpet. I wish there was some way to keep the bubbles in the mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying!","review":"My husband and I read the directions to load the bubbles and attempted to try out the mower and noticed that we had to push it very fast before bubbles came out.

The thing is a piece of junk. A few reviews here have suggested washing it out and using different bubble solution than what it's shipped with. Even if this works, seems like Fisher-Price should be testing their products before shipping them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk","review":"We got this as a birthday gift for our son. We first started using it with the bubble soap given with the mower. Too disappointing, it never worked. My son was so sad to see no bubbles at all. And I saw the reviews in Amazon. I went and bought a new bubble soap in walmart and tried to use it. We did see bubbles but they were not too many to have fun...You got to be pushing it so fast at least for 15 feet to start seeing some bubbles..and it is the rear wheels which makes the bubbles so if my son pushes it too hard, he unknowingly lifts the rear wheels and it ends up not generating any bubbles at all. This one is just piece of junk. He totally lost interest and I finally bought a 5 dollar bubble blower from Walmart and he is having lots of fun now.

The vocal style on this album is completely different from the established Jack Bruce-like sound.

In his latest popularization, \\"Galileo's Finger\\", Atkins outlines what he considers are the ten central ideas of science. Without bias, he only chooses two from his own area of expertise. The rest are from the realms of biology, physics and astronomy. Given that only two to three of the chapters are part of a high school curriculum, the book is essential reading for anyone who has not studied science past that point. His writing neither oversimplifies nor bores the reader, reminiscent of the way the late Stephen Jay Gould practised his craft. I love Atkins' definition of chemistry, \\" It is the bridge between the perceived world of substances and the imagined world of atoms.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Panoramic view of modern science","review":"This captivating book deals with the ability of the scientific method to explain the wondrous nature of the universe. The author's elegant style, clear explanations and understated humour ensure an engaging read. Atkins has chosen 10 simple concepts of great import that manifest into a giant tree of application. With its patient explanations, it is an excellent guide for the lay reader to become literate in modern sciene. The major insights of modern science discussed here are evolution, DNA, energy, entropy, atoms, symmetry, quanta, cosmology, spacetime and arithmetic. The book includes black and white photographs and illustrations, a bibliography arranged by chapter and an index.

Instead of taking a traditional approach for theoretical learning of a language, It takes a practical approach by introducing dialogues between 2 or more people and then going into the verbs and nouns and vocabulary introduced in that dialogue.This gives enough confidence to start to speak after first few lessons.Lessons are short and therefore motivates older learners to sit and go through the whole lesson without distraction or boredom.Besides that cultural notes and pronunciation explanation helps understand the text better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent all around","review":"Exactly what I was looking for.

I will not be cruel and say that the tunes are bad, although I have thought about it on a couple of occasions, it's just that the whole piece seems to be disgruntled... there seems to be very little link between each of the songs, and even though some of the numbers start off quite promising, they seem to lose strengh as the song develops...

Her acting was probably one of the best I have seen in the theatre in a long time.Buy this CD and you will enjoy every moment of it. It's beautifully written and has an beautiful story. Stephanie J.

The truth is that these bars are sugary, they don't have much in the way of protein, and while they do offer some of the vitamins one needs, one would have to consume a large amount of them to get one serving of fruit. In our home they are definitely a \\"sometimes\\" food like other sugary snacks.

Having only listened to this album once, my first impression was that they sounded Beatlesque. The first track (and my current favourite), \\"Laura\\" is a prime example. The rest of the album reminded me of a mixture of the Pet Shop Boys and other similar 80's bands. Initially, I thought they were a British band (style/appearance, lyrics, tour dates), and couldn't figure out why they kept referring to places in the States...mystery solved - they're from New York.

I accept this album as a social / age-group marker, a nod to staying tuned and keeping up with society. The bunch are urban, picturesque and mixed, the arrangements between establishment pop and white r'n'b (someone sniffed disco?) - but from what I saw live I gather they can't \\"read\\" and communicate onstage. Next, they carry no message. They're no aged, retro and grotesque Sweet who still stir audiences with sheer teenybop energy.

If you are most interested in learning the most popular Guaraldi song \\"Linus and Lucy\\" you will probably be quite disappointed with this sheet music. While the music is quite easy for intermediate pianists to learn, the melody sounds quite off. The song is written in the key of C, which while this is easier to play than the original music I am sure, the music seems very unnatural. This version of \\"Linus and Lucy\\" doesn't sound right at all later in the song as well. If you are more interested in learning a variety of Peanuts songs with relative ease this book is a good purchase. Songs such as \\"Skating\\" sound much closer to the actual music and are also pretty easy to play.

The projects in this book contain bright and helpful pictures and diagrams for each project. The directions are clear and give the reader a good understanding of how to proceed.

With get a look at what it must have been like to be her, a child bride, and completely unaware of what is in store for her. the famous line when they became the reigning king and queen\\" we are too young to govern\\" was probably true.We see her slowly mature and see through her eyes the country falling apart.

In all of her \\"I\\" novels written from the point of view of a Queen, the reader actually becomes that woman's confidante and you feel that you really know her. It's an extraordinary gift for a writer to make someone feel so at home with an aloof historical character.ETA (10/30/09): Having read more Plaidy recently and finding her style dry and hard to get through, I wonder what my opinion of this book would be, now 10 years since my original review? :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds of the time","review":"MALO was a sound that kept the latin sound alive.

As with the series in general they wander, but this time it is too an extreme and the story they are telling serves no point.

I leave for a cruise next week and that's why I ordered the steamer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me...","review":"Simply put, it doesn't work. Well, perhaps it can work on some types of fabrics/garments in very specific (or limited) situations, but it didn't work on mine.You can't manage to get a continuous flow of steam, even if you keep on pumping the button frequently (what it doesn't support, as a matter of fact, because there's a limit of bursts of steam it can shoot out in a row before \\"reloading\\").I returned it to seller (Brand Variety, that refunded me without problems, no question asked).Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spit, splatter, refill. Spit, splatter, refill...etc., etc.","review":"Tsk, tsk, tsk Black and Decker - maybe you should stick to your basic manly tools and not lead us consumers to believe that you can master a simple (in theory) concept of a steamer. This product is a joke. It drips, spits, splatters - then after maybe one or two hard-earned puffs of steam (if your thumb hasn't broken from pushing the button over and over...and over again - and it's hard to push), it needs to be refilled...again...and again...and again. In general, I have yet to find a steamer that actually works well no matter what the cost - and unfortunately a better one is too big to store. So I'm sticking to using my trusty iron upright - it's basically what this piece of junk was meant to be anyway. It might be good for knocking burglars on the head, but I think the trash can is better place for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for traveling!","review":"i LOVE this travel steamer. I take it with me on my international business trips and it works great on my suits. The best part is that it comes with adapters that you can use on your other electronics as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steamed","review":"It doesn't steam like the steamer it replaced. It for sure is portable and should only be used in a squeeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice","review":"This is soulful pop and rock at its best, an album of impressive versatility. McCluskey's vocals are warm and engaging, strong at times, then dreamy then vulnerable. The instrumental mix is particularly imaginative, and includes guitar, piano, organ, strings and even slide guitar, whilst the rhythms include pop, country-rock and reggae. In between, there are exquisite atmospheric moments, little trip-hop infusions that add a special charm. My favourite songs include It's Been Done, Love Is Stronger Than Death and Sleep On It but her exceptional voice makes even the weaker material an enjoyable listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"quite a voice","review":"angela mccluskey has one of those pricelessly unique voices that can do no wrong -- a deeply resonant, almost scary lower range, a husky, jazzy, squeaky-creaky belting upper range, and a whole host of bizarre colors in between. there's so much personality in her voice, so much style, that each word merits close attention.there are some truly great songs on this disc (\\"it's been done,\\" \\"perfect girl 11,\\" \\"long live i\\"), and some lesser material, but even on the less stellar songs the voice of a truly captivating artist brings the material to life. she sounds better here than she's ever sounded. a must-have for fans of beth orton, portishead, billie holiday, janis joplin, macy gray -- for anyone who appreciates a uniquely compelling voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like her voice, you have to own it.","review":"Angela McCluskey has been one of my favorite singers for many years now.Her voice is a flawless mix of Marianne Faithful and Billie Holiday. It is at once strong yet broken, husky yet delicate.I was a little disappointed at first with the CD. I love \\"It's Been Done,\\" the lead single. I found the rest of it to be a little too pop-y for my taste and that she got lost in catchy hooks and overproduction. Then it grew on me and now it's in regular rotation again.The lyrics can be a little painful at times (\\"Oh God, you're reading Albert Camus/ and there's nothing you can do\\") but her brilliant voice proves she can do no wrong. \\"Sleep on It\\" and the cover of \\"Love is Stronger Than Death\\" are exceptional.Also check out her work with Wild Colonials, Triptych, and Telepopmusik and catch her on tour with the Finn Brothers. She's amazing in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this CD obscure?","review":"I have been collecting music for several decades and I have to say that this CD gets the most playing time of anything in my collection. The combination of her unique rasp and soulful, sometimes stark (but not sappy) thoughts never tire on me.Since \\"It's Been Done\\" leads it off, my teenage daughter can recite everyword because I've played \\"The Things We Do\\" so often on the morning drive to school.Every so often, I check to see if she has finally produced another CD. Nothing.....so I hit play one more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many can pull off ...","review":"Who else do you know who not only has the nerve to cover a Matt Johnson/The The song, but can pull it off to boot? For those wondering ... go to www.thethe.com ... you can listen to all their music on their web jukebox ... click the album DUSK and the song LOVE IS STRONGER THAN DEATH.

I can grow mold really well in the wood even though its treated wood. There are no holes in the center section of the pot to let water through, but holes are not needed. Rain seeps in from the edge of the pot and since the pot is seated so well on the railing, it refuses to let the wood dry out. We didn't even have a hard rain and after a week the wood was still very wet. I had to remove the pots to dry the railing out. If you raise the pot so that air can get under, then the pot is not firm on the rail and would fall off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this product","review":"I love this product it was just as pictured and I have gotten so many compliments.

The Bio Ionic does reduce drying time by almost half which is great but it leaves my hair frizzy and damaged. I have curly hair and I needed a hair dryer that wouldn't damage my hair or cause it to break. The dryer only has one heat setting which is WAY too hot. After a few uses I noticed my hair getting significantly thinner and I had a lot more broken pieces. I think this dryer would only work for people with super thick hair that's not easily damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took twice as long to dry","review":"I bought this dryer expecting it would save drying time based on the various reviews I read prior to purchasing. However,it took twice as long. I have very thick, wavy hair and I need to use a round brush while blowdrying. Since this dryer is so expensive, I dedided not to keep it, sent it back after one use. I was not refunded my money. I was charged a 15% restocking fee, $13 to send it back plus the original shipping. So, when all was said and done it cost me FIFTY dollars for the privilege of trying this dryer. I will NEVER order anything from this seller again. As far as I'm concerned they are crooks and should be ashamed of themselves. I hope they enjoy the FIFTY dollars they stole from me and Amazon should be ashamed for doing business with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!","review":"This dryer is heavier and took longer to dry my hair than the 15 year old dryer I was replacing. I hate it. Also, the on/off button is right where you hold the dryer, so it's hard to use it without turning it off by mistake. Very annoying. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! Well worth the price!","review":"My husband bought this for me as a gift after another brand (also very expensive) kept breaking on me. I've always used high end hair dryers so the price didn't deter my husband. I've had this one for over a year and haven't had any issues with it. I blow dry my hair everyday and still have healthy hair. It dries quickly. I wouldn't say that it conditions my hair or that it's a miracle blow dryer, but it is better than other high end dryers. I still use conditioner daily. I would recommend this dryer over others for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it....","review":"Great product..... I love it .......

Even when he tries to be funny, he just simply isn't. Also, I disagree with most of the things said. I'm not bashing the DVD for that, though, because his opinions are HIS opinions. I'm only giving it 2 stars because it just simply is not very entertaining, and he dosen't say much that I haven't already heard him say before. I immediately listed my copy for sale on Half dot com after viewing it. Stick with the music Gene."},{"rating":"1","title":"A portrait of a fallen hero...","review":"Another of Gene Simmons products that seems to be throw together in five minutes. Some parts suffer from really bad picture quality, the editing is not very good and graphic effects seems to be done by a five year old. You don't really get to see that much from the lectures in Australia (and it's probably just as well) and most of his house we have seen already on MTV Cribs. Cribs at least did not portray him as a meglomaniac.As a Kiss fan since 1978 it's really hard and sad to see how Gene \\"whores himself\\" these days. Instead of consentrating on the only thing he has been successfull with, KISS. Most of his business ventures since the 80's have more or less been complete failures.I'l give it one extra star just because I find the demos that are used as background music interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly things you can put Edame on top of","review":"This is not really \\"about\\" edemame, it is basically lots of meats, salads, dishes you can put edameme next to, in, or on top of, which you could probably figure out on your own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edamame","review":"This book has a lot of great ideas for flavor combinations using edamame.

The ending leaves room for more action oriented tales in the series, which is the author's intended direction.

First of all I think Valentine should be staked along with Geoffrey. Second of all i think Char should of had a better time of it in the book and actually bite her boy friend.This book was just way off track with the rest of the series. If your going to make this big of a change in the story line you should do it gradually. My advice is to read the first books but skip this one and read the next one to see if it is any better. The first books in this series were really good but this ones not even worth burning. Susan your way off with this one. Go Back to your original story line. That was really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to hear the music!","review":"Had I known that it is utterly impossibly to hear the music on this DVD, I wouldn't have purchased it. What's dancing without music? Unfortunately the music is so low and the talking so loud, that you can only hear the music if you turn the TV up to maximum volume. So basically you are dancing along to Hough's squeaky, trying-to-be-sexy-and-failing-miserably voice.I would not recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made with beginners in mind.","review":"This video is NOT for beginners. Even having several years of dancing under my belt, I found it difficult to keep up with. Instead of focusing on her feet, or the body part performing the move, the camera goes to her face or stomach...not so helpful. While doing the dances, I became VERY frustrated and considered just getting onto a treadmill. I'm going to give it a few more tries before giving up, but I probably wouldn't recommend it to a friend.

You can hear Julianne, but not the music. When you turn it up, you just hear Julianne louder--not the music--which you absolutely NEED to pull you through this routine.There are no \\"dance steps\\", it's just a made-up bump and grind that is repetitive and pretty much (sorry) boring.

The moves are too severe and quick and the learning time is long. I did this a few times and just gave upn, I wasn't going to pick up on the moves and actually burn many calories. I found myself just marching along, watching and trying to play catch-up and learn the steps. Also, as with the ballroom DVD (much easier to follow) the camera work sucked. Sometimes it focused on her upper body when I needed to see her feet or a full shot so that I could see what I was supposed to be doing. I only spent $5 at Best Buy so that explains why this was in the bargain bin. Sorry Julianne, you need to be more realistic for us non dance pros."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for novice dancers!!!!","review":"This workout DVD is maddening. Julianne moves extremely quickly from move to move and gives basically no instruction. Unless you have a background in dance, this workout is impossible to follow.

Have attended conventions (back in the 70's), know every original series episode by heart. However, I'm also a musician and music lover.This is a terrible, terrible collection of songs. Nichols' voice is adequate; that's not the problem. I don't know the story of how this album got produced, but the songwriting in it is so embarrassingly poor that it puts a huge mark of shame on the otherwise distinguished career of Ms. Nichols. The production sounds like it was done on someone's PC, and is likewise extremely amateurish.Please do her a favor and don't buy this. Listen to this clips provided here and you'll see what I mean. How sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got my copy autographed!","review":"Here we have an album by Star Trek's \\"Uhura\\". Sure, she can sing, but to be perfectly frank, most of the songs here aren't very good. Most of them have \\"outer space\\" themes, and they are pretty cheesy. And can you handle TWO versions of Nichelle's tribute to Gene Roddenberry?(one is sung, one is spoken, both have the same backing track.) The CD concludes with a 25 minute interview with Nichelle, which is sort of interesting to hear once, but I can't imagine too many people will want to hear it more than once. This CD will really only appeal to Star Trek fans, who of course are the only ones who would buy it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy \\"Down To Earth\\" instead","review":"While Nichelle Nichols voice is as lovely as ever, the production on this CD is just awful! It is just about un-listenable. When listening to the version of the Star Trek theme song on this CD, I couldn't help but think of Bill Murray on SNL doing his bad lounge singer routine when he sang \\"Star Wars\\"...this song is just as bad. If you want to check out Ms. Nichol's singing, do yourself a favor and buy \\"Down to Earth\\" instead...that CD is the way she was meant to be heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Down To Earth\\"","review":"Nichelle Nichols is a respected artist, known mainly for Star Trek's delightful Houra. If you want to buy an album of some very good songs from her, better look for the Creation records / Rev-Ola compact disc re-issue of the 1968 recording \\"Down To Earth\\". A smasher. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest rock-n-roll albums of all time!!","review":"This is Rod Stewart in his prime with the Faces, one of the best rockin' bands of all time. This album is loaded! From the classic 'Miss Judy's Farm' to the raucous 'Stay With Me', this album proves that great rock-n-roll is ageless. My personal favorite is 'You're So Rude', a sooo smoooth, can't sit still roller with Ron Wood (now of the Stones) out front on vocals in one of rock's more humorous odes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!!!!","review":"Every song here is great and shows the Faces in top form.

If they had just kept their mouths shut, I probably would have given it a 4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"While this book does not have the endless color plates one might hope for, there's enough to satisfy the eye. It also contains far more text than comparable books on Vietnamese ceramics. To my mind, Vietnamese ceramics show a flair that is unique in the world - once you've seen a few examples, you can instantly distinguish the Vietnamese style from that of Vietnam's neighbors. The animals in particular have something that can only be called a sense of humor. Ki-rin and Dragons are known in other East Asian national arts, but only in Vietnam do they become whimsical, winking beasts - strangely human in spite of their strangeness. There is also a spontaneity in the decorations that exists in a playful balance with the high level of technical skill. An underrated tradition, and one that should become better known to Westerners."},{"rating":"2","title":"ease and excellence","review":"it was easy to find what i was searching for and payment was quick. when i received my product it was in excellent condition and my gift was really appreciated. thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Listenable","review":"There are two good things about this lyrically & musically vacuous album: Danny Kirwan's instrumental \\"Sunny Side Of Heaven\\", and the front cover.

A MASTERFUL PERFORMANCE BY A VASTLY UNDERATED GROUP AT THAT TIME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Nice Instrumental Tones","review":"This Fleetwood Mac recording is a far cry from the top 40 days of Lindsay Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. However, there are plenty of good melodies which are supported by some creative instrumental tones.Love the opening track Child Of Mine with good singing and steady guitar by long departed band mate, Danny Kirwan. The original version of Sentimental Lady is on this record and it is much more livelier than the version on Bob Welch's solo release, French Kiss. The two Christine McVie Songs, Homeward Bound and Spare Me A Little Of Your Love are excellent. The first one rocks along very nicely with some upbeat piano and searing guitar solos. The later tune is oh so soulful with instrumental support which is good without being overwhelming.Heck I can't think of a bad tune on the record. The poem on the end is a little pointless. Its harmless but the band could have thrown us another tune. A solid release nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bare Trees is a must hear!","review":"Excellent pre-Stevie Nicks, Lyndsay Buckingham CD.

I like Bob Welch's work on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of the Kirwin led Mac","review":"Bare Trees continues where Future Games started off. A little lighter in feel, Bare Trees showcases Danny Kirwin on his swan song with the band.All songs are great - save for the final spoken track \\"Thoughts For A Grey Day\\".Things kick off nicely with Kirwin's Child of Mine. His standout track on here is Sunny Side of Heaven.Welch contibutes with the very nice Sentimental Lady (later a big hit for him when he went solo), and Ghost.Christine McVie pens some great tunes here such as Homeward Bound and Spare A Little of Your Love.Bottom Line: Great early Fleetwood Mac album. On the same plane with Future Games but this one is a tad stronger IMO. Sort of like Volume 2 of Future Games."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lost Era For Mac fans","review":"Like Future games, this is a beautiful album. Again, Danny Kirwan shines, even though he was gone after this. His \`lamenting guitar' style is nicely accentuated by Bob Welch (who went on to capitalise briefly on reprints of his Mac work with a short solo career).There is a bit more of a rock sound to this album than \`Future Games' (which I prefer), but \`Sentimental Lady', \`Child of Mine', and \`Dust' are reason alone to own this.Christine McVie puts out with \`Spare Me A Little Of Your Love' (directed to JOHN McVie), and while others may disagree, I enjoyed \`Thoughts On A Grey day', the recollections of an older woman close to the end of her life. Very very poetic.I highly recommend you put \`Bare Trees', Future Games', and \`Mystery To Me' all in a row in your car CD player. These are three CD's unlike any Mac albums you will ever hear again, and they will take you away from the every day b.s. you go through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirwin out of his Tree, but he is a mad genius","review":"With these 5 gems, all I can say is \\"mad genius\\" comes to mind...Child Of Mine - Sunny Side Of Heaven -Bare Trees - Danny's Chant - DustIn particular Kirwin's (Dust) is very strange (a ditty about dying and turning to dust and decomposing) , but it is beautiful. The band will miss Kirwin, he was fired soon after for inapropriate behavior issues, due to his madness. God he is such a talented man (still alive) , the fame did him in, thank god we have his wonderful music that will never die."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on Earth is This?","review":"I'm not sure where they dug these versions up, but they are not the original versions in any case, not even for the Challengers' own material. Look further if you want surf music. These are pretty mild-mannered. Muzak, really.I'm not saying some of these are not potentially interesting in one way or another to somebody. The sax on K-39 (not original) was OK. And I assume some some later edition of the long-lived very commercial Challengers recorded them. But teenagers never exulted to these sounds voluntarily. Even people who used to be teenagers would find them rather dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written","review":"It was a wonderfully written story. From character buildup to the last scenes, the details were especially vivid. Having no experience with the South, nor the Ku Klux Klan, Noelle brings forth lifestyle dichotomies of whites living with blacks during that time. The personalities of each character is richly developed to the point where you could almost hear and see each one standing in front of you. Noelle has a talant for bringing beginning, middle and end together articulately and elegantly. This book was difficult to put down - I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"colored glass-review by Veda freedman","review":"Colored Glass is a captivating read, a page turner about one of the most important social changes in the history of the USA.

Not all southerners were racists, many were anti segregation and felt kindness and consideration towards all men, but to express these sentiments openly in the segregated south was inviting danger and oftentimes loss of life to yourself and family.The author portrays a very realistic picture of what it was like to live in the South where segregation was the norm but everyone knew that integration was soon to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of his best","review":"i have this on tape and find myself listening to it all of the time.eulogy is funny as hell and what better way to start off the tape.his work here is funny from the start,all the way to the end.now don't get me wrong,his other work is great as well but this one really stands out.it's hard to believe that next year this tape will be 30 years old.this just shows you that he was way ahead of his time and after 30 years this tape is still funny as hell and everyone can still relate to it even after all of this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, But Where Are the Five Star Albums?","review":"It's great to have Richard Pryor's work on CD, but his best albums on the Warner label \\"That Nigger's Crazy\\", \\"Bicentennial Nigger\\" and \\"Wanted\\" (soundtrack of sorts to the phenomenal \\"Live In Concert\\" film) have yet to see the light of day.

I especially liked what he was protesting in the skit about how people would rather adopt foreign infants than homeless children in America-I suggest Angelina Jolie and Madonna listen to this album and take it personally. He was so deep and such a bad muthaf---er, and he's the comedian I can relate to most and my favorite. I also liked that he never tried to be a female ever or wore a dress in his acts(I'm sorry, Tyler Perry makes me a little queasy), or apologized for blackness or much of anything-he was a HELL of a man you could really respect (excuse me, I am swearing too much for Ramadan.)But I love Richard and always will.

Many of the recipes call for pre-made or canned/boxed ingredients. I am not a fan of boxed mashed potatoes, or bread in those rolled up cardboard tubes.

Most of the \\"tips\\" for making quick, nutritious meals are really shortcuts that any competent cook could come up with (i.e. using pre-cut stir-fry meat or pre-sliced frozen vegetables). Quite honestly, these recipes *taste* like they only have 5 ingredients and only took 15 minutes to slap together.

So now here we go with round ? and purchasing some of the same movies on Blu Ray.So my setup is a 40 inch 1080p Sony Bravia (V-series) and a PS3 for the player.Simply stated, this movie is very good on Blu Ray and worth the money if you liked the film on DVD. The colors during the training camp sequences really stand out, down to each blade of green grass and the stains on the white uniforms. Never before have I seen so clearly how much spit flies from Denzels mouth as the coach of this team.All of the Disney Blu Rays I have purchased so far have not disappointed and this one is as good as all the rest.If you like this movie on DVD, you'll like it more on Blu-Ray."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calling ALL Coaches","review":"As a coach I found this movie motivating and a good reminder that coaching is not all fun and games. It reminded me that coaching is about preparing players for life outside of the sport in which they play. This is evidenced by the success of many of the real-life people portrayed in this movie.I absolutely loved the relationship between the Washington and Patton characters. Just when I thought that their relationship had run its course and things were about to come to a head....I highly recommend this movie to all who want to see a movie that has suspense, comedy and action. If you only buy one movie this year, this one should be seriously considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work","review":"My daughter was very excited to get this movie for christmas, cause it is her favorite movie, and it doesn't work"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT PORTRAYAL OF MANKIND","review":"THIS WAS A WONDERFUL PORTRAYAL OF MANKIND--NOT BLACK, NOT WHITE, BUT MANKIND.

But the use of racial injustice in this film seemed rushed, and discomforting to watch. The movie just doesn't truly heed well in leading up to how this event led to increased equality among the characters of the story. This movie sort of seems somewhat like another movie, 'Varsity Blues.' Although they have almost nothing in common, they both emphasize the will to win and the importance of winning in football. But unlike 'Varsity Blues', this movie installs a message about racial hatred. Overall, I found that the parts where the African-American and white players had rollercoaster situations where they fought at times, and then celebrated a moment later made the movie flow like the movie was rushed. Thus I can only give it 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember The Titans","review":"I just saw this really good movie called Remember The Titans. People that like football will probably like it. I am going to give you just a little bit of information about it.Its a really good movie about football that showed how African American's were treated back then.When it came down to football they were forced to like eachother and get along.They finally come to realize they are the same, the only difference is the color of there skin.Finally in the end,well i wont tell you how it ends,but I am sure you will like this movie.This is why I think you all sould see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember This Movie!!","review":"This movie should be remembered for its accurate portrayal of race relations. Denzel Washington is shown as a no nonsense coach who does not care about ther ace game that seems to shadow this movie. He has a job to do and just wants to do it without any fan fare. Different points of view are represented throughout this movie as there are some people in favor of integration and some who are not. It goes to show you that some people can change and others are a lot less willing. In the end, Denzel Washington creates a strong unity on his team within reasonable parameters. Not everyone likes each other. But in the end, they all learn to respect each other. Several good side bar stories with the car accident leaving one football player paralyzed and the relationship chagnes over the course of the movie. A winner undoubtedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Double Dip Disney's Deceptive DC DVD!!!","review":"A lot of D's which is the grade I'd give this Director's Cut dvd. Cut all right. They cut the 2 commentaries, the trailer, instead of 6 deleted scenes there are 4 & 2 of them are in the director's cut so are totally unnecessary. On the box it says new bonus features. There are NONE. It say's French language track. NONE. Usually a second release is an improvement but in this case it is so much poorer as not to be believed. Disney should pull this & at least properly advertise what is on it & what isn't. The movie is an A+. The Director's Cut DVD release rates a solid F.

It's about an embarassingly preachy movie that distorts cultural differences, and tries to be cute.This could have been a great and moving film. Great/true story, Denzel Washington, good message. Too bad they had to try to get cute and funny, and then try to integrate modern leftist cultural issues into a film where the year is 1971 and these issues were not prevelant.If you want to see a great movie about African American triumph, see Glory.

Great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seen It All Before","review":"Denzel Washington stars as a coach brought in to lead a hitherto white high school team, circa 1971, to both victory and racial accord. Well practiced at spinning dross into gold, the actor has enough authority to make you briefly forget the corruption of Gregory Allen Howard's script -- he can clear a frequency for himself amid even the worst static. As one of those black characters who's never wrong, essentially because being wrong would make him human, Washington eases past the thicket of platitudes, slipping by child actors whose scene-stealing tactics would shame Walter Brennan and playing off the rest of the otherwise likable young cast like a seasoned session man tapped to mellow the upstarts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar qualilty movie!!!","review":"With all the talk about what films are being nominated for the Oscar, this movie does not even come up in conversation. This is one reason why I do not watch the Oscars any more; they just do not know how to nominated a great film anymore. This has tons of heart and character. It really shows how individuals come together to work together for a common goal. This movie is an inspritation to all who sees it! The performances by Denzel Washington and Will Patton are wonderful, as well as the entire cast. Washington, Patton, and even the little girl who play Will Patton's daughter should all be nominated for an Oscar for their performances. It should be nominated for Best Picture, Screenplay and Direction. This was the best film I have seen in a very long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definatly Disney!","review":"This movie however definatly a Disney football movie, where the good guy always wins, based on a true story, I thought Disney did a phenomenol job pulling this movie off. It really goes in deep showing the diversity that was set in back then, tying in all angles from coaching, to players, to families, to children, to school boards, to communities. I thought parts of the movie were a little unreal yes, but overall; like the fact that a football team when it comes down to championship can pull a whole town together! My mother who hates history movies and hates sports movies, loved Remember the Titans, I had to force her to watch it, but afterward she thanked me and has even watched it again and again! Even if your not a huge fan of Disney (poor unfortunate soul that you would be) you will love to watch this movie if you are the football fan or not the football fan at heart!

The rest of the actors are good too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short attention span theater","review":"This movie has great production values and many fine moments. The only problem is they are nothing but fine moments with nothing really tying them together. While we were watching we kept saying \\"when does the movie start?\\" The whole first two thirds of the movie had the feel of your typical five minute movie introduction (only far longer). Basically The races are at each others throats, then the team comes together, then begin the cycle again. The whole thing is trying too hard to be inspiring without first making sure that is is a good movie. There are tons of wonderful moments in this movie but the whole thing feels like a collection of themed music videos than a movie. It was only worth watching once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and predictable","review":"This movie is so silly and corny, it made me uncomfortable just sitting through it. It is very manipulative in that all the whites in the movie had to become more \\"black\\" in order for the team to work well together. That's not how it was in the 1960-70's!! It is probably a good movie to show your young children, but beyond that it is pretty useless. Denzel Washington is very predictable as the rough and tough yell alot coach who eventually perseveres. If you want a good football movie that isn't trying to be preachy, just watch Varsity Blues or Rudy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointing to say the least.","review":"The reason why i bought this was because of the great reviews it received on this site but i have to say this film is completly overrated.

There's something magical in the song Horse With No Name, the most imitative song of the whole (it could really be Neil Young), that makes it one of the best songs of history. But the other song I find moving is Pigeon Song and I wonder why every lover of this album seems to agree that it is a weak song.

For me, \\"America\\" and it's follow-up, \\"Homecoming\\", really capture the essence of the late 60's-early 70's west coast folk-hippie music experience every bit as much as CSN & Y and the Byrds.

Or, more accurately, they're all roughly equal but \\"Killer\\" is my favorite. It has the rawer production that I prefer, great songwriting (with the whole band participating) and doesn't overindulge in the musical theater style drama that some of the stuff that comes later does. \\"Halo of Flies\\" is just an incredible highlight, but there are really no filler tracks on this release so you won't have to use the skip button ever.This is definitely one of the 1970's top rock albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer, for real","review":"This is a record that I haven't been able to get off my mind in years. My first ACG record was Billion Dollar Babies, and I was enough into the material I had never heard (Raped & Freezin, Unfinished Sweet) that I bought Killer as well soon thereafter. THIS is the real deal from the ACG. The thing about it that gets me is that its not just hip or ironic, but truly creepy. You can say whatever you want about \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" Alice, but Dead Babies is a pretty freaked out song; its not primarily for laughs but for...what? I don't have the word, but at any rate, it can be a pretty chilling song to listen to. The other real highlight for me is \\"You Drive me Nervous\\", which has that signature sound pickup-truck-dirty ACG guitar.

We are part of the most intimate experiences of Will, his parents, his sisters and others he loves, who love him. These are experiences that touch us deeply. We feel the stinging pain of the injured eye, the poignant implications of memories lost, the depth of an anger that resists release. In the family's meadow, in the milk barn with Sister, the library stacks with Miss Jones, the music captures us, the poetry engages us, the honesty speaks to us. William Wallis has penned moments of sadness, fear, joy and the simple but endearing love that bonds the family and captures our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Active Games","review":"This is a treasure trove for anyone who leads children's groups: scout leaders, camp counselors, Sunday school teacher, etc. The games are timeless, and many require no equipment.

I tried to use it, and it did get some old lint out, but I'm afraid it was not one of my better purchases.It wasn't very expensive, so I will overlook the problems. I wish, however, that I had a coil spring to insert that would keep it open. It would be very handy to clean dryer vents, and a/c floor vents.

The hose is curved and very stiff, so it makes it hard (if not impossible) to move around in the proper direction. I gave up.

One time it came loose so I held on better the next time. It tends to bend (crimp) or to collapse, either way not allowing the lint to pass through.

This is a terrible non-functioning product. When you attach it to the vacuum cleaner and turn the vacuum on, the sidewalls on the tube collapse, allowing no air to get through. This is particularly true at the very far end of the tube where slits have been cut in the tube. These slits all close in on oneanother and don't allow any lint or even air to pass through.

The author definetly knows his stuff about Catherine, but I got so tired of reading about all the political stuff in this book. I wanted to know more about her personal life, more details about her comings and goings, not about how she ruled her Russian cabinet officers.

It combines both masculine and feminine adventure, heroism, and toughness with sensitive insight into the male and female psyches of the characters. Our hero, Michael Cameron, a burnt out helicopter pilot in the Vietnam War sets out to rescue his love, Kathleen Howard from slavery in Burma. However, Kathleen (with her baby) has already embarked on her own escape attempt. Clauser does much better than Ludlum or Cussler would do with similar material. Yes, the adventure is gripping and full of suspense, but the people are real people; they come to life. Clauser has clearly researched every aspect of her material. Her descriptions are so wonderful that you can smell the villages and marketplaces in Burma, Laos, and Vietnam. I couldn't put the book down, and when I was done I felt that my best friend had suddenly departed."},{"rating":"2","title":"East of Mandalay: A terrific book","review":"EAST OF MANDALAY is an absolutely terrific book. Its narrative is tremendously exciting, and the genre almost defies description: it is a hard-hitting adventure story with a military man at its center, and yet at the same time it's a beautiful and complex romance with a historical background. The Southeast Asia locale during the Vietnam War era is exotic and enticing, and the characters are all three-dimensional and fascinating.

Tiggre exhibits a similar shortcoming: any character can, at any time, speak or think in exclamation points, and the tone conveyed is usually that of Tiggre's own unbridled optimism coupled with his disbelief at the pervasiveness of conventional wisdom.But I have read many times over every word Heinlein wrote, and while Tiggre isn't his equal-- NO ONE is-- he has produced an exceptionally fine read, one worthy of any big-name storyteller. It is important to bear in mind that while the possible (and completely unknowable) outcome of the Y2K problem makes a fascinating backdrop for the novel, it is the story itself which is paramount.And a swell story it is, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before it's time.","review":"Tiggre does a good job with this fiction.

The animation is a decidedly a cute young style and it's pretty good looking, but the monsters are gruesome and terrible, so parents should be warned.There is some action in the first two episodes on the airship, but not the third. The dialog was lousy, and I didn't care about the characters. The plot was really dumb and slow. The story doesn't grab you in and the music is bad. The intro doesn't really give you a right impression of what the show is really about. Lieza is a stereotypical helpless female, who has some special powers to talk to animals.

Deep Purple really mixes up there songs on this one, sort of an experiment, I guess. Great vocals by Gillan, great guitar riffs by Blackmore, and great organ and piano by Jon Lord. I think that's what really set Deep Purple apart back in the late 60's and 70's.

The music rocks hard, yes, but it doesn't sound as good as other hard rock albums from the same time period such as Sabbath's Paranoid and Zeppelin IV.The songwriting is a bit weak in places as well. Sometimes vocal melodies just pass by harmlessly, but without much in the way of excitement. There could be some more of Ritchie's great guitar playing since that is one of the best things about Deep Purple. It does feature two of their best songs- \\"Strange Kind of Woman\\" and \\"The Mule\\".It's still a really good classic rock album though, and maybe even better than In Rock.

Just the whold idea of leaving your baby with the dog is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave your baby home with the dog?","review":"I just could not get past the idea of this book. A family leaves a baby home alone with a rottwielier on Christmas day. The dog then rides the baby on its back through the cold city streets even stopping to peer into the window of another family enjoying their Christmas together - babies included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed!","review":"The only reason I am writing a negative review on this release, is that I am a huge Baby's fan and I made the mistake of reading the reviews before I heard the releases and was underwhelmed after hearing mostly over positive ratings. So, hopefully someone will just listen first, then read after and just be appreciative that there is some demo releases that were found and just enjoy! To me, there was reason these were not released, as is with most demos. But, I will say, If you liked the older \\"broken heart album\\" sound, you might like this. Personally, I started really liking them from \\"Head First\\" on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Not quite as good as some of the older ones but still has some nice tunes. I'll listen to it often as I stack it in my player with the other Limelighter CD's I have...Except the \\"Alive in Concert\\" CD..See separate review. Only problem being that both of the cases on my last two CD purchases were cracked. Need better shipping quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing product and sloppy shipping","review":"My Pilates CD was too short for the hour-long class I teach. Most Pilates classes are at least 50 minutes long, and the CD was only about 38 min. Also, the CD case was badly cracked when I received it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way off on fit.","review":"When I went to purchase these mats on the Amazon website it was stated that these mats would fit my 2007 Honda Odyssey. When I received them it was obvious they expected me to cut them to fit. They are way too narrow to begin with so trimming wouldn't help. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to excellent predecessors","review":"Purtill's original Kaphtu trilogy was a minor but real and memorable pleasure to read. An interesting and original look at Greek mythology, quite unlike any other that I had come across. I was very pleased to find that he had published more, especially since these are tales referred to but never told in the first three books. However, this book was distinctly disappointing. The story was thin and unsatisfying, lacking point, structure, characterisation and even much in the way of background. The time travel element seemed entirely gratuitous. It read like (deservedly) excised chapters from the original trilogy, or possibly like the outline of a more substantial book. These significant flaws may have something to do with why it was issued through AuthorHouse, a vanity press. There were also a great many typographical, spelling and grammatical errors in the text."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is my Favorite hair brush!","review":"This is my All time favorite hair brush.

Most pages have multiple errors in spelling, and many have grammatical errors also. If you are learning how to speak (and read) Portuguese, this book will do much more harm than good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too grammatical","review":"You don't want grammar in a phrase book! But this one is full of it. Nouns, adjectives, definite articles, indefinite articles, pronouns, subjects, objects, regular verbs, irregular verbs, double-stemmed verbs, you-name-it verbs. If I wanted a grammar, I would have bought one. You don't want grammar lessons in a phrase book. I find this amount of grammar in a phrase book quite out of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonely Planet Brazilian Portuguese","review":"Great pocket guide to give you a basic working knowledge of the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful -- definitely worth getting!","review":"This phrasebook was really helpful on my recent trip to Brazil. I don't speak any Portuguese, so it was nice to have a little help with common words & phrases. It has pronounciation guides, which was great, and my new-found (English speaking) Brazilian friends were impressed with it too. It's small enough to carry around easily, and I highly recommend it for anyone traveling to Brazil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"Don't even think about trying to survive in Brasil on this book. While other LP language guides (I have used their guides to Latin American Spanish, Mongolian, and Russian) are thorough, and provide lots of conversational phrases to get you into and out of almost any key travel situation, this one is woefully lacking in any aspect. Not enough vocabularly, not enough questions, not enough areas. After three weeks in Brasil, I managed to successfully use this book twice. It's cheap but it's not worth the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Pocket Guide","review":"Just got back from Rio and found this version of the guide book very helpful. I would have loved if there was an audio companion to this book. That would have been extremely helpful in getting the right pronunciations. Overall, a great pocket guide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Helpful","review":"I just returned from a trip to Brazil, and though I know some Spanish, I had no previous exposure to Portuguese. This phrasebook proved invaluable in helping me bridge the gap, and contributed to me having an even better time, and blending in better with the locals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"This phrase book was helpful. The pronunciations in Portuguese are hard to figure out; they're not intuitive and are radically different than Spanish. I wish this book would help me more with that but well this is just a phrase book and one can't expect it to act like a dictionary or a language lesson book. My recommendation is to study a more comprehensive Portuguese language book before going to Brazil especially if you're interested in communicating with the locals. Most people in Brazil don't speak any English what-so-ever, so you need to learn some basic things. If you don't want to spend the time, you should at least get this phrase book and carry it with you at all times. It becomes handy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good language book for traveling.","review":"I thought this book was very good. It gave each phrase in portuguese, english and written out the way that you would pronounce it. I bought another portuguese book that did not have the pronunciations, and will never do so again if I can help it. In my opinion the english/portuguese dictionaries did not contain enough words in them. There were quite a few times where I didn't have access to the words I was looking for. Overall I think this is a good book and would definately stick with Lonely Plane Phrasebook in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Embraces Punk Rock","review":"With this album, Neil Young alone among his classic rock peers made peace with and embraced the punk movement that had looked down on them so disdainfully. \\"This is the story of Johnny Rotten,\\" he sings at one point. Indeed, but the album also includes two great songs \\"Powderfinger\\" and \\"Pocahontas,\\" that explore the dark side of American History. It starts out accoustic and then plugs in for some great guitar jams halfway in. An absolute classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust should try sleeping","review":"All the fine stuff; and then this.

If you like this album, than Live Rust is an absolute must have also"},{"rating":"2","title":"No rust on these songs","review":"Rust never sleeps is a great accoustic electric mix.Mymy heyhey was a statement about rock at the time.

I do not recommend people to buy this video it was a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dated.....","review":"OK - this vid delivers on its title - there is big air action for sure. Unfortunately the whole thing is pretty low budget - if you're used to high budget, great music, beautifully shot snowboarding videos, then Big Fat Air will probably be pretty dissappointing.

That's a lot of electric when you're paying 20 cents/kwh. I wanted to replace the ps because it was loud and thought that a more efficient ps would be a great bonus that would pay for itself over time. Quite true here. Idle power went down to 47-48 watts (!). I didn't do a full suite of tests but the idle itself was a 17% improvement over the Dell (a modern E521 / X2 processor system). This means I should get similar savings over the entire band of power consumption when the cpu grinds down data where it can surge to 100+ watts on the old ps. These measurements taken with a kill-a-wa-tt power meter. Therefore, with a 10watt saving at idle, I will save approx$1.44/month in electric at minimum. If you're paying a lot of $ for electric (and it will only get more pricier as oil continues to rise) then an efficient ps is the way to go. Great unit for this purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost cause","review":"When received, this item smelled of cigarette smoke so bad that I could smell it before I even opened the package.

If I put it in a system, it will fill the entire room with the awful smell as soon as it gets hot. This item is completely unusable.

It's true, because when I hear a really great original Chicago song, it brings images of this pathetic performance.It isn't nice or easy to say bad things about performers trying so hard to entertain, but someone has to say it. Save your money. Don't buy this.

The basket though didnt seem to want to stay closed , so I had to maually tie the ends together to keep from opening while turning in oven. Also the manual is a little shy of proper instructions in assembling the basket to the rotesserie. Took me a couple of times to fiqure out proper assembly.

When the water is running in the sink and the garbage disposer is on it is impossible to know that the garbage disposer is actually running because there is very little noise.Even when the disposer is on and the water is not running it is quiet. For people with slight hearing problems this could be a real hazard/danger.After all our society is conditioned to know that disposal are in fact loud. When they are loud they warn us to stay away. This model however is way too quiet and i would think that this then can be a hazard. This is an example of technological improvements in an appliance that are actually not improvements at all but rather possible dangers.

It also goes to sleep after no activity and would take at least 2seconds to wake up - kind of annoying (trying to save batteries).

Since this DVD is from the same tour I thought that it may approach the quality of the video I used to love so much. Not EVEN CLOSE.The video quality is poor, the audio mix is often off and the overall look and sound is barely above that of a home-made video or an amateur concert video one may see on local access cable TV.So, like I said; This DVD is for hardcore fans only.If anyone knows of a decent quality DVD of Utopia from the same era I'd like to hear from them as I find this DVD almost unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?

One moment, all that can be heard is vocals then too much drum then too much (fill in the blank) but wait ! Todd is about to solo! I can't hear it THEN it's all I can hear.

She serves as a servant for a rich white family.Aunt Tillie: She teaches Rose Lee how to serve properly.Henry: Rose Lee's brother who wants to go to Africa.The Bells: The white family that Rose Lee serves with Aunt Tillie.The author did well on knowing history. The story was true and made sense with history. The author didn't make the story very interesting. It wasn't very exciting at all. There were only one or two really interesting moments.

For summer reading at my school, they assigned this book and the much more interesting and riveting book, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451.

The NJO series was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"Whose idea was it to let this slop stretch into a trilogy? All of the important points could have been condensed into a single novel (or maybe even a short story). The New Jedi Order does bring an exciting new plot arc to the Star Wars universe, and there have been some great books in the series, but once we get toward te end, the true marketing genius becomes clear; a reader who has already read a dozen novels and gotten caught up in the story of the war with the Vong, will work their way through even the worst book to make it to the end of the series. Or indeed, the worst three books. Only a couple of interesting bits (like the Tahiri subplot) save this from a 1 star review."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Filler, No Thriller","review":"This latest installment of the NJO is merely treading water waiting for the series' traditional fall hardcover. Del Rey has really released a low quality product here just to line their pockets with money. This one has all the things you've learned to dread about the lesser NJO novels: retreaded plot lines, unconvincing portrayal of the Jedi mindset, shallow two dimensional emotionalism. Undiscriminating Star Wars fans will love this just as they love all Star Wars novels. I used to look forward to each New Jedi Order Novel to see how the storyline moved along and to sample the styles of the different authors. This one has me dreading the next paperback because this one had no real plot movement; more sadly, the next paperback is written by the same below average author tandem. In summary, Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't let these guys write another Star Wars book!","review":"This book is (as another review so aptly put) nothing more than absolute filler material.It is by far the weakest book in the whole New Jedi Order series - even worse (if you can believe it) than Dark Journey.I won't waste my time writing a lengthy review for this as I put so much into my review for the first book in this \\"Force Heretic\\" trilogy.Suffice it to say that this entire trilogy by Sean Williams & Shane Dix is complete rubbish and brings the entire \\"New Jedi Order\\" series to an all-time low!If you haven't read the trilogy yet, do yourself a favor and skip it.

Three main stories, the male twin solo looking for a mystical planet called Zonama Sekot with the help of Master Skywalker, Jaina Solo and Tahiri fight a disguised Yuuzhan Vong infiltration somewhere in the universe and last but not least Nom Anor returns as a prophet leading Shamed Ones in his struggle to infiltrate the chambers of the Supreme Overlord.All in all, as a NJO fan you follow the stories where they take you and you enjoy letting your imagination loose in the universe of Star Wars. But these books seem to stretch a story that can be fit into a single book.I hope the third book really stands up. Books like these make you feel like a grain of sand in a marketing world. Where all you do is contribute your buy and keep on reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"part two of Betty Landers's review","review":"Appologies for doing a split review, but this one is to focus on the chop-job of an abridgement.

It is pitiful that you have a series that has spent the past 14 books creating interest excitement and intrigue with quality authors and top notch story lines only to get to the fifteenth and sixteenth book to be completely let down. A plot that doesn't go anywhere or create interest and a story that fails to captivate combined with author(S) who fail miserably at jumping from subplot to subplot in an intelligent manner . The saddest thing of all is that we will continue to buy the series because we hope that something in this sub series will be important to the next authors book.

You can use whatever cliché you want: these are the things that dreams are made of,or I thought that I died and went to heaven. Yes I'm talking emotion here, not the technical quality of the recording, but the quality of the performance buy a few of the elite masters of this genera.

I found three problems with it. Firstly the glass top of the scale protrudes about one inch outside of the four feet the scale rests on. This means that if you step on it near the edge the scale will tilt and you are in danger of falling off and/or breaking the scale. This may sound unlikely but every person I watched use the scale for the first time had that problem. Secondly the scale did not give a consistent weight reading - within five minutes it said I weighed from 171.5lbs to 175lbs. I couldn't figure out what was causing it (yes I was using a hard surface and it really was within five minutes). Finally the scale (on average) said I weighed a good 5 to 7 lbs less than the double arm balance scale I use at the gym.

Based on his own experience as a fighter pilot in Korea, The Hunters is the story of an American pilot who wishes to become an ace. Written in direct, deceptively simple, and precise language, The Hunters is an examination of the demands of wartime viewed through the prism of this relatively solitary pursuit. Salter conveys the experience of the Korean war and dog-fighting beautifully. Unlike most war novels, this book is a psychological novel preoccupied primarily with moral issues. The key questions are what is the appropriate way to live, and its obverse question, what is the appropriate way to die? This is the type of novel that Hemingway tried to write in For Whom The Bell Tolls. Where Hemingway failed, Salter succeeds. This deceptively modest book is much better than most of the serious American literature published over the last 50 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Forgotten War brought to life","review":"There have been many books written about the Vietnam War but very few about the Korean War.

It is about success and recognition. It is about injustice and magnanimity. It is about being unappreciated in a large, and political, organization.The theme of this book is not war. War is the setting. Readers who are not interested in war stories will still enjoy this book. Company workers and team-sports players will recognize the themes. Therefore, to classify this as a war story does it a disservice--it has a much wider scope.(The movie tells another story; don't be misled.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is the Fuss About ?","review":"I was disappointed in this book, given the build up by reviwers, including a \\"blurb\\" in the New York Times Book Review.

But the Korea story has been told elsewhere- and much better- by such writers as James Brady (\\"Coldest War\\") Donald Knox (\\"Korean War\\" in 2 parts esp. the first) and General Matthew Ridgeway (\\"Korean War\\"). Who would know the subject better than him? One could argue that those were concerned with the war on the ground. To that argument, I would offer James Michner's \\"The Bridges at Toko-Ri\\" about naval fighter pilots. I still can see that scene in the movie where Mickey Rooney drops in his chopper to rescue William Holden- and the book was better! A previous reviwer suggested getting this book at the library.

I've been following this series from the beginning and some of the books were quite fun but this one was difficult to get through (and it's not that long).My first issue was that the main troupe of characters is entirely made up of fighters. A human fighter, an elf fighter, a dwarf fighter, and a dwarf fighter cleric. Having Mialee or Lidda around usually helped the books... anything for a little more variety. Jozan the cleric makes a cameo in the beginning and returns and we know Naull will appear at some point... but when you get four fighters as the party you can be assured that there will be some hack and slash on its way.As to the fights... Lain writes a very interesing fight with folks feinting and ducking and blades nicking or pommels hammering... but there were a few too many of these just in the first few chapters. I'm still going to read the last book as I'm hoping this one just didn't come together."},{"rating":"1","title":"hello","review":"If you really watched wrestling you would know that this isnt Rey Mysterio!

I can only suppose that most of the songs were recorded after a long illness. Age alone would hardly account for the weakness and deterioration of his voice. Only the first track, \\"The Candy Man,\\" sounds like Anthony Newley at his best. His other signature songs, \\"Who Can I Turn To?\\" and \\"What Kind of Fool Am I?\\" are rendered in a weak, quavery voice. How this CD could be titled, \\"The Best of Anthony Newley\\" is a mystery to me.

It can only receive live XM broadcasts when docked with the included cradle and satellite antenna. But you can connect this to your stereo and listen without earplugs. But the best feature is the ability to record XM radio for later playback--just live Tivo.So at home you can listen through your stereo speakers, and then if you're away from home it acts just like an iPOD. This is better than the current portable XM radios since with those you cannot predict what kind of signal strength you'll get when on the go. The menu system is great, although the buttons are small. You can record any channel at any time, and build your own playlists.

One note - if you're not using it for XM radio don't bother with the installation disk. I have never used it - I just plug it into my computer through the USB where it becomes a new hard drive. Then I just copy and paste my songs to it's assigned hard drive letter.

The best thing about this album was that it was mercifully short at just under 30 minutes.The next best thing was the trick cover. Actually the one thing I like about it was Ronnie lane's too brief efforts, especially the title track, which unfortunately is sung by Ron Wood and not by Lane. The group's heart just wasn't in the album, and Stewart at the time complained that they couldn't play a lot of this material live without stuffing up the songs.

Where he is best and most in the place where God created him is in a live setting with other worshippers.This CD is powerful! There are some great songs that bring you to your face as you worship God. The only weakness may be song #3 which has deep lyrics and idea, but the sound of it is a little weak. Other than that Matt Redman has a winner here. If you enjoy modern worship then you should get this CD.

It was not easy or short, and it seems like they cut some corners in the manufacturing process. But this is not by biggest complaint. My biggest tiff with the table is that the fence and guide SUCKS... It is not easy to adjust or square or easy to square. I finally gave up and made my own fence because there is no upgrade fence available for this table. Everyone knows that the accuracy of a router table comes in the stability of the router mounts and a good fence.

The stock seemed to get held up by the stationary part of the table. I tried several different tensions on the clamp, but, none of them worked out this issue. The fence was not supported close enough to the router bit. This causes the fences to flex when any pressure is applied close to the router bit.

First of all this router allows for above table height adjustment which you can't do with this table. Shame on me for not realizing there would be no work around for this. The top is also so thick that I cannot get enough extension out of my router to use some bits to their fullest. I tried my Hitachi and Ryobi router also and same problem.

In this story, Lucy was preoccupied with herself, and her family took a backseat as she tried to discover a murderer and contemplated an affair; a not-so-believable twist in the plot. The reader gets a confusing view of Lucy's husband: on the one hand, he's a traditionalist who wants his wife at home; on the other, he'd like her to do what she wants. In the other books, one gets a sense that this is a good marriage. In this book, one wonders what these two have in common. The murder story even took a back seat to Lucy's preoccupation with herself. Was this a muder mystery or a woman's struggle with mid-life crisis? In the end, the resolution is anticlimactic, and the reader is left with some negative thoughts toward Lucy Stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy handed hints give the mystery away","review":"I very much enjoyed Mistletoe Murder and Tippy Toe Murder, so happily settled down to read this mystery, armed with a free afternoon and a cup of coffee.

It seemed too obvious, so I checked the end of the book, and I was right. The hints (which I will not reveal, because it might not be obvious to some readers) were glaringly heavy-handed--not really hints at all.I stopped reading, my cozy afternoon coming to a premature end.

So many recipes call for items that I have never heard of or have to go out and buy for a one time only use. What a waste of money! With this cookbook you can decide at the last minute in the morning to gab a recipe, use the items on hand, throw together, put in the crock pot and out the door you go to then come home to a great meal. Plus most of the recipes have several variations of the same item in case you don't have one ingredient but you have another. I have tried a lot of the recipes and 90% of them my husband and I loved. Believe me..... I have gotten my money's worth from this book. I have recommended this cookbook to several friends and they love it too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck!","review":"I have made several recipes so far and they all tasted terrible. Yes they were easy but the recipes are so simplistic that it is not worth printing the recipe. This book is definitely quantity over any sort of quality. You get a huge collection of bad recipes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"500 Variations on Beef Stew and some other recipes....","review":"Mostly tiny variations on the same recipe over and over. Out of 800+ recipes, I can count on one hand the ones we'd actually try. I'd rather search for crockpot recipes online that have pictures, reviews and healthier ingredients!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cook Book","review":"The cook book that I ordered\\"Fix-It and Forget-It 700 Great Slow Cooker Recipes Series\\" is just what I ordered and it came in 3 days. I love this book because it is simple to use and you do not have to have a lot of things that you don't usually use. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a great,simple slow cooker recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much repetition!","review":"I am a disappointed buyer. The back cover boasts more than 800 recipes, but there are a huge number of very similar recipes: more than a dozen versions of beef stew, eight similar versions of ham and potatoes, eight meatloafs, seven Mexican cheese dips using Velveeta cheese. The authors would do better to present a lot fewer recipes that have been screened for the \\"cream of the crop.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This is a terrible cookbook, in my opinion. If I had seen it in a store I never would have bought it, and I feel misled by the many rave reviews here. It wasn't written by the \\"authors\\", but is a collection of recipes from amateur cooks of the sort who rely heavily on canned soups and processed cheese. (Ugh!) Also there are many recipes which are essentially duplicates of others. Lora Brody's book is good, but I was looking for something with more, but still good, recipes. This isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Meal-a-Minute Quickfix for your life style","review":"Attn: Target Guest and Shoppers:My name is Shara L.Bouie, and my review of the Fix-it and Forget- cook, comes from the stand point of the working class student and traveler. Therefore,I think this item is a great item for beginnger groups or students, working class family,or the Military tranfers. This book gives helpful tips on eating and preparing meals on on a limited budget,however,one is still able to get a 5 star meal -a- minute like they would at a resturant or if they had time to cook at home. Therefore,I highly remind this book too the general population as a whole.Thank YouShara L&gt; BouieAtlanta, Ga"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I don't recommend this book at all. So many of the recipies sound unappetizing, are high in fat, and call for a can of condensed cream of mushroom soup.This cookbook doesn't promise to deliver much, and it lives up to this promise. First, there's a disclaimer that the recipies haven't been kitchen tested by the editors. Second, it promises numerous recipies that vary by only one ingredient. How many chili and baked beans recipies do you really need? Well, this book has over 30 for chili and almost 60 for baked beans. The rest of the book is stews and other dishes that would go perfectly with a side of Wonder Bread, like this sample recipie:Ham Bar-B-Que1 lb boiled ham1 cup of cola1 cup of ketchupCook on low 8 hrs.HAM + COKE + KETCHUP = DINNER?What kind of cookbook is this?Of course, not all the recipies are this poor, but only 1 of the dozen or so dishes I've tried is worth making again. If you're looking for a good slow-cooker recipie book, try Betty Crocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS COOKBOOK!","review":"This cookbook is great! Not sure what I did without it all these years! My favorite recipe so far is the Beef Enchilidas. Everything that I have made has been delicious and easy! My sister made the beef enchilidas for us and I immediately ordered my own cookbook and a cookbook for our Mother and the diabetic version for my sister. I also told some friends about the cookbook and they too purchased one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cook Book","review":"Purchased this book for my mother in law for Christmas, but before we give it to her, my wife and I pulled out some receipes to try and they were great. The book itself has plenty of receipes and, is great for any person looking for some new receipes to try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome cookbook!!!","review":"This book has come into good use. I received it in a good timely fashion. The price was very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO PLEASED","review":"This is not the first Fix It and Forget It cookbook that I have bought. The binding was on the wrong side. But this one I bought as a gift and did not have the time to exchange it. Imbarassing..it looked like a seconds gift. How was this overlooked when packed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent family-fare cookbook.","review":"This book is not for someone looking for \\"gourmet\\". It is, however, PERFECT for working parents to get good food you and your kids will like on the table, quickly. There are many, many, recipies, all down to earth, and out of 6 recipies I've tried so far, most my family rated \\"Good; would like to have it again\\". One (chicken tortilla soup) was a smash hit suitable for company (the kids wanted it in their lunch box thermos the next day); and, one (cowboy casserole) we didn't care for. A pretty good record, and all of them were pretty easy. One other thing: I am not wild about the texture of chicken or meat cooked in the crock pot, but all of the recipies I tried in this book are instantly adoptable to other cooking methods. If you've got kids, you need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget it...not enough variety","review":"I found this book on a bargain table, quickly glanced through it, and purchased it. Dumb-da-dumb-dumb.This was a bad purchase. I wasted my money. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for it. So many others have written about the problems...I whole-heartedly agree with their reviews.I gave it two stars (instead of one) because I do occasionally look through this book for ideas. I've only used three or four recipes out of it, and those haven't become family favorites or anything.My suggestion, save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Cooker Bonanza!","review":"You've hit the motherload of quick and easy recipes for the slow cooker with this one. An 800+ collection by ladies who are into this style of food prep, with such a variety for almost every menu item.With unbelievable good results so far, we've dined on: French Dip Roast; Meatloaf Dinner; Chicken at a Whim; Jean & Tammy's Sloppy Joes. There is far more in this collection to explore.One to get and have fun with. Inspire all of us to throw together some favorite ingredients and then forget it for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum....Much of the same over and over...","review":"Not all that impressed, a lot of recipes that were very similar and many different takes on the same recipe (there must be 25+ different recipes for \\"stew\\" that are almost alike). The book contains recipes submitted by people rather than \\"professional\\" recipes. Reminded me of a school fundraiser cookbook with parent submitted recipes. Tried a bunch of different recipes from it, none were worthy of making again. Doing a search on the internet for \\"Slow Cooker Recipes\\" yielded better results for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The art of tastelessness","review":"I have tried about 20 recipes from this book and I have to say that are only about 2 that I would make again. I've never eaten anything as tasteless as Mom's spaghetti sauce (no offense to Mom). You can tell that she worked hard to concoct the perfect combination of spices to cancel each other out. Aside from that, who needs 50 different recipes for beef stew? Was the book written by chickens? I would definately consider other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity? Yes. Variety? No.","review":"I picked this book up in the bookstore because it sounded like just what I was looking for -- simple. What I discovered is that the recipes are definitely simple, but they're also incredibly repetitive. Sure, I can appreciate a dozen variations in swiss steak, but I'm not sure that counts as a dozen recipes. I flipped through most of the main dish section without finding more than a couple things I even wanted to try.I think this is a great cookbook if you're looking for flavor variations on slow cooker classics. If you're looking for recipes that are both simple and interesting, I'd look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lazy Effort","review":"This book is largely a list of deplorable, highly processed, over salted, and unhealthy recipes. Given the number of cans of soups added to so many entrees, one wonders about the quality of food consumed by the author and contributors.The Rival Crock-Pot Cooking book of 1975 is far superior.Slow Cooking needs a fine cook and writer, such as Barbara Kafka, to update slow cookery and provide us with fine recipes.With so many people interested in good food and markets brimming with wide selections, it is sad to read books written by people of such limited culinary experience and skill."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointing","review":"I bought this book because it was all the rage a year or two ago. I was new to slow cooking and thought this would help me figure it out. The problem was that I'm not a meat and potatoes or canned food kind of person. I don't keep that stuff on hand and prefer fresh cooked meals.Another problem was the repetitive nature of it. Not only do I not care to cook a lot of the recipes, but there are about ten different versions of each boring recipe. I hope I can find a book to tell me how to adapt my own recipes to the slow cooker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great- if you have no taste","review":"A collection of recipes using mostly cans of this or that. No discussion on technique or what makes a slow cooker desirable as opposed to anything else. Very few recipes using actual fresh food! Completely bizarre to me. If cooking is such a pain for you, eat out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst cookbook I have ever seen.","review":"I agree with all the other one star reviews on this site. Horrible horrible cookbook. Loaded with processed unhealthy ingredients. Every recipe comes out tasting like dog food. Awful! Worst cookbook I have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"ADD TOMATO SOUP","review":"I ordered this cookbook with reasonable expectations. I expected a well thought out book of tested and edible recipes. This cookbook is as far from that as a Big Mac is from Filet Mignon. This is a collection of recipes from all over the country, who knows where she got them all from. There are too many varieties of chili to even count, all of them sound disgusting.The major theme in this cookbook seems to be some variation of \\"add tomato soup\\" or cream of mushroom or bullion cubes or something. I think anyone who is serious about good food knows just what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Unhealthy!","review":"I just browsed through this book while waiting for my mother in Walmart. I would not recommend it to anyone. Not only is it disorganized and repetitive as other reviewers have pointed out, but the steady reliance on beans and prepared soups and condiments promotes unhealthy eating habits. I found many of recipes to be purely disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be decieving","review":"Say you want a recipe for slow cooked pulled chicken. There MIGHT be 4 or 5 in the book, but since the recipes are clearly listed under regular people's names and NOT the dish, you may never find a pulled chicken dish in the book. NOTHING in the index is under a normal title such as \\"Pulled chicken.\\" I'm sure Lily's Vegetable Beef Soup is just as good as Ruby's, but how the heck would I find the recipe by their FIRST NAME??? Stupid idea to write a cook book this way...Its a shame. I would HIGHLY recommend looking elsewhere for slow-cooker recipes as all this book does is frustrate you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this cookbook","review":"The recipes in this book are a collection of other people's home recipes, most our boring and use can goods. Nothing exciting or different here. There are no nice presentations or pictures of what you might be eating. Save yourself time and money and get a \\"real cookbook.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the health-conscious!","review":"Although most of these recipes are quick and some are tasty (others are ordinary at best), many are far from healthful and in that way not much better than fast food. Many rely on cream soups, bottled dressings, and sour cream for flavor. Also, some of the soups in the \\"Vegetarian Soup\\" section contain chicken broth, beef broth, bacon, or dried beef. Someone needs to check the definition of \\"vegetarian\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed!","review":"I had heard great reviews for this \\"cookbook\\" from several slow-cooker e-lists. I just received the book in yesterday's mail, and I was so disappointed! It isn't a cookbook, it's just a collection of recipes from people other than the \\"authors.\\" I'll bet most of them weren't even tested. There is nothing about technique. And the recipes are repetitious--there is a large section on soups and stews (mostly chili and beef stew), and then a good number of the recipes in the main dish section are also stews. As mentioned in other reviews, a very large percentage of the recipes call for canned cream soup. There are 600 recipes, but as I looked through the book, I saw only one or two that interested me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haven't made a recipe in here that I didn't like!","review":"This cookbook is my \\"go to\\" book when my busy schedule allows for just enough time to throw things in my crock pot and run! Every recipe I've tried (and I've made many) has been excellent. Some recipes I've *tweaked* a bit to fit my personal preference (like a splash of red wine in a stew, or additional veges, etc.), but even just as they are, they are tasty!If you are looking for gourmet recipes, then this is not the book for you. BUT....if you are looking for simple recipes that you can literally \\"fix\\" in the morning, then forget about it the rest of the day....then have a great meal at dinner time, then this is for you!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fix-it and Forget-It Lives Up To Its' Name","review":"As a busy homeschooling mother of 4 children, I have found Fix-It and Forget-It to be the answer to my dinner dilemma!

This is a cookbook I would highly recommend to anyone needing easy to make and delicious recipes that take the guess out of the \\"what's for dinner?\\" problem so many of us face!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compilation of recipes without screening","review":"I felt that this cookbook culled the internet for all kinds of recipes and just threw them together without testing. Lots of them are the same recipes with one or two things different, and the quality of the end product was all over the place for me. I love my slow cooker, but i want to do more with it than just open several cans and dump them in. I prefer Rick Rodger's book - everything i have made from that book has been fantastic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I first saw this book at an aquarium gift shop in Oregon (yes, its true). I decided to check it out from the library before purchasing. I am glad I did! The continued repetition of the same recipe is boring. Most recipes used processed, high fat and sodium foods (velveeta being a favorite). My favorite recipe??? \\"Perfection Hot Dogs\\". \\"Place hot dogs in slow cooker. Cover and cook for 1-2 hours.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!","review":"I love the Fix-It and Forget-Cookbook, revised & updated.

It was such a cool book that my sister \\"borrowed\\" it months ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I agree with the ones who say lots of repeating the same recipe. I had high hopes, but, was unfortunately disappointed. I'm not one to return a cookbook, but this is going back! sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland & Bad for you","review":"I've given this book 100% effort in trying to find a keeper recipe - have tried over 20 recipes to date and found one (Taco Soup) - the rest were definitely not keepers. A good chunk of the ones I haven't tried were over the top bad-for-you or sounded down right icky (and I'm fairly adventerous when it comes to trying recipes). I agree with the other reviewers - lots and lots of duplicate recipes where one or two ingredients were changed. Lots of canned soups and processed cheese. There's got to be a better book out there - if not - someone please write one! With healthy yummy recipes! The crockpot is so handy - I'd like to think I can make great food in it that doesn't cause my arteries to dial 911."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd rather eat real food","review":"Like another reviewer, I was extremely disappointed with the number of recipes in this book that called for canned soup of some sort. Many of these recipes are about throwing some already processed ingredients into the pot, which feels more like serving pre-prepared food and heating it up.There are fewer than a dozen recipes in the entire book that I would even bother making.Just flipping through the recipes reminded me of being stuck in the house on a freezing cold January night with nothing to look forward to except dinner, and having to eat something nasty that involved condensed cream of mushroom soup.Very disappointing. I received this as a gift, otherwise I would have returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I found this book years ago!","review":"With the impending birth of our twins, this book is definitely coming in handy.

This one does not make any claim to be lowfat. There are other cookbooks out there that say they are lowfat/healthy....they should give those a try. Anything that is homecooked is healthier than fried, oversalted fast food!This is a GREAT cookbook. Lots and lots of useful recipes.

So, I bought this book when I saw it.The two recipes I have tried so far were absolutely awful, and my family made me swear never to use the crock pot again. The book has many almost identical variations on the same recipe. It seems that any recipe sent in was published, without anyone testing it. Many recipes rely on Cream of Mushroom soup, or other prepackaged or canned ingredients.If you are looking for tasty recipes, or healthy, home made food, look elsewhere!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have some MORE pot roast!","review":"How many recipes for pork chops does one person need?! How about 20? How about 14 recipes for pot roast? Or 13 for cranberry punch? An entire week's worth of split pea soup is available, too, by only varying one ingredient a day (maybe two--JACKPOT!). No wonder the book is sold in shrink wrap with no demos available to look at. Seriously though, if you are looking for a winning state fair baked bean recipe, you could use this book's recipe collection, and enter a different recipe every year for the next forty-seven years! Wheeeeee!! Happy blue ribbons to ya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over promise and under deliver","review":"This book is merely the conglomeration of lots and lots recipes. No pictures, no recommendations. Too much information, too little intelligence. All in all, not what I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipes are not tested - Buyer Beware!","review":"The first 2 recipes I tried turned out terrible. The first was on page 83, Irish Beef Stew. Everything was tender but absolutely no taste. There should be more salt & pepper or something? I didn't give up, since there are so many recipes in this book. My next try was Meatloaf Dinner on page 107. I followed the recipe to a \\"T\\". When I arrived home in anticipation of a great smell of \\"dinner ready\\" I was instead greated with the smell of burnt potatoes and carrots! Yuk! After inspecting the Crock Pot and seeing the black and burnt potatoes and carrots, I re-read the recipe, thinking I did something wrong (like forget to add water or broth ??) I believe there should have been some liquid added to this recipe, but none was to be found written in the book. I give up. I'm not even giving this book away, I'm throwing it away! What a waste of food! I can't stand it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"I tried to give this no stars, but apparently that isn't an option... I have only made a few recipes from this book, but after reading the recipes, it is a terrible cook book. It features complete lack of organization, many recipes are duplicates of others, no commentary on the recipes. The few things I did make were so bad we threw them away without even serving them. I'm not even selling mine on Amazon, I'm putting it in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A previous reviewer said it right, \\"forget it\\"","review":"This is a collection of recipes from amateurs, and I have rarely seen one so completely uninspiring. Many recipes seem bland and use very little imagination. I don't mind the lack of pictures, but I have a problem with the brief descriptions - could they not have included fewer recipes (many of which are almost identical) and more tricks, tips, or a brief description of alternate ingredients. I don't know who eats like this, but most of it is disturbingly reminiscent of public school \\"cafeteria slop\\".

To be fair, I've never actually used it, but page after page of recipes in which cans/packets of soup, etc, were central to the dish put me right off. If that's the kind of recipe you're looking for, then you probably couldn't do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed!","review":"I was disapointed when I got this book. Yes, it does have lots of recipes but I found it wasn't quite what I was looking for. Most of the bean recipes called for canned beans when I have found the slow cooker to be the best way to cook dried beans. I couldn't see the point of throwing a few different cans of beans together and leaving them in the slow cooker for hours. Alot of the other recipes called for canned soups and canned vegetables. There is so much more that can be done with a slow cooker other than using canned food stuffs. The recipes in this book were obviously meant for a variety of sizes of crockpots but nowhere in this book did it state what sizes they used. I found this book a little boring and unimaginative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and inexpensive family fare","review":"When I first bought this book, I had a few doubts because other slow cooker books I have bought had few good recipes. This book however changed my mind. Every recipe I have made has come out a delectable success. The ingredients required are simple and inexpensive. Since I started using this book, my weekly food expenditures have gone down substantially. Furthermore, most of the recipes require no excess fat and are relatively healthy. It is wonderful to come across a cookbook that saves me both time and money, has healthy recipes, and still makes my family happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and disappointing","review":"I'm glad I found this at the library rather than spend money on it. As others have noted - there is an incredible amount of repetition (e.g. 10 recipes for apple butter). I tagged maybe four recipes, but frankly I stopped seriously looking after seeing pages and pages and pages of the same dish. I'll stick with \\"Better Homes and Gardens\\" slow-cooker books."},{"rating":"1","title":"For novice cooks and crowds...","review":"A lot of repeat recipes; for example, beef stroganoff, chili, bean dips, etc., and usually only one or two ingredients different for each recipe. Useful if you don't know how to cook or are a \\"new\\" cook--like for high-school or college students--or for cooking a casual meal for a crowd for Sunday afternoon football. For more advanced cooks, it's way too basic. Recipes are very high fat as well...processed cheese is a favorite ingredient!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Variations on the same recipe","review":"I must agree with some of the critics. This book contains one idea with a dozen variations. There are so many ways a person can slow cook a beef stew. How about some proven recipes? I usually like to cook low-fat foods, and this book doesn't fit my criteria. I was sorely disappointed in this book and ended up selling this book on EBAY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor nutrition and overly repetitive","review":"3 reasons this book is bad:1. There are so many repeated recipes here! This cookbook is a gyp because you are paying for a book full of recipes, when the reality is that it has only a few that are repeated ad nauseum.2. And there is FAR too much reliance on canned soup! Very poor nutrition.3. Poorly organized! As other reviewers have noted, you cannot simply look into an index because it is not indexed by ingredient, but by a catchy name.If you want to save money, get a variety of good recipes, and save time by cooking some healthy food, try another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many of the same recipe","review":"I bought this book in January, it is going into our yard sale this month. I got very frustrated because there were pages of the same recipe with different names.

I've made a few recipes but nothing was that incredible or worth making again for that matter. I love to buy cookbooks, but with the ability to get recipes online at allrecipe.com I really don't use my cookbooks anymore. It's easier to search a database and read reviews to find what I'm looking for.

We have two adults who work full time and three kids who eat, well, like kids. They don't want fancy sauces, exotic ingredients or heavy spices. The slow cooker has long been a work horse in my kitchen so I grabbed Fix-It and Forget-It Cookbook: 700 Great Slow Cooker Recipes (Fix-It and Forget-It Series) when FSB Media offered complimentary review copies.The recipes are for real people, not gourmet cooks. They use ingredients like cream of mushroom soup, onion soup mix, packaged seasonings and bouillon cubes. Some seem repetitive, but most seem to be things families with kids would eat and they seem easy enough to get into the crockpot and onto the table. I foresee my household staff (a/k/a my teenagers) becoming very familiar with this book by summer's end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reworked slow cooking","review":"The recipes in this book are simple and easy to make, but yet result in some very good meals - not gourmet cooking but good comfort food.

Equivalent measures chart is included, ingredients for substituting, a list of kitchen tools and equipment you should have and an index by name and ingredient.This is a revised copy of the first Fix-It and Forget-It book for slow cookers.

The recipes were stuffed 6 to a double page with no author comments or tips and no colored pictures or illustrations. Not very reader friendly. Furthermore, the recipes relied heavily on cream or dried soups, and some of the recipes bordered on silly, certainly they were inane. In short, I did not care for the book at all, and will donate it."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome cookbook","review":"this is my favorite crockpot cookbook! it has a great selection of food and it is so easy. you fix it in the morning and you are set for dinner that night! it is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun book for fans of The Batman","review":"A fun, well written book that Batman fans will enjoy.

Running commentary clearly notobjective but then very few are concerning this period ofrecent history."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Remakes & Live Recordings","review":"I'm not sure where the 5-star review came from ... Time-Life? Not even close.These are mostly re-recordings (many not even by the original artist) and a handful of live performances.If you're looking for the original hit recordings as you remember them on the radio, these ain't them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gaudy at best, poor worksmanship","review":"They claim its silver, it's not. It is however pot-metal that has been plastic coated, mine had rust on it. The pendant is HUGE too, they should include dimensions for these things! They don't sent you a necklace with it, they send you a piece of leather string. If I wanted to tie my own necklace I would have just bought the pieces sperately cheaper! Overpriced piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor workmanship","review":"I really liked the pendant necklace but the chain/plastic necklace that it came on didn't last very long. When it broke, I also lost the pendant.What a shame that it doesn't come on something that is a little more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality / good value","review":"This Ankh is made well, and it is silver. It is 52 mm in height and proportioned correctly. This is a nice piece for the cost, and the supplier had it delivered super fast!"},{"rating":"1","title":"meh...","review":"The details of this necklace are kind of misleading. The black string that came with the necklace was kind of cheap and the pendant itself was nothing special. It is obviously fake and looks more gaudy than unique. I was under the impression that this was actual silver...its not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it! It doesn't work!","review":"It seems like a bargain, but it's a junk. It did not work at all. I discarded it into garbage and did not bother to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not sync","review":"Although on purchase it mentions that it 'syncs' info to your palm, it does not. it has no sync button so a sync is not an option. good for charging the palm with usb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt cheap replacement works great","review":"Some reviewers got frustrated because this cord doesn't have the little Hotsync button, as the stock cord does. This is not a problem for me because you can always simply turn on your Palm, go to the home screen, and tap the Hotsync button on the Palm screen. I wonder if people didn't know this or just hated the two extra steps.Anyway, I love that this cord also charges the Palm, which my stock cord didn't do. Before I got this cord my Palm was always running out of charge. Now that syncing and charging are the same step, it's never happened. I would have been happy with it for $10 including shipping, but it was actually $3 or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap, works, but no HotSync button","review":"It's good that something like this is still available, and the price is definitely right. Pity it doesn't have a HotSync button - but frankly for a product as dead as a PalmOS device, that shouldn't be a daily issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth the money","review":"It is well worth the money even if you just use it as a charger.HotSync work fine even though it does not a button, which is not much of a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cable","review":"Works exactly as it should - charges the TX but it does not have a sync button.Syncing has to be done by opening up the Hotsync application so it is not really a problem - just not as convenient as having the button to press for syncing that is incorporated with the original USB lead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start to a series, now reprinted!","review":"The writing quality is excellent, the premise is interesting,unusual, and takes awhile to \\"get it\\" (it's a mystery to thecharacters, which we discover with them.)The world-crafting is top-notch, the pacing excellent.The ending, however, is in a future book, hopefully the onecoming out in August. I've been waiting a couple of years tosee how this ends, and will buy the sequel as soon as it releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could barely hear Ms. Harnoy!","review":"I bought this CD a few years ago since I'm a cellist and I wanted a really good recording of the Brahms cello sonatas. The first couple of times I heard it, I wasn't too impressed with the sound quality. The piano was way too loud and I could barely hear the beautiful melody that Ms. Harnoy produces on her cello. Ms. Harnoy is an outstanding cellist, but if you want a really good recording of the Brahms cello sonatas, save your pennies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiography of Sir Harry Smith","review":"To whom it may concern,It is inconceivable as to why this copy is so poor, with pages missing, and broad black print lines appearing at the bottom of every page corresponding to the second half of the original text.It was a really shoddy job!Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Not what I expected.

It was a big hit in 1972 and went Platinum in the US. Contains the classic Ventura Highway and the hits Don't Cross the River and Only In Your Heart. Nearly every song on the album received airplay in 1972/1973. They make more use of electric guitars and keyboards on this album than on the their first, but it still has a strong acoustic flavor. Plus it has one of my favorite album covers of all time!While this is a great CD, it is kind of pricey and you can probably find other releases of this CD for cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of America's best.","review":"I really like this album. Not only are the songs great, but it has one of the best album covers I have ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Best Kept Secret","review":"As far as America goes, this is in my opinion their best work. It is an engulfing piece of work that has an incredible high level recording quality which is only superceded by Supertramp's Crime of the Century. To this day after hearing it for over 35 years, I still find new subtle ideas. I find that everytime I listen to this work, I close my eyes and find myself in a different place. A peaceful, relaxing place. If you get a chance to see them live, see them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hola Mon in N. California","review":"Wow! This gem of an album sat in my collection after \\"History\\" came out, but I just got the cd and can't believe how hauntingly beautiful this music is. \\"Ventura Highway\\" and \\"Don't Cross the River\\" are well-known hits, but songs like \\"Saturn Nights\\" \\"Til the Sun Comes Up Again\\" and \\"Moon Song\\" are just as good and this album plays just like their debut \\"America\\". If I could choose 10 cd's to take on Survivor with me, this would definitely be one. Not a weak cut in the bunch."},{"rating":"2","title":"in a word..\\"AMERICA\\"","review":"What can I say...I like this group and it all started with an awesome album. If you like acoustic driven rock and never heard of this group this is the place to start..you will not be disappointed!!! I bought this cd to replace my old record of it. Well worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An early 1970's classic","review":"Released in late 1972, this was America's second album. It made the top ten in the US and would eventually be certified PLATINUM by the RIAA. It includes the classic hit \\"Ventura Highway\\" as well as country-rock hit \\"Don't Cross the River\\" and the minor hit \\"Only in Your Heart\\". Several other songs received radio airplay on stations playing album cuts including \\"To Each His Own\\", \\"Cornwall Blank\\", and \\"California Revisited\\".While this is an excellent album, this import is a little pricey. I recommend you pass on this and buy the US release instead. It is much cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums of all time in one of its best pressings","review":"America Homecoming is one of my favourite albums of all time. It has almost 40 years and sounds very contemporary even today. It includes songs like Ventura Highway, Cornwall Blank from Dewey Bunnel, Head and Heart (John Martyn's cover), Only in your Heart, Till the Sun comes Up again and To Each His Own from Gerry Beckley. Recording made in 1972 was brilliant and Friday Music has done an excellent job in this new vinyl edition. The quality of the cover and record is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"America's Best Studio Album","review":"HOMECOMING is America's best studio album. Produced by the band themselves, it features a number of gems, including, especially, the impressionistic \\"Ventura Highway\\", which hit number nine and the cautionary \\"Don't Cross The River\\", which, probably because the record company assumed the band was hot enough that any single they released would do well automatically and therefore didn't promote it properly, peaked at number 35. There are other great songs here, too, and the band members' belief that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia since 2005 for drug smuggling was unjustly convicted makes HOMECOMING an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this or any other \\"mechanical\\" scale.","review":"Not only does this scale require a strange \\"warm up\\" period in which the reading will be WRONG until the springs 'loosen' but the thing broke within a week anyway. I tried adjusting it in a million ways, but it always gave me a different weight by a 15-20 pound variation from one minute to the next. The whole thing was a freaking waste. Please, I beg you, INVEST in a nice scale. Don't throw away your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughing all the way to the bank","review":"I just can't see the worth in this music. I'm far from being a classical music purist but Maksim is just a very average piano player with a pretty face and a great marketing team. 'Flight of the Bumblebee' is almost half the speed of other recordings, for example. It pains me to see this musack promoted as serious music. It is just souped up Richard Clayderman. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toy Breaks Easily, Not worth the Money","review":"When I saw that this toy was wooden, I was hopeful that it would be sturdier than some of the plastic toys that my 3-year old son has broken. I was sadly disappointed. This toy is made out of very flimsy balsa-type wood. In the 3 weeks since Christmas, I have already had to glue two pieces back on. Also, the wood is decorated with simple foil stickers that are already peeling off. My son desperately wanted some sort of astronaut toy for Christmas, so I bought this one. He seems happy with it, but only because I have repaired it for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product !","review":"I have been using this sunblcok spray for my kids since they were infants. It works great. They swim a lot. I don't even re-apply after applying once in the morning each day during the entire summer. No sun burns. I will continue using for my kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Coppertone!","review":"This stuff also promotes allergies, along with a nice sunburn if you use it. Why aren't they more careful with kids' products? This one should work, hands down, but doesn't. Now I've got to get the sunspots looked at by a dermatologist that were created while using this product. Do yourself and your child a favor, stay with Coppertone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT risk using this product!","review":"I am very careful about the sun exposure during the summer. I bought Banana Boat Tear Free for Baby SPF 50 for my 2 yr old son and for myself, thinking that we can use it at the pool since it is advertised as 'Very Water Resistant'. I used it during our trip to a water park last weekend. Even though I was generously re-applying the cream every hour, we both got seriously sunburned.This cream did not do ANYTHING to protect the skin from the sun. I did not put this cream on my face, and instead used my daily facial moisturizer with SPF 15, and the SPF 30 facial power on top. That protected my face and it did not get burned. This just proves how ineffective this Banana Boat product is.This tells me that Banana Boat product is as good as smearing oil on your body to attract more sun instead of protecting the skin from sun burns. I would recommend to NEVER risk using this product, especially on children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept, Poor Execution","review":"If you really must have a removable media MP3 player, this one isn't it. If I could rate 0 stars, I would. Biggest problems are it has no display, it won't find songs in folder, since it won't find songs in a folder, it's limited to only a hundred or so selections (there is a hard limit on the number of files at \\"root\\" level, which I discovered upon trying to load up a 2Gig card and could only get about a half megs worth of stuff loaded before the card crapped out.I ended up replacing this POS with a \\"JukeM@n jWIN\\" for $15 and it's A LOT better. The jWIN allows for your MP3's to be in folders, so you can fully load the card with songs, on top of that it has a well lit display and good shuffle play, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooktacular","review":"I do not usually read anything with suspence, but I actually had to put the book down because I was spooked! I know the area the author speaks of, so it really made an impact on me. This was a great book! Loved it. Was sorry to see it end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evergreen/ Grassroots, 9th Edition. Unimpressive!","review":"I have used earlier editions of Evergreen and Grassroots extensively in my classes, but am unimpressed with the supposed improvements/changes in the 9th edition.The small type face and rather shiny finish on the thin pages makes the text hard to read.Much of the content is identical to older editions; in fact, I get the impression the publisher has merely revamped the book in order to publish a \\"new\\" edition for more profit.Additionally, this text now assumes a greater ease of access to the Internet than is feasible for many students.I particularly dislike not receiving a printed copy of the Instructor's Annotated Edition. Using it on-line is quite inconvenient.This book is not worth the expense, especially when one considers that students can't really re-sell used books because the practices are already completed on the pages.Very disappointing. I shall be recommending other texts for my classes.

Unfortunately, when I compare the price paid for the book with the value I received, I have to conclude that the publisher got the better end of the deal. This book is more than a users guide, but only a little bit more. My recommendation is to get a book on Act from the library, and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puppy Pen - just what I needed","review":"Item as described. Easy to set up and fold back up when you want out of the way. Gate is very easy to open and close. Has been a great pen for my puppy. It is on tile and she can push the panels and change the shape a bit if she wants but not enough that it is an issue or of concern. She is 15lbs and there is still plenty of room for her bed, water dish, and for her to play a bit with the toys we leave in there for her. Not really big enough for her to get \\"exercise\\" but a great puppy/dog playpen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice X pen","review":"If you are a prime member this item ships for free. An excellent way to go. If you are a frequent Amazon shopper, it's definitely worth the price of membership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate! It gets the job done!","review":"I originally purchased this gate from Petco.com thinking I got a great deal. Instead it ended up being on backorder for 2+ months and I was back at square one. Then I found it here and I got it just 2 DAYS LATER!!!!!! It's worked exactly how we needed it. We've attached it to our dog's crate so he has a bigger space to play around in while we're at work.The human walk thru gate works well for us to go in and out. There is a decent sized threshold though, so our dog (mini-dauchshund) has a hard time getting in and out of the human door. Instead he just uses his own little crate door instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pin!!","review":"This was a great pin, but i wish it split complacently apart so I could just put him in a corner but for what it is it works great!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Play Pen","review":"This pen works well for my two chi's It could be a little higher; my female chi was able to jump over it using a pillow as her prop. I use it indoor and out. Mostly outdoors depending on the weather. The fact that it folds and is portable is a biggie for this household."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Kitten-proofing the Christmas Tree!","review":"I purchased this product to protect my Christmas tree from two very nosy kittens. It seems to be solidly constructed with no obvious defects and the black color is pretty unobtrusive. The height is ample to contain small and probably medium sized dogs. It has nice weight to it, but I don't think it would contain energetic pets of any size without being anchored down somehow. By the gate there is a long rod with a small nut at the bottom that can be unscrewed to release the rod and open the pen into a straight line (we needed pliers to get the nut to unscrew). It's not obvious that it is a nut but if I had actually looked at the instructions in the box, it would have saved me a couple of minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Functional","review":"Overall, I really like this exercise pen with just a couple of minor quibbles.Pros:Folds up very neatly, latches together securely, and is easily carried with the handle.Having the door makes it a lot easier to manage going in and out.Well constructed, and the black wire looks as good as it can.Cons:The three gate drop latches are difficult to line up. I can usually only get all three to drop in after fussing with it a while.The way to separate the panels to make a long line instead of a circle was not immediately obvious, and the skimpy instructions were no help.The bottom line - would I buy another? Yes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"This works perfectly for a 6 pound yorkie. I can easily move this around my yard and patio. Can be configured into different shapes easily. I don't use the door as I just pick her up but I did try it out and it was easy to open and close. I like the fact that it packs flat to put away and store when not in use.I wasn't too happy about the way it was shipped. It comes shipped in the original box. This does not work too well when the contents are metal and shift quite a bit during shipping. It cause a rather large hole to be made in the packaging and if the clip that is used to keep the pen closed was not securely attached to the pen, it would have been lost during shipment through that hole. The box was nearly in shreds upon arrival. No damage to the pen and it works perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALTERNATIVE AND MANY USES FOR THIS BATTERY PACK!","review":"There are many uses for this battery pack, for instance, this great GOT LUX?

Charlotte and Rupert are lucky enough to get a second chance at love when they are reunited in an idyllic English village, and they make the most of it. Changing Seasons is a delightful story of a village whose inhabitants, when they aren't digging in their gardens, seem to be getting married. Jessie Watson gets it just right. Her Regency slang and mannerisms ring true, her characters are charming--the hero and heroine are well-supported, especially by the vicar and his dog, Fortune--and she sure seems to know her gardens.I highly recommend this book and all of Jessie's others.
