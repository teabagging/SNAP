It highlights the trials and tribulations of the modern couple trying to raise children. The father is a dentist, there are two children, a boy and a girl and the main character is an overextended mother. As a single parent, I found many of the overworked parent situations to be overdone, but they were still amusing. Examples are the student teacher conferences, planning a vacation, keeping school supplies safe until school starts and whether or not you have a pet.If you are married and think that your life is atypical, read this book and smile. Although the specifics may differ, all couples with children must deal with nearly all of the circumstances this couple copes with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but the later ones get better!","review":"For Better or For Worse is like a fine wine, it has gotten better in time!

Author Michael Cavanaugh deals with so many of the problems that we face in the world today. He raises a Godly standard, and in simple, straightforward language, he teaches and encourages his readers to fight the good fight of faith. The book takes a no-nonsense approach, and shows how compromise very often leads to misery, but walking in the way that God has set before us will strengthen us, and give us His peace and fulfillment, whether we ever marry or not. I've read it four times, and plan on reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treasure ~ !!!","review":"I love this book. Being a single christian is hard on it own.

The book gives a serious wake up call on just how much purpose and fulfillment resides in the single status. So what are we waiting for?!?! I felt motivated, encouraged, many times humbled, and overall convicted to embrace my life the more. I was one of those waiting to buy a house when I got married. I'm currently praying about a two year plan to own my first home! Bro. Cavanaugh Bravo!! and Praise God for your obedience to hear a clear plan for the single Christian adult.

Unfortunately, after the terrorist events of 2001, including the anthrax releases, this book is all too timely.The style of writing bears Scientific American's usual editorial skill, as applied to all the articles, written by experts in their fields. Topics discussed include how germs can attack humans, and the current precautions we can take. However, germs can evolve resistance, so we do not face a static picture.Perhaps the scariest topics describe how a biolab can deliberately modify an existing bacteria or virus, to amplify its danger to us. Unlike nuclear proliferation, the technology required here is much less capital intensive and the knowledge base is far more widely dispersed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is worth reading if you are interested in Biological warfare and germs","review":"This book explains how germs become immune to different medicines. It gives many examples of diseases and many possibilities to what the future may have in store for us. Unfortunatly, everything in this book is true so all of the stories of diseases that killed thousands of people were not fiction. During the time of these diseases, the correct vaccines and antibiotics were unknown so many people and animals were killed because of them. Their are many countries working on developing biological weapons but only a few worry the united states because of their past relationship with the US.

If not, then skip this one.Deep voice chants are slow and abnormally low/deep voice. It's hard to describe. Some people think that these chants may have 'harmonic healing qualities.' I don't know, but if you like Tibetan Buddhist mantra chanting, deep voice is a wonderful aspect of the sadhana. This CD is a wonderful introduction to deep voice.I love this CD. Lama Tashi's voice is deep and quite otherworldly, butI can hear and understand the words. Lama Tashi's voice is very clear.Many CDs of deep voice chanting (particularly those made by large groups) are difficult to appreciate because it's often hard to make out individual words.This is a wonderful exception.Listen to the sound clips on this site. If you don't like deep voice, then skip this one. If you want to check out deep voice mantras, this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkably powerful and relaxing","review":"Listening to this CD is like a meditation in and of itself. I've listened to many different chanting CD's but this is the most entrancing and powerful chanting CD thus far. Lama Tashi's 'overtone' chanting is very deep and powerful. His voice is duplicated and gradually starting at various times so it sounds like there's several monks chanting at the same time! Each track begins and ends with the sounding of a Tibetan \\"ting-sha\\" bell and a short homage and dedication chant to whatever energy/deity the main Mantra is directed at."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chants for Life and well being","review":"I am listening and chanting to this CD everyday before beginning the day and before retiring at night.

To the person who reviewed this and called Pat Derby and Ed Stewart hypocrits, you really missed the point. They have provided an amazing sanctuary for these animals and others. They do not promote keeping animals in capitivity, they simply are caring for those that are unfortunetly, already captive. They are providing a wonderful place for them to iive out their lives with the hopes that there will not be a need in the future to provide sanctuary for any others, though sadly, that seems to be only a dream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled","review":"This is a book full of pictures of elephants, NOT a Peter S. Beagle book. He wrote a few paragraphs of an introduction, nothing else. In terms of the rest of the book, it is bland and hypocritical; the authors bemoan the fact of captive elephants, while keeping captive elephants. The pictures are poor quality as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy? Absolutely. Too much smoke? Probably.","review":"I know this album only has two reviews so far, but I'm surprised at how positive they are. The songwriting of this collection isn't so bad, but the performances -- both vocal and instrumental -- are so amateurish and listless that the tracks are just about unlistenable. Half the disc is demos? *Every* track sounds like a demo. No polish or energy whatsoever. As for the singer's resemblance to John Lennon, it's present but hardly uncanny. Not enough edge. Not enough swagger. He sounds more like *Sean* Lennon. The Papa Lennon similarity is nothing once you've heard, for instance, the Cavedogs' Brian Stevens or Cotton Mather's Robert Harrison. If you must try a track, check out \\"There Was a Time.\\" The band approaches competence with this one, and it has a pleasant, Emitt Rhodes-like flow besides. Otherwise, there is nothing to praise here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweetness of Aloha","review":"Keahli'i Reichel's voice is what I would consider the epitomy of the Aloha Spirit. Living and driving in LA, I turn on this CD and it magically transports me back to Kauai. I was never into Hawaiian music until I listened to Mr. Reichel and now I don't get enough. I lock Lei Hala'i into repeat and I never get tired of it. I would recommend all his albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"this cd is kool!my favorite song is 'kananaka'.i would reccomend this to anyone who loves true hawaiian music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally uninvolving","review":"The story of a brief romance between the opera singer Enrico Caruso and a Chinese-mulatta Cuban woman, Aida Petrirena Cheng, narrated by their illegitimate daughter. The romance is doomed because Caruso is only making a short tour in Cuba, he's married, the Sicilian Black Hand is making death threats, and he may be seriously ill (the last I never figured out).The story is presented like a tragic opera. Unfortunately, although competently written the book is emotionally uninvolving throughout. The characters, though not stereotyped, never came to life, and neither did the story. It always seemed as though everyone was making much too much of a fuss about everything. So Caruso had a (fictional) fling; what's the big deal?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and Sweet","review":"Sometimes the best things really do come in small packages. It is precisely because of the length that Anna Quindlen's little book was just what I needed. I think this will make a wonderful gift to anyone who is in the hospital, recovering from a traumatic event, or simply taking time to reflect on what's most important in life. It's not just about getting a life, but recognizing how intensely precious the life you have really is. You never know how much the things and people you take for granted are worth until they're gone. Why wait?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Cliched","review":"I was very disappaointed in this book. It was trite and cliched and offered no new insights. Having read several of Anna Quindlen's books, I was surprised at how awful this book was. A small book of 50 pages, in which photographs comprise half of the pages. It was a waste or money, and an embarassment for the author. Who would have thought that she wrote insightful pieces for the New York Times?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"Folks, it's true. You can literally read this book in 8 minutes. I cannot believe the nerve of Anna Quindlen, Ms. Liberal Money Isn't Everything...that's what she preaches and then she tries to rake in the gold for this tiny, cliche ridden, preachy, treacly, sentimental slop.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little treasure, filled with the wisdom of life!","review":"This little book of Anne Quindlen's is just so full of life wisdom that it can for sure help one think about life and death, and to think about how to live one's life to the fullest.You may not be able to get anything from this book if you just read through it in a couple of minutes (which I believe you really can) and then put it down forever. But if you try to slow down and savour the book bit by bit, and most important of all, stop and *think* what the author really wants to bring out through her sharing with us her own experience, then, I am sure your reading of this book will be very rewarding.The only thing that keeps me from giving this book 5 stars is that I find this little book really a bit too little. If only she can write a bit more for us..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizzle over substance -","review":"I feel cheated - 50 pages????. And the author apologizes for letting you down in the first few!! Even at its low price this book is a rip-off. There are so many other hardcover non-fiction books that truly give guidance and satisfaction. \\"Winning at Mergers & Acquisitions\\" is a much better investment, a great summer book, and will actually help you keep your job when your company gets bought. But it wasn't written by a novelist with a friend on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning To Love The Journey, Not The Destination","review":"What a sweet inspiring book. The author shares her life transforming experience of her mother's death to inspire the reader to not take life for granted. For me this little (50 pages including many touching photos) book was a reminder of how rich each moment of life can be, and is if you live from moment to moment and not from goal to goal.If you enjoyed this book I highly recommend a wonderful book called \\"WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. The Kane's book is a great read is for anyone interested in a practical guide to living in the moment, where your life has meaning and fulfillment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive fluff","review":"I was terribly disappointed by \\"A Short Guide to a Happy Life.\\" An avid Anna Quindlen fan, I bought it with huge anticipation and brought it to a restaurant lunch by myself where I could savor it.

I finished it before the end of the meal, and I was still hungry on both counts.Save your money and read it at the bookstore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I like Anna Quindlen, but this book was a dissapointment. I can't imagine why it sells so well other than brilliant marketing and the author's good name. Perhaps I simply expected too much, but there is not much more to this booklet than \\"you should get a life, and appreciate it.\\" Over half the pages (literally) have no text but are filled with unoriginal b/w stock photos. You will finish what little there is to read in this book in a matter of minutes, and be left with little more to think about other than \\"I wish I hadn't spent ten bucks on that.\\" Those who seek truly thought-provoking advice on living a happy life would do well to read the writings of Gary Zukav, the Dalai Lama, or newcomer Taro Gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have always liked Anna Quindlen's writing, but this book was truly disappointing.

Unfortunately Amazon doesn't have a one-half-star alternative. Anna Quindlen is one of my favorite columnists. She is very talented. Why she agreed to put her name on this book is a mystery, but very likely has to do with greed. Those of us who buy books online eventually make poor choices because we cannot flip through the book, read a few pages, etc. I wish Amazon would allow customers to view the first few pages of each book. If that's not possible, how about some access to those books that climb into the top thousand sellers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to Your Novels, Anna","review":"I love Anna Quindlen's prose and think most everything she writes is great. And, then I came across this \\"little gem.\\" Not up to your standards, Anna. This trite and sentimental bookette was a disappointment. Purchasing this book will make me shy in the future about buying books sight-unseen and online from authors I admire, but who have to create something for the holiday market. At least the price dropped since I purchased it. This is a great gift for the office--as long as no one knows it's from you. Hoping that this was intended as a joke for folks like me who too often pick a book by only looking at its cover and/or author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Make a Great Graduation Gift","review":"Short and sweet. Very sweet. Words of wisdom simply put and a pleasure to read. With a variety of stock, black and white photos, it's a lovely overall package and I believe it would make a nice graduation gift for high school seniors and college grads.Thank you Anna Quindlen.Michele Cozzens, Author of A Line Between Friends and The Things I Wish I'd Said."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Short Guide to Getting Shortchanged","review":"If you've read Ms. Quindlen's columns, heard her speak, or know of her boilerplate commencement address, this booklet is not worth the money. While I've often enjoyed and admired her writing, and did hear her speak in college, this item is a real disappointment. I made the mistake of buying it impulsively at the checkout counter, and feel foolish for having done so. She's attained a status as someone who is trustworthy, and wouldn't necessarily stoop to a cheap marketing ploy to cash in on something like this \\"guide.\\" It's a two minute read, spread out over a deceptively thicker booklet, with a lot of silly b/w photos unrelated to the work. Mea culpa for succumbing to the counter display, and I can't blame anyone for making a buck, but it won't happen again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire up the fireplace","review":"This was one of those books you settle down with while sipping a cup of tea. It's an uplifting reminder of what matters most, or should. If you have only a few minutes to spare, this is a great little essay to fill that time. Nothing new, no revolutionary insights, but that's part of its beauty. It's simple, plain, heartfelt, and warm. Light up the fireplace and enjoy Quindlen's comforting words."},{"rating":"1","title":"No there there.","review":"I, too, am a fan of most of Quindlen's work but this book was very disappointing. Vapid trite prose. No wonder she never gave the speech."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good column not a good book","review":"I ordered this book from Amazon and felt ripped off when I read it. It was like reading a hallmark card. It would have been a great column. Also, the photographs which were great, had no real credits. You could not identify when they were taken or by whom. This was such a disappointment from Quinlan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book","review":"This is a special little book.

Here's my summary review:- Better photos in Victoria's Secret (and it's free).- More serenity from raking my 6 inch square zen garden.- Better life lessons from \\"The Weakest Link\\"- Not as compelling as \\"Goodnight Moon\\"If you must -- read it at the bookstore and use a buck or two on 10-10-220 to phone a friend and warn them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, yet profound","review":"One can read this brief but powerful book in 15minutes but the lessons are timeless. Anna Quindlengets to the heart of what is valuable and precious inlife by reminding us how temporal our existence is. Ilove her idea to \\"...think of life as a terminalillness, because, if you do, you will live it with joyand passion, as it ought to be lived.\\" She reminds usthat the simplest of moments are miraculous and worthcelebrating. This small volume offers tons ofinspiration.Another book I go to for inspiration is Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenmentby Ariel and ShyaKane. This book is filled with delicious storiesthat touch and amuse but ultimately guide the readerto a place of well being and gratitude for all thatlife has to offer. Both of these books are puremagic. Keep them near by in case you get knockedabout by life. These authors will bring you back toliving fully and joyously one moment at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I like Anna Quindlen, but this book was dissapointing.

This is just a random string of thoughts off the top of someone's head, and not very good thoughts either. I have a hard time believing Anna wrote this herself. Totally unoriginal. No new material here you can't find in a get-well card, or on a mediocre TV talk show... Ricky Lake is more profound than this fluff. Save yourself the money! At least if you're foolish enough to buy it, you will finish reading it in less than 10 minutes (even if you're a slow reader) so the pain will be over soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shockingly trite entry by Anna Quindlen","review":"I am surprised that Anna Quindlen wrote this very short book, and probably made money on it. There is nothing new here, nothing surprising, nothing that leads me to a happier life. In fact, Quindlen uses so many old sayings that I'm surprised she didn't footnote. This might have been an excellent book if Quindlen had made it into more than 50 pages (including sappy photos that have no context). The story of the death of her mother might have been a fantastic non-fiction book. But this is no little gem. It's a waste of time and a waste of money. Liking Anna Quindlen's work as I do, I was really surprised. Don't bother buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This little book is a complete waste of money unless you like cute little photographs. In not so many words the message of the book is: Life is short, enjoy it, and especially the little things. I do not need to shell out 8 bucks to know that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book!","review":"This book, as all Anna Quindlen's books are, is wonderfully written. There are so many self help books out there, but this one gives the greatest message of all. You read this in one sitting and when you are finished you have a refreshed view on life. You finish the book and want to go out and do good.

However, it took me 15 minutes to read and cost me $12.00. I don't see the economics here. Do not spend your money on 30 pages of writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but cliches","review":"This book has nothing new or original to say. It is simply a collection of cliches and another proof that low quality writing can still come from recognized authors. It may only be 50 pages long. But, the whole book can really be summed up with \\"once in a while, stop and smell the roses\\". So, just save your dollar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reverse the adjectives?","review":"The author assures that she has few qualifications to advise anyone on life--and clearly means it. After a few pages it is more clear she wishes to, in fact, completely convince us. Many readers will feel that the book would have been greatly improved if it could have had the adjectives in the title reversed. But on its own terms it is a masterpiece, and will divert many on the subway who read it from a life of crime or unseemly public yawning."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?","review":"i BOUGHT THIS LATEST, PER THE GREAT REVIEWS AND KNOWLEDGE OF HER PREVIOUS WRITING GREATS. eXREMELY DISAPPOINTING, TO SAY THE LEAST.

Very disappointed and might not buy any more used books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disillusioned","review":"Once an ardent admirer of Anna Quindlen's writing, one true thing is that her pamphlet is a mostly maudlin collection of cliches.

If you really want to know Anna Quindlen, read anything but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the first half of the story ...","review":"Excellent read ... great advice to readers of all ages.

When it arrived I couldn't help but read it first. Yes I was finished in about 10-15 minutes but when I super stressed I often pick it up and read it again. Yes, I did selfishly keep it for myself instead of giving it to my friend. This little book which is definitely short on pages is jammed with message. It's quite the book for introspection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of money","review":"This book was a great disappointment and a complete waste of money. I did not find it motivational, inspirational, or interesting. At one point I thought it sounded like it was imitating that writing that circulated on the Internet as being a commencement address by Kurt Vonnegut. However, that was far superior and I received it for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"Short Guide to a Quick Buck\\"","review":"This is the ultimate case of cashing in on a name.

Not only is is short but it seems the author wrote down every cliche about life that she could think of and tried to squeeze them all into one essay, which is what this book really is. These include such things as \\"If you win the rat race, you are still a rat\\" and \\"Life is a journey not a destination.\\" If you can think of any others it is probobly in here. In closing the book fails utterly to enlighten. It's real success seems to come not from enlightening the reader, but in lining the pockets of the publisher. Save your money, and spend it on something a little less trite."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Happier Life","review":"Anna Quindlen is one of the most articulate, informative, and enjoyable contemporary writers I have read, and \\"A Short Guide to a Happy Life\\" is another great addition to her list of books. Although it was written as a commencement speech and not intended to be a book, there were so many requests for copies of the speech, it made sense to publish it in book form. I wish I had read a book like this one when I was growing up, but I learned most of Quindlen's advice the hard way. Maybe I would've had a happier life when I was younger, but my life is happy now that I've learned that things usually work out for the best. It's still a good book to read after acquiring lots of wisdom and experience -- just to keep everything in perspective and remind us of the most useful things to pass on to our children and grandchildren. I recommend this book to everyone -- young and old."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with the other negative reviews.","review":"This was a huge disappointment.

That's a great trick. I'm all for celebrating animal love - who's to say what is right or wrong, good or bad? Morally, this is nothing new. The question is whether the play is good, whether it is funny, whether in the end it provides a satisfying 'evening' in the theater. Barn-yard jokes (what's that smell?) don't do a lot for me, so I can't say this play satisfied and, although I'd be the first to sanction a roll in the hay for my neighbor the bachelor, would it really be fair to ask my wife to share our bed with a farm animal?

This isn't a bad thing as he's done some excellent journalism on cultural trends but I have the feeling that his days as a novelist are at an end.

It just dosen't hold together as fiction as well.

Too hip, too noir and too self-aware for the room. I think I saw this (type of) film with John Travolta in it and that one creaked of sweat, effort and dialogue that was just a little too precocious. However I did learn a new word: \\"Rhizomatic\\". So it's not a complete waste. And it would make a pretty good junk film if the right mind got a hold of it.

The life time of the battery is very low...maybe 60 minutes. When snorkeling in Hawaii, the battery life was shorter than my duration in the water which was less than an hour. I did take a few pics on the beach as well, but I ran out of battery juice in about an hour. I am looking for a battery for my W30 that will give me more life time on the battery. You don't get many pics on the life of one fully charged battery."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Pentax","review":"VERY disappointed as I thought I would be receiving a Pentax D-L163 battery as depticted, but received a Zeiks rechargable for Olympus and Nikon. Battery says ZE-L142B. Can't find the the price and photo from my original order, but in my account review, when I click on the photo for my purchase it brings me here. I paid $19 including s & h, but ordered from a place called Best Stop Electronics? I EXPECTED a original Pentax for my Optio M30. Not worth returning, but I'm expecting this generic to be very disappointing.

Could have saved some trouble if it was listed correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It gives an overview","review":"The way an overview on the subject of E-commerce is given in marvelous. However it is very pratical, something is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much philosophy, not enough content","review":"The authors are clearly qualified and knowledgeable, but the book suffers from being a dry and largely superficial overview of almost every concept related to computers, IP networking, telecommunication and e-commerce. Little space is devoted to real-world examples, illustrations of products and promise of specific technologies in e-commerce.The book is probably written to those who need a some \\"corridor competence\\" to talk about these matters, but there's little technical \\"meat\\" to be found here."},{"rating":"2","title":"The finest treatment of its subject","review":"Neither Stalin, the collectivization crisis, nor the terror suffer from a dearth of good and serious studies. Yet despite the crowded field, Tucker's \\"Stalin in Power\\" is by far the best treatment of all three complex events. No other book sets out as credible, well-researched and well considered a theory of the workings of Stalin's mind. The great challenge presented by the Soviet thirties is the comprehension of the real logic behind what appears from the outside as mass irrationality. Most writers' personal models of depth and social psychology are inadequate to the task. Tucker succeeds, by a significant margin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stalin in Power: Rob't C. Tucker","review":"I have read many excellent books on Stalin's life, his reign, individual histories of many of Stalin's puppets, and the Great Terror of 1937-1938. Mr. Tucker's book is superb in its depth, breadth and clear understanding of Stalin, his accomplishments and failures, the minions and accomplices who surrounded him, the costs of his bungling, both in human and economic terms, his political purposes, and critically, the psychological forces driving Stalin and his deadly machinations. If you could read only one book about Stalin, Tucker's \\"Stalin in Power\\" is it. Essential to any library on the subject, this powerful history will provide you with a deep understanding of the most evil and Machiavellian person in modern history, a person who both horrifies us, and begrudgingly, engenders a certain amount of respect for his single-mindedness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please write volume 3!","review":"This is an excellent biography of Stalin, the middle book in a proposed trilogy. Tucker weaves events in the Soviet Union around the twisted, paranoid personality of Joseph Stalin, former seminary student. What I found to be the most intriguing was how every time Stalin changed his mind about something, everyone had to fall in line or risk being labeled a \\"wrecker\\" or \\"counter-revolutionary.\\" Stalin was not particularly brilliant, and he was not Lenin's choice as a successor, but he had a genius for bureacratic maneuvering that put him in the powerful position that he held for years. For all his paranoia and all the damage he did to Russia, it is amazing that someone didn't actually knock him off. It is a chilling reflection on how obsequious even the best of us can be when motivated by fear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many informations. But you will be tired at the end.","review":"For everyone who is interested in matters of ideology and public opinion it is a very useful guide into past and current discussion on the concept of ideology. In the second part of the book you will find quite interesting elaboration of the development of media industry based mainly on data from Braitain, neverthenless vey elucidating. Finally the author's media theory which is trying to consider the inner dynamics of media development against the mainstream of New-Left critics of the mass culture tyranny. The style very clear, so you can follow the author's pace of thoughts quite easy but you can find yourself quite bored going thru three fields of reaserch which will finish in final synthesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Successful Retirement--Peace and Purpose","review":"This book is excellent for a transition from the workforce into retirement.

It keeps though the viewer's interest throughout, albeit it is not so unpredictable as the two previous films in the series. On the plus side, I may add that revenge is more than justified this time, since the evil doer is a serial killer of small children and the revenge itself is delivered finally in a more \\"democratic\\" way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Woman's Masterful Touch","review":"An absolute masterpiece. Each film in the Park's vengeance series stands on its own as a great film. Nevertheless, Lady Vengeance stands out from Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Old Boy for the simple reason that the story is seen through the blood-red eyes of a woman scorned. This could be misinterpreted as a cheap gimmick or Kill Bill ripoff, but I assure you that is not the case. Far from it, Lady Vengeance plunges you into the mind and soul of a woman to live out the betrayl, pain, loss, vengeance, and even redemption as a woman. This is not a movie that crams a macho-dude-with-guns into a super-model. This a masterfully crafted story of a character who uses her wits, cunning, love, kindness, seduction, patience, and consideration to exact her revenge on one of the most rutheless villains in modern cinema."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated at best...","review":"I was expecting alot from this movie. After being wowed by Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Oldboy, I eagerly anticipated this movie, thinking it would at least begin to hold a candle to the others. Boy was I wrong. This film completely failed to capture or hold my attention. I was certain I was at fault so (unfortunately) I tried watching again - nothing. I want the time I wasted on this cheap cash-in back! I want my life back! The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I didn't fall asleep during viewing either time (although I now wish I had). There's enough going on to keep it mildy entertaining (if you're easily entertained, like me) but not enough to make me like the movie in the least bit. I hope the people responsible for making it come to their senses and come out with another Oldboy soon - the fate of Korean cinema may hinge on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good.","review":"This movie was quite disappointing. AFter having seen two outstanding movies (Old Boy & Mr. Vengeance), I expected something much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie, to put it plainly, sucks","review":"Alright. Let me say this, if you are looking for a really artsy movie that is not entertaining but is unpleasant as well as disturbing this is your movie. Do not be fooled into thinking that you are in for something like Kill Bill, or a Bittersweet Life, or any \\"cool\\" violent movie. This movie isn't like them. I cannot believe I wasted my time on it, and I would recomend that anyone who says this is a good movie or that they enjoyed this movie be institutionalized. And it isn't sophisticated or intellectual either, its like someone was like \\"wouldn't this be really messed up\\" and then the director decided to be all artsy about it, life has enough real tribulations. If you like watching movies like this, my advice to you is: move to a third world country and learn something real about life...and don't come back"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nostolgic step back in time","review":"I first saw this book in 1981.

The photos of the historical women were nice, but the information provided about them was minimal and undocumented. If you quote a person about something, then you really should mention where the quote came from. The information on the currently working women was better, but again, minimal. I was also disappointed that she didn't include photos of tattoos these artists had done, rather simply included photos of them and the tattoos that they had.Overall, not much content, just some nice pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific premise, fine writing, but not much of a story","review":"This is a well-written novel, with an excellent premise--a newborn female, through magic, being transformed (temporarily) into an infant boy because the evil king wants his son, and not the newborn (who is the rightful heir), to succeed him to the throne. The characters are developed well: from the hero (who does not know he is a girl), to his companions, to the witches and wizards (some of whom know the secret and some of whom do not). Surprizingly, the evil king has rarely been present in the story up to now.The problem is that the story itself proceeds in an entirely predictable pattern. Once it is clear what is going on (this takes two or three chapters), there are almost no unexpected twists and turns, which are the hallmark of the best fantasy writing.That being said, I recommend the book and anxiously await the next installment of what I assume will be a three (or more) volume series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me wanting...","review":"FOR more! This is my first book from Lynn Flewelling, and I will be buying the rest because she has the ability to write a tale that has story lines that seem so different yet they are all running down the same course of the river, perhaps one is caught in an eddy or another rushing in the middle of the rapids! Being pagan I truly loved how steeped in symbology and magic and honor!A book to read for sure! I cannot wait to find out what is on the plate for Tobin now that ... well I will leave that to you when you read the tale..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"This book is a masterpiece. I have read Lynn Flewelling's previous books, but this goes far beyond them. It is deeply disturbing and meaningful. Each character in this book is painfully real as they wrestle with internal struggles. Tobin is a character so intricately woven that you lose yourself in his world of rumours and whispering. The Bone Doll's Twin drew me into the Three Lands and I am anxiously awaiting the second installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"\\"The Bone Doll's Twin\\" by Lynn Flewelling is one of the best books I've read in a long time. All of the main characters are believable and interestingly drawn and now that I have finished the book I find myself wondering what will happen to them in the next book.It is dark fantasy though and Flewelling isn't afraid to let you get attached to a character and then kill her or him off, which I generally don't like but the writing was good and the story excellent. I do wish that this hadn't been quite such a dark vision though for the sake of the hero/heroine Tobin who seems to just be almost unreasonably mired in misfortune. I don't generally enjoy a fantasy that has such a dark vision of the world but Flewelling stayed true to her theme throughout and it ended up working for me. This was a haunting and engrossing read and I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified Prologue","review":"Like other's before me, I was left disappointed by Bone Doll's Twin. I've never read anything by Flewelling, but she came highly recommended and I picked this book off Paperback Swap (I didn't read any reviews first). I thought the plot sounded very interesting, what with Tobin having to hide out as a boy until she could take over the kingdom, and her disguise coming from her dead brother and all. However, the pace was agonizingly slow and I felt that this book was basically a study in character development. Very little action happened, until the end, at which point I was left at a rather large cliffhanger. Unfortunately, the pace of the book, and the fact that I was bored the entire time I was reading, has killed my desire to read the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flewelling does it again!","review":"Lynn Flewelling, author of the excellent Nightrunner series, has another great book in Bone Doll's Twin. Mystery, magic, and intrigue are well blended in this haunting thriller. A must for any fantasy fan. Also, don't forget to pick up Luck in the Shadows, Stalking Darkness, and Traitor's Moon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dying for Tamir Book #2","review":"I liked the Nightrunner series. When this first came out I didn't want to read it because I didn't think it would be any good. But seeing it in the library, I decided to give it a shot. It was incredible, surpassing the Nightrunner series by tenfold. Now I'm dying for the next book to see what happens next. I won't give away any detail because it's a book you'd want to savor."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting beggining...","review":"The thing that really separates The Bone Doll's Twin from many other fantasies is it's somewhat dark atmosphere and oftimes spooky imagery. The story follows a tried and true fantasy plot of some prophecy that must be fulfilled, but this is not to the detriment of the novel since many other elements come into play. The prophecy in question states that a female ruler must rule in order for there to be peace and prosperity, when the prophecy is broken and kings instead of queens sit on the throne, all goes to hell. The protagonists of the story devise a clever, if cruel, way to insure a female ruler using magic, but the forces they unleash threaten to be much more than they bargained for.The story is not stand alone, and is meant as the first part of a trilogy but the book tells a compelling story nonetheless. Author Lynn Flewelling has a firm grasp of the genre and adds some darker elements that really make this novel stand out from other more sanitized fantasy tales."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to slog through mud, AkA where's the beef?","review":"I wish that I had more positive things to say. It takes the main character too long to do anything. If you had gotten rid of all of the moaning and groaning over growing up and gotten to the meat of the matter I would have enjoyed the book more. I enjoy female protagonists usually but this book drags. All you hear over and over is that the child's mother went insane, the father boo-hoos over it and the child is left to deal with the angry twin. Where is the action, where is the magic, who cares about the supporting characters especially if they don't seem to do more than hide, smell bad, and talk rather badly? I wouldn't recommend this book, in fact if you cut out the growing up verbiage of the child I bet you could get the entire trilogy in one book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where to begin?","review":"I bought this book because it came with an incredibly high rating, and had several reviews (including one by one of my favorite authors, Robin Hobb) that were well-written, coherent pieces of praise. Which leaves me with one question: Which book were they reading, and could they please loan me a copy? What I got was several hundred pages of...nothing. Nothing punctuated with random, gratuitous, and unnecessarily graphic...liaisons. The story was interesting in concept, but poorly executed. There were no sympathetic characters, and little action. I'm ashamed to say I hung on until page 330-something, thinking that surely it got better. Perhaps the sequels improved it; I'll never know.All in all, I've read better and more interesting Star Trek spin-offs than this uninteresting if \\"original\\" book. If there was a zero-star rating, this book would've earned it. Now where's that used book store?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noble effort, but really nothing new in the genre","review":"I was drawn to this work from a recomendation from George RR Martin, who is my favorite fantasy writer. But, I was bitterly disappointed in this book. The writing is competent, the atmosphere chilly and she tries to build up momentum for the main story, a few subplots, and fills in a backstory. But, very little seems to get accomplished in the first 250 pages. There were no characters that I actually cared about and no sense of wonder at any mystery that made me want to turn the page. By way of contrast, GRRM's works by that point had at least 5 characters that I wanted to learn much more about and had started half a dozen story lines that captured my interest. Bone Doll seems to put almost all its eggs in one basket with its main story, and it's not as interesting as one of the top 3 of GRRM's subplots. A very competent writer, but there are better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The whole series could be condensed into on book","review":"After reading this whole book (I skipped a few pages), I really wish I had just read the first ten pages and the last three. The book starts out pretty good with some mystery. But everything is explained within a few chapters and I lost all interest in the story. The middle of the book consists of nothing more than minor insignificant happenings, character description and scenery description. This would be fine except it wasn't even crucial to the story. Add in the unlikable, whiny characters and you got yourself one snoozer of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I guess the novel was well written but I can't help feeling somewhat disappointed. I loved Lynn's three previous novels and have read them so many times I could quote chapter and verse. What I loved about those stories was the beautiful relationship between Seregil and Alec, their comraderie and wit, the dangers and trials and triumphs and eventual love. I've searched for years for novels featuring a male friendship and I miss that dynamic in this latest story by Lynn. Stories of truly wonderful male friendships are difficult to find in any genre but I hit the mother lode with \\"Luck in the Shadows\\", \\"Stalking Darkness\\" and \\"Traitor's Moon.\\" As I said, the book was well written for what it was, but I couldn't empathize with the characters.I'm keeping my fingers crossed for the further adventures of Seregil and Alec. Please Lynn!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These characters ... are lacking","review":"I wish I'd read the story summary before I bought this one. I guess I was expecting more of what I'd come to expect from Ms. Flewelling - adventure, wit, charm, character chemistry, caring, however I was treated to more of what seems to be a trend in Fantasy fiction these past few years. Well, at least it wasn't sporting a ghastly cover featuring some well built heroine brandishing a sword. Nope. Instead we have a nice looking, outwardly appearing *guy* - who's actually a *guurrrrl!* :(So I'm a male bonding kinda gal <shrugs>..I prefer to read novels, Fantasy or otherwise, with fun, charming, caring men instead of this cop out. I, too, am hoping that Ms. Flewelling has more adventures of Alec and Seregil in mind for future novels. Now those two are the best fictional characters to come along in many years...in any genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"This entire trilogy was excellent. The characters were interesting and I hated to see them go. Throughout the story I found myself go from loving to hating to feeling sorry for many of the characters. I only wish that the author would write more stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book started slow","review":"This book started slow, about the time I thought I would give it up the plot got interesting. This book certainly did not miss anything that might be contained in a fantasy. The book had angry ghosts, witches, Sorcerer. I enjoyed the characters they were well rounded and left one wanting to know more about them. By the time I finished The Bone Doll's Twin I had order book two and three from Amazon. I hope they keep me as interested as this book. I could not put this one down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This video is a waste of time. It's basically a home video wrapped with a short prelim on the area along with some 'save the environment' BS. The voiceover is apallingly bad and it only runs for 15 minutes.

I'm sure they're also great for various other arts and crafts.However ...I purchased these thinking that they were postcards and I intended to use them as such. Despite the lovely images these do not work well as such. They must be torn from pages in the book. Each page has 4 cards that are attached together by perforations. This leaves two sides of your card with a very unattractive white torn paper \\"fluff\\" that you're going to need to cut off. Also the weight of the paper is pretty weak. I worried about sending them as regular postcards so ended up putting them in envelopes and sending them like they were regular letters.So if you're looking to use these for crafts or framing, I give it 4 stars!

Are they kidding? I guessed the murderer about halfway through the book, and was disappointed when I was right. Not much of a challenge. If the incomparable Ms Christie had written this book, somebody REALLY surprising - but with fair clues - like the panhandler, would have turned out to be the murderer. Believe me, I'm not giving anything away when I say this. Subtlety isn't this author's strong point. I expect his avid fans to put a ton of \\"Not Useful\\" marks by this review, but the review isn't for them. It's for the reader who's looking for a good mystery: don't be snowed by all the gushing.

Who cares about every single street every single carachter takes on his way to anywhere??Unless you're from LA this becomes utterly boring! Delete all the references to streets, avenues, boulevards and whathaveyou and you will end up with a 20 pages book even a child could write.Very repetitive (too much so) descriptions and thoughts and quite predictable.Again, if so many people consider this book to be the best among those Connelly has written thus far I can say this is my first and LAST."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing first Harry Bosch read.","review":"This is the first Harry Bosch book I've read.

I found myself reading the book at stoplights. But as I surfaced and started to ask questions, about halfway through the book, I realized that nothing really new was going on. It didn't stop me from reading the book, I still enjoyed it immensely but I found myself saying, \\"No, it isn't so and so because I sort of know what's going to happen and there are still a hundred pages left\\" Similarly I found myself staggered at some little gems of characterization and detail and then scratching my head at the cliched quality of other, very significant details.

If you're looking for something totally absorbing, a real page-turner that may keep you up all night to finish it, then this is for you! Truly imaginitive, uniquely creative, it makes you want to get started on another as soon as you put this one down. Having read Black Ice, Last Coyote, and the Poet, I can honestly say that Michael Connelly is \\"first class,\\" right up there with the best of his genre.Being an attorney myself, I am usually completely turned of by phony courtroom scenes and by a generally lousy grip of the law that many mystery writers seem to share.

Connelly's development of story lines and characters builds with each book. The Concrete Blonde is the third in the series and, so far, the best of the bunch - but for its full impact, read the other two first. You will be very happy you dove into the Bosch series. This is great crime and detective writing and story telling. Bosch is quite the complex individual, but others around him are also built by Connelly with depth. As for the stories - as you would want, they are filled with twists and turns all the way to the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Connelly's best","review":"Connelly is a great writer. I've picked up a few of his books with some trepidation, such as the Poet or Void Moon and I always find myself pleasantly surprised. The Concrete Blonde is the territory where I feel more comfortable, it is the world of Harry Bosch, Connelly's usual protaganist. The novel is a brilliant combination of courtroom action and slick detective work peppered with just enough police lingo to immerse the reader in a realistic world without losing them in lots of technicalities. This book delves into past events mentioned in earlier Bosch novels while not alienating new readers. Gritty and poetic, Connelly exceeded my expectations with this book. A must for hard-boiled detective fans, mystery readers, and Connelly fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"Connelly just keeps turning them out, I don't know how he does it but he always has a good story and knows how to tell it so that you can't wait to turn the page.This is another in the Bosch series and it tells a little more about what made him into the man he is."},{"rating":"2","title":"And Concrete Foundation","review":"Michael Connelly's The Concrete Blonde is another good 'who dunnit' well worth your time to read.

And it is a great piece of writing. As a lawyer, though, I have to downgrade a star because Connelly seems out of his element in the courtroom aspect. No judge, especially the by the book judge here, would allow a \\"police shooting case\\" to devolve into the guilt or innocence of the victim. It is simply irrelevant to the trial whether the guy Bosch shot was the Dollmaker or not. The issue is whether his move for the pillow justified the shooting. I just don't get that most of the trial is about the guile or innocence of the guy that got shot. 98% of the \\"evidence\\" at the trial would never have been admitted, or -- at a minimum -- the case would have been bifurcated as between liability (whether it was a good shooting) and damages (how much loss is associated with a shooting if it were adjudicated \\"bad\\"). No way the jury would have heard all of those arguments at the liability stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top notch mystery","review":"A civil trial brings the a vicious serial killer back into Harry Bosch's life.

Subsequently, I inadvertently read the whole Bosch trilogy (\\"The Last Coyote\\" had not yet come out) from back to front, then re-read them in the proper order.

Mr. Connelly's knowledge from being a crime reporter show beautifully in his novels. Very realistic.I wish he had better taste in women. He like them sexually desirable, but shallow and self-centered. They always end up dumping him for cold, selfish reasons. They claim to understand the seriousness of his work, and also understand his commitment; but they leave him at his neediest, because only threir (lesser important) needs take precedence.

Bosch has killed a serial murderer previously and now the widow is suing Bosch. My 1st thought was \\"Please Lord, don't let her win !\\" I don't want to spoil anything but if Bosch and the LAPD lost this suit I wasn't reading anymore Michael Connelly ! Anyhow, the suit is secondary to the page turning plot which has to do with a copycat serial killer. I really like this series because Connelly understands the LAPD and Bosch is a very likeable and dedicated detective. So will you !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A keeper","review":"This is the second book by Michael Connelly that I have read. I think i will read more, now. He gives each of his characters not just a life, but quirks. You often find slite humor in the words.

The Dollmaker is a great villian yet unlike Patterson everything gets resolved in this incredibly good novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of Bosch - (that I've read so far).","review":"Just recently, I received a copy of Connelly's Trunk Music as a gift. Never one to begin a series in the middle, I picked up a copy of The Black Echo. I can see how Connelly's first novel won an Edgar. The Black Ice was better; much better in my opinion. In The Concrete Blonde, Connelly hits his stride with Bosch, revealing more details about the character's past, creating deeper relationships, and supplying more motivation for why Bosch is not your run-of-the-mill, rogue cop. The Concrete Blonde is about the lost concept of justice, and Bosch's pursuit to obtain it without sacrificing his \\"mission\\", his relationship, and his sanity. Through this disturbing journey, Bosch shows us the costs involved in acheiving true justice. Next up: The Last Coyote - I can't wait!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Concrete Blonde, by Michael Connelly","review":"This was an excellent mystery/courtroom drama/thriller; I didn't really expect anything less, because I'm fast learning that Michael Connelly is a sure bet for a fantastic read.In this book, Detective Harry Bosch kills a man he was sure was a monster - a serial killer. Unfortunately, the circumstances surrounding this incident left Harry explaining why he didn't call for back-up, and why he shot and killed an un-armed man. Four years later, this man's wife sues Harry for her husband's wrongful death and he has to justify his actions in court, or accept that he made a horrible mistake.It's probably best to read the whole Harry Bosch series in order; I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Bosch book so far","review":"I realize I am coming very late to the game with just now starting to read the Harry Bosch series but I am so glad that my friend recommended the series to me. I have read the 1st 5 books and so far all the books have been riveting and real page turners but my favorite has been The Concrete Blonde. I found myself really cheering for Bosch and was literally at the end of my seat. I would highly recommend this book but I recommend that you read the previous leading up to this one, otherwise you will not get the whole picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The concrete blonde","review":"I enjoy the Harry Bosch novel's so much. Following this detectives life book by book always has me on the edge of my seat. I truly enjoy coming across the other familiar characters along the way as well. Even if you read a couple novel's out of order, Connelly thoroughly explains the people and events so well along the way- it's like you haven't missed a beat anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghosts from the past","review":"In the first novel of the series (\\"The Black Echo\\"), reference was made to the shooting that got Harry Bosch disciplined within the department. Now it is four years later. The police department is being sued for alleged violations of the suspect's civil rights. As the trial progresses, you learn a little more about Harry's past, and a lot more about the four-year-old case.This is a novel about serial killers. It is not overly graphic, but you do learn a lot along the way about the porn trade in Los Angeles, the seamier side of life, and the black heart hidden inside some people who appear externally normal. It is a well written novel with some surprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Bosch and his grim world","review":"Quite an absorbing story. Michael Connelly IS indeed a great writer. His characters are quite edgy. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to read a gripping, suspenseful story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally inadequate!","review":"These lift supports were weaker than the lifts I was trying to replace.

The only good part is that Amazon picked them right up and gave me credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost useless","review":"I bought this book because the Exam Cram on 70-175 was excellent. However, I found this book almost useless. A lot of topics in the exam are not covered at all or enough by this book. You are very likely to fail the exam if you only rely on this book. The practical questions are stupid and too simple, you will be shocked when you do the real questions. To prepare the 70-229 exam, I highly recommend 'Professional SQL SERVER 2000 Programming' by Robert Vieira. That book covers everything you need to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best one ...","review":"I passed the exam but only because I got rid of this book and studied from MSDN a week before. The book covers most of the topics as if they were in a high school curriculum. I'd say if you are preparing for the MCSE/MCSD/MCP exam then DO NOT go by this book. But is fairly ok if you'd want an introduction to SQL Server 2000 before digging deeper into another detailed exam material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out","review":"I bought this book a couple months ago and I'm really disappointed because I found several wrong answers on it, not forgetting to mention the fact that several parts of this book are made from \\"topics\\".

There must be other better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"Of all the technical books I have read, this is probably by far the worst. There are many typos; errors where the book uses the wrong word and throws you off; and inconsistencies where the text says something then the answer to the practice question says something different. But additionally, the book covers some materials insufficiently to be at all useful, in other words it is too condensed. This book is not enough to pass the exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for topics - lacking substance","review":"It's a good study guide in the sense that it tells you what might be on the test - but it doesn't go into detail. A lot of wasted words on the different types of tests.... but when it comes to the actual questions, often it says \\" there will be several questions about .... review the technical reference to prepare youself.\\" Like, HELLO?!?! that's why I bought this book.

His voice caresses the Hawaiian language, already one of the most beautiful languages on earth. His Hawaiian sounds like the Hawaiian that the kupuna speak. Combine that with the masterful poetry of the amazing Puakea Nogelmeier, and you've got music that is timeless. Whenever I listen to Keali\`i singing, it makes me soooo homesick for Hawai\`i. If that weren't enough, Keali\`i is one of the nicest people you'll ever meet -- and so is Puakea. They both still live in Hawai\`i and they don't have the big head because they are famous.

The author seems to have problems focusing directly on the topic at hand. What examples do exist have errors, which is enough to confuse any student. The difficulty of the end of chapter problems is a bit tough at points which is confounded by the lack of provided solutions. the book has 0 solutions with a promise that 20% of the problems are solved online. Instead, what is found on line are hand scribbled answers with no explination. This book is a work in progress at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, maybe if I already had a degree...","review":"This book is very tough for someone just starting Electrical Engineering to understand. The book reqires a lot of previous subject matter knowledge that can be very frustrating if you don't have it. The mathematical derivations of the equations are somewhat choppy and skip many steps. Also, the problems at the end of each chapter are extremely difficult compared to what was taught in each chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"This book is full of errors and the subject matter presentation is far from an introduction.

Aside from seeming to be disorganized and overly complicated, it also has a massive disconnect between practice problems and examples.

But within two months (with very light wiper use), the blade started to fall apart, to the point there was metal scraping on my windshield. I actually thought about bringing the blade into the house to see if I could thread the rubber back through the clips, etc., then decided my time was better spent elsewhere.

The willing suspension of disbelief which is essential for the success of a good fiction read becomes more and more difficult as the book progresses. Unexplained details (a character who is described as a \\"miracle worker\\" is a repeated deus ex machina whom the author inartfully uses to tie up loose plot ends, e.g.), impossible coincidences (an ex-con known to the protagonist just happens - out of the absolute ether - to have the drop dead connection to the bad guy) and unresolved plot lines (what happened to the social worker and the ex-wife? They simply disappeared!) sink this book. Deaver is a talent but it is not evident here.

I've read better.","review":"This is the first book I picked up by Mr. Deaver and as soon as I got to the checkout line, people who saw the book said \\"he's really good!\\" Then another person tells me that he's the guy who wrote the book that became the movie, The Bone Collecter. Now that impressed me as the movie was definitely well made.With high expectations I delved into it, only to be sadly disappointed. While the premise is exciting and there are twists in the tale, the characters are cliches and the story rambles at every opportunity it gets.No doubt the author is a good writer as it shows on occasion, but this book was a major disappointment.

However, unfortunately I was quite disappointed in his latest effort. The plot was OK, but the focus on the main characters melodramatic thoughts in regards to his children really put me off. As a separated mother myself, I know how it feels to think your access to your children will be taken from you, but his thoughts about it were always far too melodramatic to be true. I did not find this book as absorbing as his previous books, sometimes finding excuses not to read it for long periods. All in all, not bad, but compared to his others, nowhere near as effective.

Hardly...","review":"I really,really enjoy Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme series so I was hoping this would be as good as the rest, I was wrong. This book is poorly written and seems rushed, its way too long and the plot jumps around too much. I hated the Digger character, the scenes describing his progression are flat and uneven. I really enjoyed the characters of Parker Kincaid and Margaret Lukas but besides a few anecdotes, they are never fully fleshed out. I also didn't care for the mystery, its not a good thriller, the action scenes are done well, but their is really no mystery, the FBI always to stumble upon clues and it gets infuriating after a while having to put up with annoying sub-plots. I hope Deaver's next Rhyme novel, \\"The Empty Chair\\", is better because this book is a stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"More is less","review":"I was disappointed by this book. I cut Deaver a lot of slack in the Bone Collector and Coffin Dancer primarily because the plots were well devised. Not so here. While the two leads are interesting characters, the deductions made to catch the killer are ludicrous to the point of undermining the books credibility. Deaver even plagiarises himself by using a fundamental plot twist from Coffin Dancer. In short, a forgetful and cartoon-like read."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a dud","review":"Jeffrey Deaver's style of writing is getting old. We've all come to expect his stories to twist and turn until the very last page, and he's become so intent on writing like this that he's abandoned any sense of believability. When the final \\"shocker\\" came at the end of this novel, I said to myself, Well, I knew that was coming. Okay, so I didn't know exactly what was coming, but the possibilities were very limited. And it was just so fake, like a really bad movie. I recommend his stuff from a few years ago, especially The Maiden's Grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre thriller that follows a set routine.","review":"For first-time readers of Jeffery Deaver, Devil's Teardrop may stand out as a significant thriller. Viewed in the context of his other novels, it quickly becomes tiresome as Mr. Deaver simply follows the same gimmickry he used in most of his other books -- using a character to exit his or her \\"safe\\" role in the book to assume the character of the main fiend. As a result, the reader is left only with trying to figure out whom the fiend is and how he or she will play out his or her role. Please, Mr. Deaver, you do a very good job of describing villainry and in this case it's a shame that you leave most of the enormity of this fiend until the very end. Abandon the gimmickry and try a new style, one that will truly entice the reader. For those willing to read other books by this author, I suggest The Bone Collector. It is by far the best Mr. Deaver has written, and depends lesser on his standard trick writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Police Procedure Nonsense","review":"It's not as bad as the audio book we got, another title, but it still shows what a small amount of research can do.

This book is very slow moving for the first 1/2 to 3/4 of the book until it picks up near the end. The sections describing forgeries and types of paper to help with forensics evidence were informational but only served to bring this book to a crawl at times. If there were more detail and scenes involving the Digger earlier in the book it would have helped move the story along. Overall a decent novel but I hope Deaver has better works out there. For a better option try out one of J.A. Konrath's 'Jack Daniels' series novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extortion plot that could lead to numerous rampages","review":"A criminal mastermind is plotting an extortion scheme against the city of Washington, threatening massacres at four hour intervals if 20 million dollars is not paid by noon that day.The day is New Year's Eve, 1999, and someone is terrorizing Washington D.C., which leads the FBI to turn to Parker Kincaid, who had retired after an ugly incident a couple of years earlier which had endangered his children's lives.With his expertise as a certified document examiner, they unravel the spellbinding mystery.Parker is very likeable as a single father, which makes this story all the more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read with an interesting plot but...","review":"Overall I enjoyed Devil's Teardrop, but found some the latter shifts in plot to be incredibly far fetched, and much too simplistically introduced. One could easily tell that Mr. Deaver simply wanted to interject surprises into the plot (which is a good thing when done right) however it could have been so much better. As these surprising occurences just took place, I found myself shaking my head and simply saying \\"yeah, right.\\" And then of course, later there would be a very simplistic explanation for the shift interjected later in the text. One thing that was never explained however, was the \\"click\\" that occurred during the Digger's thought process."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thriller to the very very end","review":"Excellent book.

You'll enjoy the story and learn something too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a very disappointing read.","review":"I'm afraid that Mr. Deaver's latest endeavor left a teardrop in my eye. The great characters were so wasted with his plot that was so full of holes a truck could be driven through with no brakes.

Try again, Jeffrey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Having read some of the reviews already posted I have to say that none of them reflected my feeling about the book. Though at first it entrigued and enthralled, the story unfolded to what was in the end a run off the mill 'thriller'. At times I found that the attempts to explain the 'science' behind the forensic analysis abit laboured, almost half expecting a flashing caption to appear stating \\"Here's the science bit\\". This is the first novel by Jeffery Deaver I have read, and despite his great reputation I must say I was left disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst book of the year","review":"I had read The Bone Collector, loved it and was SO excited that I got Teardrop for my birthday....until I started the book. This has got to be the sappiest, most unlikeable \\"hero\\" ever! Not once did I even feel the slightest bit of empathy toward any character, the premise was goofy, and for the first time in years, I put a book down without finishing it. This one rates a great big \\"YUCK\\", and I doubt if I'll read another of Deaver's works. So there, I said it and I'm glad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singer, great song choices","review":"I bought this album some 12 years ago and up til now, i still consider it as one of my faves.

Great solo CD, Russell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome","review":"This book is absoultely gruesome. Bombs drop and people die. Parvanas father dies. It is sick. Not popular on my list."},{"rating":"2","title":"insightful","review":"The Breadwinner's superficial plot concerns a young girl living under the Taliban who's father is arrested. She dresses up as a boy so she can go out and shop and earn money. It was written (very well written in fact) by an aid worker so it has more than a touch of realism. The greatest value of the book is that it provides a perspective into a very different world, and it does so skillfully and perceptively. While the book maintains a hopeful tone, the subject matter is dark, and is not sugar coated or simplified. The father's situation is eventually resolved, but by that point the protagonist has even more concerns. If you think it is a book that might be suitable for a younger child, I suggest taking a look at it first to assure yourself that your child is sufficiently mature for the material. It is a quick read for an adult."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Breadwinner","review":"The Breadwinner is a book filled with wonderful adventures about how a girl has to save her family from starvation. This girl did many brave things that not just an average girl could do. I think this book is filled with adventures and if you like that it's a great book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not receive product or explanation why","review":"I ordered this product and never received an e-mail stating that it was shipped. I had to wait until the estimated delivery period came and went before I could file a claim (approximately 3.5 weeks after I had submitted my order). Within a day of filing the claim, I was notified that I had been refunded. However, it put me in a bad position as I had to rush out to purchase the book from a bookstore at the last moment before school started. When I received the refund notice, there was no explanation of why my order was not filled nor any kind of apology for the inconvenience this caused. I consider this to be poor customer service. I would have rated this vendor with only 1 star; however, because the refund was processed quickly, I rated them with 2. But I will not do business with this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"I taught this book to my sixth grade class last year-an easy read technically but mature ideas, but easily 90% of the students loved it so much that I had to order the next book-and then the next one as well! Thought provoking for everyone who has grown up with all the necessities and more. A great perspective on the real world right now. Even though it is about a young girl, boys thoroughly enjoyed reading about her adventures. The best part? All proceeds go to Women for Women, a charitible organization in Afghanistan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wasn't Impressed","review":"The story was good and the characters were well defined by dialogue and interaction with each other, but there was almost NO description of anything physical. The book is targeted towards preteen Americans, but the author used terms that would be unfamiliar to that demographic and then failed to define them in context. There was a glossary that I did not discover until ten pages before the end of the book.Further, the dialogue was not always clearly attributed and I sometimes was confused about who had which part in a back and forth conversation. This would be especially difficult for 11-13 year olds, who have less-developed comprehension skills, to know what was going on.There were hardly any descriptions of the environment, clothing, etc. It assumes that this audience knows what Afghanistan in the 90s looks like and feels like, which-- as a work that is meant to be a snapshot of a living experience for children who aren't from that country-- is uneffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling","review":"Parvana is a young girl living with her family in a bombed apartment building in Afghanistan. Her father is taken away by the Taliban and Parvana is forced to disguise herself as a boy in order to obtain food for her family.It's a compelling story which allows children who have never experienced war or hunger to see what life in other places can be like."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book review from 4th grade students in Beijing","review":"This is an excellent book because it is suspensful, informational, exciting and thought-provoking. A majority of us believe that this book should be read aloud by an adult in order to discuss the sensitive content.There are many scenes in the story that have a lot of imagery. Especially the part when Parvana is turned into a boy!This book should be read all over the world because it makes us thankful for what we have in our own lives and also helps to educate us on life in Afghanistan while the Taliban controlled Kabul.We are excited to read the next 2 books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This is a sad but seemingly true story of how one family has learned to survive in a country at war during Taliban control. The story is told from a little girl's perspective. The reader experiences the many trials and tribulations that the main character, Parvana, goes through on a daily basis. May not be a true \\"historical fiction\\" but it is an excellent novel and must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fifth grade review","review":"The Bread WinnerThe Bread Winner is a five star book about a girl, named Parvana and her family. This book takes place in Afghanistan. When her father got arrested nobody can get the food. Parvana is the only one who can because everybody else is either to old or to young. Do you think Parvana can keep the family running and not get arrested? I like this book because it was suspenseful and you never knew what would happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seventh graders love this book!","review":"My seventh grade social studies students are about half way through this book, and they absolutely love it! I actually hear moans when we have to stop for the day! Paravana and her family are quite familiar with their sibling rivalries, chores, hopes, fears; even my most unwilling readers are being drawn in. The setting is \\"known\\" to students as a result of September 11; the suspense keeps them turning the pages; the realism of the characters makes them realize that this could happen to them. I strongly encourage parents and teachers to share this book with children to give them a sense of the world and the connections we all share."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breadwinner","review":"I really liked the book The Breadwinner. It had some exciting moments that just made me want to keep reading. Every day Parvana dressed up like a boy and went to sell things in the market place. While she was sitting on her mat a mysterious lady would drop little presents down to her from her room above Parvana. I always wanted to find out what she would give Parvana the next day and the next day. There were also some sad parts to this story about Parvana and her life in Afghanistan. Women and girls had to wear turbans on their face and they couldn't show any skin. Girls could only go outside with men. She had a hard time being a girl in Afghanistan. Her father was in jail and she had to act like a boy and work the family jobs. Parvana is a very smart and courageous girl with a strong mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important book for youth","review":"Young readers in the Western world will find the horrifying circumstances of Parvana's life hard to believe. This book can serve as an eye-opening introduction to the situation in Afghanistan, and a springboard to further investigation. The allegations of inaccuracy (by reader-reviewer tenzing) are a bit harsh. The official years of the occupation are 1979-1989. Maybe since it was late December 1979, the author rounded up by a week--a regrettable but not unforgiveable choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stirring Gospel Music","review":"This is authentic, stirring African-American gospel music on Soul Note Records, a label that in the 1980's was dedicated to cutting-edge jazz. The connection stems from Fontella Bass, who performed with the Art Ensemble of Chicago. Her mother, Martha Bass, was a long-established gospel singer. Like Fontella, her brother David Peaston is a versatile singer with plenty of soul and roots in the church.Martha, Fontella and David provide the vocals, joined by AEC members Malachi Favors on bass and Phillip Wilson on drums. Amina Claudine Myers supplies genuine church-based piano and organ.The result is magnificent gospel music presented in a serious historical context. Its honest fervor will touch gospel devotees as well as those less familiar with the tradition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading and Disappointing","review":"This is the worst kind of genealogy book ... the kind that lists a lot of names but is really only trying to get you to buy other resources. Be wary of the index of names that is included here in the Amazon sample pages. The surname index includes references to a list of names found in ANOTHER book. Nice trick #!~@#.Another trick: \\"The Complete Returns From the Census of 1659 for County Tipperary\\". Sounds good, right. Well it only lists a count of English / Irish by Parish and Townload. No individual names except for a small sample of English nobility.Most of the other material are just excerpts from well-known sources like John O'Hart's pedigress, etc. Further, there is not even an attempt by the publisher to write a meaningful explanation or introduction about the pieces of information provided.Just a shameful conglomeration of pieces with a misleading name index to try to get web 'hits' and sales for IrishRoots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"FLCL, Furi Kuri, Fooly Cooly, whatever you want to call it, is a huge step forward in Japanese animation.

I am greatly looking forward to the English dub (even though most English dub is really awful), to heard what's happening during the Manga scene in episode 1 (it's brillient, but hard to follow when your attention is distracted watching the subtitles and the action). This Series is amazing, and very fun to watch.ALSO!! Listen to the background music (BGM)!! J-Rock band The Pillows rock hard!! ^_^"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorate anime...","review":"Silly, crazy, exciting. I love FLCL. The story is great, the shows are re-watchable, everything about it is wonderful. My only complaint is that they only manage to put 2 episodes per DVD when they could have easily fit all 6.

This is a show for the ages. rant and rave to all your pals and homeslices. Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"There has to be bad anime to make good anime better","review":"This show is truly awful. There is no plot or theme. It is simply a confusing mix of images, characters, music, styles of animation, perversion, and culture. It is offensive on several levels. Its use of violence is excessive and not the least bit funny. The innuendos are poorly realized and are beaten into the viewer's mind with no real purpose in the episodes. It is supposed to be a comedy, but it lacks the direction or substance to function as one. It is boring and painful to watch. I have watched a lot of anime, and this is by far the worst. I would have to give it one star, because it does not fit into any known genre category. It is a unique creation of its own, but it lacks all of the basic elements for a decent story, and it makes Excel Saga and Tokyo Pig look like classics. As stated before, there has to be bad anime to make the good anime look good. Don't waste your money here."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 star movie, kinda","review":"i've never seen it and judging by the delays i never will. i've had this thing on pre-order since january 12th and i've seen it pushed back more times then the detriot lions on the football field. it's really starting to bother me (and b4 u send ur flames i'm a lions fan)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just weird","review":"If you want your mind blown, fine, you might enjoy this. But personally, I'd like to know there was some manner of thought behind the ridiculousness. There isn't. This is strictly for the pseudo-intellectual.

This isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to see here folks, move along","review":"Less a \\"revolution\\" in anime than \\"more of the same\\". The character designs are fetching, the pallate is nice, but neither is remarkable. The pacing is frantic, like most all silly comedy anime. Characters are thinner than the lines they're drawn with. In typical gainax fashion illinear storytelling, preteen erotica and pretensious psychobabble are par for the course. Comedy? It's not there. Sure there's something slapstick about a boy getting walloped by guitars, but every other joke falls embarassingly flat. Horny older men, a sexually disinterested young male lead, crazy randy chicks, adolescent wish fulfillment... sound like evangelion? Nothing here you havn't already seem in all the Ramnas and Tenchis out there. The hype is a lie. 2 stars for the art, 1 of which is for the vespa."},{"rating":"1","title":"STINKER ALERT!","review":"...BR>The story is, well, there really is no coherent story. Trying to believe there is only impaired what little amusement there was to be found. It was about fifteen seconds of watching the little black cat jump around along the shore of a canal during some pointless dialogue. The rest is best described as an ecclectic collection of \\"Through the Looking Glass\\" style Freudian psycho-sexual imagery that might amuse people who still smoke pot in their parent's basement.Despite the chaotic nature of the series, I found it to be tedious and curiously repetitive after only a few episodes. While being weirded out can be fun, Furi Kuri manages the incredible feat of making it dull.In my opinion, this is a steaming pile to be avoided at all costs, but if you liked \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\", you just might disagree."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLCL Rocks","review":"This is an incredible show, with amazing music, amazing animation, and a very cool storyline once you realize what is going on.Btw, a lot of people here are protesting about the use of Fooly Cooly. I think it is a little weird, but if you watch the animation closely, there is a scene at the end where the word is spelled out (as Fooly Cooly, although i think it actually ends up getting spelled as Fooly Coolly with two L's) that way, so I don't see why everyone thinks Studio Gainax doesn't think this is a good spelling of it.Studio Gainax also explained that they based the title on the words \\"Fool\\" and \\"Cool\\", so this really isn't that incorrect. Why people are so against this is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"When I first saw it, I got addicted. The music and the amination are just super cool.

Just dazed and in awe. It'll seem confusing, but it all makes sense as it unwinds. It's your first kiss and a kick to the [netherparts]. It's brilliance.Oh yeah, an awsome punk-ish/rock band, The Pillows, provides the sountrack, turning you into a fan in an instant."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTF??","review":"I have no idea what FLCL was about, but I think I loved it!!Seriously though, at the beginning you can't help but think, \\"wtf is going on?!?!\\" as horns grow and mecha starts coming out of the main characters head. Being as short as this series is (6 episodes over 3 DVDs), there's not too much explaining regarding backstory or how things came to be. Despite the lack of explanation, this is one of the best animes I've encountered in a while. The animation is very well done and the characters are very likeable.If you're looking for something fast paced with lots of action, but don't mind being confused as well, check this anime out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderus Fun","review":"A fun show with lots of action.Theres no blood(that i'm aware of)and is fun for the whole wacky family.If you loved Spirited Away,you'll love this.Its got some stuff in it that's probally not intended for kids under 10.Its Got some kissing in it but otherwise its abosultly fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"FuriKuri is a gr8 anime!","review":"The first thing i noticed about the series FLCL (aka fooly cooly or furikuri) is that it is very strange. i have watched a lot of anime, but i have ever seen anything quite like FLCL. It is stylish and creative, and is not like anything else.The whole story revolves around a boy named Naota and his life changing with the arrival of a mysterious alien named Haruko. the anime is full of lot of funny people and dialogue, that u will have 2 see 2 believe. The story gets very crazy and almost unbelieveable but is good through the whole 6 episode series.The story's insane plot will keep anyone hooked!The series has a gr8 music by the pillows (check out their cd's-they r good!)

Haruko is crazy, Naota/Takkun is a troubled grade school student, who gets hit by Haruko's Vespa S100(scooter) and robots start coming out of his head. Mamimi - Mamimi is a high school outcast who become Naotas brothers girl freind. His brother went to the US to play baseball. So now Mamimi is becomeing \\"Takkuns\\" girl freind.Basically, I beleive this is a unique anime, with good music, story, and chars. All of this makes up for a great anime.

It's obviously strange and random beyond reason on the surface, but it harbors a surprisingly intricate and, at times, moving story underneath.

Hillarious and uniquely stylized, this anime is perfect for anime fans that like to go \\"huh? what is going on here?.\\" FLCL is certainly not for everybody, it's a very love/hate anime. This show is very wacky, you can see the point where the writers decided to drop the script and take hallucinagentic drugs. Many tiems completely changing animation styles in the middle of a scene (i.e. FLCL suddenly turns into a South Park parody at one point). But it's wackiness is it's best quality, this show had me rolling on the ground laughing (...).

There is very little discussion or recognition of Russia's long history of economic fraility and culture of corruption--rather Cohen would have us believe that all of Russia's miseries can simply be attributed to America's self-righteous crusade to instill market capitalism and democracy.

I would think for $100 dollars it all could have been made a little better, maybe out of Stainless Steel rather then POT metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help!","review":"Without this device I would not have been able to solder a complicated circuit board. I could turn it to any position to make installation easy. I highly recommend the Panavise 350."},{"rating":"2","title":"just a little off kilter...","review":"The PanaVise 350 is a great product. It's solid and yet flexible. It will hold just about any project you want (that wouldn't need a full size vice) without moving around. My only complaint is that with the rubber feet (that you have to stick on your self) on it wobbles a little. For some projects this might be fine, but I'm using it at a soldering station. I'm soldering small wire to even smaller terminals, so it wobbling around was unacceptable. This was Easily fixed though. About 3 min and some 400 grit sand paper and the problem was solved. All in all, I'm glad that I got the vice. All I need now is a set of helping hands (to hold the wire), and I'm good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy Base","review":"I use the PV 350 without screwing it onto the table and I was surprise how stable it is, due it's low center of gravity. The jaws are precisely adjustable so that you can use just the right amount of pressure to hold but not destroy your work object. The tiny trays are helpful indeed. The relative small size allows you to store it easily. I switch often between different extensions witch can be done easily and quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"PanaVise 350 Multi-Purpose Work Center","review":"I'me very happy with my purchase. The base has a good heft to it. It feels very sturdy on the bench when holding my parts for soldering. The little trays around the base are great for holding small screws and such that tend to roll off the bench. I bought thePanaVise 371 Solder Stationto go with the vise and the solder holder is great. The solder just rolls off the little spool. The sponge is worthless. Buy yourself a brass shaving tip cleaner. They work really well. This is a quailty product that I can't ever imagine breaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I purchased three each of this item and not a single one of them worked properly.

Anyways, into the garbage bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product it does not work!!","review":"I recently purchased this product and took it with me to Europe. It did not work at all in 3 different locations. My wife tried using it for her hair dryer and her flat iron, and neither would work. Yes, I knew to use the adapter as well as the plug, and we had it on the highest setting.

Regarding the chorale section at the end: that's psychedelia, baby. That's the real thing. My other favorite track is the gothadelic I'LL DRIVE YOU FROM MY MIND.

I am normally a size 8, and that's what I ordered, but they were way too small. Also, they were so high that I could not walk because I had no room to bend my ankles. The shoes look just like the picture, but they are very small and uncomfortable. They don't make returns very easy, either. I had to purchase a box to send them back in so the shoe box would not be damaged. I wish I could be reimbursed for shipping. They should also include a return label to make shipping back easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep those lyrics classified, son","review":"Classified is not a good rapper. He knows it. On a lot of his tracks, he says stuff like \\"I never had the skill but they knew I had the heart.\\" Well, Classified, you're right- you don't have the skill. What this album does have is some really clean production. If he stuck to making beats for good MCs he would make much better tracks. The song \\"No mistakes\\" is about how he's made mistakes and will probably make more. Ok? Is that it, Class? I'm sorry you smoke everyday and feel guilty, but keep that to yourself and put something good on a beat that nice. I'm giving this 2 stars for the production, which is top-notch at times, but 0 stars for lyrics and delivery.

Fans of the Used and Thursday will love it, and about half of the kids who liked Saetia, but if you're a fan of real hardcore this cd will make your teeth hurt. Too many calculated riffs, too much gloss in the production, and cheesy MTV-style 'emo' backing vocals. Technically, everything's brilliant (except for the vocals; Billy still can't do a decent scream), the musicianship is top-notch. But what's the point if there's no soul?This is the new 'emotional hardcore', I guess: wimpy commercialized dreck that only white-belt hipsters will enjoy. It's about as close to original emo as Saves the Day. Whatever happened to Moss Icon and Antioch Arrow? There's no passion in this music anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work w/ My John Deere","review":"Order this wrench over the winter to be able to service my John Deere lawn tractor. I bought this wrench specifically since it called out John Deere compatibility. But when I went to service my tractor I found it to be way too big for my oil filter. This is new tractor (less than a year old). It would have been nice if they would have listed the diameter range of the wrench in the product description. It is listed on the package after all. I would return the tool, but I would have to pay the shipping per the return policy and it is not worth the shipping cost. I was fooled by the John Deere name-dropping.

I got this as a gift and didn't have to waste my own money on it, but only an extraordinarily clueless woman who has never watched television or read a magazine in her life would benefit. The suggestions are ridiculous (seriously, wear a tiara, call your girlfriends, fingerpaint with your feet) and some even borderline offensive. There's a section about being \\"cosmopolitan\\" that suggests things you can do to be French, Italian, etc. On the French page, one of the suggestions is to \\"skip the shower.\\" On the Spanish one, it is \\"skip the underwear.\\" These women have got to be NUTS.If anyone ever calls me a diva again, so help me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What woman doesn't think she's Diva-fied?","review":"I liked the book. It reminds you that there is nothing wrong taking care of yourself admidst of taking care of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you serious?","review":"This book was a serious waste of time for any woman who has half a brain and half an ounce of self confidence. The authors actually suggest that wearing a tiara, taking luxurious baths, keeping dairies and cleaning out your closet is the key to becoming a \\"Diva,\\" and the key to \\"rediscovering the passion, joy and fun in their lives.\\" I am really amazed at how many women gave this book a good review. I would love to take a poll on the age group of women that read this book. This book was passed on to me from a friend who also thought it was a waste of time to read. My friend and I are both in agreement that there are far better \\"real\\" self help books out there for women than this one. The best part of the book were the illustrations so that is why it gets one star. Ladies, don't waste your time. If you need a self help book buy something written by a doctor or an expert - not four middle aged women who just underwent a mid-life crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's already been done!","review":"This concept has been done, and been done better, by Jill Connor Browne in The Sweet Potato Queen's Book of Love, God Save the Sweet Potato Queens, and The Sweet Potato Queen's Big Cookbook and Financial Planner. Everything about this book from the concept, to the writing style, to the merchandise they are hawking on the webpage is a cheap imitation of SPQ's tiara wearing, survival kit toting, originals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not the pick of the litter","review":"Unlike other reviewers, I like the art in this book--even the mediocre and inaccurate representations of some of the animals. The descriptions of the animals are okay for an encyclopedia, but there are more descriptive encyclopedias available. I haven't sifted through all the information presented in the book, so I can't comment on the quality of the research. To the authors' and editor's credit, the encyclopedia does have some obscure entries that are missing in other encyclopedias. Overall, I like this encyclopedia and do not regret purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids loved it","review":"My daughters really loved this book, and it is so unusual to find them reading anything, that I read it myself. Now I know why they liked it so much. It is a fun story, told with a child's sensibilities, yet it never patronizes them. There is humor and pathos, conflict and resolution, magic and treachery. It reminded me of the Lloyd Alexander books I used to love when I was young. My daughters have recommended it to their friends, and I would recommend it to any young reader (9 to 13, or older) who likes stories where ordinary kids get to do extraordinary things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magic and Witchcraft are anti-Christian","review":"Books like this and Harry Potter not only teach anti-Christian lessons on the occult, but also moral relativism, and desensitize children to the black arts!! The anti-Christian message is thinly veiled in these \\"childrens stories\\" about magic and occultic practices and heavily draws from elements and philosophies behind pagan religions, celtic religions, the religions of the druids, witchcraft, and satanism. What makes this book especially dangerous is that the clever writing and enthralling plot detract from what is otherwise a clearly evil message. My son of 8 was so engrossed in the story that he did not realize the this message about \\"witchcraft\\" was not fantasy, but rather a sinful reality of our world. God is clear in Scripture that any practice of magic is an \\"abomination\\" to him. I am truly disturbed that this was on my son's reccommended reading list."},{"rating":"1","title":"chilton manual","review":"Took over a week to arrive and was disappointing.

I have used them previously in the past and would always find everything I needed in the repair manual. The Full-Size trucks repair manual slightly misses out in quality this time around. I found portions of the manual to lack information on specific identification numbers or references to find them. I purchased Haynes repair manual and have found the matching information that I needed. Both have their downsides, but together they are comprehensive enough to finish practically any job or service that you may need to complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor detail","review":"So general they might as well expanded it to include Fords and Chryslers. Most schematics are small and blurry. I bought it to troubleshoot a horn. Guess they forgot trucks have a horn. There's a reason why the books are sealed in plastic at the parts stores.

It truly brings a tangible feeling to the 'how' we forgive. The author's clear and concise in his writing and description on what forgiveness is/isn't, why we forgive, and detailed in his explanation on what the process is comprised of.Before this book, I had no idea that in order to forgive we had to go through a very systematic process; forgiveness IS a step-by-step process for addressing the underlying issues of our anger and resentments, not just addressing and trying to resolve the anger/resentment itself.I am extremely happy with \\"happening\\" upon this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting Pad","review":"Pad works as described.

It looks like the film maker used a home video camcorder to gather the footage. There was no \\"incontrovertible\\" evidence concerning the existence of or encounters with alien races.Most of the commentary footage was taken at a UFO convention somewhere in the west (California??). The characters the film maker interviewed gave the impression of \\"very strange people\\" and destroyed any credibility the film maker was trying to build. However, to the film's credit I did find the segment on the removal of alien objects from people's bodies mildly interesting. The surgeon interviewed was believable. Unfortunately the credibility of his contribution was destroyed by the questionable characters and footage of the rest of the film.I will most definately sell this DVD at my next yard sale as it is not worthy of a repeat viewing. I would advise you to find another documentary of a higher quality.

But this was definitely not the case with the sensational and quite shocking first novel by the very talented Jackson McCrae. Yes, I'm talking about \\"The Bark of the Dogwood.\\" If you haven't read it, you've really been missing something. I do, however, take issue with the comparisons to other books and other writers. This book is like nothing else I've ever come across. It's first rate, and full of fun, love, horror, and redemption. I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Book!!!!","review":"I loved this book. It is laugh out loud, hold on to your side funny in places & hauntingly sad in other places.

One scene was especially disturbing & I really wish that the author could have left it out. Otherwise a very enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful and over the top","review":"I just finished this book and have a hard time finding why so many people loved it. My book club selected it and we have not yet discussed it. It follows many of the southern dysfunctional family memoir/novels. I enjoyed The Liar's Club, Little Altars Everywhere and Running with Scissors which all have examples of appalling abuse mixed with humor. This has some interesting themes, Helen Keller, for example, but the ending is preposterous and extremely disturbing. It overshadows any enjoyment I had in the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I love novels about the South, and this one started out well. I got the feeling, as I continued to read, that the author wasn't sure that his readers would get the messages (interconnectedness, the legacy of abuse, and others) that he is trying so hard to convey, so he had to beat us over the head with them. The excessive repetition of themes and the poor quality of the editing (\\"This...led [sic] credence to the myth that he subsided [sic] entirely on the stuff...\\" - p. 186 - just one of multiple examples) were so annoying that I started skimming sections instead of reading every word. There was much that I liked, some instances that made me laugh out loud, but overall, not a book that I would recommend with enthusiasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bark of the Dogwood","review":"I am not a professional book reviewer..

I cannot get rid of the image and am furious with the author for creating this horrific visual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just lame.","review":"I agree with others who have said that this book started off very good. Unfortunately, though, it took a quick nose dive and never recovered. The characters were SUPPOSED to be deep, multi-faceted and intriguing, but they fell short, way short. In the end, I hated ALL the characters. I didn't find them sympathetic, nor did I find even one of them to be believable. The coincidences were inane and just served to frustrated me as a reader. It was a long book, but I managed to get through the entire thing, hoping in the end it would be worth it. Unfortunately, this didn't happen. I am truly shocked that so many people enjoyed this book. I guess it goes to show there is audience for almost any book out there. I would put this one on par with \\"Running with Scissors\\", another book I hated.

He can plod along with the most pedestrian shuffle beat but if you listen closely you can hear some other stuff going on in there, as well. This is pure improvisation by Max and Abdullah Ibrahim, recorded in 1977. While the piano is impressive, it's Max that holds this record together. Max is a man of many talents on the drum kit - he will set your car on fire, he will crawl through your window and pleasure your woman while you are sitting on the toilet reading box scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the day job","review":"I read this book because I enjoy O'Toole's superb acting, but it is not an easy read and it doesn't really say much, even though I am familiar with many of the characters. I dislike his rambling writing style which seems to follow that of the late Robin Smith of the Scottish Mountaineering Journal, but with notably less success. Could well have been half the length.I don't recommend it if you expect his writing to be as entertaining as his acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"hit and miss","review":"That O'Toole can write is no surprise to anyone who has seen him act, since--although he is saying others' lines on screen--a pulsing intelligence comes through in his performances. (Brando can't write in SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME, and neither could KATHERINE HEPBURN in her autobiography. As good as they are as actors, they don't suggest eloquence on the screen...despite the quality of the lines they say). But O'Toole is not one of the greatest writers alive. This volume shows that. His writing needs to be more linear. He IS one of the greatest actors alive, however. So I wish he would leave his desk and get in front of a movie camera or on stage instead. I don't believe there is such a thing as a genius actor. But if there is, O'Toole is it (and the only one). There has certainly never been an actor as charismatic (well, maybe Cary Grant. But could Grant have played serious drama as well as light comedy? He never played in a drama that I know of)."},{"rating":"1","title":"impossible to review not recieved yet","review":"One must have the book in hands to review!

This one didn't provide the excitement and angst I was expecting to find with this non PC hero. The hero was in love with the heroine and had planed to marry her from pretty much the beginning of the book, and that sort of killed the fun of the chase for me since I'm not a fan of unrequited love from the hero's pov. Those of you that like that theme might enjoy this book though. The heroine's sister's infatuation with the hero kept the book lively for a while, but the heroine's TSTL personality made it hard to sympathize with her. The hero does cheat if you are concerned about that, but he had not consummated his marriage at the time.

At the end of the chapter, it says, and I quote:\\"The terms used by deaf people to insult or poke fun at the hearing majority cannot compare with the nastiness of the terms the hearing majority has long used against us.\\"That makes it okay, then?Not by me.

This book gives equation and then you must hunt through a sea of words (sometimes not on the same page) to find out what the notation means. Values from graphs are often needed to solve the chapter problems, however the values are not obvious and often you have to guess.

Surprised because I had read weak reviews and passed on seeing this film on the big screen.Were those critics wrong.This was an incredible film on all fronts: the visuals, the quality of the cinematography, the story, itself. It's not merely acoming of age type of story. It's just very good story-telling about a very disturbing time--where so many suffered. With all of the Holocaust films coming out over the past few years (it's practically a genre, by now), it's important to have a story where so many others during WWII suffered, as well, and seemingly without end. I'm still wondering why there has not been a story based on the invasion of Poland--where so many innocent civilians were slaughtered by the Nazis. (Perhaps, there is one or two, I am just not aware of them). Anyway--this was a gorgeous and moving film that went well beyond my expectations.A terrific choice for teens--yes--but also, everyone else, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Winter in Wartime - a great foreign film","review":"This film is in Dutch with some German spoken and with English subtitles. I think it is a very exciting war movie and has several good story lines that made the movie a wonderful experience. It shows Nazis as regular people, and as \\"monsters\\" - just like in any society at any time in history. I hope you try, and enjoy, this movie. I do want to note there isn't a lot of shooting and blowing things up like Saving Private Ryan, but there are scenes of graphic violence you should be aware of.

I am a WWII collector and historian, and the movie was absolutely dull. The character development was non-existant, the action was nowhere to be found, and the story was really boring. I didn't care at all about the subtitles, but the movie wasn't good. The part I really hated was the RAF pilot. His character was bland and very ungrateful. The poor boy lost his father, horse, and uncle as a direct result of helping the pilot. He even lost his sister in the end as she had to run away with her new British man. I don't care if people think it is good, because it isn't. A movie like Letters from Iwo Jima is so much better and well produced than this. Winter in Wartime is a movie I will never recommend to anyone.

The \\"inside\\" information can largely be found on the net and/or in better-written books by screenwriters of prominence. The agent and producer listings are vague and of little help. The book tells you almost nothing about \\"what they want\\" and virtually nothing about \\"how to win them over.\\" All in all, it's poorly written and verbose and could have been cut down to a third of its length. Some of it is shockingly inappropriate, such as recommending to African-American writers where they can get good fried chicken in LA. In sum, it's yet another add-water-and-stir screenwriting book by somebody long on self-aggrandizement and short on Hollywood experience.

Whether he's talking about his childhood (Old Weird Harold, Buck Buck) or adding details left out of the Bible (Noah--my personal favorite), the man is a genius. And he does it without profanity!

A WARRIOR'S BRIDE was a definite mis-step from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Like the Warrior or the Bride 1 1/2 star?","review":"\\"A Warrior's Bride\\" was my seventh book by this author and the seventh in the series of 14 books. This book is my least favorite of all so far. I just couldn't get into these characters. I can't say I like either one of them. I got through it and I would say it was O.K. I have the entire series so I didn't want to stop reading it even though I had thought about doing so. These stories are not racey by any means. I am used to reading Bertrice Smalls books that have very erotic love scenes. I wasn't sure if I would like this series but they are kind of refreshing but they could use a little more charm & sexual romance. One interesting thing is all the books have around the same number of pages? A short quick read. I would not recommend this book if you want to read just the one of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration to get you moving","review":"David Heenan's, Double Lives, profiles 10 individuals who excel in their vocations as well as in their avocations (sometimes more than 1).

I enjoyed the plot and the beautiful country."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nyeh...","review":"I did not enjoy this beastly film. Gielgud has appeared in many wonderful films, and a few terrible ones, and this one I feel falls into the latter category. He plays an unwanted dirty old lech who tricks a tense, unlikable family into taking him along to Italy where he hovers about the windows outside smoking cigars and chortling to himself as their lives go steadily and sadly awry. Most unpleasant. Skip this one, even though it was once shown on PBS' \\"Masterpiece Theatre,\\" and go find yourself a real masterpiece instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had high hopes for this series based on the title, but was deeply disappointed with the story line.

They are easy to take along with you or pack in a lunch box, etc. The flavor is excellent. My favorite pie is cherry, and this takes the place of a piece of cherry pie without consuming the white sugar that would be in a piece of pie.

I have a Swiss, analog watch right now and wanted a nice looking digital watch to alternate wearing with the Swiss. I received the Pulsar for Christmas this year and out of the box the watch felt solid and looked pretty impressive.Unfortunately, after about 15 minutes a row of the digital display went out.The display was too dim for my tastes to begin with.And the kicker...the menu button was flaky as well. It was too difficult to push in while I was wearing it. I had to take the watch off and press pretty hard to get the menu to appear.A previous reviewer said they \\"wanted to like\\" the watch. I feel the same way. But I must combine the need for functionality w/the desire for handsome gadgetry.This watch is heading back to the manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Nintendo Wii, Quit working in 6 weeks!","review":"The product I received did NOT have the words Nintendo or Wii on it like the original or like the one I just received to replace it.

I hadn't turned on my Wii for awhile at this point so I thought something was damaged with the system or component cables, but switching back to the other A/C adapter fixed all of the issues.Long story short, DON'T BUY this and expect it to work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Official","review":"This piece of equipment does work with my Wii, but it is NOT an official Nintendo Wii AC charger. NO WHERE does it say Nintendo on it, and I'm hoping it lasts awhile because it seems lighter than my original Nintendo AC charger. The only reason I had to buy a new one in the first place is because the one that came with my Wii died unexpectantly. So hopefully this unofficial one goes the distance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work properly","review":"I needed a new adapter because the one that came with our Wii isn't working--sometimes there is no red light even though it is plugged in. We have to unplug it and then plug it back in to get it to work. I tried this new one, which *isn't* official, and it made the picture fuzzy. I then went back to the old one, and interestingly, it has worked ever since. Go figure. Anyway, I took too long to return it, and I'm still waiting to hear back from the company to see if they will take it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage! Don't Buy!!!!!","review":"This is NOT an official adapter. Should have known for the price. I too got static lines through the display as many others mentioned. From searching around online, this may only be an issue if you have a large LCD or plasma. Nintendo offers official one's on their store for only about $20. If you have a large TV like me you may want to just get the real deal. You can roll the dice and try this product like I did, but it sure didn't pay off for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS POWER SUPPLY","review":"I bought 2 of these. When I turned one \\"ON\\" it worked well enough to get the Wii going but when I put in a game disk, the Wii did not recognize it. I tried a lot of other games with the same results.I went as far as calling Nintendo & having them issue a repair slip for a \\"defective disk drive\\".I later tried an original power supply from another system and all the games loaded & worked just fine. So, I tried the second power supply just to find the SAME PROBLEM PLUS \\"SCREEN STATIC\\".These units are cheaply made & are very light compared to the originals.I guess you get what you pay for & now I have to call Nintendo & tell them to cancel the repair order.PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! I threw my money (and both power supplies away)."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP WORTHLESS POWER SUPPLY","review":"This is not a \\"Nintendo Wii Official AC Charger Power Supply\\". It is very deceiving putting \\"official\\" in the title. This is a worthless, cheap, lightweight power supply. Do not be fooled.

I was led astray (as many others) by the \\"Official\\" in the title. This does NOT equate to OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), as this device is a cheap overseas knock-off of the real power supply. You can feel the difference in the weight, which translates to improper shielding and heat-sinks.The new unit did indeed power up my Wii, but causes an electronic pulse (looks like a static bar) through my television that makes it impossible to play any games.Not I've wasted my money, and have to find another vendor, since I can't use this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why not just be truthful about the product in the description.","review":"The listing stated that this item was an 'Official Nintendo Wii' charger. The charger they sent is clearly not. It's half the weight and quality of an original.I don't mind if an item is not an official item, but list it so. Blatant lies in a listing needs to be addressed by Amazon.When contacting the seller multiple times, you get absolutely no response, so I had to open a case against them. Lets see how that goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Nintendo product","review":"I was disappointed to see that this is not an official Nintendo product. The description on Amazon should include the text from the package: \\"This is a Hyperkin(R) product and is not endorsed, manufactured or distributed by Nintendo.\\" This power cord is not UL Listed/Certified. There are so many similar listings for Wii Power Adapters on Amazon it is very confusing, but to claim this is a 'Nintendo Wii Official' product should not be allowed. I am still trying to get a Nintendo-endorsed product from this company, which responded to me saying they don't offer a real Nintendo adapter, but has a different Amazon listing (Nintendo-RVL-002-Wii-AC-Power-Adapter/dp/B0033QISHU/) for a Wii Power adapter that includes the claim \\"This adapter is original and of Nintendo Brand.\\" Seems pretty close to false advertising to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"SWEEP THIS ALBUM UNDER THE RUG!","review":"Alanis has done what, three albums to date. Jagged Little Pill is flawless, Super Infaturation was just a disaster (sophomore jinx) and now we have Under Rug Swept. Well, the album is mediocre. Too much language/lyrics in her songs, its good that she is writing some of her own songs, but still....Alanis has a long way to go. She has changed, maturely, but the lyrical content has got to go. For the customers that are skeptical about buying this album, I would reconsider before spilling out 17 bucks for this mediocre album....Nothing new here. I would suggest buying Natalie Merchant's Motherland or Indigo Girl's new album --- those are masterpieces compared to this album.1.5 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money!","review":"This is a lousy CD,lyrics that try to be intelligent but only succeed at tiring the listener with cynical cliches and annoying vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"What is the appeal of this?

I was a bog Alanis fan but her last 2 albums have been one worse then the other. It is the same whinning Alanis and complaining with all this time off you would have thought she would have matured as a artist. The title says it all Sweep it under the rug and keep it there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis extraordinaire","review":"Alanis continues to surprise me.Hey voice and lyrics are a breeze of fresh air in today's world of violent and sexist songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jagged again, finally","review":"Finally, Alanis has come back to good music; she always brings intriguing, poignant lyrics, but Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie's music just stunk. This album is great - good rock sounds, smooth flowing ballads, Alanis Morissette at her very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"I guessss.","review":"I don't know what to think about this album. We're so used to her having a meaning behind every album, but this album's different. It's like she said, \\"Uh gee, I feel like making another album.\\" I guess that's why this album feels so commercial and that there was no effort behind it. If you don't get that impression from the songs, the album cover and booklet should unquestionably say so. But so far, \\"I guessss\\" it's pretty good...for Alanis fans, that is."},{"rating":"1","title":"i guess i was a little too hyped","review":"I was looking forward to this album for a long time. Ever since it was announced in the summer, i believe. She had promised she would return to the sounds of Jagged Little Pill, so i expected some angst. And while i'm glad that she's happy, i just cant see her in that same light. She's simply better at making angry songs. And this CD sounds very happy, and a little more poppy than her other albums. I dont know if its just me, but all bands seem to be getting more poppy on later releases. THis includes No Doubt, the Cranberries, and many others... There are few that would even be indecisable enough to get played on the radio, and the first song is the hardest song on the album which is quite disappointing. I hope you are happy alanis in the path you have chosen to quick fame and a quick comeback by creating radio friendly songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature","review":"Definately a wonderful Junior effort from her! I loved the first CD (as a college woman, it was hard not to!) and wasn't a fan of the second one, really. But this CD is not only singable, but at times touching, from start to finish. Even my boyfriend likes it - a feat for an Alanis CD :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful mess","review":"It's Morrisett’s hesitancy to bend to the conventional, melodic lyrical arrangements that makes her refreshing. She challenges the norm, by pushing in way too many words than the common songwriter would allow herself. Truly brilliant!It's her gorgeous stream of conscious writing that got me hooked, especially on Jagged Little Pill, on tracks like \\"Not the Doctor\\" (I don't want to be your food/ or the light/ from the fridge/ on your face at midnight) and \\"All I really want�?(My sweater’s on backwards and inside out/ and you say/ how appropriate). They're simple, everyday, and straightforward, without being precious. And her delivery allows it all to be a weird, disjointed lyrical delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it just me?","review":"I've never been a huge fan, but the last single from this album just sounds like a big Ani Difranco rip-off to me. For the people out there saying they've never liked Alanis, but like this album....do yourself a favor and buy any one of Difranco's albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"another great album from alanis","review":"the only thing i was disappointed w/ is that your computer will only read the enhanced-cd section. the album tracks are only playable in a stereo or cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"On her first album, Alanis' limited vocal range was offset, and overcome, by her bursts of ferocious, angry energy, most famously displayed on \\"You Oughta Know\\". On this album that energy is tamed, and her vocal range pared down to a practical monotone. The result, there's not a memorable melody on the whole album. Don't expect any flashes of instrumental brilliance from her band either, there aren't any. As far as the lyrics go, well, on the first song we're greeted with the Earth shattering bombshell that Alanis really prefers a man who is athletic, smart, and witty. Wow. Finally, what the world really needed: a song with all the daring and originality displayed in those desperate singles ads that read: \\"I really like sunsets and long walks on the beach.\\" The rest are no better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Ordianary","review":"Alanis Morissette is Arguably one of the Most Over-Hyped Acts over the Past Decade easily.when She first Arrived in Her Post Disco/Pop Era She seemed like something different.\\"You Outta Know\\" was a catchy but in your face song.since then with&without Glenn Ballard She has came close to that Intensity&Almost matched it with various songs but this Album shows Why She still hasn't Surpased those Heights.She matches the Production but the songs themselves seem to Formula Driven to me.they are missing Drive&Depth.Vocally&Lyrically not much has changed.She can take a few years off if She keeps the Formula going.it's cool She has Label Mate or I should I Say Former Label Mate MeShall'Nede'ocello on it.it's cool to see Her still doing Her thing but this Album is another Easy Cash in overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM IS GREAT!","review":"I heard the songs, before I got the album, and I just wanna say, I like this better than JLP, SFIJ, and Unplugged. Her songs on this album match the music of JLP, but her lyrics have much more meaning. Frankly, I thought JLP was way overplayed to the point of getting really sick of it, but this album offers a fresh new perspective of her life and relationships. She's not angry as in JLP, but she's not in her Indian phase or at peace with her past as well. It's more of a story of an abusive relationship to inner peace within herself, concerning her self-esteem. I would highly recommend any Alanis fan to purchase this album. Heck, I'd recommend it to the non-fans as well. There's a lot of insight into her life and I find I can relate to this a lot, especially \\"That Particular Time\\" and \\"Precious Illusions.\\"If you've ever had any meaningful relationship in your life, whether it's negative or positive, buy this album. I don't think you'll regret it. I don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth it","review":"This is a great album. You can play it out until your tired of hearing it and still go back to it a month later and play it out again.

I think she once again improves herself vocally and lyrically. \\"That Particular Time\\", \\"Hands Clean\\", \\"Narcissus\\", \\"Precious Illusions\\".... it is a well rounded album with many good tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"I reccomend Under Rug Swept! It is hard to find a female singer that can actully sing. This album is a mixture of pop and soft rock!

As a result the music suffers. this is stillted and boring. Not that people need drugs to be creative, but some people, like alaanias do. skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Guess i didn't learn my lesson with her previous album. I have this time. \\"Hands clean\\"...great song, The rest, babble set to music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Garbage!!!","review":"Well well.. What have we here? Another timeless gem from Alanis. Am I being sarcastic? You bet I am. If Alanis Morissette is the future of music than it's about time for the apocalypse. This release has AM in her usual form... Lyrically going nowhere, musically going nowhere. The only thing this piece of plastic is good for is a coaster or a chew toy for my dog. With lyrics like \\"someday I might marry you if you watch your weight and you keep your nice body\\" we get a sense of the true artistic genius that is Alanis Morissette. Am I being sarcastic? You bet. This CD is a waste of time and money and its a crying shame that this so called musician (who can't sing or play the harmonica to save her life) is getting so much attention when there are truly talented female artists in the world who are overlooked. Alanis go away!! This music along with her other releases is pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, by Chloe F.","review":"This is so boring. All Alanis ever does is whine and complain about her betraying boyfriend and how his girlfriend will make a really excellent mother. I owned this for a minimum 4 1/2 years and I didn't really listen to it. And what's up with Alanis being obsessed with being a man now and being a man?! Is she transgendered or something?!Alanis is a sick, whiney, bitchy freak. Do not buy this CD. You will regret it and it will haunt you the rest of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"Alanis Morissette has one of the most irratating singing voices I have EVER heard. I would literally kill myself if I ever forced to listen to her music for an hour straight. If you want to listen to some annoying chick yodel, buy this piece of crap people call music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lower if I could for technical reasons.","review":"The music on the album itself is not bad. Not good, either. I found it to be mediocre. I would give the music itself about 3 stars.My primary issue is with the CD itself. The CD has been written in such a way so as to prevent it from being read in a CD-ROM drive. Ostensibly, this is to prevent piracy. However, this assumes that I was going to pirate the music and prevents me from playing the CD (which I paid for) on my computer at work (which I have the legal right to do so). I resent the presumption that I am going to be a thief ? either in stealing music from someone else or in aiding and abetting someone else in stealing music from me.I will not purchase any CD that is produced is this manner; I will not purchase any more music from this studio."},{"rating":"2","title":"More accessable than her last CD.","review":"Just bought a copy of the new Alanis CD. Wow. The lyrics are mostly about relationships, but heh, so what, we can all relate to some of the words. This CD is more accessable than \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\" and has tunes, like her first CD, that you can remember and sing to yourself afterwards. Favourite songs, \\"Flinch\\", \\"So Unsexy\\" and the 1st single of the album \\"Hands Clean\\". Welcome back Alanis the wait has been worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Still Got It!","review":"Upon first listen, I have to admit that I thought it was a little too \\"radio.\\" But after a few more, it really grew on me. Please ignore the critics and reviewers who say \\"... as with her previous two albums, Under Rug Swept is marred by unabridged stream-of-consciousness lyrics. Her awkward syntax and distorted phrasing disorients music that's melodious and compelling.\\" Aaargh!!! To me, that is one of the most appealing aspects of Alanis and her music! In times when almost any other female vocalist's tunes can be mistaken for \\"The Theme from Titanic\\", this CD is a refreshing and much welcomed change of pace! Musically, there's not much happening. It's really the phrashing and the lyrical content that make URS a must-own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I was so disappointed by this cd. I loved her first one and played it all the time. The second one wasn't as good but I still liked it. This third cd has gone down another big notch. I'm kinda tired of hearing her whine about her failed relationships. The songs all basically sound the same. Nothing really catchy at all. The cd is also really short but after listening to it that turned into a plus. If you really have to have this cd just because it's her (like I had to) I would buy it used. I guarantee there will be a lot of used ones to buy. As a matter of fact you can buy mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the music?","review":"I was so excited to run out and get Ms. A's latest. I loved her \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", her live album AND the last one \\"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie\\".Where are the driving instrumentals? The lyrics and emotion that many of us have come to love AND that many of us could relate to...??I found her latest was discordant, disjointed and displeasing. This is just a stream of conciousness totally self absorbed babble-fest. Maybe I am obtuse, but I just don't get it Alanis. To be fair, a couple of the cuts were OK. But the rest? See above.I would really think twice before I made this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This CD","review":"I love the music on this CD so much especially Precious Illusions and even though it is softer than some of her previous work, it still carrys her message beautifully, I think."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Album!!!","review":"I would recommend Under Rug Swept to any Alanis fan. This is some of her best work and the CD is definitely worth every penny! I listen to it over and over again. It is less serious than some of her earlier albums (Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie or Jagged Little Pill) but still has that Alanis edge. So go and buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alanis; Matured","review":"This CD is entirely compelling. Alanis' lyrics are incredibly mature and meaningful. I can't stop listening to it.

I loved the cd. I'm a huge Alanis fan and she never disappoints. On this cd, her brilliance and talent are out in force. Real die hard fans will love it. And the ones that made her a star, should listen to it also.,but if they only prefer her \\"mad\\".,then that says a lot about them, doesn't it? Alanis is a gifted artist. I wish more people would recognize that. I'm glad she's in this world and that she's brave enough to share of herself with us, her fans. Alanis, you rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to basics","review":"I was sort of reluctant to buy this one after listening to the stream of pop/rock albums being minted out by the music industry. One good song. All songs sound the same. Songs sound like some old tune. Nothing fresh, but then I was glad once I bought this album, as it is original (so alanis).In simple words, if you liked the first album for it's sound and content, you will not want to miss this one. I loved her first album. I bought this on the date of release, and it has been played more than a couple of times each day since then. For times on repeat. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take Away This Woman's Prozac!","review":"Even \\"Supposed Former...\\" had more of an edge on it than this. Gone is the rage. Gone is the energy. Gone is my interest.Only the title track even comes close, and that's a distant close, to Jagged-Little-Pill-worthy. Alanis seems to have reinvented herself as cut-rate Enya.Alanis, if you're out there, go out, have a bad relationship, start a bar fight with Ani Difranco - get [mad].The brilliant woman who gave us Jagged Little Pill is in there. Let her out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Much More Pronouncable Alanis","review":"Just like Alanis's lyrics, her album titles get bogged down with her verbose prose. Her first album had a 3 word title, her second had an extremely long title, and her third is back to 3 words. Yes, she babbles a train of consciousness for lyrics but she has an ear for music. The tunes are catchy without being \\"pop-y.\\" Overall this is a good album. It's not \\"out of this world\\" but as long as Alanis is \\"angry\\" I suspect we'll get some great tunes out of the girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Rug Swept Consolidates Alanis Superstardom","review":"Yes, everybody saying this is no Jagged, but come on how often does such an album grace our paths. Under Rug Swept, Alanis' third LP has wonderful music, the tunes for \\"Hands Clean,\\" \\"Surrendering,\\" \\"Utopia,\\" and \\"So Unsexy\\" are intoxicating. And whether the lyrics may not be the easiest stuff to comprehend they hold a sense of uniqueness only Alanis can concoct. Less introspective than SFIJ but more musically pleasing, Under Rug Swept is a MUST MUST BUY - it is just too good to pass. While the world waste its money on the likes of Celine Dion, Brandy, Enya, and Linkin Park I suggest that you try an album that makes you think and have a good time doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swept me off my feet!","review":"Under Rug Swept is a truly emotional and in-depth album that most 20-something women will be able to relate to! The lyrics and wonderful melodies of the song \\"That Particular Time\\" make the album worth every penny. I felt as if that song was reaching into my very core and pulling at my heart. I love how the line \\"At that particular time love encouraged me to leave. At that particular moment I knew staying with you meant deserting me. That particular month was harder than you'd believe but I still left. At that particular time.\\" shows women that when they begin to lose themselves in someone it's time to leave and that it can be done. I could very much relate to \\"Flinch\\" and \\"Unsexy\\". Get the album, it's worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She should of stuck with Glen Ballard","review":"Her previous 2 albums with producer Ballard were much more unique and raw. This being the first time she's writing the guitar work, it sounds similar to a garage band, but I can tell she has learned alot from her work with Glen. And I would prefer not to have a musical diary of her every relationship and trama. This albums songs could no way be as fun to see in concert, but I may be surprized. This sounds alot like her work on the Canadian albums. But Alanis rocks! I saw 6 times on her last tour and hope to see more this time around. Rock on Alanis & Nick Lashley!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Alanis Morissette album","review":"Another good album by Alanis. Her lyrics are always original and her voice distinctive. Definitely worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best cds of the year!","review":"the third studio recording of Alanis Morissette is completely up-to-standards... there are 11 new songs, ranging from the upbeat, catchy \\"21 things i want in a lover\\" to the soulful \\"That Particular Time\\". With such radio-friendly songs as \\"hands clean\\", \\"precious illusions\\", and \\"narcissus\\", it will keep yer ears entertained 'til the next release (this christmas!). keep up the good work alanis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The right balance","review":"\\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was the perfect portrait of anger towards the world. \\"Junkie\\" turned out to be an inner journey where Alanis was the one to blame for everything. \\"Rug\\" has the right balance: Yes, she is messy, but those narcisus/lazy/mature males have part of the blame. A great reinvention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Jagged Little Pill...","review":"...although that fact, has, I'm sure, been mentioned so often about this CD that it's become completely meaningless. There are a few standout tracks on the album - the overplayed but still enjoyable \\"Hands Clean\\", the wonderful \\"Precious Illusions\\" and \\"Utopia\\" (a song which takes several listenings before learning to love). The rest are good, but not brilliant. The sort of CD which will have you skipping over half the tracks, but replaying the aforementioned ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"an American in Paris","review":"I'm a big fan of morissette but I have to admit I'm fairly disappointed with this album after such a long wait. Especially since I found the 3 unreleased songs on the unplugged album so good. I thought it would be a taste of things to come; not so. I only like about 4 of the songs on this album and I find, along with other reviewers, that her lyrics are stale and uninteresting. I think she has enormous talent but I think she needs to go in a different direction next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE STILL HAS SOME FIRE IN HER STYLE","review":"I'm glad to hear that Alanis did away with the dark,gloomy sounding music that plagued a lot of songs on Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie.

The whole thing is not as great as Jagged Little Pill,but still a really good,solid album...check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Brilliant!!!","review":"What can I say, BRILL BRILL BRILL! Ok so there are a few tracks that I skip (7 & 8) but part from that it rocks!!

UNDER RUG SWEPT is Alanis' best work in my opinion. It contains from thoughtful songs as FLINCH or THAT PARTICULAR TIME to rock jewells as A MAN, SO UNSEXY and more!!! Please believe me, You won't regret buying this album... and this comes from a non-fan source, so you know what i am talking about. My personal favourites are SO UNSEXY, PRECIOUS ILLUSIONS, FLINCH, THAT PARTICULAR TIME and SURRENDERING.And of course it contains also Alanis hit HANDS CLEAN!This albums follows an only style which I adore, and so I must admit, the wait was worthy!!!!!!!!!!Go and getcha'!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"These little rejections; how they disappear quickly\\"","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Alanis (well, at least I wasn't). When I first heard Alanis's new single \\"hands clean,\\" I decided I'd give this CD a chance. I own her first CD, \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" and I love it. I had heard not-so-good things from her sophomore effort \\"supposed former infatuation junkie,\\" and decided not to buy it (I'm definitely considering it now). \\"Under Rug Swept\\" is a *great* album. \\"Hands clean\\" is a great song, but some of the other songs are much, much better.All her songs have great melodies and as usual, eccentric lyrics. When you insert this CD into your computer, you will have access to a \\"secret\\" website with some unreleased songs and other tiny benefits.I can assure you that this is one CD you will not want to stop listening to.Highlights:*21 things I want in a lover*narcissus*hands clean*so unsexy*precious illusions*utopia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yeah","review":"First the obligatory statement, \\"This CD rocks!\\"What a great disk. From the test yourself Id initiated \\"21 Things\\" track to the introspective \\"So Unsexy\\" to the exonerating \\"A Man\\", every one of them falls into the category of very good to just plain great.Alanis has an incredible knack for producing really unique and highly listenable music. If you owned Jagged Little Pill, and found that the best songs were the ones not played on the radio, you to will find this CD to be a gem. The music is just as edgy and full and in your face. The driving guitars and thought provoking lyrics remind you that Alanis seems to be ready to take on the world.But she has grown up some as well. No longer the angry you woman, us guy types can even find a song sympathetic to our ears. In \\"A Man\\" we are told we have taken and given a lot of garbage, but we have tried to better ourselves, and we have suceeded.Now I must go steal the CD back from my wife who is being quite stingy about sharing it with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first alanis album...","review":"And i love it! It's really great. i've always liked alanis (especially with \\"ironic\\") but i never cared enough to buy any of her albums... but, i was in the store today, and i thought to myself: \\"well, hands clean is tight, and alanis is fine, so... let's give her chance...\\" and i bought it, wow, i'm glad i gave her that chance! Now, old fans will probably buy this album in no time, and new fans like me, buy this album! it's really great!!!All the 11 tracks here are great and all of them can be honored as \\"singles\\" and the best is... ah, they're all great!And, it's an enhanced c.d with a link to a secret website with many cool stuff! (a new song too!)Buy Buy Buy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alanis is still blah","review":"Jagged Little Pill was great, but since then Alanis has just churned out three albums with nothing new to offer, little inspiration, and lyrics that aren't particularly poetic or interesting and overwhelm her music with their sheer bulk. This album is one of those three."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under Rug Swept","review":"Some will say that Alannis is caught up in the fervor of lyrics and will sentence the fullness of \\"song\\" in this magnificent album to the gallows. But when put to test, the full force, words and music, of Flinch and Hands Clean as well as others on this album have to cause one to demand a re-run. Flinch has to be one of the finest songs of the period: pulsing with energy, caustic yet soothing; this song itself has to be the gem that completes the transition from Jagged Pill's subway high school diva to Central Park grown-up lover. I liken Under Rug Swept to the great album Four by Blues Travelor. Both of these become richer and more relevant as each playback completes. Listen to Alannis and to John Topper, they truly know the glory and tradegy of love in the modern world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great","review":"I picked this CD up along with the new CD. I am glad I did because this is a really great CD I had been missing out on all of these years. Alanis' CD's may not have more than 12 tracks often but the songs on the CD are quality tracks. My favorite tracks are \\"Narcissus,\\" \\"Precious Illusions,\\" and \\"Hands Clean.\\" I am surprised that Alanis didnt' get more critical acclaim and award recognition for this CD because its great and the production is awesome. The track for \\"Narcissus\\" bumps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell yeah, Alanis!","review":"Having been a hardcore Alanis fan for a few years now, I was very excited to purchase URS. JLP is possibly my most favourite album ever - it has helped me through so many things in life. In comparison, URS is nowhere near as raw, rocky and revealing, but still classifies as a damned great album. Stand out tracks include \\"21 Things\\", where Alanis lives up to her 'Queen of Angst' title, \\"Hands Clean\\", which is a beautiful song, and \\"So Unsexy\\" - an incredibly touching song with such true lyrics. Personally, I find Alanis' lyrics amazing and I really connect to her pain.URS sure doesn't compare to JLP, but it's a hell of a good attempt. Definitely go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alanis \\"Under Rug Swept\\"","review":"I used to like Alanis Morissette when I was younger (at the time \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" was released) but now her music just don't tells me nothing, both lyrical and musically. This last album only came to prove that. The songs are all similar in tone and rhythm, even Alanis voice arrangements starts to annoy the listener. When you reach track 5 you just can't stand no more of her kind of \\"instrumentalized\\" strident and boring voice. Sincerely, I am not anymore an Alanis Morissette music fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNDER RUG SWEPT...good idea","review":"The best thing about this album is the cover! More useless songwriter babble from the most self-involved, self-indulgent performer on the planet. Alanis....take your money and retire. You take up space that some true artist rightfully should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"well I gave it a chance","review":"under rug swept was given positive feedback upon it's release and I was enjoying the song hands clean so I decided to check out the rest of the CD. Although alanis is a talented singer and songwriter I just wasn't feeling this CD although I give it to her for trying to be more musically diverse. It sounded too much like sugary pop to me I couldn't get into the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is when Alani's music started to get bad","review":"Even the first time I listened to this album I was hardly impressed. \\"You Owe Me Nothing\\" is the only song that sounded somewhat origonal and interesting. As for the rest of the album, it's either too pop, or too dull.Amazing, though, how the music videos, that were made to promote Under Rug Swept, were still original. Whereas with the release of Alanis's newest cd So Called Chaos, the videos are cheesey (judging by Alanis's music video for Everything)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shes not angry anymore...but still can't sing","review":"Bought this cd for my wife. Who admits that she fell in love with alanis after Jagged little pill (mainly due to the 'you oughta know' song).Alanis is a mediocre singer at best, nowhere near the voice of talented canadian singers like Diana Krall or Celine Dion. There are no songs on this cd which I would call a hit, no catchy melodies or memorable music. At least here two previous cds had at least 2 catchy tunes each, this one has none....Alanis seems to have attached like gangrene to the plight of angry women who have been hurt by cruel men. And those women are loyal and do not care if they can not sing along without a thesaurus. Therefore it is irrelevant what I write about this cd...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful 4th Album From Alanis","review":"Alanis Morissette's \\"Under Rug Swept\\" seems to have 3 parts to me. The first part, from \\"21 Things...\\" to \\"Flinch\\" is great. These first four songs are the best on the album, especially her single \\"Hands Clean\\". The second part, from \\"So Unsexy\\" to \\"A Man\\" are...pretty bad, actually. The sappy ballad \\"That Particular Time\\" does not seem like Alanis material. The last part, which is the last 3 songs, ends the album on the uptake. The song \\"You Owe Me Nothing In Return\\" sounds like an Alanis song, with its sarcasm-sweet lyrics and thumping, angry base line (courtesy of Me'shell Ndegeocello). The last song, \\"Utopia\\", (possibly written after September 11th)ends the album on a sweeter note. I don't think she will ever be able to top \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", but this one comes real close. Kudos to Alanis for a great 4th album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My review of Under Rug Swept","review":"This is a very good CD. Alanis sounds great on most of these tracks. I almost forgot the lyrics when listening to it at first. The first single Hands Clean sounds really good. It is a song about the violation of a minor. Hands Clean is also about trying to get on with one's life after that. I loved the song 21 things I want in a Lover. It is a very brash and honest tune that reminds me of the song You Oughta Know. It makes me rethink of the qualities I seek in a lover. So Unsexy is a great ballad about how we can allow a person to make us feel so unsexy and insignificant. At that particular time is a good song about the different stages in a relationship. It is a song that reminds us that we need to take time out to evaluate the direction of our relationships. Under Rug Swept is the best CD of 2002 so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again, Interesting","review":"Alanis further explores her sentance lyrics on this album. She incorporates the electronic and rock together here, to create sort of a warm fuzzy of an album. She's not as...fantastical on this album. She's very direct, and while she's not angry, she's very cynical/sarcastic.\\"Narcissus\\" is a great example of that direction. She chides people for being so self-absorbed that they don't realize how crap their lives are.\\"Hands Clean\\" is a VERY good song concerning an underaged relationship. She tackles the subject with grace, and the music is compelling.Unfortunately, I don't remember a lot of this album. Those two songs alone deserve a 5 star rating, but the forgettability of the rest of the album drags it down to 4 stars.Respectable. Pick this one up. Maybe you'll like it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised!","review":"Though I've read plenty of Stephen King over the years, this was the first audiobook I listened to. I didn't think King would make a very good reader, but he did an excellent job with his three excellent novellas. Truly fun and entertaining stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I have read everything Stephen King has written and have always looked forward to what is going to be coming out next. I purchased the audiobook as it was the only way to experience it, even thought I would much prefer a novel. I thought at least it might be neat to hear his voice reading his words. I was so disappointed! The stories were very mediocre for King. I had trouble paying attention to them and I think his style of reading took away from the stories. I hope he has this out of his system! I hope these were old stories he had and decided to finally publish them, I would hate to think this is his latest work and this is what we have to look forward to from now on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It put me to sleep","review":"That's right, friends and neighbors - hearing the King read his own works zonked me right out. These stories may just work on the printed page, or perhaps with somebody else reading them - but certainly not Stephen King. His voice just drones, on and on, ad infinitum (almost ad nauseam) in a monotone that only slightly varies when his characters get a tad emotional.It really pains me to have to say this, because I've loved everything King has ever written (except the Dark Tower series, which makes absolutely no sense at all) - but he's a much better writer than a reader. Note that I say \\"reader\\", not \\"speaker\\". I've heard him speak, both off the cuff and in a lecture, and he's much more emotional and emphatic in those modes. Please, Stephen, put these stories out in a book, or get someone else to read them. The blurb on the case that says \\"read by the author\\" is a nice gimmick, but that's all it is - a gimmick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"I recently went camping with some friends and, after reading all of the wonderful reviews of Blood and Smoke, decided to buy it for the trip.

Save your money for The Stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collection","review":"I have bought every thing that has come out by King. I have his work in all forms but I like the CD's.

I didn't even listen to the other tapes--I donated them all to my local library to sell in their bookstore. I thought the story was nothing and King's voice drove me to distraction--he rolls his \\"L's\\" in the back of his throat.Maybe I would've liked the story better in written form. Sorry-can't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blowing smoke...","review":"I'm sorry to say that I really thought that this audio bok was dull and annoying. I have red every one of King's books, enthusiastically waiting between releases for the next title. He is an amazing writer. However, this project was quite the failure. I was irritated by his reading and bored by the contents. I would like my money back. Sorry Stephen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not up to King Standards but still better than the rest","review":"I wanted to quit somoking and thought it would't be a bad idea to quit while listening to Mr King reading these stories.And guess what:The funny thing is that all the main characters gave up somoking a short time ago...(sounds like the author tried to quit himself wihile writing the material) The idea is good, the packaging is funny (the 3 tapes come in a box that looks like a pack of cigarettes) but I was't all too happy with the stories. The end of Srory Nr 1 is pretty good (eeh, eeh..) Story Nr 2 has a wonderful beginning but a lousy ending and Story Nr 3 has a predictable ending. However Mr King is still one of the best storytellers around and a very good reader. This man really knows how to tell a story even if the content is not all that brilliant.That's why he got 5 on this from me. Or to say it very short: This is bloody good stuff, check it out even if there are a few things that one could argue about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! Yuk?

A word of warning though - make sure you listen to '1408' in the daytime, with plenty of light - I didn't, and I was seriously spooked for days after - you can't beat a good ghost story! Keep them coming Stephen - I for one will be eagerly awaiting your next audio book, especially if its read by yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master returns","review":"This, as far as I'm concerned, is the first frightening bit of horror Mr. King has released in quite some time. And it rocks. The first story petered out like ZZ Top song with no substative ending, but beyond that, this collection thumps. I don't scare easily, but the story 1408 had me doing sanity checks for the next two days. I don't know if I'll ever stay in an old hotel again. The exposition leading to the horror is unparalleled. The horror itself NEVER lets you go. The falling action, as it turns out, is just a little more horror, toned down to allow our pulses to normalize. The last story is just a bit of flavor and a good yarn like the first, but unlike the first, it feels more complete. But, my God, the second tale, 1408, must be heard to be believed. Listen to it in the dark, alone, at night, preferably in an old hotel room."},{"rating":"2","title":"commuter listening","review":"Purchased the audio cd for listening to while commuting back and forth to work.....better than being on the cell phone.

Instead I found it a huge disappointment!! I enjoyed much of her first book about Alexander, \\"Lord Of The Two Lands\\", but her latest book is a sorry conclusion to her Alexander story. Her writing style comes across as forced and awkward, and the surprise twist that occurs two/thirds of the way through just made me groan and want to throw the book to the side. (Even though I saw that 'surprise' coming after the first few chapters, I had hoped I would be wrong and it would turn out to be a TRUE surprise, but no such luck!).

Instead I found it a huge disappointment!! I enjoyed much of her first book about Alexander, \\"Lord Of The Two Lands\\", but her latest book is a sorry conclusion to her Alexander story. Her writing style comes across as forced and awkward, and the surprise twist that occurs two/thirds of the way through just made me groan and want to throw the book to the side. (Even though I saw that 'surprise' coming after the first few chapters, I had hoped I would be wrong and it would turn out to be a TRUE surprise, but no such luck!).

The film also represents a time capsule of a Las Vegas that no longer exists, as evidenced by the destruction of the Sands in 1996. Unfortunately, there is little else that remains memorable, except for the famous \\"twist\\" ending and some amusing cameos by Red Skelton, George Raft and Shirley MacLaine. Director Lewis Milestone was better off filming the Rat Pack's \\"Summit\\" performances, which had more energy and spontaneity. For a \\"caper\\" film, \\"Ocean's 11\\" moves at a lethargic pace - bogged down by too many secondary characters and subplots. Amazingly, the heist is not introduced until the halfway mark. In terms of Rat Pack portrayals, Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. come off best, with Frank Sinatra displaying little enthusiasm for the material. A potentially good film was buried in \\"Ocean's 11,\\" which director Steven Soderbergh unearthed with his 2001 remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comes out with seven or eleven on every roll of the dice!","review":"This is the way we want to remember Sinatra and the rest of the Rat Pack.

It stank. No-one (save two of the girls: Angie & Shirley) could be bothered to give a performance, no-one could be bothered to direct. It looked like the laziest piece of filmmaking I've seen since Bridget Jones's Diary. The excuse there was a first time director who was unable to display ANY knowledge of filmmaking; with Ocean's 11 there is no excuse - its director had made All Quiet on the Western Front! It has ONE good shot (and Bridget had at least three - but then give a chimp a typewriter and it might come up with SOME words correctly spelt. ) The good shot?

Nostalgia is a dangerous thing, and while all things Rat Pack are considered the height of retro-cool, Oceans 11 was just a bad movie. Why do you think it has been unavailable for so long? It is just that with all the pr surounding remake they thought they could sneak it in without anyone noticing it. This is not a slur on the cast, as they set out to just have a good time, which is obviously just what they did. However, in having such a good time they forgot a few crucial things.... such as acting, a script, a director, a plot etc etc. Oceans 11 is great idea and in the minds of those that haven't seen in for 20 years it is still cool, but in reality it is painfully unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let 'em scam you","review":"This movie might be preferable to rubbing beach sand in your eyes, but not by much."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL DEAL","review":"If all you're looking for is top drawer entertainment performed by the tops in the business at the top of their form, along with an interesting plot, fine acting, and a wonderful music score, then this is the real deal.

As in much of his writing however, 'Pure Drivel' fails to amuse or provoke anything special. Martin is an intelligent man and I suspect has been producing work below his own standard for much of his career; in this sense 'Drivel' represents a pinnacle of sorts. Take a leaf out of this reader's book by taking all the leaves out of his - try 'The Bounting Man' by Helmut Fickenwirth or Roy Williamson's 'Mr. King'.

In a recent interview on Charlie Rose, Martin said this book is the real him. I think not, and hope not. The comic genius he once was has become anesthetized in this book, and I hope one day to see it reawaken. Fame may have been the worst thing that has happened to Steve Martin.

Today there is only free-market vanilla and North Korea.\\" really made me need a drink. I am consoled by the fact that this book will end . I hope I can stick with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"Lexus\\"; Too little \\"Olive Tree\\"","review":"Something has happened to T. Friedman between writing \\"From Beirut...\\" and writing this book. In the past, he was an amazing journalist, with well-deserved awards. Now, I find something has infected him and I don't mean the internet or globalization. He has lost his independence. Not that this isn't an original book--it is. But it is also an establishment book that could only have been written by someone in the monied, elite class. Nothing wrong with that group except that they can't see from the Under side, so the opposite of Friedman's humanity in the past. He loses the human touch and hobnobs with too many heads of State and Heads of Corporations. Too bad that genius, which he possesses, necessarily goes astray in this society. He's influential to the same degree that he's lost some critical capacity. I recommend reading this book with above words in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The world as america","review":"I think that the book is well worthwhile to read but unfortunately is has to be taken with a huge grain of salt. I think that it is very narrowly focused and as an apology for globalism it is both too americanized and one sided. There is more than one (successful) culture in the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not as good as it could have been","review":"Mr. Friedman presents a good overview of the process of globalization and for people who are trying to get a grasp of what that process is all about I would recommend this book. But I know the process is taking place and I know enough about what is driving it to want more than this book offers. I kept waiting for Mr. Friedman to reach conclusions about where the process is going and was constantly disappointed that none were forthcoming. Mr. Friedman's style is also heavily anecdotal, sometimes to the point of becoming a travelogue, and at points Mr. Friedman lets a certain arent-I-clever tone mar his writing. This book is the McDonald's version of globalization: quick, easy to digest, and nutritious enough to keep you alive to your next meal. Readers looking for a more in depth study should go elsewhere; a good introduction to the subject and little else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting It Straight","review":"Its about time somebody actually explained the major benefits and drawbacks of globalization. Far too often these days people will voice their opinions about globalization without actually knowing what it is exactly. He does not irrationally defend globalization, he admits that people get left behind. Many who disagree with Mr. Friedman's central theses fail to see beyond their overly idealized notions of governance. It is a fantastic read and I could not put it down. His stories are entertaining and important to put globalizing ideas into a perspective that is easier to comprehend quickly. It is a must read if you really want to know what to expect in the future. Although unforseen events have challenged Mr. Friedman's predictions, it in no way discredits them. Brilliant book."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there.","review":"I really dont understand why Thomas Friedman deserves all the accolades for this book. I read a lot of it for an Economics class at school, and then compared it with the Wall Street Journal at the school library. Mr. Friedman's observations, though humorous, do not lend particularly well to the UNDERSTANDING that people should have from the book. Indeed, I would recommend the WSJ to people over Mr. Friedman's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"This is one of the most obvious pieces of pro capitalist, globalization propaganda I've ever read. I am not going to repeat much of what has been said here already but... I'll say... this is not even close to the whole picture. Friedman has a God, and that God is the western capitalist system in which he believes and preaches about. He is able to offer dozens of examples of how globalization is a good thing ignoring the pathetic aspects and consequences of it. He pictures globalization as an inevitable system that came out of nowhere, and for which no one seems to be responsible. But after all... what can you expect of a NY Times journalist? Anti capitalist theories, anti superpower political hegemony theories, anti colonialist theories? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased","review":"I read this book for an International Politics class. This book made me understand the pro-globalization perspective. It was very biased and anyone who does not understand globalization can easilly be persuaded by Mr. Freedman's statements. When I read \\"Globalisation Unmasked\\" By James Petras & Henry Veltmeyer, I got a different and more realistic picture of globalization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Globalization 101","review":"Considering that this book deals basically with economics, it is very accessible. By using anecdotes and drawing from personal interviews with economists and industrialists, Friedman gives a compelling overview of the coming changes in the world economy. He tries to explain why so many counties are afraid of Americanization, but sees it as an inevitable outcome of economic growth.Though he seemed prescient about 9-11, he did not envision the current Enron debacle. In fact, he sees the big, modern corporations as the white knights in the battle for economic leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading for the global economy","review":"Globalization is an extremely difficult subject to manage. This book is an excellent place to start. Friedman's anecdotes provide an easy-to-follow story of how the global economy is forming. It's true that Friedman is a globalization champion, but he does present both sides of a divisive issue. For example, Friedman's \\"McDonald's theory\\" shows how a more interconnected world may reduce the possibility of conflict, but he also shows how globalization can harm the environment and produce \\"fringe\\" people that may cause harm to nations like the United States. Is this the total answer to globalization? Of course not--no one can totally comprehend this subject. However, Friedman does as well as anyone. This book should be required reading in business curricula as a way to begin discussions on globalization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for interesting reading","review":"Obvious, folksy, self-involved, trite rehash of the current received wisdom of the 'global village' and the 'new economy'. A cynical attempt to (a) exploit this current \\"globalisation\\" bandwagon and (b) promote himself as a cool and well travelled guy Friedman. And regularly factually and/or conceptually incorrect. Real chicken-soup analysis. I'm upset with myself for having wasted money on this book. The pity is, when he sticks to journalism (e.g. Beirut-half of \\"From Beirut To Jerusalem\\") Friedman is a fine writer; it is when he tries his hand at commentary and analysis that it all comes horribly unglued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another book on globalization","review":"Hmmm...globalization...now there is a vacuous concept that lots of \\"intelligent\\" people throw around to explain things they're too stupid to think through. Ever notice how no one ever gives us a definition of globalization? Basically, its just the lowering of transaction costs and guess what kids, its been around since the beginning of human history. Leftists find the concept useful to scare people -- \\"Look! The globalization monster is sneaking up on us to lower our standard of living, create massive unemployment and make everybody miserable.\\" (Oh, wait, that's not happening.) What ever happened to the leftist cry of internationalism? This book gets a big \\"DUH!\\" and so does the guy worried about endism (another useful concept). Am I an endist? I like to finish what I started, so I must be (Fukuyama aside)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic and trite","review":"Friedman rehashes cliches about globalization and the impacts of technological change. If you are interested in globalization, read Kaplan and Huntington -- they actually have something to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"An uninspired rehash of writers travels.","review":"This book is an \\"I love me book\\" discussing the author's many travels as a foreign correspondent, couched as an analysis of globalization. His ideas are straightforward at best, and he uses the words \\"I\\" and \\"me\\" at a remarkable rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lexus and The Olive Tree Book Review","review":"What does a Lexus have to do with an Olive Tree? Friedman implies that the Lexus is the human drive to better oneself. Next, he implies that the Olive Tree is where we come from or our origins. Thus, through globalization, one can have their cake and...park their Lexus next to their Olive Tree. Friedman uses terms such as the aforementioned, combined with whit, to define the term globalization. For example, in Part II of the book, he uses the term DOSCapital to explain the government's various levels of control over capital. Friedman starts with DOSCapital 0.0 (communist operating system) and ends with DOSCapital 6.0 (the freest markets operating systems). Friedman's book is easy to read and understand for the average business student with an interest in globalization. Thus, I suggest that if globalization is a term that you wish to gain full knowledge of...read The Lexus and The Olive Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friedman is no Walter Lippmann","review":"Like it or not, Friedman is essentially right about two things: One, globalization is an enormously complex phenomenon. Two, this phenomenon is the axis of postmodern, postindustrial technological and economic theory today (though it's emerging at different rates around the world). Unfortunately that's about as profound as this \\"interpretation\\" becomes. Friedman's sophomore effort has a freshman ring to it. His writing is bracingly oversimplified in many areas (economic theory and culture studies to name two), he uses rather clumsy metaphor and analogy to make points that are largely intuitive, he oozes with bombast and tautology to drive his points home, with his sugar-coated exultations and incessant name-dropping all making for a quick, light read. Charming anecdotal bits, poor analysis, lackluster synthesis. Not a waste of time overall, but far from \\"groundbreaking\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's a Lexus?","review":"The title of the book says it all. The Lexus luxury car is a well-known brand in the U.S. alone. His vision of globalization is a very narrow one because of his lack of exposure to the real world outside the U.S. and of the ivory towers of academia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too many arrogant anecdotes","review":"An interesting book with some good ideas and some that I disagreed with, Friedman gets kind of irritating after a while. He uses so many different anecdotes to get his points across, that they become extremely irritating because it seems as though Friedman is just trying to prove how great he is by knowing so many different kinds of people in so many places. After about 100 pages you really don't want to hear about his orange example in Japan or wherever. He does make some good arguments against anti-globalization which are well worth thought, but overall not really worth reading. The book is just an extended editorial. Read his NYTimes editorials instead and maybe you won't get as annoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth, overlooks history","review":"Friedman's book is very simplistic, views the world through the lens of present economical/political events while ignoring historical trends. Full of now defunct clichés' about the information super highway (internet) and democracy, and rather than seeing our democratic system as unique to the American experience he makes it into a one size fits all. A better book to read is The End of the American Era, which incidentally the author devotes a chapter of the book to Friedman's view of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive","review":"Repetitive, very little substance. Good book to give to someone older who you know feels out of touch with the \\"fast\\" world.....this book isn't so fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This book was required reading for one of my classes. By the end of the class, I couldn't wait to get rid of the book. Friedman rambles on and on about his vacations around the world. I can understand using an example to prove a point, but making up conversations and trying to pass them off as fact is just ridiculous. Now, some of the book was actually thought provoking and interesting. But the rest was completely off the wall. Avoid at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So simplistic...","review":"This book is so disarmingly simplistic, deterministic and so much imbued with american culture that one starts believing this to be intentional. Reality is much more complex than the author wants us to believe and development is not one-way: there are always options, but Friedman does not want to show them to us. Seattle, Jose Bove and the renewed emphasis on the tobin tax are there to prove it. Pretty a useless reading, not in touch with the daily life of 4/5 of the world population."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friedman's new book is pro-corporate propaganda","review":"i would not recommend this book.

On July 5, 1999, at an appearance in Aspen, Colorado, after repeatedly asked to explain why he is against Bulgaria becoming part of NATO, all he could come up was \\"Who gives a #%@* about Bulgaria?\\" - a rather ignorant answer for somebody who claims to be an expert in world affairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discredited by recent events","review":"A lightweight discourse about \\"the vw and the sugarcane\\" -pretentious, pompous, ethnocentric, purely anecdotal, and woefully lacking in even rudimentary knowledge of the basic economics, worldview and culture of many of the regions he writes about. Sounds like a PBS special best left on the cutting room floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Day Dreams from A NY Skyscraper","review":"A starry eyed pep talk on the wonderful new world of the global economy-- free from any real experience of the depradations of the New World Order, Friedman chooses not to visit the maquilladora free trade zones, with their wrenching poverty and human exploitation. What Friedman replaces any critical analysis with is the sophistry, platitudes and blue sky fantasies of the neo liberal order, while every aspects of a democratic economy spins downward in the clutches and predations of his 'free' markets and information economy. See what sustenance an information sandwich or warmth a cyber dwelling has to provide the (increasingly numerous) victims of these ravages. Read Noam Chomsky's 'Profit over People' or Eammon Fingleton's 'In Praise of Hard Industries', to get a touch of reality of what is REALLY happening out there and the type of illusions, well represented in this book, that have to be overcome to fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enlightening.","review":"I think Thomas Friedman really tells us about old news. This may stun some people, but the world is not \\"10 years old\\" as Friedman suggests. Globalization and the global economy has been around since Merchants have existed, which is well over 2000 years. All one needs to do is read a copy of _Nations of Nations_ or any New York Times and he will find that even our great nation, the U.S.A., was and is built upon an explosive export/import sector, from the Magna Carta to E-Commerce. Even Mr. Friedman is profiting from this. Don't buy it sight unseen -- read a little at the library and make an informed decision as to whether you want to spend money on a book that is just a re-print of the nightly news."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lexus and the Olive Tree","review":"The Lexus and the Olive Tree represent an age-old battle between modernization in an increasingly global market and culture in the face of change. Friedman used many stories to explain his beliefs of Globalization and I enjoyed reading how he related all the concepts in a loop (Rational Exuberance - Democratizations - Globalization). As a well-traveled journalist, Friedman presents Globalization from a foreign perspective contrasting traditional US views towards the economy. His comments about the Internet were right in line with most all projections from major statistical sources. The Democratizations of Finance, Technology, and Information are the main components of the engine in the Lexus that make the Lexus accelerate and take it to higher gears or levels of Globalization. Overall, I enjoyed reading the book and I would recommend it to all undergraduate business students interested in evaluating the general direction of global markets."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG!!!","review":"Thomas Friedman supports corporate globalization because he belongs to the top 5% of the world's population that actually benefits from it. The Free Market system has failed in both Russia (capitalism run by the Mafia) and China (capitalism with no political rights)."},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting information leading into political campaign","review":"The book is offering an interesting insight into the current development of globalization, giving the reader various examples. Unfortunately, most of the examples seem to be the authors' thoughts or interview-results that are manipulated by him (at least the style), causing severe damage to the quality of the book as such. Starting from a \\"quasi-analytical\\" perspective, Friedman leads into a political campaign at the end of the book, revealing a biast american point of view and failing to maintain global understanding. One is shocked to hold such a low quality report, written by a man in Friedman's position, meant to be a guideline to globalisation, into one's hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast-paced Perspective on Globalization","review":"Tom Friedman captures the powerful forces that are transforming the world in an anecdote-packed, fast-paced book that highlights the many virtues (and few drawbacks) of the globalization era.

He discusses the phenomenon that is Globalization in a frank and non-pretentious manner. His numerous stories adds a touch of reality to the book as well as just simply making it enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling if you are open to these ideas","review":"This is a collection of stories and anecdotes woven together in ways that may radically change your view of the modern world--if you are open to new ideas. This is not an academic treatise, nothing is quantified, and there may be few individually new ideas here. Its breadth of insights and storytelling is its strength.If you still believe in the Republican Congressional class of 94, you will hate this book (see some reviews here). If you are a traditional liberal, you will be uncomfortable through the first two thirds of this book. There is a wide divergence of opinion among reviewers, but charges of shallowness are hard to understand unless the reader isn't open to these ideas or doesn't like storytelling as a didactic technique.If you don't have time to read the whole book, at least read the article from the Sunday NY Times Magazine March 28, 1999 which is basically excerpts, although less well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lexus and the Olive Tree should be required reading.","review":"This book should be required reading for everyone in the world -- particularly in those nations that just don't \\"get it.\\" Right on, Friedman.

It answers many questions about what \\"globalization\\" is, what's happening today, why it is happening and what people should do to survive the changes. It is important that the book can be read by anyone and does not require any special knowledge on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$","review":"The author jumps happily on the globalization bandwagon. The overall impression is that globalization is inevitable, nicely mirroring the rhetoric of the \\"free trade\\" school of economics. Friedman seems to ignore historical precedents on global economics from Spain, Holland, and England, choosing instead to treat new technologies as \\"world changing\\".I also found the writing style a bit much to swallow. Mr. Friedman holds himself in quite high esteem. The self aggrandizement became nauseating after a couple of chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy","review":"This book is easy to read; the language is simple and anecdotal.The substance itself is what annoys me.

Friedman makes clear why world leaders have less impact on the world today than yesterday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great anecdotes, but otherwise not compelling","review":"I made it about halfway through \\"The Lexus and the Olive Tree\\" before I started skimming for anecdotes. Why? Because Friedman follows the same formula in chapter after chapter. In each, he creates an artificial construct, then attempts to bend world events into his ill-fitted molds. He fails.The first few chapters of this book are quite interesting. Friedman is obviously well-traveled, and has gathered an impressive set of stories with which to illustrate his points. But he soon goes astray, concocting such nonsense as his \\"Golden Straitjacket\\", \\"Electronic Herd\\" and \\"DOScapital\\", battering the reader with them until the book becomes unreadable. Without the gimmicks, I might have read it end-to-end. I'm glad to say I borrowed instead of bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"An overblown selfcongulatory waste of time","review":"Tom Friedman is a thoughtful and insightful writer on many fronts--but not in this book. He offers a \\"blinding glimpse of the obvious\\". But it's no glimpse. It's a torrent of self-indulgent words and more words and more words. This could have been a tight five to seven page essay. But no book. \\"Common, Tom!!\\"--as he would say in his theatrical voice in this book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly timely!","review":"How globalization intersects with tribalism to give power to individuals is one of the timely themes of this book.

It did not paint the picture all peachy and cream about globalization. I remember hearing a term, \\"those who suffered from globalization always know who they are, those who benefited from Globalization does not always know who they are.\\" A lot of the example in the books are quite relevant. The title of the book is a bit off I think, it is a bit puzzling to me. Globalization is inevitable according to Mr. Friedman, I think it is very hard to resist also. Especially when all the information is flowing freely on the net, it is going to get harder for any countries trying to hold on to the old non-competitive way of living."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for those looking ahead, not backwards.","review":"Anyone that rates this book one or two stars is either jealous or doesn't like Thomas Friedman. Three stars indicates the reviewer just doesn't understand. Four/five star reviewers understand and will apply this great work.

Thomas Friedman, with this book, is acknowledging that he himself, before thinking about the topic, was a one-dimensional political reporter. Suddenly he undergoes this conversion, SEES THE LIGHT, and understands that economics is a factor in everyday life?The Truth of the matter is that Mr. Friedman is NOT the expert on Globalization. All one really needs to do, the next time you purchase a sporty watch or walkman or appliance, is take a look at the directions / owner manual. If the manual is written in Russian, Chinese, French and Spanish, then you know the manual was printed in SEVERAL countries. When you see that some parts were made in India, and others in Canada, globalization will make more sense. It's better to look at everyday life versus read fictional dialogue from Thomas Friendman."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"Thomas Friedman has done us all a favor taking on the subject of globalization and attempting to explain it to us. As a whole he did a good job however it did go on at length at times after the subject had been explained.

Oh yeah? I wonder why there is no updated edition of The Lexus And The Olive Tree for 2002.In summary, the book says something like: \\"Globalization is not an option, but a must. If you want to globalize, you need to do it fast because globalization is like 100 meter dash over and over. If you do it fast, you will lose your olive tree (identity). It's not acceptable to lose the olive tree.\\" I cannot make any sense out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.","review":"Dear Readers:This book does not overwhelm one when he reads it. To wit, it doesnt do much. I am amazed how such a poorly written book can have such brisk sales. Just because ONE guy states his view (which, incidentally, has been around for a long time) does not mean that WE should take it as GOSPEL! I loved Friedman's \\"From Beirut to Jerusalem\\" because it was reporting at its best. Mr Friedman fails with his analysis of lexuses and olive trees as the right way to look at things, for what we see, and the only historical CHANGE that we see, is the rise of mass consumerism. That's it.Having bought this book, I would consider it a MISTAKE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic and Biased","review":"Friedman's book is shamefully US-centric for a book on globalization (although it tries very hard not to be).

If you enjoy reading about (INSERT US CORPORATION) amazingly have an office in (INSERT COUNTRY HERE), yet co-existing with (INSERT LOCAL TRADITION/FOOD/ETC.), and enjoy reading it (INSERT LARGE NUMBER) times in the span of one book, then by all means buy this book. Personally, I find Mad Libs more enjoyable than this book is insightful.

I watched Thomas Friedman's interview on Charlie Rose and found him to be an interesting speaker on timely issues related to globalization.When I got the book and started reading it, I got pretty tired of reading the made-up terms he used, eg. electronic herd etc..I found the book to be biased towards the benefits of globalization and dismissing the disadvantages.What I did like about the book was some of the personal anecdotes he relates to the readers, ultimately giving you the feel that you're hearing the story from the man on the ground.I found doomsdayer520's review of this book to be particularly helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extra! Extra!","review":"Friedman spins one contrived anecdote after another in an attempt to illustrate a string of mangled analogies. While the subject of the book is vitally interesting, nuggets of content and glimmers of insight are few and far between. The author draws heavily on gimmicks inappropriate beyond the news column, with a disproportionately high number of paragraphs ending in a quote, a rhetorical question, or a punch line (and on occasion all three). A good intro to the subject, but look elsewhere for serious analysis. Friedman seems to have a sound understanding of the subject matter, however his journalistic flare and heavy-handed story telling obscure much of what he is attempting to convey. Over-written and under-edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"Thomas L. Friedman explains that the old world order of the Cold War has been replaced by a new paradigm of globalization. In this system, finance, information and technology are being democratized. The Lexus automotive brand of the title is the emblem of globalization. The Olive Tree stands for deep local cultural connections. The tension between globalization and cultural identity is the defining conflict of the new era. Friedman excels at making connections among diverse events and is a brilliant storyteller. He is particularly good at translating complex ideas into vivid, clear, colloquial language. His observations seem so simple that it is easy to miss how profound they are. His arguments seem almost irrefutable. He is basically optimistic and chooses not to dwell much on the dangers implicit in this new world. We recommend the book to everybody. Because Friedman draws heavily on his rich store of anecdotes this book is best appreciated in its full length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and outdated post 9-11","review":"This work provides a general understanding of the drivers behind globalization, but Friedman often leaves concepts in mid-air without closure. And for that reason much of the book seems like speculation or 'best guess as to why' Q&A.Friedman's admiration for Enron will make you giggle and the little attention he gives to terrorism as a backlash to globalization weakens the entire work.Perhaps so much has changed since 9/11/01, its outdated that quickly.I would recommend it for high school students as an intro to the topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S GLOBALICIOUS!

Conclusion not supported.","review":"The first 90% of the book consists of a good description of the increasing integration of the world, constraints on governments spending and ways of doing business and increased overall competition. He describes why and how the US is the leader and will likely remain so. Then, with no explanation and no supporting data, he launches into an attack on the Republicans \\"mean spirited\\" attempts to do exactly what he previously called inevitable. This unbelievable conclusion called into question his thought processes for the entire book. I would recommend this book except for the wacky ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, simple, cloying","review":"In addition, to making no serious addition to the thinking on this topic, the author managed to bombard the reader with a series of cliches, anecdotes, and undergraduate theses.

I thought being a newspaper person would have made Friedman concise and to the point, but Friedman spends so much time talking about things that are not directly related to the point that I gave up on this book.

Now it does not appear as path breaking as it was said to be when it first came out. Maybe it's because we are now familiar with most of the things he talks about. There has been no shortage of articles on this subject in the media. Still the book has the advantage that it brings together the various aspects of globalisation in one volume.There are some good 'big ideas' in the beginning of the book. But towards the latter part the narration loses its rigour as Friedman keeps elaborating the same points. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as the book is written for the layman.I got a feeling of deja vu while reading the book. It's very similar to Alvin Toffler's works. In fact it can be considered as the sequel to Toffler's 'future' trilogy (Future Shock, Third Wave, and Power Shift)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting, multifaceted view of world interactions...","review":"Friedman does an excellent job of caputring the differences and similarites between cultures that continue to keep us apart in the face of accellerating globalization. Although I don't agree with all of his points, it's an interesting read. There are some points in the book when I wish he would go into further depth to explain how things will change in the future rather than just explaining the past and present. Overall, a recommended book if you're trying to understand how the world operates as an interlocking system of socio/ethnic/economic forces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly banal endism","review":"This thorouhly predictable and banal endist claptrap will come as a disappointment to those who have enjoyed Friedman's work.

I don't like to critize other authors, being a writer myself. However, the author's penchant for constant self-reference and annoying acronyms made the book unreadable (for me anyway). Plus, much of the material is dated, as the book is filled with references to now defunct (or nearly defunct) Internet companies, which are held up as shining examples of the New Economy.While this book offers some useful insights into global economics, I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free Trade Candy","review":"If you have read Friedman and are feeling like a free trade warrior, you need to read William Greider's One World Ready or Not as an antidote."},{"rating":"2","title":"His focus on Middle East is particularly trenchant","review":"Friedman is particularly trenchant and insightful in those portions of the book that focus on the Middle East, and especially Palestine and its neighbors. But this is understandable. The Middle East has always been his main \\"beat,\\" and his area of special knowledge since student days."},{"rating":"1","title":"One moment please!","review":"The inherent problem with this book is the underlying assumption which multinationals have successfully brainwashed into the Western psyche that 'progress' and a 'better lifestyle' is having all the trappings of western society. But how many of us can honestly say that bigger houses, more toys, etc has actually led to the promises of greater happiness, more time, less stress, etc. An honest reflection on this question might be quite revealing. And having seen the impact of Western commercialism on indigenous peoples, where they move from a subsistence utopia to having to depend on a wage packet, the results are equally instructive. We need to start with these questions. Unfortunately this book doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Journalistic shlock at its worst. No doubt this book has come into the public consciousness because of Mr. Friedman's position, but not due to its merits. On the whole, it's a rather poor effort, as it seems to be lacking serious thought or analysis, and seems merely like an extended newspaper column. If you want to use it to play buzzword bingo, on the other hand, it should prove excellent. If you want a serious book that contains actual analysis, try looking at \\"Future Perfect\\" from Micklethwait and Wooldridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased Book , Inaccurate Thesis","review":"Mr Friedman makes some interesting points about globalization in his book , which I would characterize as biased and one sided. His argument that you are on the globalization train or not is suspect and misleading. Globalization is not in the pocket of some one or is it the posesssion of some country, which Mr Friedman wrongly believes are the western countries. Yes , many countries need to learn a lot from westernize countries to develop themselves, however to charcaterize that such countries who have not yet gotten on the globalization train have nothing to offer or that Globalization cannot leearn some thing from these countries is misleading and inaccurate. Globalization is about bringing about the best in all the countries either is it China or USA, Egypt or Israel, India or Pakistan and each country learning from each other and adopting best practices from each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friedman, Expert on Everything","review":"Yes, of course, Mr. Friedman, you are right. As if your brand of modern life is inherently better than all those ever tried. It is nothing but your own olive tree, your secular god, but you are too smug to admit it. Rather than explaining globalization, Friedman gives nothing but a tired case for the advancement of new an removal of the old -- as if 3 centuries of writers had not done the subject justice (and Hume, Locke and Hayek were far better writers than Friedman). So, unless you are a fawning sycophant who believes the self-appointed expert on everything, Thomas Friedman, you might want to find an original, thought provoking and insightful book to explain globalization. This one surely isn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective on past, present & future of globalization","review":"This is the best book I have read so far on the convergence of financial deregulation, silicon technology and telecommunications, and their overwhelming impact in making the globe a single vast market moving at unprecedented speed. Unlike many authors, Friedman has a solid grounding in recent international history, politics and business from his career as the NY Times Foreign Affairs correspondent. He also sees clearly the implications of new technology and financial systems. Very lucidly written with a fast-paced, comprehensible style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant philosophical construct underlying Pax Americana","review":"Another Pulitzer for certain. Friedman is not trying to teach ceo's of multinationals, he is providing a marvelous structure with which mere mortals can gain better insight into globalization. Required Reading. Anyone who thinks this book is too simplistic doesn't know hopw to write themselves. This book reads extremely well. Mr. Friedman has a remarkable talent for relaying his observations as the #1 foreign reporter in America. We would be less well off absent his contributions. Kudos!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The lexus, the olive tree, and a huge ego","review":"Before reading and listening to the book I thought some of the negative reviews had to be unfair. Then I read and listened to this book, and it was worse than any review had indicated. The opening story about oranges sets the stage. Here is a person so accustomed to luxury and so insulated from the real world, he misses the point himself. Poor communication. and a lack of cultural understanding leads to not getting what you want in the globalized world. His whole thesis is based on being rich and making lots of money. He never mentions going to places like Italy where this is seldom a priority. He judges the \\"olive tree\\" culture harshly. He assumes everyone wants a Lexus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tao Of Translation","review":"Others object that this translation is not pure enough or accurate enough and yet no translation is ever good enough compared to the original language of the author. Its not perfect, but then who is? Its practical and accessable and, and for me, extremely useful. From my point of view, this version captures what other translations only hint at - the day to day use of the Tao in creating a serene life. Namaste."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine translation of some fine thinking","review":"A fine translation. For the new entrant, perhaps seeking that second book to follow the Tao of Pooh, or for an old friend of the Master, Stephen Mitchell's contemporary English translation get's it right. From the comfortably blended gender pronoun usage, to it's succinct but engaging notes, Mitchell's translation carries Lao-tzu's wisdom to 21st century English speakers with grace. The pocket edition is entirely sufficient to the task."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but not very good quallity","review":"The book is great, the cover is great too, just the inside paper is the poor one yellowish cheap paper"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Translation of Lao-tzu and Taoism","review":"Taoism is a very interesting Chinese religion/philosophy. Eastern religion is very different from Western Religion. Rather than focusing on God and mans relationship with God, many of the Eastern Religions are more philosophical and advocate a way of life. This is why many people in East Asia practice elements of all of these religions and in many cases do not even know they are. It is also with this in mind that Buddhism became to popular in China and other parts of Asia. Buddhism unlike Taoism or Confucianism dealt with an afterlife.Well sorry for the lecture, in terms of Taoism I like this translation very much. I found it well presented and very easy to follow. Taoism and the whole idea of the way, Ying and Yang, balance and harmony with nature too me is one of the most interesting of the world's religions. Anyone who would like to read about this philosophy/religion would enjoy this book.It is food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephen Mitchell's translation of this classic is....","review":"very meaningful to me on many levels. I own several copies and use them as personal manual. Much like you would with, \\"The big book\\" or \\"The Bible.\\" Each and everyday I either think of this wonderful translation or I am busy reading sections. I am familar with more traditional translations and much prefer this one. I can relate to it on many levels. I find the western-zen qualities that others critique, appropriate and very useful. I believe every one is both looking and creating the \\"truth\\" in a dialectical sense. This book along with a few others helps me with my struggle to both find that truth and walk the path when it appears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perception shifted","review":"I made a point of reading this just one or two pages at a time, every day or other day, to really digest what I read and not rush through it. That was probably a good thing since it can be a little repetitive, so trying to soak it all up in one sitting could have felt monotonous. But when I reached the end and I closed my copy, I thought \\"everyone ought to read this, and I wish I could 'explain' it or share with others the feeling that it left in me, but.. well.. it would be like 'pointing at the moon.'\\" I'm sure I'm still a poor student, but I did feel a change through reading it-- a sense of real potential for some peace and clarity and flexibility-- and now I'm trying to dwell on that and cultivate it.I highly recommend this if you're searching for an inroad to a deep spirituality unburdened by religious dogmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Good Translation ....","review":"TTC is one of my favorites. Strongly recommend this translation of TTC to those who want to understand Taoism. I found this book the best translation after going through many different versions. This is by far the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warhead?","review":"The word warhead appears in this text. When I read it, I became suspicious of the entire book and the reading became unpleasant as a result. After reading reviews, my worst fear was affirmed: this is not the Tao Te Ching. This is more of a paraphrase of various translation with the author's own language thrown in.I know that the Tao cannot be conveyed through words. It is better to say that the Tao Te Ching describes around it, like hands attempting to contain a ball, concealing it so that it cannot be seen while hinting at its shape and size. The ball is there, but the hands conceal it. Lift the hands and the ball shall be seen! It is not there, but it is. This book is like a pair of hands, but they are dirty. They have been sneezed in. It is impolite to offer one's hand to shake when it has been sneezed in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not wear well","review":"When I first encountered it I liked this version of the Tao Te Ching. As time has gone by I have found it less and less interesting and in some cases actually irritating. Some of it I still enjoy, e.g. his rendition of number 9. But with others, e.g. number 50 it is apparent he has substituted something of his own in place of Lao Tzu's thoughts. This book would be better titled \\"Thoughts of Stephen Mitchell found on looking into Lao Tzu\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a translation of the Tao-te ching","review":"Buy and enjoy this book if you like Stephen Mitchell, but don't fool yourself that it has much to do with Taoism or the original Chinese text.

As many other reviews have stated, he doesn't speak chinese, so this translation is comprised of his reading other peoples' translations and what he thinks it means. He then tries to modernize it and make it accessible to 21st century americans. I like the old world feel of this book, you don't need to change swords to nuclear warheads, I know what a sword is. At least though, this change makes sense, some chapters Mitchell changes so much, that the entire chapter loses its meaning. A couple chapters made no sense, so I went to the back of the book where he tells what parts he changed, and then I was able to understand exactly what Lao Tzu intended to say. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply (the way to live)","review":"Due to it's translation from ancient chinese, the Tao Te Ching can be a somewhat abstract and cryptic book. Having read several different translations, I believe Stephen Mitchell's version to be one of the best, in that it can be better understood more readily. I think it is best to read the Tao several times, though, as the reader will gradually understand more and more, (or less and less, as the original author Lao Tze would say). Simply put, the Tao is a consise work which teaches how to live our lives simply, allowing us to be more accepting and less judgemental, with diminished fear, and greater understanding. A great work."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're new to oriental thought...","review":"This, as any other translation commonly known as Tao Te Ching, is in reality just the book of Tao (Way), the book of Te (emptiness) having never been translated from the Chinese, and known only to advanced practicants of Tao Lung (Way of the Dragon). If you are interested in oriental thought, you may as well pick this translation as an introduction. People that wish to plunge deeper into Taoist thought must learn Chinese and study directly from a Si Fu (instructor) in order to truly understand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible translation","review":"This book is entitled \\"A New English Version\\"; it should say \\"A Terrible English Version\\". This version of the Tao Te Ching is so badly translated it isn't even the Tao Te Ching anymore.On the cover of this book it says \\"Tao Te Ching, by Stephen Mitchell,\\" which is interesting because the Tao Te Ching was written by Lao Tzu, not Stephen Mitchell; why isn't the author of this book given credit on the cover for writing it?Mitchell did not even translate the Tao Te Ching, he basically read it and then re-wrote it in his own words. This book is only his personal interpretation of the Tao Te Ching.

I purchased the book at a suggestion of a friend. The picture of the book on the Amazon website didn't look like the cover of my friend's book, but the description said that it was recently reprinted, so I thought that it just might have a new cover. When it arrived, I noted that the translations seemed very different from the tranlastions I had seen in my friend's book. I just got together with my friend to compare books and it is indeed, not the translation by Stephen Mitchell, as Amazon represents. I am very disappointed.

Just my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tao Te Ching false cover","review":"the book is advertised as a translation by Mitchell but it is not, the translator is Legge.

I was, however, pleasantly surprised with what I read. Mitchell does a fine job bringing the text to a human level. Because of the \\"beginner\\" guideline that he seems to be shooting for, I was surprised and disappointed that he didn't go a bit deeper into the history of the philosophy in the intro. Nevertheless, the content of the book itself moved me to place this edition with some of my favorites, and even prompted me to frequently give the edition as a gift. Highly recommended, especially if you are looking to discover the essence of what Lao Tzu probably had in mind in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sorely misses the mark.","review":"Mitchell has apparently given in to the \\"fast- food Chinese take-out\\" syndrome. I have read scores of translations of the Tao Te Ching, and Mitchell's work does not even deserve to be called a translation.

It is similar to another one I found,The Rhyming Tao Te Ching, and other Oriental wisdom in rhyme: Over 70 ways to easily access peace of mind, wisdom, and awareness. The Tao Te Ching is a very relaxing book, and it sounds better in rhyme, somehow. Lao Tsu rhymed part of the Chinese original."},{"rating":"1","title":"New age garbage","review":"As Stephen Mitchell admits in the introduction, he cannot read Chinese. Instead, he uses translations by other people to construct his own interpretation of the text. When he comes across chapters he doesn't agree with, he simply removes them and writes something totally new. Apparently he thinks some Zen training qualifies him to translate an ancient text, while being completely ignorant of its language or the tradition of Daoism (which is far more than the philosophy of Laozi or Zhuangzi). This book is really just another useless commodity catering to the prejudices and fantasies of the New Age crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable translation","review":"There is no doubt Stephen Mitchell's translation is one of the most beautiful and fluent versions. The problems of this translation, however, lie in the author's view of Tao-te Ching as a religious/spiritual book, and his obvious personal love of Zen. Tao-te ching is not a religious book, it is the basic philosophy of Chinese Taoism. The Taoism philosophy has been deeply inbedded in Chinese minds and culture. It is simply an everyday-live philosophy, and it's meant for every body. This beautifully worded translation unfortunately mystified Tao-te Ching as a spiritual guide, and somehow tranformed it into a book full of Zen concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"the ADD version of the tao","review":"i've read numerous translations of the tao, and this is by far the worst. you should only buy this if you have a supremely short attention span. sure, it's eminently readable, and the words flow nicely, but once you're done, everything will have dissapeared without a trace. call me demanding, but i like a philosophical text to actually make me think. this is just shallow happy-clappy feelgood stuff. for people more serious about it, i recommend red pine's translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly simplistic, lacking in depth","review":"There are much better translations of the Tao Te Ching out there. One gets the sense from reading the Stephen Mitchell translation that it was tailored to sell in the west. I would recommend the Red Pine translation above all any day of the year, as it makes use of all discovered versions of the Tao Te Ching in its translation, and includes commentaries on each verse from scholars of the past 2000 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful botchup","review":"This is not so much a translation of the Tao Te Ching but rather a new-agish interpretation of such. By incorporating input from Buddhist and other traditions into his interpretation Mr Mitchell misses the difference between the Way and the other forms of eastern religions. Taoism, for lack of a better label for it, is entirely native to the east, as opposed to Buddhism and Hinduism which are both outgrowths of an Indo-european system of beliefs. His efforts then become such a mishmash of ideas that they bear no resemblence to either the Tao Te Ching or the philosophies underlying it. One chapter in the book he even deliberately ignores the meaning of the chapter in order to argue for embracing death. Frankly anyone who uses this translation in an attempt to understand the Way might as well use the Bible, the Koran, the Bagavad-Ghita or the Torah. It would be just as easy to find the writings in them as in his work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good translation to begin your relationship with the Tao","review":"Of all of the various translations I have read either all or part of, this is the most fluid and dynamic. Not being able to read Chinese, I will not pretend to comment on its fidelity to the original, but the ideas conveyed by Mitchell inform the Taoist philosophy well. I consider the handful of one star reviews to be unfair; however, since I am not necessarily familiar with the better translations they mention, I cannot make any claims on their individual criticisms. One thing, however, is certain: Just because there may be a better translation does not make Mitchell's a bad translation. If anything, you should become familiar with a variety of translations, and this should certainly be among them."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best translations of this all-time classic","review":"I've read many different versions/translations of the Tao Te Ching... and while I realize it must be a very difficult text to translate and still preserve the original meaning, some authors seem to do it much better than others.

But, can one believe in atheism ? An oxymoron is not worth the true fidelity of trust. Fate brought the Tao to me; I was destined to read it. Can one describe birth, love, or an epiphany ?

Try to find one that really emphasizes the spiritual side of the martial arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book / Bad Format","review":"I used to have the hardback edition of this book, a well-bound book on quality paper with old school, cut-edge pages.

The accents on the cassette are nothing short of embarrassing - A cringe a minute. I asked a fellow actor to listen to the French accent and guess what it was: He guessed Spanish!

The book also contains some helpful hints (though if you're learning the dialect for the first time, I would recommend his tape series, Acting With An Accent or Robert Blumenfeld's Accents, A Manuel for Actors.

Even tabbing from one field to another in a dialog box will crash QPX3. And worse, any time a dialog box is on screen your CPU usage pegs at 100% until the box is closed, so even if you do manage to build something QPX3 will eat your CPU. On a laptop this just drains the battery and makes the fan kick in. There are numerous errors in the help documentation. Some are merely typos.

I know it's fiction because the book is so godawful, his statement cannot be interpretted as factual.--- As a writer who aspires to be published in this genre, I can only hope to someday become Mr. Cussler's friend so that anything I write will be fasttracked into print without having to endure the tedious editorial process.

The plot became highly predictable, the writing is atrocious, and the ending punchless. Mr. Dirgo is obviously a Clive Cussler wannabe, but has neither the imagination or story-telling ability (not to mention basic grasp of the English language) to even be mentioned in the same breath as Cussler.

The publishing industry must really be desperate for material if they go to the trouble of printing something this bad. Do they think everybody reads at a third-grade level?

DO NOT read this book if you still have humanity left within your soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Debut","review":"The purest form of flattery is excellent imitation and Dirgo, a Clive Cussler protege, has done a great imitation of the master of modern day swashbuckling novels. The main character, John Taft is cast in the same devil may care mold as Dirk Pitt. The style and atmosphere is similar (though tamed down) as in Dirk Pitt novels. The premise that Einstein did finish his Unified Field Theory but hid it to protect the human race from itself is believable and the background story is the strongest part of the novel. The second half of the novel is weaker as the plotting is more contrived, yet it was entertaining; I spent a pleasant afternoon reading it.One note about the Kirkus review above, the reference to \\"T E S ? A\\" on a star map is obviously a pointer to the theme for the next John Taft novel, and not a conclusion of this one.

The plot was intrigueing enough to keep my interest. I especially enjoyed the dialogue Dirgo developed between his characters. As well, the author succeeded in weaving his fiction yarn in and through historic events in a believable way.If you're looking for a classic work, this book's not for you. But if a well crafted tale with twists and turns suits you, give this one a try. All in all, I appreciated a good first effort from a new author. Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"First off I have to say that this book is nothing short of entertaining from the beginning to the very end. If one was to simply put aside an over anlaytical mind and simply embrace the fact that the word FICTION means using your imagination and letting the unexplained go, you are guaranteed to enjoy this book.The best way to simply describe this book is James Bond with more muscles!There's action, there's politics, there are guns, there are agents. It is a book that leaves you with curiousity. You are left with the desire to actually look up Einstein and Physcics to learn more about what exactly \\"the theory of relativity\\" is.Obviously if you were a physicist, mathematician or scientist, you would be able to poke so many holes in the book but even you have to admit, you wish you were JOHN TAFT!Overall I would say, if you are looking to enjoy a good read and get lost in the world of spies AND scientists without a lotta mumbo jumbo to confuse you, go pick this book UP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Imitation of Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt Novels","review":"This book is a very amateurish try at imitating Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt Novels. The story line has a lot of promise but does not deliver. The dialogue and the detail reminded me of the simplistic plots of 1950's detective/science fiction TV shows.

His main character, John Taft, is supposed to be like Dirk Pitt but he's a bit off-- maybe because he drinks ginger ale instead of tequila. And Taft's sidekick, Martinez, has promised his wife he won't fight. Some of his premises are so far out as to be not even good science fiction. For example, Dirgo has his characters get several hundred cylotrons \\"scavenged from storage racks and test centers\\" and place one in each old plane at Davis-Monthan Air Base.

The long and short of it is that this album falls into the same free-form waste of time circular file as Trey Anastasio's Surrender to the Air, which wasted the talents of such modern notables as Oteil Burbridge, John Medeski, Mark Ribot and many others.

After cleaning the registry, upon start up, Windows Installer tried to load a TrayApp and Document Viewer that it couldn't find. I also received an \\"unhandled exception\\" in Microsoft.NetFramework. The only way to stop it was to end the programs (control alt delete). I then spent time in msconfig and found the problem was in the start up tab. After backing up my entire system, I tried to fix the problem by restoring the registry before the \\"clean up\\". That did not fix the problem. After going through almost the entire start up list I found the problem in the HP startup program. I loaded the driver disc from my HP printer and windows installer loaded the missing files. I now am free of the constant appearance of Windows Installer at startup.

I use this with the shimmer lights shampoo once or twice a week, never more than that and use regular shampoo and conditioner the rest of the days. I often get comments on my silver hair and I think using shimmer lights is the reason why. Even my husband has mentioned how often strangers comment on my hair color and gets a kick out of it. I can see a difference in the brightness and shine and really like what this does to my hair. I don't mind the scent at all and I like the way my hair feels as well as looks. I am very happy having silver hair and plan to keep using this shampoo and conditioner to keep it at its best. I received my order from Amazon very, very quickly using the free shipping option too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a desirable scent","review":"The conditioning was okay, but the smell repulsed me!

I'll keep looking for one that suits me better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much good to say","review":"I ordered both the Shimmer Lighys shampoo and conditioner on the recommendation of my stylist. Neither my husband nor I can stand the fragrance of either product, and the conditioner leaves my rather short hair tangled.

They love, hey, I LOVE, the silver of my hair and it's down to the middle of my back! I only use the conditioner because using the shampoo also, makes my silver show up more blueish and I'm not in that group yet!

One minute works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I love this brand's shampoo. I use the shampoo to cool my high lights.

Lassiter wrote this book 1 to commemorate the victims Corinna Novis,and Lynel Murray and 2 because he wanted to examine the lives of the couple that killed them, in the hope that he would get an answer why they did what they did.

But after getting it, I am convinced it was a total waste of money. The leather is extremely low quality -- rough, dry and even scratched up on the back. The shoulder fit is totally out of proportion. The lining, even after I took out the zip-out vest, was too loose. Did a drunk person stitch this together?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most outstanding, and horrifying book I have ever read","review":"I am not much of a reader, but being in the military, I thought this would be a good book to read. Boy, was I right. Blackhawk Down is a terrifying look into the black soul of battle. The courage and bravery these men displayed is matched by no other. Even though they are supposed to be the best, and beyond fear, the terror that the Rangers and Delta Force faced is enough to make any man go insane. If you are in the military and have soldiers of your own, I strongly encourage reading this masterpiece, and then make your soldiers read it. We can never be truley prepared for what terror combat might bring, but Blackhawk Down shows us what to guard against and how to best overcome the worst of a situation to accomplish the mission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Hawk Down","review":"Black Hawk Down is a very fast paced action novel which involves lots of gun fast paced fighting and many other things that are involved wth war. I also is a sad book because the war that took place in this novel was very dramatic. Black Hawk Down takes place in Mogadishu, Somalia where U.S. forces are trying to get two druglords, Sgt. Matt Eversmann is the main character and also the chalk (sqaud) leader. Eversmann experience's alot in the war but that does not phase him, Matt is a good commander and knows how to lead his troops to victory. I really liked this book because i love action packed novels and this is a very action packed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dramatic acount of modern war.","review":"Black Hawk Down is about the battle on October 3rd, 1993 in Somalia. I won't reveal anything, because I think you should read this wonderful book for yourself. However, if I do say so myself, the message of this book is irreperable, and that is that regular people can do extraordinary things, if they are in a desperate situations. The writing is overall very well done. It is truly a quality book. The book gives you great insight into the battle, but don't take it all from me, read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrow-Minded and Dreadfully Boring","review":"This is one of few books that I have ever started, read half of, and did not bother to finish. The 150 or so pages I read-- consisting entirely of stale, straightforward plot description -- were some of the most mind-numbing I have ever encountered.I was hoping for some insight into the Somalia conflict or the American Armed Forces or US foreign policy or even the psychology of warfare. Instead, it's a kiddie book about a single mission and the story is alienated from any larger social, political or historical context. I can see how military buffs -- especially those who already know the background on Somalia -- would be impressed by the intricacy and apparant authoritativeness of the narrative, but I found it empty and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"One big fight scene that doesn't work as a book or movie","review":"The hype that the movie Black Hawk Down received prior to its release encouraged me to read the book: a fatal mistake. The book is as groan inducing as the movie and this is mainly because it spends so little time with character development that it's hard to care about the outcome and feel sorrow at the deaths of the soldiers. Action buffs who enjoyed the movie often criticize me by saying that this is a true account of an actual event, but even so this does not make the book any more exciting for me to read. If you are interested in knowing of what happened in Mogadishu, read the book, otherwise, steer clear of it as you would any other mindless action book/movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of: BlackHawk Down","review":"BlackHawk Down was a great book. The reason i thInk this is because it was writen in a way that it put you in the action, it made me feel like i was there in the middle of a war.Another reason i liked this book is because it went almost exactly with the movie, and when i read a book i like to be able to watch the movie and there not be a big difference between it and the book. Also not only did the events follow along with each-other there were alot of the same words and the book used alot of detail in sense that it used the abbreviations the army does, it used the same weapons, and the same names of the people who were actually in the war. I highly recommend this book to anyone.RYAN CARNEY"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is so boring!","review":"Way too detailed and too long.

Regardless of the Commander-in-Chief, our US forces train as hard as ever to protect our country, as well as our interests abroad. My eyes were wet when I read of our elite service men falling to the ground in a useless cause. The battle in Mogadishu has not made peace in Somolia, and the day after the mission was finished, that same Task Force was pulled out of the country. However they were motivated by a love so deep for their country that they were not afraid to die serving her, and many did.

And, given the Clinton predispositon towards the military, and institution he \\"loathed\\", Americans might not expect much from a small albeit dedicated group of fighters in this African cell of poverty and turmoil.Bowden does a fantastic job of showing the personal side of heroism, of depicting modern warriors who go unrespected or unnoticed in their own countries. Taking a small, \\"botched\\" military operation, underresourced and quickly planned, Bowden adeptly portrays the people who live and die to help make sure that we continue to live and die in freedom. These men illustrate valor and commitment, to one another and in the name of an unappreciative government. Mostly without the seemingly everpresent CNN live world coverage, a small number of men accomplished a lot with a little.The September 11 events make us grateful that we have soldier warriors like these men."},{"rating":"2","title":"The few and brave","review":"Before I read this book I've always wanted to be part of the special forces, I would picture them going into enemy territory and finish there job, kill the bad guys and get out without a loss of a single man.

I would recommend this book to anyone intrested in special forces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book with few minor annoyances","review":"Mark Bowden does an excellent job in portraying the Battle of THe Black Sea to its fullest extent. The graphically descriptive images of the battle and the emotions that plagued those involved were realistically displayed. It is definitely a book destined for great reviews. The only minor drawback is the constant fluctuations between different characters' point of views and the chronology of the events. THough noted that such technique could be aiming for the true confusion that these Rangers and Delta Operators were plagued with, but it would be much easier on the readers if it was clearer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A definitive look at the Somalia debacle","review":"As riveting as fictional thrillers like The Triumph and the Glory or Rainbow Six, Mark Bowden's Blackhawk Down is even more riveting because it is TRUE. This fine book should win every award there is. Read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invasion from Mars (The Sequel)","review":"My reaction; Logically , how is it sanity to be so idealistic to rationlize an attempt at correcting another Nation's anarchy, by sacrificing American lives ?. I just can't wrap my head around losing American lives to try in vain to save a recalcitrant country from it's own fate, regardless of the possible European colonial roots of this anarchy. Furthermore, I feel it's time our Elite, suffering from cracking faces ( addicted to spending and debit ) spend more time using their nobler intentions instead of using their balls. This post-cold war euphoric fog has been around for way too long and people need to start dealing with our children's future economic reality. Getting back to this book, details, angles, tons of it. This story is not a Cowboy and Indian story, it's a story of 100 or so of our American boys being thrown into a hellish meat grinder of a nightmare. Some other food for thought, No Somalia 1993, No Rwanda 1994 ?, on a whim or not commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily dishonors the soldiers","review":"The author was trying to be more of a journalist rather than conveying the meaning and gravity of the story. Unneeded details of men behaving badly when they are bored and alone does nothing but distract from what our country put them through. At some point in the editorial process they needed to cut out the distractions and focus on the heroism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unflinching","review":"I think what I like best about this book is that it's unflinching. There are no attempts here to whitewash the grit, the gore, and, at times, the outright incompetency of the men involved in the Battle of the Black Sea. But, at the same time, this is unabashedly a story of common men thrust into an uncommon situation that forced them to bend, break, or rise with the courage necessary to save not just themselves but also their comrades. Definitely necessary reading for any student of military activity, particularly modern warfare."},{"rating":"2","title":"military writing at its best","review":"i'm trying to read all the iraq boks but i have to say...there's nothing so far that can touch this one.

If anyone have told me a couple of years ago he or she was going to write a book about the battle in Somalia, I would have laughed and wrote it off.Boy, I would have been wrong.This is a very engaging book, methodical, and caring. The author did an excellent job representing all sides of the conflict in an engaging manner. One could tell he did a tremendous amount of research, and most important, he did not relay on dry military reports, but interviewed all involved. This is also a fascinating look at the life of the soldiers, the conflicts between the different units, and represents the views of the commanders, ground troops, and pilots.I would just like to say that he did do justice to all involved, we need more books like that. Also, don't forget to read the notes at the end of the book for more insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before you enlist, read this book.","review":"Bowden's book should be standard reading for any person considering entering the armed services. This is as factual an account of combat as I have ever read. In the end, there is no glory, just those who lived, those who died and those who were mentally and physically destroyed.For the hawks on Capital Hill, it is a stark account to read before sending boys into the void, for the doves, a poignant reminder that at times, there is evil in the world that must be confronted.

I wish that every voting-age American would read this book. I really appreciated the way Bowden went the extra mile in detailing his sources and research methods, including other writings on the subject. Wake up America - this is a look at the future of the squandering of military power on feel-good conflicts rather the defense of the US and its interests by bumbling politicians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mark's C-SPAN description was better than the book.","review":"I bought this book after watching the author's riveting and emotional account of this story on C-SPAN2's book review. Anyone watching this first-person account (of one of this century's worst military gaffes) would be compelled to read this book.But what a let-down! Let me just put it this way: Mr. Bowden speaks much more succinctly and powerfully than he writes. For all of you Stephen King fans out there, this is the \\"Bag of Bones\\" of military stories. Tons and tons of endless--and seemingly irrelevant--character development (or fluff, as I call it) that works better than any OTC sleep inducer.But that's just my opinion. I'm more of a Tom Clancy fan when it comes to war stories.

Shoddy journalism, coupled with one Delta operator's huge ego and one-sided opinions, make for interesting reading, but it does a disservice to the outstanding performance of our SOF warriors and their Somali opposition. It is on paper now- thus, it must be true. And, of course, several soldiers received their 15 minutes of fame and are naturally supportive of the book. Just another wannabe making a dime off the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant, but incomplete book","review":"Great descriptive book but he ignored the reasons for the battle.

I thought it was ok but it had way too many details. I wish that it could just get to the point. Some times there were points that were not important but it just kept giving details about that pointless scene. Other than that it had a pretty good plot and I like the way how it followed each different soldier's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"truth and horror","review":"This was a very accurate account of this event. I would suggest to anyone who wants a clear picture of what happened in this fight that they read the book and let the movie fall second behind what is reality. Everyone should read this book to know a little bit more about the sacrifices that soldiers have to make when in the line of duty. It's a very sobering affect and should make you very proud to be an American. Only people who have been there and know what it's like truly have a right to criticize any military actions taken on for the sake of freedom and democracy. People who don't know better and who don't live in this country should keep their mouths closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Monument to the Men of Task Force Ranger","review":"With BLACK HAWK DOWN, Mark Bowden gives the valorous Rangers, Delta operators, and Night Stalker pilots who fought in the savage Battle of Mogadishu on October 3-4, 1993 perhaps the greatest monument possible by crafting a definitive moment-by-moment record that faithfully tells their story and ensures it will not be forgotten or otherwise lost to history. Bowden has produced an intense, riveting, exhaustively-researched novelistic depiction of modern urban warfare in all its stark brutality and chaos, told from the human perspectives of the soldiers on-the-ground who lived it. He does so in a refreshingly straightforward manner that respects the subject matter at all times and eschews the reflexive anti-war cynicism, exploitation, and editorializing that so often mars modern war reporting. The result is nothing short of a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mogadishu - An Unforgettable Place In A Rescue-Gone-Bad","review":"Mogadishu - not a place you want to go and vacation.....at least not in 1992 when this \\"Black Hawk Down\\" disaster took place.After seeing the film a few times, I thought I'd finally get around to reading all the details about this brutal historical event in Mark Bowden's book. I wasn't disappointed. My only complaint on the book was the maps didn't always seem to jive with the descriptions of the events as they were unfolding, which was frustrating.Still, it's an amazing true-life account and Bowden spares no details in describing it, both good and bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great storytelling of chaotic and desperate situations","review":"Mark Bowden deserves lots of praise for writing this book because if he hadn't, this would be another untold chapter of American heroism. Never mind the objectives of the American government or the means they used to find Aidid, these Delta and Ranger soldiers risked their lives for America.Bowden jumps from the situation of one soldier to another constantly while never leaving the big picture throughout the story.

With 700 plus reviews, it was with reservation that I undertook to write this, what more could be added. But this book was important to me because after reading it, I began to search for answers to questions such as when is it right to fight for human rights? What if that means going into a country that doesn't want your help? This is a really trite summary of my reflections after reading this book, but nonetheless the book really triggered me to think closely about all the conflicts we are involved in. The book also puts the reader in the middle of a culture so far removed from ours that it brings the principles of our western culture into view.

It is a clear, consise story told for and by members of Task Force Ranger so that their story will not be forgotten. It is told so vividly that it is hard to believe Bowden was not there with these guys, running through buildings, up and down those streets, dodging bullets coming from every direction. This needs to be a standard in every histroy and military history class in the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respect They Deserve","review":"I had a hard time putting this book down. I remember vividly when this terrible battle hit the news and the papers. Once again our soldiers are sent into the absolute hell of combat and are left to fight for their lives in a situation that all the possible scenarios were not thought out. This book not only gives the reader the facts and stories from the soldiers themselves but also many of their thoughts before, during and after the battle. The book depicts well how good American Rangers are at their job and how unbelievably well trained and professional the Delta guys are. Although some people may be offended by the unfortunate killing of civilians - the book clearly points out how and why civilians were killed.

Once again, the bureaucrats expected a mission to go off without a hitch and had no plan \\"B\\" to fall back on. Only through the courage and dedication of our fighting forces were the lives that were saved made possible. Furthermore, this book demonstrates that our need for HUMINT is an extremely crucial but much neglected facet of military missions, be they covert or not. September 11, 2001 is an even better example of our need for an expansion of our HUMINT forces. Like many others, once I started the book, I was unable to put it down. I spent an entire, beautifully sunny Saturday reading this book. I highly recommend this book to everyone who has an interest in our military.

The fact that it is based on a true story is what makes it even better. This book had great descriptions of battle scenes and what war must really be like. The battles in the streets were so well described that it was hard to put the book down. Unlike some war accounts there is not that much leading up to the action. There is no complicated story line in which to get confused. It just describes a soldiers view of war overseas, and has non-stop action and horrific descriptions of the fights and casualties.

The book opens up with excitement and never lets go. Whereas many non-fictional accounts stumble through the boring prelude, reason for the mission, etc., Blackhawk Down goes straight to the action and gives historical anecdotes where needed to give a broader meaning to the story as it unfolds.

Many war books/films loose their focus in an attempt to properly develop characters or to give the scope of the bigger conflict.The major criticism of the movie was that it was nothing but war and no underlying story. In the book Bowden's skill as a writer provides a story and excellent character development.This a great book for anyone interested in special ops or the Battle of Mogadishu. It is also a great read for anyone who is not a big reader because it is so exciting the text pulls the reader through the book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adds a lot more to the story above the movie","review":"I have seen the movie multiple times and absolutely love it, and for that reason, finally got myself to sit down with the book. I'm glad I did, because the book adds a lot more over what the movie tells us. The book introduces quite a few characters and can be a little gnarly to follow in the beginning, but I found myself well oriented about 40-50 pages in.

He presents a very complex incident with color, passion, and detail, cataloging the sounds, smells, and visuals of this frightful engagement.He allows the participants among American and Somali soldiers and noncombatants to tell their own stories in their own words. Occasionally he steps back and presents historical/political background to let the reader see this \\"Battle of the Black Sea\\" in context.The movie version (Ridley Scott directing) was exceptionally well done, fast-paced, fierce, gritty, and like the battle itself, ultimately very sad and leaving a sense of futility, given that the U.S. scampered out of Somalia shortly after the battle. Yet the movie was light and almost careless of many details compared with this book.Move over, Cornelius Ryan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"A historic first hand account about the US prisoner snatch that went horribly wrong.

As one of the Sammies said the Americans are too concerned for their comrades and will not leave them to die which of course meant they drove round in circles trying to find their mates while under murderous fire from all sides. A great read and testimony to the bravery of American fighting forces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work by Mr. Bowden","review":"I'm a Nat'l Guard cavalry Sergeant, and was concerned that Mr. Bowden's lack of military experience might color the account of the events in Mogadishu on October 3-4, 1993. I could not have been more wrong. Obviously Mr. Bowden entered the project with an open mind, and became impressed with the men of SFOD-D and B/3-75th and all the other unfortunate soldiers, sailors and airmen struggling in the streets of Somalia during that long running gunfight. He pulls no punches, and leaves nothing untold. If a soldier did something he was ashamed of, it's right there in print. But one cannot (as obviously Mr. Bowden could not) be impressed by the dedication, and courage of these men in their desire to complete their mission, and preserve the lives of their team mates. If I ever meet Ranger Stebbins, I'd be more than happy to buy him a beer. Hell, I'd buy a keg for any and/or all of these guys!

The movie- based on the book- is quite exceptional as well, but nothing beats the narrative of what happened there and Mark Bowden does a tremendous job.I would highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys or is fascinated by our military history.

You will realize that technology can only enhance a battle but not replace the men and basic equipment needed to win that battle. And you will see courage by the pageful. This should be mandatory reading for all military officers and noncoms. It is a lessons learned book and may help prevent some of these mistakes from happening again.

It is a very sobering and very realistic reminder of how dangerous war can be, how easy it is to become overconfident with disastrous results, and how different standards and experiences can be in other countries.

The rock songs are instantly catchy and accesible(like Sleepwalking and Already Gone), and the mid-tempo acoustic songs are excellent changes of pace(Last Summer). The real revelation of this album, however, is not simply Felumlee's musicianship or lyrical ability, but also his singing voice. It's hard to believe so rich and expressive a voice has been hiding behind the drum kit of the Smoking Popes and Alk3 for this long.

Like the way Janeway got seperated from her crew.I do not think that Kes should have been brought into the story. Even though she used to be a crew member. A seperate book should have been written about her. Even though her story is brought into the story well.Pathways was an enjoyable book and I recommend people to read it as it gives you a background to the characters. Some thing's don't match up with the series but it is still enjoyable and interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"not TOO bad...","review":"The previous book by Jeri Taylor, MOSAIC, told the story of Kathyrn Janeway very well, but if you're looking for THAT kind of insight into the other Voyager characters in this book, you will be disappointed. Don't get me wrong... you will find out things about the characters, but the portraits are relatively two-dimensional. It's like eating one potato chip..... The surrounding story is weak at best, and is too easily dispensed with."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot better than expected...","review":"Before I read this book, I looked at book reviews from different readers. I became wary because at the time, I found that many people disliked the book, but I bought it and read it anyway. It was REALLY good! Mrs. Taylor did a wonderful job with the background stories (Especially Chakotay and Harry's). I thought that the camp situation was really interesting and I wish more would've been said about that, but I understand that the porpose for the book was to explore the characters, the camp just set the reason for telling them.

This woman has no grip on the personality traits of any of the non-human species created in the other Trek incarnations and brought forward into Voyager. We suddenly have honourless Klingons, illogical and intolerant Vulcans, etc. And none of the senior staff had a positive female role model in their lives before Janeway? Sure, sure. That's how they became so emotionally mature and competent.Star Trek is wholly fictional, of course. But this book seems to be a fiction inside a fiction: as if Taylor were living in the Trek world and writing stories about the characters for the National Enquirer. Strange days indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek Voyager - Brought more to life!!","review":"This was a great read, but be forewarned that you must be a Voyager Fan in order to fully appreciate this book.

I hope so, and I only hope if it ever does go to screen big or small, it is done as close to the book as possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wounderfully written!","review":"I loved reading the book Pathways. I like how Jeri Taylor gives us some background on Voyager's senior staff. I understand that some of the facts don't agree with the T.V. series, but I'm not a regular Star Trek watcher. Out of Taylor's two books, my favorite was Mosaic, but Pathways was still an enjoyable reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too many inconsistencies!","review":"Not only were the characters way off base, but their histories were terribly inconsistent with facts already established on the show. For instance... I thought Tom's accident was after he graduated, not DURING the Academy. Perhaps Ms. Taylor is confusing Tom Paris with Nick Locarno (Robert Duncan McNeill's TNG role, in which he played a cadet who covered up an accident... sound familiar?) I think B'Elanna's homeworld was wrong, too. As for the rest... well, it felt to me like the book was written by someone who didn't watch and didn't have a clue about Voyager. Not too good considering Ms. Taylor used to be an executive producer of the show.I didn't even finish reading it, and I seriously doubt that you will miss anything important if you skip this book. As a big Voyager fan, I cannot accept this as canon. Stick with \\"Mosaic\\". Jeri Taylor does herself proud in that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Premise is flawed, so is the book.","review":"To restate what others have said with far more style. Janeway sends her entire senior staff to a planet, then leaves on a diplomatic mission!?!??? That in and of itself defies logic. And in many ways this Voyager novel suffers the same symptoms as the series. 80% of the story is build up, 10% is fluff and 10% is the solution. Like the series the conclusion to the problem feels hurried and contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily verbose...","review":"Unfortunately, I struggled with this novel from the very beginning. The author, rather than simply telling a good story, bogs down the reader with sentences like:\\"In a flash, he realized that nothing had been wrong, after all, except his perception of time, distorted by his biological responses.\\"and...\\"That last remark produced no response from the people on the bridge, but B'Elanna assumed they all had a similar response: there were people who had no real home, not anymore, not after they decided to thumb their noses at the Federation's peace treaty and try for a different kind of justice.\\"It was just not a pleasure to read. I hate to give a bad rating to a Star Trek novel, but I just felt like this particular one was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!","review":"I simply loved this movie.

I have only had these wipers for about a month so I do not know about the length of time they will last. But, so far I am very pleased with the quality of the wipers.

He wanders through the drug stage, the meaningless sex stage, and forever has bouts of \\"soul searching\\".

In the beginning, Whalen had the answers, he started as a complete person, and degenerated, grew backwards, almost as if he had been born a man and moved backwards into childhood confusion.

The DVD player portion played fine, I thought the screen could be a little bit sharper, it seemed a little grainy for me. Anyway, I'll be returning this piece of junk ASAP and continue my search for a good portable TV. Don't waste your time with this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coby TV/DVD","review":"Purchased this system for my wife's birtheday. She loves to watch movies.

It did not hold me like a good book should. The mystry was mininal and suspence lacking. Sorry guys about the bad reveiw and spelling"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I like John DeLancie, and really enjoy Peter David's work. 'Q' does a great job reading this story. However the story itself is just odd, long, and rambling, very incoherent. I love the character Q, but don't care of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Started out interesting, but quickly became old, tiring, and hard to finish. But finish it, I did, because until recently Peter David never let me down.Oh, sorry, Mr. David, but you did this time. And you have with most of the New Frontier books. Only the first couple were very good.Please, Mr. David, please return to writing stories of the calibre of Imzadi (the first, not the second)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy addition to the Q stories","review":"I feel that I,Q was a very enjoyable book. I loved John DeLancie's tongue in cheek writing style. I felt he captured the real essence of Q as only he could. Q had grown emotionally and become a real boy (wait, that's Data! No, it's Pinocchio! Whatever!). I would have enjoyed it a little more if perhaps more of the characters could have appeared somehow. Deanna Troi, for example, would have been a useful addition to the adventure. Her mother would have been a real stitch. But I digress. . . My one question (phrased so as not to give anything away, I hope) is: why did Picard see Vash & not Beverly Crusher at a certain point in the story?"},{"rating":"2","title":"We need more Q","review":"Defiantly one of the better Trek audio books; read by the man himself this should be a treat for casual fans and the hardcores alike. Picard, Q and Data must unite against forces that threaten to literally unmake the universe. A good way to kill three hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHUT UP!","review":"This was written in first person from Q's perspective and as in the series he tends to drag on and on and on. Now, I enjoy the charcter Q but shut up sometimes. In an hour long show its OK but for a novel shut up! This could be a great story line if it was wrriten form a 3rd person view and leave out the excessive commentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"I,Quit","review":"John De Lancie should quit writing and stay with his acting. Even with the help of long-time Star Trek author Peter David, this book left a great deal to be desired. Most books in the series either fill in background on one or more of the characters (this one didn't) or provide us with a captivating story (again, this one didn't). The story line was written as if whatever came to the author's mind became a part of the story with no concept of flow or story development. It was, at best, a jumble of concepts, vulgarities and colloquialisms which was nearly impossible to follow. Even given the somewhat unexpected ending (the only thing interesting in the entire book), the time required to read the book would have been better spent watching paint dry or grass grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really wonder what that was all about...","review":"What should I say about this book? One thing I can say FOR this book is that it really kept me reading. I always wondered what would happen next, and I also have to say that it was really entertaining, also including some wise and witty observations about these most curious creatures we call humans. On the other hand...when I read the conclusion, I really wonder... In my opinion, NOTHING was explained at the end of this book. It was not even a rashed throw-in-your-lap, as in some other books. After reading it, you sit there, and ask yourself: \\"What's the point of all this? IS there even a point?\\" I would have preferred not to give a rating, because I still don't know what to make of this book, but since I have to I'll give it 4 stars, because it was a good read nevertheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be hard core!!","review":"The audiobook has one thing going for it. Mr. de Lancie's smoothe delivery. If you enjoy John's (Q's) voice, inflections, irony, petulance then by all means pick this up. The plot line is overworked (end of the universe), they drag a lot of old hackneyed Trek lines around, and the other characters are wooden. I wanted to end it early but That Voice kept me going!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Q finds that he is not at the apex of existence.","review":"I've read all of the reviews before mine and I get the distinct impression that most people did not understand the ending. Or was it that they do not want to understand the ending? The seemed very clear to me.In order to understand the book you have to understand what Q is supposed to represent. Q is thought to be at the highest level of existence in his Universe. He thinks he is omniscient and omnipotent. Through out the book, he is desperately trying to hold on to his feelings of superiority. In the end, he finally realizes that there is a power greater than him. The irony is that that said power had the same problem the Q continuum has; it is bored to death. The point of the plot is to show that there is always someone greater than you, there is always someone who knows more than you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there a plot?","review":"This book is a waste of money, even at Amazon's reduced price. The book is only 249 pages, and it feels padded at that length. The book doesn't have that much of a plot, and it lacks the wit of Peter David's other books like Q-Squared & Q-in-Law. I just kept waiting for the book to end. The book should never have been published, let alone as a hardcover. The book does give you a glimpse into Q's mind, but if you want Q read Greg Cox's Q Continuum Trilogy. If you read Dyson Sphere earlier this year, I,Q is like that book, only worse. I want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Q. doesn't believe in God, and he lets you know.....in almost every paragraph.","review":"Q. is one of the most beloved characters on a show with nothing but beloved characters. So I got the book. Well it seems that Q. and his unique perspective is used simply as a cheap college expose on God and religion. The main characters are Q. Picard, and Data....but really its just Data and Q. So there's a bunch of philosophical expose on supreme being and robot, machine and man, creator and created. However, Q.'s usual smirks and condescending attitude has been hijacked so that the author can mock people that believe in God. I'm aware that Star Trek often tackles serious issues, but there's hardly a page where Q isn't repeating his beliefs on God, his hatred of God, the stupidity of God, and his disgust for God. I think the word God is used on almost every page. Literally! I'm not offended easily, but this seems like a hack author trying to pass off his community college 'anti-religion' thesis as a Star Trek novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"definitely not David's best work","review":"About the only thing this book had going for it was the fact that Q was the main character. Usually Peter David's Trek novels are stellar (Imzadi, Q-Squared, and Q-In-Law were all great). I bought I,Q. with the expectation that it would be such another wonderful story. Instead, it takes a rather interesting premise and makes it into on of the dullest stories I've ever read that wasn't for Early American Lit."},{"rating":"2","title":"John De Lancie as Q is quite funny in this book","review":"John De Lancie as Q is quite funny in this book; that's about all I have to say. A good, interesting book that will keep you riveted, sort of. I don't really understand the ending, though. Maybe I should read the ending again, very slowly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute book but wait for paperback","review":"This was a cute enough book but not David's best. One part with the Grand Nagus is great. But Picard and Data often seemed out of character. Q's self-love and ego overwhelmed even me (a big fan of the character) at times. There were excessive and misplaced cliches, colloquialisms, and profanity, inconsistent with most good Trek. Too many speeches, too, even for a Q story. So, don't buy the hardcover; get it in paperback or from the library. In the mean time, read 'The Q Continuum' trilogy; it's a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such potential, but what happened?","review":"I love all the Peter David \\"Q\\" novels, so when I saw this one I ordered it immediately. What a disappointment. The book goes off on so many tangents and trails that lead nowhere that it could have been about half the length it was. Such a good storyline, such great potential, then it all comes crashing down. Sorry, but this is not at all in the same league with the other \\"Q\\" novels. Let's hope there's some good ones in the works for the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I look at things different now","review":"I'll be very minimal in words to convey how I feel after reading this book. I can stand in a line that goes around the supermarket several times and I say to myself\\"\\"How can I control this situation? , No more road rage for me, I don't make fun of other people anymore, In general I am a better person to my wife, kids, peers and everybody out there. Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happier People","review":"This cheerful book aims to make us stop and smell--if not roses--whatever is sitting in front of our noses. It offers meditations designed to make us appreciate our lives, keep our emotions in perspective, and cherish other people.

Call me a pessimist but I take much of what is written in self-help books with an exceptionally large grain of salt because the bulk of the advice is about sugar-coating and donning rose-colored glasses. But this is the 2nd title I've read by Carlson and I must admit the man makes some very good, very practical points.

Turned out to be a really dulled-down self helper. Wouldn't bother with it.

But there should be deeper reasons for doing things.Bottom line, shallow and obvious...also I read it in about 2 hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Teaches passivity","review":"I have a huge problem with the advice this book gives. It teaches one to be passive. For example: it tells you to ask yourself what someboy who victimizes you is trying to teach you, and to learn from them, even if they physically beat you up. Are you kidding me? If somebody abuses you, you should learn the lesson they are trying to teach you? Most of us can do without that kind of advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old same old over and over","review":"Common sense type stuff. Ten pages would tell it all.

This book is so simple minded that it makes People Magazine look like great literature. What has become of our Country when such dribble is considered a useful tool for the way we interact as members of society. I don't remember the last time I felt compelled to voice my opinion in a public forum but this book set me off! I don't think that this is \\"small stuff\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"If you have EVER read ANY self-help type book, don't bother with this one. There is very little original material here. I found about 6 pages out of hundreds useful. The ideas in the rest of the book, I have heard or read elsewhere. This book merely rewords the work of others and sometimes is factually incorrect! The only reason I see why there are so many of these books in the series is that it is written in an easy-to-read, bite size, small book format. If you have anything else to read, do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the single person","review":"I have several problems with this book, of which I have read enough to draw these conclusions:1) It is written in a bite-size style, because the author did not have a sufficiently coherent message to organize it properly.2) It seems to be written for a certain audience - married, assertive, overachieving middle-aged people who focus too much on their jobs and little projects, like fixing their houses. It's not a very good book for single people, who don't have a family their supposed to be investing in. If, as Carlson suggests, you let everyone else have their opinion, you're not likely to get a date, as both men and women these days are generally interested in someone with a spine! This book is not for the slackers amongst us, who need a kick in the butt to get something done."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is incredibly inspiring!","review":"What an inspiring book! Not only have I read it, but twice! I also typed a list of the chapters up to put in my daytimer to begin my daily reading.

I find some things here useful but where are the references? Do I do this just because? Did Dr. Carlson's Ph.D. appear out of thin air? No, I think you learn that these time proven principles were concieved by greater minds. \\"An aim is not the only fortune worth finding; and it is not to be found in foreign lands but in the heart itself.\\" - Robert Louis Stevenson.If you want to read a book with substance AND references, read Self-Help Stuff That Works by Adam Khan.

DSTSS is an easy read, whether you do so straight through or in installments with time in between to try to absorb the fruit of the lesson. Each of the hundred suggestions/lessons are simple to read and comprehend, not so simple to put into practice. The book would not be worthwhile if they were easy to operationalize.

If you find you need the spiritual guidance, then it has plenty for you.Happy reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"These books have the wrong idea. It is a list of rules or something. But people don't learn from lists. Lists have to be memorized to be effective and with so many things going on with our lives, there is no time. People learn better from stories or anecdotes. That will stick. I do give it two stars because there are some useful advice found in this book...most I know but need to be reminded.

The hard part is to put it in practice, because it has always been hard! That's why the world is violent, people commit suicide, people kill each other, etc, etc. So, a smart writer put all this obvious stuff (be gentle, be patient, be nice to your friends, etc, etc...) in a book and earn millions. I don't need this book to know how to live more easily, more friendly. Anyway, I give it 2 stars because sometimes it is good to read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impractical for the Type A personality","review":"Don't get me wrong - I do agree with the message of the book. However, it's only presented in a \\"feel-good\\" manner and has no substance regarding how to integrate this mentality into real life. It keeps shouting something to the extent of \\"Don't Worry, Be Happy\\" and offers no game plan. Then again, I'd find it hard to elaborate greatly on my thoughts if all of the chapters I wrote were two pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"OK read but offers very little to help you stop sweating the small stuff.

While the first few pages were promising, the rest turned out to be more of the same... indeed, the repetitiveness of the messages became annoying, it was as if the author is preaching to an adult class of slow learners.

I don't recommend buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"Ive listened to this several times while driving and it is starting to sink in.

Many of these self-help books have come and gone, and here is yet one. Richard Carlson is a likeable guy, yet this deluge of platitudes dilutes the true power of words. When we really need them, we\`ve heard the obvious statements so many times that we no longer listen. Example: The misuse of the word \\"love\\" has made it almost impossible to use it on the correct occasions in the right way, so that the power of the word is kept. Sooner or later, one tires of facile solutions to complex questions. And this is one such occasion - sorry that it had to be your turn, Richard Carlson.

It would have been a more honest statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't you already say that?!?!?","review":"When you first start reading the book, it's quite enlightening...that's the first chapter. After about the first three chapters, I started having serious deja vu. There are only so many ways you can say the same thing before the reader catches on. Another thing, who in the heck is going to get up 4 hours before they need to, to meditate?!? I tend to like sleeping laying down instead of sitting up. And if I have 4 hours to spare, I'm surely not going to use it staring out a window. This book seemed to dwell on the passive nature in people. While he did say that sometimes you have to stand up for what you believe in (BRAVO, finally a statement that doesn't tell you to be a wimp), he had so many other wishy-washy walk-all-over-me statements that anything he said worth noting was tossed to the side because of the unrealistic ideas he repeats so frequently.

However, a co-worker lent it to me after seeing how I went through a job from hell after coming to the new place and other things happened to me as well. Well, I read this book.

The third track is \\"How to Listen to a Story in Music\\" The seventh track is \\"Maestro talks about the music\\" The either is \\"Now that you know a little More...One more Time\\" Perhaps we will enjoy this more when my kids are 10 or so, but it was dry, intellectual, technical...and sort of ridiculous. Well, I am not one for over analyzing literature in general, and I didn't find this intellectual analysis at all compelling.

Tell me where to get more books like these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good series for beginners","review":"I really like these books. Nicely done and easy to follow. If you think you cannot draw a straight line, you will find the lessons eye opening! I use them for homeschooling. We use them not only for drawing & handwriting practice, but we also look up more information on what we're drawing and try to create a little unit study with it. I will say that all eight volumes stay pretty much at the same level. They just showcase different subjects. If you are looking for a drawing program that will progress, this probably isn't it. My older son mastered Draw Right Now pretty quickly and was eager to move on to something more detailed and challenging.

Since we got these books a month ago his drawing has improved every day - he has gone from stick figures to subtle artistic renditions of all kinds of animals, vehicles, etc. in a month. Our 8 year old daughter has also enjoyed this series, but she prefers the \\"Draw 50\\" series by Lee Ames (which we can get from the library), because the figures are more realistic. Even our 2 year old daughter has gotten in on the drawing craze and can now draw rudimentary figures and faces, whereas a month ago she simply drew series of lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids love these!","review":"My daughters have been drawing with these for school.

She has already released these songs on Disc 1 of her greatest hits CD. There are no new songs, live versions, unreleased tracks, or alternate takes, just the same songs we've heard before. This is just a gimmick to make money. Shame on Arista for squandering Whitney's talent for this cash grab. The same goes for Madonna who says that the reason she didn't put any new songs on GHV2 (her new collection) was because it was a greatest hits album, and should only include those songs. Shame on her too. It's disappointing when singers of their stature (and wealth) resort to these lazy attempts to extort money from fans. Both these albums are failing miserably on the charts and deservedly so. Didn't they learn from Celine Dion and that pathetic greatest hits album she released last year (only one year after the real greatest hits album came out)?

Did Phil McGraw ever challlenge that assumption! I find that I can only read a chapter at a time because I am so gripped with ideas, thoughts, and issues that it takes a while to process them.

I look forward to the TV show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New Here","review":"Frankly, I don't understand why this book got so many raves. I found it unbearable. The book consists of \\"new-agey\\" statements of the obvious intermixed with demonstrations by the author of his own self-importance. I'm sure McGraw is a great trial strategist, but as the \\"life lessons\\" contained in his book are nothing but common sense, I fail to understand his special qualifications as a \\"life strategist.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh","review":"Despite being embarrassed to buy this book (I felt like a loser handing it to the cashier), I bought it anyway because I like Dr. Phil's show--he's entertaining. However, I didn't find this book nearly as helpful as Wayne Dyer, The Secret or Eckart Tolle. I didn't take anything away from it, and I wish I had bought something else instead of this book. Sorry Dr. Phil! I still love your show and that brilliant masterpiece, Dr. Phil House."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Strategies? Or Oprah Dedication?","review":"I did not read the book but opted for the audio cassettes. I was immediately put off that 3/4 of the first tape was dedicated to Oprah and HER lawsuit, how she looked, what she was wearing, how she felt, blah, blah, blah. WHO CARES? What does THAT have to do with ME? I could care less about celebrity and their overblown egos! I continued to listen however, chuckled once or twice, said Mmmmm, interesting a handful of times, but overall disappointed. Mr. McGraw sure would have a lot more credibility with me if he wasn't cow-towing to Oprah."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Phil Makes Sense.....Sometimes","review":"This is a very good book for people seeking self-help, and also for mental health professionals to work through with their clients in psychotherapy. His ten \\"life laws\\" in particular, are resoundingly true, in my opinion and will provide basic understanding of what approaches to life's problems work, and what doesn't work. As a professional therapist and academic writer, I find that these Life Laws are useful, well thought out, and presented in an interesting, non-psychobable manner. The only drawback is that Dr. McGraw's narcissism shows a little at times - he is very certain that he is \\"right\\" and other approaches to building self esteem and healthy interpersonal relationships are not valid. It was well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired of the Cheerleading","review":"Slow reading. I was always impressed with Dr. Phil and his discussions on OPRAH, but found the book rather disappointing. He does give a good 'in your face' account of what you need to do in order to perform a Life Strategy. However, I found some of the pages with sentence after sentence just telling you over and over what you need to do but not providing any specifics for the reader on how to actually start doing it. Also felt that the book contained quite a bit of grand standing on how he helped Oprah win her mad cow disease legal case. That grew old very quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating in the extreme, the audio version is.","review":"I bought the audio version of this book because I liked the guy's persona in small doses, the times I happened to see him for about 15 minutes on Oprah. Listening to his thick Texas twang for five or six hours on tape though was enough to give me a migraine.And the advice he dishes out is pretty simplistic, with nothing new under the sun to offer. It all boils down to \\"just do it,\\" and you can get that from a Nike ad, so don't bother with this book (and do NOT buy the tapes unless you are really fond of thick Texas twangs).His \\"life laws\\" consist of such pearls of wisdom as \\"Some people git it, and some don't.\\" and \\"You create your own experience.\\" and \\"There is no reality, only perception.\\"Not exactly an original thinker. I was expecting something fresher, I suppose, but this material is stale in the extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars for the Principles, 1 Star for the Examples","review":"I thought McGraw did a great job of assembling some key principles of living, relationships and success. For these principles I give the book five stars. The only problem is that you can get the principles by reading the table of contents...which isn't necessarilly a bad thing but one expects to get more in depth explanations inside the chapters. What I got was a litany of arguments and examples for a \\"stereotypical American\\"-- a sort of Oprah-watching couch potato with low self-esteem. I didn't associate with McGraw's examples and I'm not sure there are many who do (at least not those who are taking the time to read a book about personal life strategies). In short, I felt that McGraw haad some brilliant life strategy ideas and then he played to the least common denominator in American society. But, I loved the table of contents!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Life re-org course, works well with the Pathways course","review":"In the middle of taking the Pathways course in Dallas I got this book. (note: Dr. Phil developed the cirriculum for the course.)It has many of the essential elements of the course and is a course amplifier. It also stands on its own. the Pathways course and this book together they are a 15 on a scale of 10. try the book, if you are serious about making a monumental shift for the better in your life, then do both."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book I ever read","review":"This is not another Dr. trying to sell a book. He is honest and straight forward. If your not ready for the truth this book is not for you.

All I got from the book was feeling like I had a large cheerleader saying \\"go for it - compete - winning is EVERYTHING - no matter what the cost...You must have a goal & win or your life is no good\\". What about the journey? What about stopping to smell the roses?? I got tired just reading his book! \\"His\\" principles are good common sense. I was reading it going, \\"and yes? Your point is what? Nothing new here\\". I have worked very hard for a very long time & have learned that it is the journey that counts. And that you DO NOT always have control over what happens to you. Only in your perception, and response, and attitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock!","review":"I spent two hours with this lemon. The Oprah story was intriguing; everything else was gibberish. Phil's guidance is loaded with ten point plans to nowhere. I couldn't form a mental image of anything he had to say after the Oprah discussion. When writing is so vague that it doesn't evoke a single visual image, something's massively out of whack. At least on TV, Phil has a point of view. A stern, realistic one at that. His editors should have made him watch his show. I rate this book, which I was looking forward to, as a refund. After learning about Dr. Phil's past business practices on Wikipedia, I wonder if this sucker was ghost written. Absolute incoherent drivel. Forget psychology; this isn't even meaningful as English."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dangerous book.","review":"Puts entirely too much emphasis and burden on the individual in a complex society. Depressed people, those with fragile psyches need to come to terms with their inner reality in a setting of unconditional acceptance. Some might feel overwhelmed and defeated if the stark principles in this book don't work readily in difficult life situations. If this book is empowering to some, that's fine. But many people need a gradual, insightful approach and not the bullying, bruising method this author recommends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest....","review":"us 'self-improvement' junkies are suckers for books like this no matter how many times we keep hearing the same old advice. We're searching for that magic formula that just doesn't exist and this book - like most others of it's kind - is the same recycled, repackaged jargon. Deep down we all know what we need to be successful - a solid idea of what we truly want and the discipline to work towards making it reality. If you already know this there's no point in buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think","review":"Every person's experience in a reading a book is their own, and therefore, unique. I took away a sense of this book \\"making me think\\" and asking myself hard questions about life. I felt the exercises were way too long, but I got a much needed dose of mental focus from reading it.Dr. Phil offers so good, sound, ideas that will cause you to look at how you are managing your life and how you can do it in a better way. I recommend that you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading what works and reading what matters","review":"Reading this book could be your first strategic move towards improving your life. Dr. Phil is really good in showing the readers how to make effective changes in their lives. At least you get a more realistic view on what works and what doesn't. It's all about getting to know you better and creating your own experiences. This is as powerful a book as Stephen Covey's \\"Seven Habits of highly effective people\\". If you like Dr. Phil's TV show, you'll also enjoy reading and benefiting from this thought provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priorities","review":"In our busy lives this book is very helpful.

Life Strategies is one of these.This book by Phil McGraw captures and keeps your attention from the first page of the introduction (where he tells the story of how he met Oprah and took the first steps from being a litigation consultant to the country's life coach). He shares personal experiences of what some would call \\"light bulb moments\\" or times he \\"got it\\". He distills the life lessons he's learned into a clear action plan for a better life. Get out a pencil and actually do the exercises to best create real change.Highly recommended to all who want more out of life.Mollie Marti, Ph.D., J.D.Author, Selling: Powerful New Strategies for Sales Success"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pah.","review":"This book is a collection of soundbites. As another reviewer said more eloquently, the book wallows about, contradicting itself, making unsubstantiated claims, and occasionally foaming over with nonsensical palaver.But I'd still give it a marginally passing grade because there's a kernel of wisdom that deserves much wider recognition. McGraw says that each of us is responsible for what we do (and 'doing' includes feeling and reacting).Yep. And I do believe quite a few of us would rather not take responsibility for ourselves. We'd all be better off if we did this more broadly. A new concept? Hardly. But still, important."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"TELL IT LIKE IT IS\\" DR. PHIL","review":"What I appreciate most about Dr. Phil is his straight \\"tell it like it is\\" approach in his writting and his appearances on Oprah. When a couple or any individual are doing something that's not working for them Dr. Phil is there to guide them to a starting point from where they can take a look at what's not working and from there have an opportunity to transform their lives.I noticed another reviewer recommending the book \\" WORKING ON YOURSELF DOESN'T WORK\\" by Ariel and Shya Kane. THANK YOU FOR YOUR RECOMMENDATION TO A GREAT BOOK!THIS IS THE BEST BOOK ON PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION I have read. The Kanes' book is a practical, easy to read, insightful and humorous guide to my own self discovery and as the title states without working on myself. My life, including my work and relationships, has become and continues to be much more fun, satisfying, and rewarding.I too whole heartedly recommend the Kanes' book to anyone interested in having A WONDERFUL AND SATISFYING LIFE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward, No Nonsense!","review":"\\"Life Strategies\\" is one of those rare finds, a self-help book that does not wallow in big words or esoteric concepts. Mr. McGraw outlines his steps for success in life in simple, direct, yet engagingly written chapters. The organization of the book is excellent throughout and reflects an author who has had extensive experience in dealing with people from all walks of life. He deals with concepts such as self-reliance, individual responsibility and similar notions often downplayed (or ignored outright) by other authors seeking to play into the culture of victimization. You will find none of that in Mr. McGraw's book; his main theme is that we are responsible for our own lives.Once you pick up the book, it is difficult to put down; you will find yourself nodding your head at what you have always known in your heart, but do not always acknowledge in your daily life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money - Read the Back Cover","review":"While this book isn't terrible, it is unnecessary. Certainly it's unnecessarily long. It would have made a great pamphlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Strategies was trite","review":"I thought this book was going to tell me something that wasn't totally obvious. This book was a lot of rah-rah, \\"I know Oprah\\" sentiment. It is written at a third grade reading and maturity level. I felt like I was being sold a used car. If you consider yourself intelligent, save your money. However, if you are sold on worn-out hype and want to read about Oprah's trial again and again and again, this is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"There are a lot of self help books out there. I found Life Strategies the most practical.Dr McGraw explains that you create your own experience. In chapter 8,Life law # 7, Dr McGraw teahes that life is managed, not cured. You must take control and Dr. McGraw provides real life strategies to do just that.I also liked all the quotes. Along with Dr. Covey's excellent work, this is the best personal development book out there.Another book that I suggest is Direct from Dell by Michael Dell. This great book by Dell is very motivational and inspirational for business/management people and like McGraw, Mr. Dell provides strategies, not just rah-rah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of Breed","review":"This is, of all the \\"self-help\\" books I've ever seen, the weakest by far -- dashed off, flip, and wholly derivative. If it took McGraw more than a weekend to slap this together, he was as bored with it as I am.Try Tony Robbins. He actually tries to put together books that people other than himself may benefit from. McGraw intermingles the glib with the cliched. Terrible.\\"Awaken the Giant Within\\" has actually helped people. This book, however, is simply a let's-make-a-quick-buck-on-my-fame disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Get It ...","review":"Very little of what happens to people in life - good, bad or indifferent - has anything to do with deserving. While it's true that we are, in part, responsible for how we act to adversity, to perceive, as MacGraw asks us to do, the reality of the ups and downs, the good and the bad, the successes as well as the failures and disappointments to be anything but the reality of what life really is - a journey not a destination - is ludicrous. MacGraw would have us believe it's all there for the taking. Just take a number, get in line, and manipulate others in order to get what we want. He who dies with the most toys wins, no matter who we step on on the way. Dangerous reading if taken to McGraw's extreme."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is good for someone who needs to face reality.","review":"It's a book that can help you to understand why you do the things you do. As you read you will come across parts that remind you of others around you. It will make you want to run out and give this book to people that you know. If you've ever watched Dr. Mc Graw on Oprah you will appreciate his humor in the book. I know I laughed quite a few times while reading. It's interesting as well as heartbreaking. He talks about his experiences and people that he has treated. This is one self help book that everyone can benefit from. No matter how normal you think you are."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you're into self improvement, this book is real waste of time and money.","review":"This book is full of that kind of phrases that a self improvement newbie likes to hear. To show that he is a credible man, Dr. Phill begins his book by the story of the trial of Oprah Winfrey against the cattlemen in Amarillo. I read the book from beggining at the end more than one time to realize at the end that it is really waste of my time and money.If you don't know Anthony Robbins, please look at his books and audios. He is far beyond the level of Dr. Phill futile advices, and he is man who really cares about people.Hope I did help with this modest review.All the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Strategies","review":"Life Strategies by Phillip C McGraw is a fine book about how to look at yourself.

He has you approach your important categories in life (ie; personal, professional, relationships, family and spiritual) by applying his ten \\"Laws of Life.\\" By taking responsibility for your actions and realistically evaluating your strengths and weaknesses you can improve your quality of life. His book is a fine read and useful to anyone who wants to learn more about what is important to help them live better and reach their personal goals.

I thought the point of the book was to help you set a strategy for your life, but there is a strong assumption that your life is off course. My life is not off course, I am not making poor behavior choices, and I do \\"get it\\" already. I want to have a stronger strategy and direction, but I'm not sinking or sunk as his writing implies. I'm told over and over how I need to take responsibility (I aleady do! ) and how I need to see the real truths (I already do! ) etc. I feel like I was preached to, but I don't need converting. It was an annoying waste of time. Only people whose lives are screwed up should buy this book - not those of us with good lives looking to make them better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment !","review":"I found this book quite disappointing. It's not as good as it sounds when Oprah Winfrey talks about it. It's her shows about the book that are good, not the book itself. Some bits are quite useful but I find it really strange when Dr. McGraw \\"attacks\\" some other self-help approaches implying that his is the only real one. Throughout the book you have a feeling that he thinks he is the only one who knows the meaning of \\"get a life\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"It is for people whose lives are off track, not a true \\"strategy\\" book to help normal people achieve goals.

Also in some case it doesn&#65533;t seem obvious how to implement/activate the suggested strategies. But, hey, it could just be me who really didn&#65533;t and perhaps couldn&#65533;t get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Setting Mental Health back to the stone ages","review":"In this book this man makes statements that sells books. He says people just need to take control of their life. I'm sorry, but the mind is a little more complicated then Mr. McGraw would like you to believe. There are a broad spectrum of illinesses and problems with the brain that we haven't even begun to find, so when Mr. McGraw suggests that children are being diagnoised as HDD instead of being called a spoiled brat and swatted on the bottom, then apparently he has never met my son who suffers from frustration, anger, and low self-esteem. This man is about money, don't be fooled, some people need help and this man is forcing them back into a closet of guilt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"Air conditioner broke after 6 mo.

I admit I also was a bit self righteous when I first read the title. Sure. Right. Uh-huh. However, I found myself fascinated from the beginning and started savoring each chapter. This has not an easy book for me to read. The true picture of what I have become at this point in my life has not been easy for me to face directly. Yet, with each chapter and each assignment, my courage grew stronger. This is not a book for the faint hearted. The response from my family, friends and co-workers have ranged from incredulity to disbelief to wonderment and most importantly, and more frequently, respect. For the first time, they are seeing more of who I really am. If you are satisfied with your life, don't get this book.

Dick Sutphen's superb \\"Reinventing Yourself\\" is a much better choice. Mr. McGraw is a dynamic speaker, however, this book is too long at over 300 pages in paperback and occasionally loses its focus. Someone new to reading psychology books will probably be impressed with this work, I observed strong similarities to Dyer, Nathaniel Branden, and others in McGraw's book. Now his son has authored his own self-help book so this has become a family franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Phil, Direct and to the Point","review":"I have read a lot of books on self-help but none are more usable than Life Strategies. Dr Phil puts the blame where it needs to be and make the reader understand that they and only they control and direct their life. I enjoyed the book most because it made me wakeup and finally take control of my life back when I was really in control of it the whole time. I recommend this book to anyone who once and for all wants to open their eyes and take back over their life and live it as it should."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good book for someone in real trouble","review":"It is sad to think that Amazon does not post \\"all\\" book reviews, especially those that might be critical of a best seller like this one. I did read most of the book and I must say I was very disappointed. The cookbook solutions to complex problems have much to be desired and the broadbrush categories beg to be reduced. This book is all about sales and marketing and when you have a talk show host like Oprah hawking it you are going to get buyers not matter what is says. A very sad commentary in the boob-tube world we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Useful Information","review":"As an avid reader of self-help books, I really enjoyed this book and feel it contains a good deal of information. I felt empowered by Dr McGraw's views that we are all responsible for our own actions. Although this is not a new concept to me, the manner in which he explains this was powerful, for example, \\"if you chose thoughts that demean and deppreciate you, then you chose the consequences of low self-esteem and low self-confidence\\". Also, his discussion of filters and his ways of helping the reader uncover their own filters was empowering. Take heed though, do not waste your money buying this book if you do not want to put in the time and do the work. There are a total of 18 personal growth/get to know yourself \\"assignments\\" throughout the book and you must take the time to write your thoughts related to each assignment. These assignments are extremly useful however it is certain that if you do not put forth the needed effort, you will not acheive maximum results."},{"rating":"1","title":"But how do I get the million dollars?","review":"I was reminded (when I read this book) of the old Steve Martin joke... \\"I can tell you how to get a million dollars tax free. First...you get a million dollars.....\\" In the same way Dr. Phil promises that all we have to do is figure out what is blocking us....what prevents us from attaining our goals, and we will be able to fix everything. I never made it to the \\"fixes\\" 'cause I don't know how to figure out what the problems are. If I knew that, I probably wouldn't need the book! There was really nothing concrete or useful for me in this book. A shame really, because I like Dr. Phil and appreciate his no nonsence style. But if I can't get the million dollars, the info on the tax break \\"ain't\\" gonna help me one bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought he was more interesting on Oprah!","review":"I found the book to be not as interesting as I thought it would be since on Oprah he was always appealing and funny. I found that halfway thru the book, I got really bored and all the things he wants you to right down and review was bit to to much to get into. It wasn't a bad book but I wouldn't say it helped me with any life strategies either, I thought the book was just to much work and couldn't keep my interest peaked enough. I do however enjoy his talks on Oprah.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time - try philosophy.","review":"Don't bother reading another \\"selp-help\\" book; rather, seek the well known philosophers of the Western and Eastern intellectual traditions.

Perhaps we ought to learn how to suffer \\"a little.\\" Learn to accept the minimums. Try developing your critical abilities. Try the philosopher Spinoza. Using a \\"selp-help\\" book to aid your \\"problems\\" is not useful when you are really trying to fill your \\"pathological void.\\" Your \\"problems\\" are rooted more in your culture and its/your web of belief.

But then, I wondered the same thing about some other books - like Covey's \\"7 Habits\\" and Johnson and Blanchard's \\"Who Moved My Cheese?\\".And then it clicked - some people LIKE to beat up on themselves. Somewhere along the line (from a certain kind of parent, perhaps, or a certain kind of teacher?) they learned that IIDHIAW - \\"If it don't hurt, it ain't working\\". Or as Jane Fonda put it: \\"No pain, no gain\\".And some people have captured that message and turned it into a book.Well, this is one of those IIDHIAW books. And readers who believe that pain is the only effective teacher will love this hidebound set of instructions on how to live their life.Readers who enjoy average to high self esteem, on the other hand, will most likely hate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another awful dr. phil book","review":"I read this book while in a doctor's office waiting room. It's the kind of mindless drivel that a 12 year old could write about \\"life.\\" That this man has become an 'icon' in America is depressing enough. But the fact that he gets so much airplay is an indication that Americans simply do not want to have to think, imagine, take responsibility, learn to cope with reality.

The correct appraoch would be to help readers focus on themselves AND other people, to live life in concert.Second, this prevents the individual from seeing the larger framework of social activity, of which they are a single player. You don't make change through brute force, but through subtle and consistent attention to pressure points, after recognizing what they are.Third, if I took his advice, I would be unhappier than ever. You can't make people feel comfortable with pain and suffering just by telling them that they have to deal with it. Pain is never a given. It is simply a result of bugs in the social network. His assumptions doom this book to failure from the beginning, because it springs from his own harsh view, which isn't accurate or objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this guy real?","review":"Dont buy this book, you could get more wisdom from fortune cookie fortunes!This was the most incredibly trite book I have ever read....half of the book is an ancedote focused on Oprah....he writes 5 page acedotes that dont make any sense or tie to any point...it was impossible to read without getting extremely frustrated...it was so bad that of our book club of 8 people only 1 read it all the way through and even though I was the facilitator of the book club meeting featuring this I couldnt even get through it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coach says \\"Go!

Never mind that the book is unforgivably shallow and weak, and that it is just a bit goofy. The self aggrandizement of the author who makes it sound like Oprah is riding his shirt tails rather than the other way around is pure rah rah coach hucksterism.

Substance-wise, the book does the job pretty well and lays all the concepts out with helpful examples. However, its inexcusable when a book has errors that potentially result in sentences meaning entirely different things. For example, I've spotted at least two places where the author uses vendee in place of vendor. Using the wrong term of art causes unneccessary confusion in a book that is supposed to clarify the situation- especially in a subject like property law where there are so many loaded words. In short, these authors are all lawyers who I'm sure like to pontificate on the importance of careful editing- practice what you preach!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best T","review":"Very low in front, need to wear a tank top underneath or undergarment will show.

A good quality stockpot of this size would never be that flimsy or easy to bend out of or into shape. I can't wait to fill it up with water and pick it up by the handles.

Full of bumps and twists, this book is a book for anyone who enjoys reading about adventures. The Shipping News is a book that is not slow; rather it's a fast read even though it has a good number of pages in it.One different thing that the author does in the book is that she starts each chapter with a quote from The Ashley Book of Knots or the Mariner's Dictionary. This gives the book something different and it adds to the book.Annie Proulx did a great job of using great detail and good imagery to show and not tell how the story goes along. Proulx adds many details that apply to our everyday lives. This book is easy to relate to which makes the book so good. The main character, Quoyle goes through many things to become a better person just like we have to. I found this book enjoyable to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newfoundland stole the show","review":"E. Annie Proulx's intimate descriptions of Newfoundland made it a character in The Shipping News as much as Quoyle and the rest. It was full of something ghostly and beautiful that made me feel as if I, too, had roots there. It was a place of working class people living an antiquated life that made it seem like something from a skewed fairy tale -- a Never-neverland of salt-of-the-earth tragedy and darkness rather than childhood fantasy.The human characters were equally fascinating, particulary Quoyle, whose psychological transformation was a joy to witness."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the point is...?","review":"this book seemed such a waste of time on the part of an obviously able author.

When the movie came out I thought \\"Good, now I can at least I can see what the story was all about\\", but guess what? My husband and I walked out about 1/3 of the way through - we just couldn't stand it. Guess it wasn't meant to be and I'll never know what happens to Quoyle. P.S.

I even have my doubts about whether such profound changes are realistic, but finally, I think, one realizes that this character is EAP's gift to her readership, for us to mock at first, perhaps, and then cheer on, but eventually to empathize with, since we could all use a little more gumption in our lives, a little more courage, and a little less drifting with life's tides.

After 100 pages of terse, incomplete sentences with newspaper headlines masquerading as the protagonist's conscience, I have grown tired of the same literary device being employed without end. The story seldom goes anywhere, and, on the rare occasion that it does, it is at such a painfully slow pace that by the time the author is done with the all the irrelevant verbiage, the reader has lost interest. Indeed, it is mysterious how this novel became a best seller, a prizewinner, and the subject of a movie. I do not question the author's noble ambitions; I am just regretful that they aren't realized in this writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plainsong - with cold water","review":"Here I go again, out on a limb - or is that plank? As I said of Kent Haruf's \\"Plainsong,\\" this book is too \\"artsy\\" for me. I borrowed the unabridged audio version from my local library system (Thank Goodness!) for a recent long car trip.What we have here is a failure to communicate or to adequately introduce characters - they just suddenly appear and disappear in a fog of what the author must consider \\"beautiful new prose.\\" After re-winding several times to answer the question, \\"Now who is THIS?\\" I hit the Eject button midway through Tape 1/Side 1 and drove on through the beautiful North Dakota Plains in silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"The voice of dissention ...","review":"I must agree with the previous reviewer from Chicago - I got about halfway through this book and couldn't finish (VERY unusual for me). I started with high hopes as the characters started to take shape, but after getting halfway through the book no further character development had transpired! It just couldn't keep my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same story... different setting","review":"A lot of books are about man's struggle, etc. Frankly, it gets a bit boring and \\"ho-hum\\" after awhile. The only difference with this novel is the location: Newfoundland.As a Canadian, I have been to Newfoundland and I think the author's depiction is really off base. I believe it gives readers a false impression of what this maritime province is really like.Some characters are annoying and I'm not a huge fan of her narrative voice. I also dislike the excessive use of sentence fragments. This is, of course, personal preference. My opinion of the book is that the use of descriptive detail and imagery and other literary devices conceals the fact that the plot is fairly bland."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't find plot or meaning in long, choppy description.","review":"When I began reading The Shipping News for my 12th grade English class, my teacher warned the class that the writing style was somewhat difficult to adjust to. This was an enormous understatement. Proulx writes in choppy fragments, causing the reader to constantly question what she is actually trying to say. Her descriptions are drawn out with very little actual plot. (200 pages describing the nature of Newfoundland may be beautiful, but it isn't really a novel). Although the book is supposed to describe Quoyle's growth and development as a character, it seems that only the situation around him improves, while Quoyle himself doesn't really change. Unfortunately I was never able to adjust myself to the writing style or attach myself to the characters. I'm sorry to say that this is one of the worst books that I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"I got within 100 pages of finishing The Shipping News when it occurred to me that I no longer cared about a single one of the characters. I really, really tried to like this book, but it just wasn't happening, then I got tired of trying. Reading a book should be a lot more fun than this was. Yawn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is as tumescent as a yachtful of mashed yams","review":"See, I can do Annie Proolxz similes too! I must be a lyrical and talented writer!What did Truman Capote say about 'On The Road?' \\"That's not writing, that's typewriting.\\" He could have been talking about this book. Give your fingers a rest, Annie, or learn to write an elegant, declarative English sentence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save me from Pulitzer Prize Books","review":"How such a poorly written book won a Pulitzer Prize is beyond me. Gimicky prose with continuous annoying sentence fragments drove me nuts and kept distracting from the story line. Story line was mediocre at best. There was more boring prose about the driveway up to the house than about some characters. At least the movie had some visual stimuli to keep it going. Save the gimick writing and give me some decent readable English."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real snoozer","review":"Rarely do I put a book down without finishing it.

My preference is Scandinavian crime (Stieg Larsson, Jo Nesbo, Henning Mankell, Hakan Nesser, etc.), but I actually enjoy ALL types of material.Thus, it was with some great deal of anticipation that I checked \\"The Shipping News\\" out from my local library, particularly in view of its fame, not to mention a Pulitzer Prize, to boot.Once I began the book, I quickly realized that I did not like Proulx's writing style. I hoped the plot, characters, and other aspects of the novel would compensate. Regrettably, things went downhill quickly for me.This is, beyond any doubt, the positively worst thing I have ever attempted to read. I could not bring myself to get past 60 pages. It has absolutely NO redeeming features, and is so utterly awful that I truthfully have no words appropriate to describe how much I hated it.If I could give it zero stars, I would.

It unnerved me, made me edgy. I know there are probably some people out there going, \\"That's right! That's it!! It unnerved you like a good novel should!!!\\" Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Even edgy, unnerving books should allow you room to slip into the prose and become one with it. I tried in vein to slip into this book. It had nothing to do with the subject matter, just the style of writing. If this is what makes a Pulitzer prize-winning novel, you can count me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pathetic character without redemption","review":"I had no sympathy for Quoyle or his situation. He seemed to be someone letting the tide of life carry him along, not an active participant. I found him pathetic with few redeeming qualities. An unsympathetic character made this book hard to read and not very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!Can't get any worse than this!!!","review":"The Shipping news is about an average guy named Quoyle who tries to start a new life in Newfoundland. His two-timing wife died in a car crash and his parents have committed suicide so his aunt comes down to stay with Quoyle and his two lovely young girls. Soon after the aunt, Quoyle and the girls set off to Newfoundland to start a new life. Quoyle gets a job at the local news paper and the aunt sets up an upholstery shop. They both uncover various things about there past and their ancestors. This whole plot line is just way to confusing and not interesting enough. This book is lacking in irony. There are no surprises or any hooks to pull you in. You also don't feel any connection to the characters and it is pointless to read. This book is filled with detail, but it uses such strong vocabulary you forget what is being described in the first place. This book seems to go on forever; the pages just drag on and on. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD","review":"see above. Seriously...I have had a run of bad luck.

The book drones on and on and on. Not much ever happens story-wise. Just one narrative after another about the characters' totally ordinary daily life.

Linking graphic imagery of Newfoundland with the life story of her protagonist, Proulx has created a character with whom the reader can both relate and empathize. The book is a distillation of life itself, covering episodes of pain and suffering, love and loss and with a denouement as poignant in its optimism as could be hoped. The book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who has experienced adversity and seeks within themselves the courage and will to carry on"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative and overpraised","review":"Proulx novel is in the tradition of those contemporary American novelists who cannot disgengage their voices from the previous generation of more distinguished storytellers. It displays a somewhat lively imagination, but one in which scenes and characters are drawn through the lens of so many novels before it. The characterizations are affected and mannered, and the narrative itself never manages to break out of its studied grooves. Although the novel attempts moments of poetic intensity, and occasionally manages to acheive a vision of the natural world, such moments stand to the side of the bulk of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Bad Things Happen To Stupid People","review":"I read this book while visiting some relatives in Nova Scotia a few years back. Having read it already, my aunt gave it to me with the lukewarm encouragement, \\"It's won several awards, they say.\\"None of the characters engaged me in any way. Nothing compelling seemed to happen, perhaps the only exception being when Wavey revealed her late husband's true self. But by then it was too late in the book for me to really care. As a whole, it seemed to be the same sort of misadventures of the maladroit as _Beavis and Butthead_, a work that can only be enjoyed by standing steadfastly outside the narrative frame and smirking at the mishaps within.After vacation, I got rid of the book by handing it off to one of my co-workers. His reaction to it was, \\"Great books don't come out every year. Sometimes not even good ones come out. But every year, they still have to pass out the awards.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by Jethro!","review":"Do you remember the Beverly Hillbilly episode, when jethro threw a bunch of paint on to a canvase.

This book would be a grade \\"D\\" by my high school english teacher. It is so poorly written that it actually sound good, in fact great, but makes no sence...but the critics are ashamed to admit it...so the award it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird book, hard to get through","review":"The Shipping News by Annie Proulx is a rather odd book. Little action, nice descriptions of Nova Scotia, and far fetched characters are in this book.The book tells the story of Quoyle. Quoyle is a newspaper reporter for a 3rd rate paper in New York. He is ugly, fat, and has very low self esteem. After his wife leaves him for another man and sells his two daughters (as I said, odd book), his wife dies in a car accident. Quoyle takes back his kids and moved back to his ancestrial homeland of Killick-Claw Nova Scotia. There he lives day-to-day.I read this book with several other people. All of them found this book very boring and hard to get through. Nobody felt any remorse for the protaganists problems, or even cared.I would not suggest this book. It is kinda like a roller coaster,once you think that you are going for the sky (an interesting plot development), you find yourself plunging toward the ground. For the story gets worse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book but was sorely disappointed! A dreadful tale about a dull person who has nothing good happen. Not recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pulizer Prize Winning Snore","review":"Maybe as a Pulizer Prize winner I guess I expected more, but even 100 pages into it I started guessing that the reviewers fell asleep while reading it and just dreamed it was a good book. A little harsh? Maybe. But the characters were boring (not to mention self-pitiful and all around pathetic, I really couldn't care less about them), storyline predictable, and the setting couldn't have been more dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Colossal Bore","review":"All of the Pulitzer Prizes in the world (yes, this book won in 1994) can't save \\"The Shipping News\\" from terminal boredom. Proulx belongs to a segment of the modern school which deemphasizes plot, which might work if the characters and their inner thoughts were fascinating. But this essentially plotless novel is populated by some very dull individuals. It's one thing to write well, which Proulx does, but it's another thing to have something to write about. If your want to read a book which celebrates ordinariness, this slight tale might be for you, but don't be surprised if you, too, end up as bored as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"pulitzer schmlutizer","review":"Like others, I don't get how this book won any type of award. That was the reason I kept reading this family yarn set in Newfoundland. I actually thought the first half of the book was interesting and liked the imagery used by the author. Quoyle, a young widowed father of two young girls and the rest of the cast were quirky and I felt the story was setting up a more interesting second half. Boy was I wrong! To use the author's style of short sentences. Boring. Goes downhill. Not. Maybe some may like her abstract way of communicating a story...read at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shipping News","review":"One of the more average Pulitzer prize winners I have encountered. What I feel the book lacked was depth of character, the characters are touched upon but not fully explored, even Quoyle I do not now feel that I know much about. The story wends and falls a few times, just as you think the author could be creating something dramatic it stops and turns another direction, much like the Northerly polar winds.The main theme of the book, Quoyle's plight, I enjoyed. From hopelessly desperate and unrequited love and then to eventually find happiness again is well handled, the final paragraph excellent, but this theme too could have had more depth.The book is different with a refreshing style of writing, for which I will long remember it, but lacks what I would expect from the company it keeps in the annals Pulitzer winners."},{"rating":"1","title":"She can write, but cannot tell a good story.","review":"The authors writing was poetic, but the story was less than mediocre.

I read constantly and keep track of the books I read by author, by year to make sure I don't pick up one that sounds good that I have read before.I think the main reason I checked this out from the library was because it had been made into a movie. All I could think about when I started it was the description of the main character sure didn't fit Kevin Spacey!So giving this one star even is not a qualified rating. Sorry but no thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bizarre characters, bizarre circumstances","review":"Hard to understand the popularity of a book where the characters are off-the-chart maladapted and cast into bizarre situations. A depressing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful, evocative book","review":"I have been systematically reading all the books chosen for the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Nobel Prize in literature (including translations) - I am about 40% complete in my task and to date, E.AnnieProulx's beautifully crafted book is my current favorite. This is a delicious book which could be enjoyed by all ages. I would also recommend highly Proulx's Postcards. What a writer!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Boring and Pretentious","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I never saw the movie, and so I can't compare it. I'm a book reader not a movie watcher.There were occasional good moments (the articles from the newspaper, the recollection of the party, some of the characters were great) but not enough to make this novel very good.And the \\"NPR-Like\\" descriptions using incomplete sentences as descriptive devices. I found that very very annoying after a while.Anyway, obviously, many people disagree with me here. This book won the Pulitzer. I try to read all Pulitzers..just to know what is out there. This was definitely not near the top of the heap of Pulitzer history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard, Hard Read","review":"I found Annie Proulx to be an incredible talent. Her ability to convey and portray ideas in a unique way was astounding and something writers should aspire to. The sentences are short and to the point, almost like reading a person's thoughts (a nice change of pace from the overly wordy, breathy, flowery writers that seem to bombard the bookstore). Her ability to portray setting is astonishing. The subject matter however is tough. It's very hard to keep from feeling sad after reading this book. I found myself needing to take a few breaks in-between chapters because I was so overwhelmed with the things that were happening to the characters. The main character is especially heartbreaking.Overall, it was an interesting read, but a person should have Kleenex ready!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"The Shipping News didn't leave me with a particularly strong feeling either way. Proulx has a unique writing style, which I didn't overly enjoy. The style was quite choppy, which made it hard to embrace the book. In turn, I didn't get involved with the characters, nor did I believe them. For instance, I still do not understand why Petal would ever have married Quoyle. Also, I felt that the description of Quoyle's life was overdone. It was too pathetic to believe. On the other hand, the book is full of subtle humor. The headlines Quoyle thinks to himself were my favorite part of the novel. They were the one aspect of the book that made me want to read on. Thought I wasn't enthralled by the novel, if you want to explore a unique writing style, The Shipping News may be for you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another collection of many ink blots on dead flat trees","review":"This is an okay book. I am quite unaffected by it. I am not impressed with Quoyle's development as a blah blah blah and his harrowing trials and tribulations with blah blah blah. Nor does the. Paragraph structure. Really have a negative effect. On. Me. All in all, this was yet another of the multitude of books assigned for me to read by my English teacher. One final note: Why give it a 2 and not a 3? This book reads slower than an upside-down, mirror-imaged, badly-spelled Swahili manual on sub-atomic particle dynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's becomes worthwild reading it when you reach the end!","review":"A difficult book to read. Reading as a Year 12 VCE (Victoria, Australia) student I found I wasn't imersed in it as I was reading it out of work and not out of pleasure. An excellent book to read if you have visited Newfoundland or are considering going their. The book is full of mystery and excitement, love and tradegy. Read the first 100 pages before you turn it down. The first 40 are back ground which build a base for the book later. A good novel overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the OFF!","review":"Proulx is a solid writer and fresh voice in fiction. However, getting into this novel's plot was like wading through a mosquito infested muddy swamp; exhausting and painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating characters, absurd situations, great read","review":"Although the book started out very strangely (actually, it was pretty strange throughout!) the characters were likeable. I couldn't wait to find out what ridiculous or absurd things would happen next."},{"rating":"2","title":"A novel full of original, raw, language.","review":"I enjoyed this novel. Proulx has ripped Newfoundland outof the northern reaches of thecontinent and placed it onthe page. The novel's language is as rugged as the coast ofNewfoundland. The charactersare unusual, yet sincere. Youknow you've entered another culture when you open this book.Proulx's words paint a memorable picture. Yet, the languagebecomes heavy toward the end of the novel.Itwatchesitself play with thecharacters' dialogue. Perhaps becauseI do not know Newfoundland, Icould not appreciate the extent towhich Proulx stretches the English language.But even with this possibleflaw, the novel is beautiful andvery worth reading, especially if you are a fan of the English language and all of its nuances"},{"rating":"2","title":"WRECKING IT FOR ALL OF YOU!","review":"This book is GREAT!

Each chapter focuses on a particular place, e.g. Skipper Wills or the Upholstery Shop, and each setting is described with minute details shown up and polished. The characters are rafted on these exquisite settings, just like jewelry. In each of us is a store of memories about places we have been, and she gives us enough clues to reconstruct the feeling we had at each one. Fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching story of a man trying to regain his life","review":"\\"The Shipping News\\" is the story of Quoyle, a simple middle-aged man, who moves to Newfoundland after his runaround wife dies in a car accident.After arriving at his ancestral home, Quoyle gets a job with the Gammy Bird, the local news/tabloid paper. His duties at the paper entail writing about and photographing car accidents and writing the shipping news, the mundane information about which ships arrived in port, which left and where they went/came from.It's the characters that he meets at work and on the island that make the book a classic. Men and women who strive just to make it at their dull and/or dangerous jobs. Jack Buggit, the owner of the Gammy Bird, who instinctively knows when someone is in danger and can somehow locate them. Alvin Yark, the local boat maker, who sings the same song about shipwrecks repeatedly. There are many others, but I'd rather you meet them on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"A slow, dull story with settings and characters that I found impossible to in the slightest way. Hardly the page-turner that some say it is. The written language often lacks fluidity, and often sounds as if the author tried too hard to add color and texture to the prose. The main character is very flawed -- so much that I found it hard to sympathize with him during his hard times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not her best work","review":"Annie Proulx is a brilliant writer and observer of the human heart, but this book left me feeling disappointed. Her collections of short stories really deliver, but I don't understand the lavish praise for \\"The Shipping News.\\" I got lost early on in the protagonist's sometimes dull and aimless wanderings. It could be that this story simply wasn't for me. But she's an amazing writer, and I will keep reading her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious","review":"i saw one review that compared this novel to those of one of my favorite authors, john irving. not even close... his books are full of intruiging plotlines and characters that make you wish you'd never get to the end of those 600-something pages. this one, in comparison, contains nothing but fragmented description of a mediocre character and the banality of his life. i even liked her sentence structure at first, but that was a novelty definitely not strong enough to carry me through the book, which i finally gave up on on page 307, though i shouldnt have waited nearly that long. this kind of novel apparently appeals to some people, but if you like books that contain characters you actually enjoy reading about and great plotlines, try john irving. not this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thoroughly disappointing book","review":"Am I missing something? Why all the 5-star reviews? Whatever did the judges see in this drab and uninspiring opus to give it an award, for heaven's sake? Wafer-thin characters (with no development) who drift aimlessly from page to page, no plot worth the name - and nothing happens! You almost feel like screaming at the author: \\"For God's sake, you're in charge - make something happen!\\", but nothing ever does. How frustrating. I've read disappointing books before, but this is the only one I can recall where, at the end, I genuinely felt short-changed. I have only two words of advice for anyone considering buying it: Don't Bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!!!!","review":"I found this book to be absolutely awful! I took it with me when I went overseas & had there been any other English-language book around, I never would have finished it!!!!

Maybe I missed something. It took awhile to get into this book and found it to be a little sluggish and plodding. I personally like characters with humor and strength as well as strong dialogue and action. I hope the movie's better."},{"rating":"2","title":"You either love it or you don't","review":"I loved this book. The prose reflected the subject being described. When the setting is being described, it's beautiful, flowing, free. When you start getting into the characters, you find that the dialogue and description are less flowing, and this fits the awkward, dysfunctional qualities that each of the characters had. The triumph is that despite their rather sizeable quirks, there's still hope, joy and incredible bravery in the end. I felt like I was drawn into another place amongst people who, while a bit weird, were all the more real. I was not just caught up in the main character's woes, but into the day to day life of the rest of the inhabitants. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly well written book!","review":"Although the piece can be hard to understand sometimes because of the constant references to boating and Newfoundland it is a very well writen book. The characters are compelling and the anologies are great! I love the way Proulx uses the knots to help us understand the many stages of love and life in general. Quoule is a great,unique and complex character that will inspire you and teach you new things. Overall it was a fine read and I can't wait to see the movie with the great Kevin Spacey as Quoule."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dramatic but dark comical of a man's recovered life.","review":"After finding so much pain in love, Quoyle decides to get away and rediscover his life with his two kids. He meets many new people that change his life, but some things he just can't get past. This book showed promises and hardships, but it didn't interest me much. Annie Proulx used a great plot yet she put so much detail into matters that it ruined the whole point. This book has many twists and turns that make it hard to follow all the characters. Also, the author put a lot of useless information that made the storyline drag. Although I didn't enjoy the book, it is all in the perspective of the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confederacy of Dunces without the humor","review":"I bought this because Close Range was the best handful of short stories I have ever read.Unfortunately, in place of the startling reality of the characters and physical world portrayed in Close Range, this book has the implausibly imperfect protagonist of Confederacy of Dunces--without that character's (fleeting) mildly humorous side. And the plot is as inert and doughy as the protagonist.Caveat: I quit about the point when the only interesting character announced his intention to move far away."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're kidding! THIS won a Pulitzer Prize?","review":"I am probably being too generous in giving this book 2 stars, but I'm the one who forced myself to finish it, so I'll go ahead.I found this story extremely tedious and a real chore to wade through. I also thought if I read one more reference to the sea or sky looking like milk, I'd be sick. Ms. Proulx's weak attempts at creativity through the use of fragmented sentences, and her vulgar use of language, only made matters worse. Her characters are underdeveloped, to say the least. I was three quarters of the way through the book before I finally realized that fat, pathetic Quoyle was supposed to be going through some sort of \\"humanizing\\" transformation.I was disappointed with this story and relieved at the same time. Disappointed that a Pulitzer prize winning novel could be so lousy, and relieved when I finally came to the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not wait for it to end","review":"This is the story of a man, damaged by childhood traumas, which caused him later to suffer a really bad marriage, and how he moves back to his ancestral home in Newfoundland to start a new life with his capable and anchoring aunt. Frankly, I could not wait for this book to be over. What started out as interesting, due to Ms. Proulx's quirky writing style, quickly devolved into a dull, boring and highly grotesque type of endless soap opera, where the character development was shallow, the action slow and ponderous. In a gray atmosphere of bad smells, bad weather, dirty places and weird food, these strange characters wove in and out inside a community portrayed as really dysfunctional. I was so wanting it all to stop. It could have been a much better book with characters that were more than one dimensional. The last few pages are a bit redemptive, but I'm not sure the entire slog through it is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY THE WORST!","review":"I picked up the shipping news to read for my 10th grade english outside reading assignment.

Try as a might, i could not get into the book, nore any of the BORINg, POINTLESS characters...this book is the pitts don't attempt to read it, it is a total waste of time!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, Quirky Book, Definitely Different","review":"Because both of my mother's parents were born and raised in Newfoundland, I have always been very curious about the place and its people and was thrilled when this book came out. I know very little about Newfoundland because my grandparents came to Boston and were so busy raising 9 children that they never went back. They died when I was still young. Although they were patriotic Americans who sent five sons to war, they always referred to Newfoundland as \\"home\\". I was interested in the comments from the Newfoundlander that found the book somewhat insulting. I wonder why - I thought the people portrayed were people I would like to know. Did she think they were portrayed as being too simple? I am truly interested in this. Aside from that, I loved the story and found it very different and engaging and loved the beautiful atmosphere of Newfoundland. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes good fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"I didn't expect to like it....","review":"When I started reading this book, I almost put it down. The situations seemed just a little too contrived. I'm glad that I stuck with it. The author allowed Quolye to grow into someone who had a prospect of finding a little happiness. I grew to like him and his aunt. While many events in the book are a little hard to believe, this did not detract from the overall quality of the writing for me. The descriptive passages are very good. You can feel the cold and smell the salt air. It's not the best book that I've ever read; but, it wasn't a total waste of time, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulitzer Prize ?? Think not!!","review":"Short confusing sentences, unsympathetic uninteresting characters [except the aunt].Whats to like? It seemed like Proulx stole Ignatius Reilly from Confederacy Of The Dunces and moved him up north.The book wasn't as funny or well written but it got the Pulitzer Prize before and it worked again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't let the first 50 pages fool you; this is a great book.","review":"It may start out a bit slow but ol' Annie doesn't let us down. An exquisitely written novel that leaves you with the hope that this isn't the last we've heard on the life and times of our man Quoyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtlety, thy name is Quoyle","review":"before i knew it, i was wrapped up in these characters' lives. what a nice book! a TRULY nice book. now, i can't argue that john Irving (my favorite) spins a nice yarn as well, but what was there not to like about Quoyle, the aunt and the supporting characters like Billy Pretty and his tale? simply one of the great books that lets you ride along its waves....if you need 334 pages of DIE HARD, don't read the shipping news"},{"rating":"1","title":"No thriller, that's for sure...","review":"The Shipping News is well-written, and not unpleasant to read, but the problem is that the story is just so dreadfully boring. Of course, writing about very simple people living dull lives in a cold and underpopulated place doesn't help. How did this book win these two prestigious awards? You tell me. Yet more can be said, for this novel presents us with the underdog's version of the American Dream: \\"If you work hard, don't complain, hang on to your loved ones, and are prepared to go where opportunities take you, there's a place for you too.\\" What do we see shining through? The values of the pioneers, of course, ie work ethic, perseverance, mobility, and family values. Is that enough to redeem the book from a one-star rating? Maybe, but not from a two-star one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"I can't believe anyone would find this book boring. There is so much happening in this story, if you take the time to carefully read it. So much in the way of symbolism, with the knots, and the character's names! Ms. Proulx' style is original, and her descriptions really take you there. I could picture in my mind the villages, the sea, the people, everything. I could smell the salt air, feel the cold and the damp, the wind and the water. Almost like taking a trip! Quoyle was a sad creature, but he learned to overcome his real and imagined hardships, and to appreciate what life offered him. I kept rooting for him to get over it, to start allowing himself to live, and finally he did. A great book, one I would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad you learned to read","review":"I know it doesn't take a lot of courage to praise a story that picked up a Pulitzer and National Book Award and sundry other badges, but this one's really good. Really good. Being personally inclined to the impact school of fiction review, rather than the analytical, my highest praise is that it works. Ms. Proulx has constructed a tale as wide as it is long, with humor and remembrance, adventures and surprises that will leave you happy and wistful and deep in thought. If I might be forgiven for emulating her singular style I will conclude with this: Glad you learned to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for someone undergoing a personal crisis!","review":"Re-reading this book. Love the imagery, the language, the character's names, and above all the underlying message that life goes on in the face of adversity. I was inspired by the way that a man's love of his children, and quiet and assuming nature allow him to embrace life again. For someone going through a divorce, I found it inspiring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was very annoying","review":"At a time when I'm trying to teach youngsters how to write complete English sentences, this book frightens me. Some student may find it, come to me and say, \\"Look this woman writes in sentence fragments, and she won the Pulitzer Prize.\\" Her prose is as choppy as the Newfoundland surf must be, with an archaic word thrown in occasionally, for which you will need the unabridged. The characters are all stupid twits and never improve, and the locale comes across like a pile of rusty cars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last best book I've read in years","review":"Writing in limited narrator, present tense is such a challenge. It forces the reader to open the pages and open the world one, often painful, experience at a time. It does not allow us the comfort that everything is past, that someone has survived to tell the tale.I loved this book for its vividness, for it's empathy, for its mastery of narrative. I wish Jay Leno could act."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unimpressed Newfoundlander","review":"I'm glad that Proulx has painted a picture of Newfoundland that non-Nflders find refreshing, quaint, and sweet. However, as a Newfoundlander, I was insulted with her portrayal of my province and my people. Her characters were belittling; the attempt at the dialect was inconsistent and entirely inappropriate. As far as her writing style goes, I do not enjoy reading a book scattered liberally with non-sentences. Proulx used Nfld. to make money for herself...in no other book but The Shipping News does the jacket cover claim that she lives part time in Newfoundland. That is because she doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awkward and Painful","review":"I full heartedly agree with my fellow 1 star reviewers. Plot? Flow? Character likability? This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. A friend loaned me the book and said what a great story it was. I'm not sure we read the same book. I'm amazed I wasted the time to read the whole thing. Truly depressing and disturbing on so many levels. There are too many excellent books out there to waste time with the bad ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"No plot, excessive and unnecessary descriptions, BORING!","review":"I stopped reading this book at the 7th chapter. I thumbed through the rest of the book and saw I wasn't going to miss a thing by quitting and chucking this book. There is no clear or compelling plot to keep the reader interested, just excessive and unnecessary descriptions about the life and musings of an unremarkable and boring main character. Absolutely boring book, what a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to read","review":"This book would have been easier to read if Ms. Proulx did not use so many sentence fragments. I know that she deliberately used them to give the reader a sense of the characters' thoughts. But there are simply too many of them that they actually detract from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept hoping it would get better","review":"I'd heard good things about this book, and when I started to read it and it didn't grab me, I kept hoping it would get better. It didn't. The characters were completely flat, and the plot...well, I'm not entirely sure there was one. I normally hate leaving books unfinished, even if I'm not wild about them. However, I got within 30 pages of the end of this one, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it. It was just too painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I simply bought the book a few years back because of the Pulitzer prize. The book starts off with interesting, non-ordinary points. However, it gets boring, what with the uncommon, if existing, words. After some chapters, it was abandoned because it was no longer appealing to me. I only continue reading it because of the upcoming movie. Of course I would hate it if I see the movie without finishing the book.Maybe the expectation is raised because of the award, so it suffers the disappointment. Her sentences are unique, OK, but it's not fair for people who do not expect such complex prose-writing in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Wait","review":"Yes, the story is slow. It's hard to get into and it takes a while to feel any sort of compassion for the characters. In all, you don't even like the book until it's over. Afterwards, when you reflect, you realize what a triumph it really was. It without doubt deserved the awards it received. It was brilliantly written and frankly, has ruined me for most popular writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Rare I can't finish a book!","review":"It is very rare that I can't finish a book, but I just couldn't do it! I found I had to reread many paragraphs, maybe it was because I am from the midwest, but the language seemed very strange. Living in Chicago area I thought I had heard every dialect in the world, but this one confused me. I gave this a fair chance and read more then half of it, but I had to give up. I don't care what awards it won, I was bored to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Tale of Human Resilence","review":"I was so enchanted with the characters at the beginning that it took a while to notice the unique style. Proulx's sentences chop like the waves, roll past stiff grammar rules, and often go upstream by replacing the tired old 'he said, she said' with a character's motions. As a result, the emotional battles are far more direct, forcing the reader to burrow in under the main character's skin. For me, it was an enlightening voyage into a brilliant, new style of fiction!Chrissy K. McVayauthor of 'Souls of the North Wind'"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pulitzer Prize-winning Classic","review":"I pray that you have not seen the movie first! The beauty of this book is the author's writing style. This did not come through in the movie, making the movie very boring.Annie Proulx managed to take bleak geography (Nova Scotia) with a dull subject (shipping) and make a wonderful novel out of it.Bottom line: I loved this book and have read it three times. I would highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully convoluted text, slow dragging story","review":"I've read some of Proulx' short stories and enjoyed them quite a bit, so I was surprised by how much I did not enjoy this book. The language alternates between terse, abrupt sentences and long sentences that try for lofty descriptions and fail. The story was extremely slow-paced, which could have worked if I had cared about the characters, but I just could not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The Shipping News is one of my first Book Club reads. It's a Pulitzer Prize winner...so I knew it had potential to be a good one! It took me a while to get used to the language and rhythm of her writing. Once I settled into the dialect, I was better able to connect with the characters in the story. I did find parts of it to be so interesting, I was completely immersed and wished I could have heard more, while other parts were a little dull and I found myself tempted to skip over passages. I found it different than anything I had ever read before. Unfortunately, the reviews from the rest of the Book Club were mixed, and the story left little in way of discussion.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Novel","review":"This is what writing is all about. A fantastic story constructed in a unique way, far from the mainstream. The characters in the Shipping News are wonderfully rich and far from mundane. The story is full of life and I only wish that there were more books out there that could create such an enjoyable world for me to lose myself in. How anyone could rip on The Shipping News is beyond me. Maybe they can't go beyond the cookie cutter world of best selling authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Found Land","review":"As one who just discovered Annie Proulx after Brokeback Mountain, I feel I have found something new and wonderful. The Shipping News has been out since 1995. How did I overlook this gem ? . The sense of place, the sights, the sounds and the smell of Labrador are all there. Creating an unpredictable cast of characters is the gift of this storyteller.A profoundly enjoyable read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone--but wonderful","review":"I'm sure this book isn't for everyone. I wouldn't recommend it to but a few friends. But I loved it. It is a somewhat challenging read but well worth the effort--contrary to the comments of some less-than-kind reviewers. Once I surrendered myself to Ms. Proulx's unique style, I became part of this book--the land and seascape of Newfoundland and these wonderfully average yet quietly evolving characters. Some Amazon[.com] reviewers complained about what I found most endearing to the story. If you're up for it and open minded to the challenges of this book, you'll reap the reward. I didn't want it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed and innovative book.","review":"The Shipping News has unique style and interesting storyline. Annie Proulx almost poetic prose was a little hard to read in the beginning, but once I got used to it I was able to immerge completely in the book. Annie Proulx's attention to detail and knowledge of Newfoundland's customs created completly realistic atmosphere. She succeded in presenting the ordinary life of Quoyle - the main character - in absolutely new light. I could see the world through his eyes. The Shipping News was enriching experience for me, and I recommend the book to anyone who likes to expand his knowledge of different parts of the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great characterization","review":"Proulx was able to give each of her characters a believable identity through focusing on their naivete and innocence. The children were the most well drawn out characters of the book because of the comments they make regarding death, friendship, life, etc. Their views are are very common among other children, and Proulx writes them extremely well. I feel that the children in her story were the most believable characters i've ever read about, due to their very naive outlooks. Her adults were also quite believable, but they didn't show the same believable innocence of the children. Quoyle's naivete had a tendency to get annoying and made you want him to stop the loser act and move on. When the children display this quality, however, it's cute and believable, due to the fact that that's what a large part of being a child is: being naive and innocent, two qualities it seems Proulx enjoys writing about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull with no regard for grammar","review":"I don't understand why so many people found the writing style so interesting. Proulx writes in fragments; it's like listening to George Bush! I grew tired of having to re-read paragraphs to figure out what Proulx is trying to say in her muddled dribble. This is not unique and interesting; it's a total disregard for correct grammar. Other than the awful prose, the book was painfully boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to get through!","review":"Thank goodness I am not the only one who feels this way about this book! I have started this book four times, only to be lured away by more interesting reads. It is just too much work to keep reading. I didn't want to feel like a dunce, since it is, afterall a Pulitzer Prize Winner, but thankfully I am not alone in my sentiments. The writing style is difficult to read and I don't really care for the characters either. I will spend my time on more appealing novels. After seeing similar reviews, I now feel justified in quitting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pulitzer Prize Winner?","review":"I can hardly believe this book could win a pulitzer prize, yet alone be made into a movie!Our book discussion book really didn't know where to begin our discussion regarding this book. Everyone had the same opinion \\"Was there a purpose to this book - None whatsoever.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Advertised","review":"I felt this book was poorly written.

I hope the movie is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Love without pain or misery\\"","review":"We could all find pieces of ourselves in this book. Lifes' journey is not easy. It's about discovery. It's about loving oneself. Simply, a nice, warm story. Cheer the underdog. Good things happen to good people....... EventuallyP.S. Have dictionary handy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Prouxl for me","review":"The plot and characters are contrived and unbelievable. Prouxl's relentless dwelling on Quoyle being such a schlmiel becomes quite tiresome by two thirds of the way through. How can Mrs. Melville dismember her husband on the barge, when we have been told that it requires four other strong men as crew members? (maybe Prouxl reveals this secret later ...) Prouxl makes Newfoundlanders look like ridiculous bumpkins (with a peculiar interest in sexual abuse), whose only saving grace is some practical wisdom about the sea. Prouxl should try reading Graham Greene or Paul Theroux to learn how to place a novel in an exotic locale without turning the exercise into a cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rings totally false","review":"Newfoundlanders, according to Proulx: a simple but well-meaning collection of losers who are too stupid to get the next boat off a wretched island, who are inarticulate and incapable of the higher thought processes attributed to mainlanders (like the paternalistic author, whose claims to being somehow connected to the province as anything other than a rather myopic voyeur are false). If someone wrote this drivel about another ethnic group they would be taken out and shot, not given the Pulitzer prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious and unreadable","review":"The author's writing style, which I'm sure is supposed to be \\"groundbreaking\\", is unreadable. I personally found it offensive, affected, and completely pretentious. After 75 pages of frustration, I decided not to waste my time and rented the movie. This proved to be a wise move. For the first time since \\"The Godfather\\", the movie is actually far better than the novel on which is it based!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, yeah, that emperor has no clothes on","review":"It's obvious that the Pulitzer Prize was done a great disservice here. This is a dull book with dull characters and an overbearing narrator who won't go away to allow me to get interested in the story. Though I don't know why I'm complaining--there is no story. A lot has been said about this being a book geared toward the more \\"literary\\" crowd; well, I've got an MA in English and I find this plotless little thing intolerable. Don't let anyone tell you that if you don't like this book you're stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the Pulitzer ain't what it used to be.","review":"After listening through half of the first audiocassette of this atrocious assemblage of adjectives, I hastened to the Amazon.com site to read what others had to say. I didn't want to believe that I was the only person in America who absolutely HATED this book. I was so glad to see that there are others who agree with me that this book is so poorly written as to be unintelligible. After having to rewind the tape and listen over and over to seven or eight passages in the first twenty minutes, I just gave up. I still have no idea what she was trying to say. And lest I run afoul of those who would label anyone who doesn't like this novel as stupid, I'm not--double major in German and English literature, 4.0 average. Believe me, Goethe she's not. And by the way, Annie, I get it. He has a weird chin. Get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this book 0 stars if that was an option.","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. How did this book ever win the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize? The story was absolutely banal. It was a struggle just to finish the book, and I wish I hadn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very bad","review":"I'm from Newfoundland and I was a little offended by this book. We are not all that ignorant, we just have a very distinct culture.As for the plot, it really wasn't great. I didn't like Quoyle and I certainly didn't enjoy his daughter or mother who were both moody, spoiled brats. And his wife irritated me everytime she was mentioned. The family moves here so Quoyle can start a new life where he originally hails from. And he also finds out that he is better than anyone expected - he gets a job and a girlfriend.If you liked the movie, don't think you'll like the book, too. The movie was not incredibly true to the book. Case in point - Kevin Spacey is not a large lumbering fool as our hero is described to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Just because her book reads like a screenplay dabbled with preposterous similes (\\"fingernails like bowls of souvenir spoons\\" and \\"the bay crawled with whitecaps like maggots seething in a broad wound\\") does not make Annie Proulx a unique stylist and a great writer. The comparisons defy comprehension, and one has to ponder over them, finding nothing, and move on, blaming him/herself for missing something. The prose is very artificial, lacking the smoothness of a practiced writer's terse sentences. Hidden beneath the contrived paragraphs is just another conventional love story about two widows trying to find reasons to love again (Yuck!). Then there is the setting: a small town in Newfoundland, where the inhabitants drink, work on boats, and talk like pirates. This book is a bad work of art and an insult to its readers. If, for some strange reason, you enjoy reading this book, try also Carol Shield's Stone Diaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless Read","review":"Like many other readers, I bought this book with great anticipation and excitment, only to be let down within the first few chapters. I found the narrative to be choppy, and the wording and phrasing disjointing. I finished only because I give every book a chance to the end, but developed no sympathy for the characters or their plights. And while I admit, I'm not familiar with Newfoundland or its culture, this book did nothing to make me want to investigate it further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece, the life of the very ordinary!","review":"I found the first 70 pages or so very tough going. I am not sure at what point, I became totally gripped by this book. I so thoroughly enjoyed it after that and plan to read it again soon.Annie Proulx build up and development of the main characters is remarkable. They jump out of the pages and speak to you. The details of everyday life in this frozen corner of the world, the chatter in the offices of the shipping news and life of an unusual family emigrating to an unlikely destination; all come across so vivid and live.No doubt this is Annie Proulx best book to date"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Shipping News","review":"I began this book with high expectations. I was let down quickly. I stuck with the book and finished it, only to feel empty in the end. I had high hopes for the characters, especially Quoyle and his life struggles. However, a FEW interesting characters, and beautiful descriptions of Newfoundland were all I came away with. I felt as if the E. Annie Proulx chose to stop writing this book rather than ending it. Of course, how do you wrap up a novel that has no story. I would have given this book only one star had it not been for some of the characters. Perhaps this would have been a better book written as a series of short stories involoving these characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hope springs eternal","review":"Sweet book, even with the black humor and dark back-stories. Quietly heartbreaking, but also incredibly hopeful. For me this book was about human resilience and the persistence of hope; the powerful effect of finding a place where you feel you belong. Characters are well fleshed out, and the audio version had excellent, engaging voices. Reading book is equally engaging. An added bonus are the absorbing descriptions of Newfoundland - geography and lifestyle. You feel the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diasappointing-especially after all the hype it receieved.","review":"After hearing so much hype about how great this book was, I couldn't wait to start reading it. And as soon as I did, I couldn't wait to stop. There is no doubt that the writing is excellent, but the content of the book left something to be desired. Try as I might, I could not force myself to become interested in this story, or these characters. Apparently, many people did not feel this way, and therefore I kept trying to discover what it was that everyone found so enjoyable. But after 120 pages, I finally gave up and put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended by Deborah's Book Club","review":"Top quality fiction. Well written and engrossing. Do not miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"If you haven't read a book in a long time, pick this up, and it will restore your faith. In all honestly, this is probably the best book in the last twenty years. A clever plot with simple structure is a great triumph. Set in Nova Scotia, a man, his aunt, and his two daughters go through the trial and tribulations of life. Very realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best books I've ever read","review":"The best part about this book, and there are many, is the characters. Proulx's development of these people, and the detail she gives them down to the dialouge, makes this book the gem that it is. I also loved the way she intertwined such a deep understanding of the community and lifestyle of Newfoundland into the story. This book is for people who love the sea, love good characters, good writing, and want to be immersed within a culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best writing I've come across.","review":"The protagonist of the novel isn't really what we think of as a hero, and the reader doesn't really like him at first. Once you get into the book, you suddenly realize two things - this simple, unpretentious writing is so good, you've fallen into the cold world of the Northern fishermen. (quite an accomplishment with a Atlanta reader). The second thing the book makes you realize is how petty and superficial our society is - the protagonist is not good-looking, and he seems like kind of a goof- that's not what TV and movies teach us that a hero is supposed to be. The reader starts realizing that the goof is a true hero, as are the rest of the plain, hard-working inhabitants of the story. This is what books are supposed to do - make us look at ourselves or our environment and question the 'truths' we've been submerged in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Wonderful Story","review":"Somehow, I felt mentally and emotionally refreshed after reading this story.

Not that I've ever done that, but I can't describe it any other way.Please try one of these locally if you can, I wouldn't suggest buying them if you can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK wiper; not really worth the money","review":"I bought this model for the passenger side of my Infiniti FX. It fits, unlike the 22\\" that I bought for the driver side. The spoiler on that one keeps hitting the wiper arm on the return swipe at highway speed. I gave that one a one-star review. This one doesn't have the same problem, so I am giving it 4 stars. Really, I don't know what the rave is about. It's an okay wiper. My OEM wiper does a comparable job, and I suspect that other after market wipers will, as long as you are diligent enough to replace them often.

Nor is it hand painted. It is mdf board and really cheaply made. I was surprised by all the positive reviews here as this puzzle literally started falling apart within minutes of my son playing with it. The paper like stickers on the puzzle pieces started deteriorating right away. I am not exaggerating when I say within minutes of opening and playing with this puzzle. This puzzle is junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful For A Day","review":"I was so excited to get this puzzle for my little ones. Unfortunately, the item description is misleading. The puzzle looks nice (before the kids get to it) and the chunky pieces were a perfect size! However, this puzzle is NOT hand painted. The puzzle pieces are just faced with a sticker, that easily comes off (in pieces!). That is not the quality I was expecting, especially from Melissa and Doug. I've had the puzzle for 2 months now, and 2 or 3 of the pieces have the stickers mostly peeled off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticker Mess!","review":"I bought this puzzle for my little one since he loved it since playing with it at our local library. I was quickly disappointed when the stickers started peeling off within weeks of having it. I thought they were suppose to be \\"hand painted\\" guess I was wrong. I have bought my son another chunky melissa and doug puzzle but if the \\"paint\\" starts to come off of that one, I will no longer be purchasing their products. Super cute designs but not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puzzle just wish it was better made","review":"Bought this puzzle for my 20 month daughter and she LOVES it! She has this one, the Jungle and the Sea Creatures. She loves taking the peices out of all and redoing them. This is one of her go-to toys every night. The only dissapointing thing is the cheaper method used to create this puzzle as opposed to the sea creatures one. The Farm puzzle just has paper on the front of the peices, the sea one is painted completely. Hopefully, these will last for awhile. Still a great item for learning shapes and logical reasoning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melissa and Doug puzzle","review":"My grandson, who is 16 months old loves these puzzles.

Additionally they were not painted at all but had paper stickers that immediately started tearing off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not wood--not hand-painted","review":"This would be such a great puzzle IF it were actually hand-painted and made of wood. I read the other reviews and I think the design of the puzzle must have changed. I was so excited about this puzzle, and my kids love it. The only problem is that I'm about to throw it away after just a few weeks because the stickers on the pieces are all but gone. We have only used this puzzle gently and as intended. I'm very disappointed and now I don't trust the descriptions of Melissa and Doug puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality sucks!","review":"I saw this puzzle at a friends house and she must have had the older version - wood, handpainted. My daughter really liked to play with it, so I decided to get one. What a dissappointment .. the pictures of the animals are nice, but on this one they are just a cheap paper sticker. The 11 mo old daughter of a friend got hold of the duck. She is still in the age where she sticks everything in her mouth and sure enough the sticker got soaked and peeled off and the duck is without a face now. And I don't know how safe this is to ingest. I know that the box says the toy is for 2+, but if you have playdates with children of different ages those things can happen. Maybe the company could go back to their original values and produce a better quality toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"What has happened to Melissa and Doug? We bought one of these chunky puzzles for our other son 3 years ago and it has lasted so well because it is painted. I just got this one last night for his little brother and it's not painted at all.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree, very disappointed that the product was changed","review":"I will be writing a letter to the company. They should no longer be writing \\"handcrafted by hand\\" on their products. It is shameful and misleading.

It covers a variety of things about the vehicle that I would expect from knowledgeable car enthusiasts, and I found even more thought-provoking points that would help me go more thoroughly into investigating a vehicle should I find a vehicle that would capture my interest. I like the hard-back format - it serves me more as a reference book instead of a field book, like the Idiot's Guide to VW's back in the 70's. I've also received detailed email contacts from Beemer owners on what to look for, including other cars to look for if I wasn't set on the 2002.

Because of the step by step instructions Marguerite gives for beginners I can now use both videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Yoga tape I've used","review":"A friend gave me a stack of yoga tapes for beginners. The first few seemed more like yoga-robics they went so fast. I couldn't keep up. I'd be trying to learn the move and they'd be on to another. I had no time to appreciate any pose at all, either, to get the maximum benefit from it.Then I came to Buns of Steel Mind/Body. Big sigh of relief. Marguerite Baca goes at a gentle pace I can follow AND she tells me how to breathe through each one. I get a full workout, body and mind, when I do yoga to her tape. I feel better, my poise and posture are better. Depression is going away, too.I tossed out all the inferior yoga-robics tapes and now use only this one. Marguerite Baca is an excellent instructor and I recommend her highly to anyone who wants to learn yoga. In fact, I'm here for another copy because I lent mine to a friend and really miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners - wish it was on DVD","review":"Just wonderful for doing daily. I took this tape on vacation and my whole family was able to join along in the morning. My nieces 7 and 10 even thought it was fun to do. My brother-in-law who is a policeman said it really helped relieve his stress. The class is about 40 minutes long and you pick up the moves rather quickly. Pretty soon you are going along with the class without even realizing it. There are days where it seens easy and other where it will make you sweat. Great for toning and streching.Please, please, please put on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing - yet still challenging","review":"So what if it is called buns of steel yoga - it is a good video - seriously. The instructor is clear with her intructions and provides modifications when necessary. She also provides adequate rest in between each pose which you do not often find on yoga videos.

I think I have read them all. I keep waiting for Ed MCBain to go stale, his plots become disorganized and the suspense to ebb. Well 40 plus years of reading and I have yet to be disappointed. \\"The Last Dance\\" has all the same characters, but I found the plot to be more intriguing and the suspense lasted until the end. Mr McBain's description of the City on page 91 is alone worth the price of the book. Ed McBain keep on writing, you keep me young."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANOTHER GREAT 87th PRECINCT NOVEL FROM McBAIN!","review":"Let's hope that \\"The Last Dance,\\" is not the last dance for the novels of the 87th precinct for Ed McBain's books retain the same great quality year after year after year. This is the 50th book in the series and all the usual suspects are here: Carella, Meyer, Brown, Fat Ollie Weeks and all the rest. Again the book is about the police solving a homocide (in this case two homocides) with all the twists and turns McBain is known for. If your a fan of the 87th precinct you will not be disapointed! A quick read at 269 one wishes the author would write even more to expand the story. And let's hope this isn't the end of the 87th precinct novels, that the whole crew will return (and bring back the Deafman as well!) for years to come! Bottom line: \\"The Last Dance\\" is a pleasure to read and leaves you wanting just one more dance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Dance...let's hope not","review":"Ed McBain is back at the 87th precinct with the whole gang...Carella, Kling, Brown, Meyer and my personal favorite, Fat Ollie Weeks. McBain uses his tried and true formula, moving the plot forward at a good pace from several directions, until he ties it all up neatly at the end. The writing is wonderful. The dialogue crisp and spare. And the story tight and compact. There's nothing extra in this novel. A truly enjoyable read. Let's hope McBain gives us many more from the 87th."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who are all these people giving this book 4 or 5 stars?","review":"I am a huge fan of Ed McBain and have read every one of the87th Precinct books. But this latest offering falls far short of whatI have come to expect from the master. From the very start the book exudes an oddly dull, flattened sense of pace and it seems very much as though the author is just going through the motions. He seems tired and his characters seem uninteresting and uninspired. The real problem with The Last Dance is the more than faintly ridiculous storyline. McBain's books are usually expertly plotted but this one strikes a duff note almost from the start. To all those McBain fans out there -- you won't miss much by skipping this one. Let's hope this is just a temporary dip in form."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Ways to Spend Your Money","review":"McBain's 87th precinct books are great but this one is a real disappointment. I found the long, repetitive dialogues dreary and McBain guilty of \\"overdwell\\". The main story line was to me jagged, jaded and not terribly cohesive (nor very interesting.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here we go again","review":"There are absolutely no surprises in this book; it could have been written by a ghost writer. On top of that the carelessness: On page 203 Lorraine Riddock is 19 years old and has red hair. On page 212 she is in her mid-thirties and has black hair. There is absolutely no excuse for such sloppiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to get excited over","review":"I thought this offering from Ed McBain was disappointing and very boring. I was expecting a brilliant crime fiction novel, the way that everyone carries on about Ed McBain, but infact, I think that I could have written a better book.The story revolves around an old man that was found dead in his bed, by his daughter. But did he really die in his sleep? Or was there foul play? Who cares?I read the entire book, but guessed the ending almost straight away. I can't believe that someone who has written 80 books has produced this drivel. As far as comparing him to John Sandford - well, I don't think how that comparison can be made - chalk & cheese!If you a looking for a great crime fiction, miss this out and do get John Sandford or Michael Conolloy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because you cannot give 0 stars","review":"This was one of the worst reads I have ever had the displeasure of reading. The book was slow, hard to follow and one of those reads that you keep reading because you think it can only get better. This one never got better but did get progressively worse. Thanks Mr. McBain. I now have one less author to remember to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best in the Business","review":"When an 87th Precinct novel comes out, I must get it and read it. I have now read all 50 of these novels, and not a single one is bad. \\"The Last Dance\\" is no exception. An old man, Andrew Hale is murdered, found hanging in his apartment, having been drugged with Rohypnol. Another murder oa a young hooker is linked to this one because of the use of the same drug. The stoolie, Danny Gimp, is shot to death by 2 gunmen, and an old woman is murdered. It's always good to see Carella, Brown, Kling, and Meyer tackle all these cases and come up with the murderer. The 87th Precinct novels are the product of the best there is in the genre of police procedurals, Ed McBain. I just hope this isn't the last dance for the guys from the 87th Precinct."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical excellent product from Ed McBain","review":"I have not been disappointed in a selection written from Ed McBain. The only way that could happen is if one did not appreciate his characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A case of plagiarism.","review":"The premise on which this crime novel is based is stated by one of the investigating officers. \\"When a stage musical is likely to make millions, there's always somebody who makes a claim of plagiarism.\\" So Carella and his 87th Precinct fellow officers investigate several crimes here, and work their way through a large list of suspects whose motivation might be linked to the forthcoming production of a stage musical.You'll find the usual McBain mix here: vivid description, tight dialogue, frequent changes of location. You'll never find a dull sentence, or a lifeless piece of dialogue. It was published in the year 2000. If the drama sags slightly and the imaginative force is not as strong as the punch that hits you in some of the earlier McBain crime novels, bear in mind that this is the fiftieth time McBain has worked with this highly successful formula."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobody does it better.","review":"McBain should be cloned. He's that good. In \\"The Last Dance,\\" his 50th (!) 87th Precinct novel, McBain retains the freshness, the sassiness, and the cynicism laced with humor that have made this series so outstanding. His wonderful characters never fail to entertain, even the obnoxious Fat Ollie Weeks. Fat Ollie is as politically incorrect as a human being can be, yet he is a good detective with excellent instincts. The other detectives, Carella, Kling and Brown, are back and they are all wonderful. This mystery, as usual, is multilayered, involving the mysterious death of a reclusive old man, a young prostitute and an elderly lady. McBain is excellent at showing how police procedure works. His dialogue is natural and fast-moving. He's simply the best at what he does. The outcome of the mystery is not particularly surprising, but the way that it is resolved is extremely entertaining. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best....","review":"As much as I love Ed McBain and all the guys from the 87th, I had a hard time finishing this particular book. I found it to drag on and on. The story started out to be somewhat intriguing, but by the middle of the book, I found it became dull and confusing. There were too many characters to become familiar with (and a few characters that need not even be written into the story!) and way too many names to remember. However, don't get me wrong! I will continue to read any and all Ed McBain books! A true fan never dies!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Discovery","review":"I am an ardent reader who scours used book stores to find those unexpected literary gems -- Karl Iagnemma's collection of short stories is one of those delightful finds. Yes, I was intrigued by the unusual juxtaposition of science and literature, especially with a focus on romance - the trickiest tightrope act of all human relationships! Readers will find that Iagnemma blends these two areas in expert fashion. For example, in \\"The Ore Miner's Wife\\" the feared mistress that keeps her husband up at night is .... his secret passion for mathematics. Stubmling upon his paperwork, filled with incomprehensible symbols, his wife panics and throws it in the fire. We know he loves her, but will he forgive her????"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I didn't want to end","review":"As I am fortunate to work at a university with a great fiction collection, I *buy* almost no books, since I can check out or have the library purchase most any title I want. This book was an exception; I checked it out from the library and loved it so much that I bought a copy so that I could re-read it any time I wanted to. After I finished reading the last story, I opened the book again, hoping that I'd missed a story, that there was one last one to read, or that, somehow, a new one would magically appear when I re-opened the book. I've not had that experience with any other book I've read -- and as a librarian & an English major, I've read a LOT of books. The little nuances of thought and behavior that the author reveals in his characters is at once both powerfully and delicately done -- a very difficult thing to do well. His new book, a novel, is coming out this year"},{"rating":"2","title":"The black-capped chickadee","review":"The black-capped chickadee is certainly one of the most beloved of birds; one of the more recognizeable passerines, it is readily found at backyards feeders during the winter, and its pleasant \\"chicka-dee-dee-dee\\" call is known to all who frequent wooded areas. It is only natural that this species should be the subject of one the first books in the Wild Bird Guides series. Filled with numerous excellent colour photographs, the text is somewhat sparse, usually consisting of 50 to 200 word captions to individual photos. Its 90 pages is somewhat less than other titles in the series. That's not to say that the text is not informative. It definitely provides one with an excellent understanding of the black-capped chickadee's lifecycle.

She looks beautiful throughout and her stage presence is flawless. Her relationship with the dancers is more believable than in the previous documentary and her farewell to them during the last performance brought a tear to my eye.The footage of her children and husband is a welcome addition as it gives the viewer a new side to her that we havent seen before.I especially love that this dvd includes a live cd which includes the wonderful \\"Nobody knows me\\" and \\"The Beast Within\\".Any Madonna fan will love this new perspective on the pop icon.

I like Madonna but was hugely disappointed by this documentary. It's not even a documentary -- it's a preachy infomercial for Kabbalah. I was way more interested in the technical, behind the scenes tour documentation of the Re-Invention Tour. Unfortunately, these scenes are too few and she is left maundering about herself for two hours.The absolute worst part of the film is when she says something \\"important\\", annoying script / handwriting duplicates what she says on the screen. Should we take notes, Madonna? We aren't all arrogant, self-absorbed, greedy, social climbers that need a spiritual awakening in order to be a decent human being.The film teeters on interesting when we see her interacting with her family. I just find her every move (on film, at least) to be very affected and calculated, which is especially sad when she interacts with her children. Get over yourself, Madonna."},{"rating":"2","title":"SPIRITUAL side of MADONNA","review":"I borrowed a copy of this DVD from my local library.I enjoyed it so much and watched it over and over that I finally decided to buy my own copy.This is a GOOD documentary DVD.Aside from showing how the Re-Invention Tour was put together, it also focuses a lot on Madonna's intellect, views about life and spiritual side.The BEST parts of the documentary are meeting Madonna's amazing dancers (particularly Daniel Cloud Campos), following her tour from country to country, seeing live performances of her songs from the American Life album and hearing her talk about the world, politics and religion."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Cannot play on any dvd player cause it was sent from out of the us.

Her voice sounds amazing, she puts so much power & emotion into every note, you can tell she's singing & performing (as always) with everything she's got. The DVD is a great look on stage & behind the scenes to get a glimpse into how a show of that magnitude comes together as well as getting insight into each one of the performers. It too is put together so artistically by Jonas Akerlund. The sound, camera work, timing etc... all amazing & leave you wanting more. Nice bonus features too! There simply never has been & never will be anyone like her - she's THE true artist of our time IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"All grown up","review":"It's awesome to watch Truth or Dare and then I'm Going To Tell You A Secret to see just how much Madonna has changed and yet how much she's stayed the same. Madonna has matured, married, had chilren and sees the world through the eyes of what I think is a much wiser and introspective woman. Yet she remains ambitious, bitchy, funny, witty and still the best live performer of our generation. Ignore all the naysayers this is a wonderful movie and it's about time it's out on DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Fabulous","review":"I'm Going to Tell You a Secret is probably the most entertaining documentary I have ever seen in my life.

This specific brand and flavor is currently brewed in McDonald's on the island of Kauai, Hawaii as an iced tea (I would imagine other the islands as well but I cannot say that for sure).I was able to find this locally on the island during our last visit and brought a couple of boxes home. I use one bag at a time in a Keurig machine to make a great cup of iced tea. Add some sugar for additional sweetness; according to the box, sweetener brings out the passion fruit to new levels.I was already fan of the passion fruit tea found at our local Panda Express restaurants but this is a few notches better. If you like passion fruit flavored tea, definitely give this a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Back in Time to the 1880s","review":"Si, an illustrator who's fed up with his job, is intrigued by a special project to place individuals back in time. This secret government project selected him for some undefined reason as a likely candidate to mentally make the trip through time. He's a very low-key character, narrating the events almost in a monotone. The story gains momentum as he achieves the transition back to the 1880s and the descriptions and illustrations of the city at that time are interesting. There's a mystery, and a romance to enhance the story too."},{"rating":"1","title":"laborious","review":"Although at times the plot proved intriguing, Finney dragged out his story with great detail over little action. The character development was weak, and the timing poor. Definitly not a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original concept bogged down by poor editing & lack of plot","review":"As with many other reviewers, I found the concept of this book - time travel back to NYC in 1882 - intriguing. Unfortunately, the actual reading of this book was a disappointment.Here's my guess on what happened. Take a New York writer, a New York editor and a New York publisher. Someone forgot that some of the readers might not know or care about every last corner and building in New York City. Hence, many incredibly detailed descriptions were allowed to stay in the book that should have gone to the cutting room floor.The first 250 pages of this book were painfully slow for me. At least the final 100 pages had both action and philosophy and read smoothly.Bottom line -- probably a good book for those who know and love Manhattan. As for the rest of us, I'm sure better books of time-travel and mystery and romance are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring time and again","review":"I love anything to do with time travel, I find it fascinating, but this book couldn't have made it a more boring subject. In the book, the government has spent a lot of money on setting up environments condusive to time travel to get people in right frame of mind, and goes into huge detail of everything they have setup, but then basically shows that is all for nought, because you just need the \\"right\\" person with the right ability. When you're reading that much boring detail, you at least hope that it serves you well for later in the book, but no, it was just that, a bunch of boring, useless detail.The book does get interesting, like others have said, during the last 1/3 of the book, but it took me a long time to get there as I kept putting the book down out of boredom and coming back to it days later determined to finish it.Overall, not a book I'd recommend unless you're a history buff of that time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"I bought this book because Stephen King recommended it at the end of the audio version of his excellent 11/22/63. King says it is the best ever time travel novel. I think 11/22/63 is in the running for that honor, but I really liked this book. It accompanied me on several plane trips as my non-electronic reading, and it was so immersive I often forgot for awhile to return to my iPad when e seatbelt light came on. Make sure to get the illustrated version as the pictures add enormously to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Five!","review":"I just reread this book for the I don't know how many'th time.If you enjoy good story telling, with a bit of history, relationship, and time travel built in - then read this. It was not the first time travel book, but with all due respect to H. G. Wells I believe it is the best, and has influenced many which have followed in its wake (including \\"Time Travelers's Wife,\\" and \\"The Lake House.\\")Finney is simply the best at this genre, as evidenced by this classic novel, its sequel, and his various short stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Screenplay Would Be Fantastic","review":"I turned my family on to this one as our audio book choice for a days-long vacation drive time. (I'd experienced it a few years back, in the same fashion). Kids included, we've all enjoyed the trip back (and forth) from 1971 to 1882. Sure, Finny overloads our senses with detail (from both time periods!) but with everything so colorful and vivid, we're only as overloaded as Si Morley, as he looks around old-time New York with open-mouthed astonishment. As for the \\"method\\" of time travel at the heart of this story, I believe it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my favorite BOOKS ... but the abridged tape )c:","review":"I read TIME & AGAIN every few years, and it's magic every time. But the abridged cassette version ... the editor cut the heart out of this book. Finney's wonderful wordplay, his story-telling and sense of what details to include are lost in the stripped down version. What's saddest is that so many people will only listen to this cassette version, and never know they're missing one of the most enjoyable books of the last 50 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very slow book of little interest to non New Yorkers","review":"If one is looking for action or passion this is not the book toread. I found myself to be an onlooker to the characters and at notime felt I was involved with their lives. The plot, if there was one, was very, very slow to develop. The only reason I finished reading this painfully slow book was to be prepared for meeting with my monthly book club. Most of the ladies in my reading group agreed that too much detail and description took away from any story line. For those readers who find this their all time favourite book ~ quite simply I don't get it! The plot was so vague that it was a mystery to me what the mystery was all about. The love interest never developed into a heart-gripping story. Overall I was left as cold as the winter. With so much research into the history of the time the author was off to a good start ~ perhaps a different editor could have helped ad a little zip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time......","review":"I have to agree with reviewer \\"Michael D. Ward.\\" This book was such a disappointment!! I read the back cover and was so excited to read this because the concept was so unique. As I always do when I buy a new book, I logged on to Amazon.com and read the reviews. I must admit because the reviews were so outstanding I chose to ignore Michael's review. Too bad! He was right. The author went into way too much detail about the most boring and trivial things! I actually read the entire book but would literally skip pages at a time to get through it. What a waste of time, the ending was just as boring as the beginning and middle.Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrutiatingly dull novel.","review":"\\"Time and Again\\" is a novel that starts of well and quickly starts to drag, once the main character, Si, finally goes back in time (about a third of the way into the book) the stroy seems poised to really take off. Instead, the story comes to a grinding halt, as Finney starts describing everything in excrutiating detail.At first the details are themselves interesting as Finney brings 1882 New York to life, but after chapter upon chapter of trivial details even the most avid student of 19th century history has to become bored. And it just seems to get worse as the novel progresses: Eventually, Si can't walk down the street without Finney spending several pages telling the reader ALL about it.When Finney does find time to tell his story, the book doesn't fair any better since the story itself isn't any good. The characters are two-dimensional and unbelievable. This is an all around pointless book and huge let down. I'm flabbergasted that some many people praise this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travel Guide","review":"After reading Invasion of the body snatchers,I sought out other books by Jack Finney and ran on to this one at the public library.What a disapointment.This is more of a guide to 1882 New York than a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of all time! I wish I could try it!","review":"I am a librarian, and review & suggest books all the time for my patrons. This one was suggested to me by a lady who had read/listened to both books with her husband.I read & listened to Time & Again & LOVED IT!!I was really caught up with all that was going on, feeling like I was there.It makes me want to look at books/pictures of 1880's New York and Chicago, where I live.I don't agree that you have to live in/know New York to enjoy this book. I wish I could travel back in time!I have been telling everyone about this book, and can't wait to read/listen to From Time to Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"An All-Time Great","review":"This is simply one of my favorite books, by one of my favorite authors. Even when we read a great book, we are usually glad when we are done. That is not the case with Finney. He puts us so convincingly in another time and place that we don't want to leave. As an author, his tone is very much like having a good friend tell you a story. If you have only read the sequel, by all means read the original!"},{"rating":"2","title":"slow but moving story of time travel","review":"Books that deal in time travel have to adress the paradox of changing the future.This slowly and intelligently does that in a way that not only delights, but in a way repeats the ethics discussed during the story. I found the book slow and boring at times, yet it was compelling and utterly beautiful at others. I fully believed by the end of the book that the main charactor had gone back to 1882 New York City.You will never look at a centurys old city the same again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book has its moments, but they are few and distant from each other. The devotion of page after page to the transformation of the NYC landscape are only of interest to those who are familiar with its layout; even tourists would not have the intimate knowledge needed to really appreciate the described changes. Yet such descriptions are unrelenting. AND, given the number of characters who are said to \\"grin\\" at this and that, I must conclude that the whole lot of them are loaded on amphetamines."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Had I Missed This One?","review":"I've been intrigued by stories of time travel and/or apocalypse since I was a teenager in 1950 (\\"Earth Abides\\"). It's difficult for me to comprehend that I didn't discover \\"Time and Again\\" of 1970, which may well be the best of these genres, until here in 2007! I recommend it highly. Even stronger recommendations are unknowingly provided by some of its one-star reviews, so don't overlook them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time and again a good read.","review":"I discovered this book not in its own time, but when its sequel, Time After Time was published, having read a review of that book and wanting to see the earlier work.In spite of what I consider the short-comings of the period; i.e. the we're all white narration; it is an excellent book. The author is able to show his readers exactly what it is like for those who can immediatly place themselves in a time or place in their immagination. Late nineteenth century New York comes alive. It would be fun to do a tour of Manhattan, this book in hand, sharing the pleasures of what remains of this period with the author, who obviously loved the time and place he wrote about.I would reccommend this book and its sequel to anyone. It is a keeper, worth reading again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, well-plotted, mesmerizing tale...","review":"The descriptions of 1882 New York smack of reality more than anything I have ever read. The reactions of the protagonist are the best of any time travel novel I have ever read - truly amazingly authentic. The tale starts out slowly, but brings the reader to an awesome action-packed, never-rushed conclusion. Extremely satisfying. A beautiful, thought-provoking story. There is everything here, science fiction, mystery, action, philosophy, and a bit of romance. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Letter to New York","review":"This book will appeal to readers who like a slower, more descriptive story, especially those who love New York, because the author describes the city as it was in 1882 in minute detail, and works a famous fire in the World Building into the plot.Unfortunately, I found it to be boring and dated; the references to the typing pool or someone's \\"girl\\" unintentionally hilarious. I was frequently reminded ofSomewhere In Time(another time travel book in which the time travel mechanism is not explained other than a sort of self-hypnosis), but it did not have the romance story to keep me interested (or much plot at all)."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE MOST FUN YOU'LL HAVE READING A BOOK!","review":"This is a time-travel tale about going back to 1880's old New York, the nostalgia for a better time, the magic of romance, the intrigue of mystery. Reading it was the most fun I've had reading a book. The reader is really pulled into the past. Look for the Robert Redford film and the Broadway musical coming soon!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"Once I started this work, I couldn't put it down. The writing isn't perfect and the paragraphs are choppy. However, the premise of the story and Finny's ability to create compelling characters who inhabit a fully real and vivid world is unlike anything I've read. I found myself not wanting to leave the world he creates for a reader because he brought it alive so well. This is one classic that lives up to its reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"unforgettable","review":"The first time I tried to read this book I got frustrated and quit. Gave it another go later on and then it clicked with me. It is a tremendous book and it is the detail that makes you feel you're taking the trip in time yourself. Instead of having Si Morely meet up with famous people, he interacts with the ordinary people of the time and it really brings the era to life. I'll be honest, I thought that the sequel, \\"Time After Time\\" was a terrible and a waste of time. Finney spent pages going on about 19th century vaudeville. But \\"Time and Again\\" is just a terrific, warm and thoughtful book. I thought I read once that Robert Redford owned the film rights. It is a book that deserves to be made into a picture, no doubt about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story but disappointing","review":"Having read Finney's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, I expected the best. And this book presented an unexpected twist on time travel. (No, I won't reveal it.) But, just before the end, in chapter 21, the plot takes a disappointing turn, as protagonist Si gets preachy and politically correct. (Maybe because it was written in 1970?) It was downhill from there, except for an unexpected O.Henry-type ending. But I'm still a Jack Finney fan! (I read a trade paperback edition.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"I read this book over 20 years ago, both my husband and I love it. I am buying it again to read it with another frame of mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Work!","review":"Jack Finney is a classic storyteller not outdone by any other. His timelessness transends all other work of the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"New York backtrip experiment.A man becomes involved in a project that apparently can place someone back in late 19th century New York City. He has to study up and learn how to fit in to that particular society.There is quite some detail spent on small facts about how people lived and looked in that period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique time traveling","review":"This is an exceptionally fine novel. It is a \\"time travel\\" novel (nothing like any you have read before); it is an historical novel in many ways (in its portrayal of late 19th century New York); it is a mystery; and it is a love story. But what makes this book so engaging are the characters that inhabit both present and past. They are vivid and authentic and easily related to, even those from a completely different era (actually, particularly those from the different era). The plotting is very well paced, and although in another author's hands it could have been complicated, Finney does a superb job of laying the foundation for each succeeding chapter. A highly recommended read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice read","review":"I read this book in one sitting in 1975. I thought that Mr. Finney painted nice word pictures of a simpler time. I'm going to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding once you make it past the first few chapters","review":"This book starts out slow, but once you get past the first few chapters you won't be able to put it down. If you know anything about New York, you will find it fascinating. I'm not sure if it would be as appealing to someone who has never been to New York but the story is good regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"The only reason that I don't give this book 5 stars is because it is hard to get into. Once you get into it though, it is one of the best stories concerning time travel that you will ever read. It's no wonder that people in Hollywood are falling over themselves to make this into a movie (which reminds me, it is a lot like \\"Somewhere in Time\\" but much,much better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"This book is terrible... not only is it really written badly, but the details get way out of hand: for some reason the author thinks that we are interested in every single action of this Simon Morley guy, from reading the newspaper to taking a walk in the park. This book's only good point is that some of the historical stuff is cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and Again-a boring title for a boring book !!!!!!!!1","review":"Although I am one of the biggest time travel fans there are, even I couldn't put up with the long, drawn out pace of this book. The premise is good (find and purchase a few blocks of pristine, undisturbed victorian buildings in New York City, dress up some actors as if they were from 1890, and voila ! your contractor-travelers can then go to the area, and simply by being there, will find themselves back in 1890 !!).But, the writing here seems to have as its main goal, stretching out this premise and the story to 250 pages so that (maybe) a full length novel will sell more copies than a short story. The author really could have told this story with more suspense and interest included, in about 40 to 50 pages. So, in my opinion, pass on this book and read one excellent, intriguing example of time travel experience, such as Timeline by Michael Chrichton."},{"rating":"1","title":"time travel for dummies","review":"As other customer reviews have noted, this novel is occasionally charming. But it is hard to ignore that the mechanism of time travel, which is central to the story, is barely examined - let alone explained. This renders the book whimsical fantasy. It is also - no pun intended - dated, if only for the sexist descriptions of what makes the female characters attractive to the jerk who tells this tale. The accompanying appropriated illustrations and photographs are feebly selected with insipid captions. I never believed for one second that \\"Si\\" made a living as a commercial artist. \\"Time and Again\\" is unusually lame for a cult novel and I don't understand its popularity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great-UNTIL THE END!","review":"I enjoyed the book immensely...until the end. He ruined the book! With the horrible ending and solidified with stupidity by making that guy not meet his wife, how stupid is that! VERY!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"90% nostalgia, 8% romance/adventure,2 % fantasy","review":"I enjoyed most of this. 90% of it is often excruciatingly detailed nostalgia/travelogue of 1880s NYC; 8% is fun romance/adventure and 2% is sci-fi/fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Time Travel Book With Horrible Paradox!","review":"I thought this book was mostly boring. The first HALF of the book was just the characters talking about time travel. I found the plot dull. The man character, Si, has a girlfriend, who has a mysterious letter from the past. He goes back like 100 years and watched get mailed. Wow, so boring.The last quarter of the book has some exciting moments, involving an 1882 police chase.Then, the most horrible thing a time travel can do is create an obvious time paradox. Si goes back in time and stops this time travel expirement from even happening! Which means Si being in 1882 becomes inpossible!Yea, I didn't like this book. Don't waste you time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"Reading Time and Time Again by Finney is quite possibly the worst waste of time that I have ever experienced. The mind numbingly detailed descriptions of various items having nothing to do with the story line seem to drag on forever. Few of the characters were interesting and the end was predicable. Written properly, this could of been an okay short story. The only reason that I finished this story was to be able to write this review. My advise is to spend your time and money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"You don't know Jack... Finney.","review":"I had to read and research this book for a paper at my school, but found that a majority, well, all of his stories lacked a plot. Oh yeah, having some guy with \\"magic\\" glasses is cool, and being able to travel back in time may be fun, but a great example to prove my point would have to be \\"Where the Cluetts Are.\\" That was not only the most boring, but made the least amount of sense as to WHY he wrote this story, it means nothing! My advise, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a great read! A suprising ending. You will love this book if you like New York and victorian era history."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect first humor book","review":"We loved this book. It is one of the first I ever think of for the younger than 6 crowd. I think it helps with early reading and early sense of humor. It starts out pretty mundane, and you are wondering about what bias there is going to be about dirt. Then the illustration takes over and it's funny and it ends up mundane and bright - which is also funny. I am giving it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is the funniest part.","review":"I bought this book for my 1-year-old based on the funny title. Trust me, that was the only funny part of the book. The rest is too simplistic to even capture a child before it is over. She's 18 months old now and still doesn't want to read this book. And she loves books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitamura's books got my son reading","review":"I've surrounded my son with books since the day he was born but he didn't take much interest. This book finally got his attention. He would pull out ALL the books in his bookshelf until he found 'Duck is Dirty' and wanted it read to him over and over. Eventually, he wanted to read the other 3 books and then blossomed from there. My nephew who was three months older wasn't interested in books either. During a Christmas visit, he ALSO got hooked on 'Duck is Dirty' along with the other Kitamura books. Since then, he loves reading.

Instead of spreading a thin layer of glue to the scuff area and letting it dry, I resorted to applying a patch to the unglued puncture area. Removing the backing from the patch exposed the sticky side that seemed to adhere to the tube well enough, but alas the patch gave out after less than a minute back on the road. Luckily I only had a mile to walk the bike back to the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need closure!","review":"Even though Kesey still displays his personal talent for characterization and interest, this book wholly failed.Why? The ending.Yes, one can argue that it is the ride that makes the book, but a failed ending, no matter what, can ruin even the most intruiging story.It's not that I consider the ending of A Sailor Song to be horrible- it's the fact that there seems to be no ending in the first place. Like Seinfeld, I need closure!Even for the ultimate failing, this book still deserves a two-star rating, if only for the story of the Backatcha Bandit. The characters are wonderful, and certainly unique to Kesey. From the reluctant hero to the mutt/Jamaican ladies' man, the characters are certianly colorful enough to keep one's attention.If it's Kesey characters you want, I recommend this book- but don't expect an ending of the caliber of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's nest- or an ending at all, for that matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible dissappointment","review":"Firstly, this is a science fiction book by Ken Kesey. That's a bit odd. There are quite a few characters in the book, some of whom are not very well sketched out. There are several odd plot lines that develop, a handful of which get some closure. What really happens is that several possibilities are outlined, and then I guess Ken just got tired and decided to just end the book. Bam! It's done. Some new story line pops up and within a handful of pages the whole book is dropped suddenly to a close. It did have a decent start and, although it was a bit bombastic, had some appealing moments. But I would *not* recommend this book. Especially if you've read other Kesey books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sailor Song","review":"This is one of the worst books that I have ever read.

I highly recommend it to parents and teachers (school, church or house church setting). It definately encouraged me to instill the value of prayer in kids now while they are young. It gives examples of kids praying, their child like faith, and the answers God gave. There are questions and practical ideas at the end of each chapter to help you teach/encourage your children to pray. It encouraged me to have child like faith. I am a parent and a teacher. I have used several ideas in it to help my kids, at home and at church, grow in the way they pray. It can be used with teens too.

My last beanbag was a full size which allowed to rest my legs on it while it also supported my upper body and I bought it at target for $20 and even though 2 years later it ripped it was a far better buy than this product can ever hope to be.I hope this helps you in your purchasing decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Bean Bag","review":"The Bean Bag lost its shape after only 4 months of use.

Leviev is a forceful and energetic player, even when playing a ballad, and stepping outside the bounds of straight jazz gives him the opportunity to showcase that ability quite well. This album makes me wish that Laszlo Gardony (a Hungarian jazz pianist) would draw more heavily on his roots.Further listening: Laszlo Gardony's \\"Behind Open Doors,\\" and Garrison Fewell & Laszlo Gardony's \\"Reflection of a Clear Moon.\\" For a guitar-based mix of jazz and Eastern European music, try the duet albums between Fareed Haque and Goran Ivanovic.

I have my own opinion of it. The warning is: there's a swear word about two-thirds of the way through the book; a totally unnecessary one. I hate it when children's books have \\"bad\\" swear words (or any, actually) in them. Also, I think they're calling it a fantasy, but it's Science Fiction--I mean, a name like \\"organazoomers\\" to describe tree cells that transport people . . . that's a sci fi name! So don't buy this book. If you want to, read it, but it's not in the same class as Harry Potter. It is poorly plotted, none of the characters are very likeable and Earthaven may be worth saving to the people that live there, but it was too easy to feel that they were really nasty people who weren't worth saving."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting new fantasy novel.","review":"Natalie thinks she is just an ordinary girl.

This book is terrible. Poorly written, padded, inconsistent, and poorly plotted. The author attempts to provide motivation for Si to go back to 1912, but never provides the plant for his supposed reason for going back. What is this book? A man with a camera wandering around. It seems like half the book is just quotes from old newspaper articles of 1912. Bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Sequel","review":"I happened across Finney's Time and Again and it was a delight...highly original, vivid in its descriptions of 19th century New York with an engaging plot and characters. This sequel is a messy follow-up that is just too forced. One of its characters states that he dislikes the word \\"nostalgia\\" but that is what this whole effort communicates. Finney gets tied up in a cloying, irritating homage to simpler times that is meandering and uninteresting. I wish I had not picked it up and had only the memory and experience of the first book. One interesting item of note, I believe Stephen King was influenced by one thing that takes place in From Time to Time...the main character hums and sings a song from his future era which causes his wife concern. That same ploy was used in King's 11/22/63."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting concept","review":"Reading these books written by Jack Finney were almost like reading a true experience.

Probably because it involves the Titanic, and I thought that might be interesting. However, I find it more boring that the first book. The first book at least had a bit more plot about it. This book is 95% history and non-relevant storylines, and 5% plot. This shouldn't be labelled as a time travel book. It's a book about historic New York, and they threw in a tiny bit of plot to attract readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"A teen point of view","review":"Well I don't read many book often but this book sounded nice so I start reading it, I think the story line was pretty good and I realy enjoyed it altough I never had the chance to read \\"Time and Time again\\", but the book mostly has nothing to do with the main story line that I loved, for exaple try to count how many pages Finney wrote about the act called \\"Tessie and Ted\\". It was kind of annoying and boring. Also I must say Finney just had to write details about every little tiny thing and that buged me.

The cover art is nice.Unlike other \\"reviewers\\" who imply that one of the strengths of this novel is its pleasant \\"what-if\\" journey into the past, I found it boring and scanned through many, many pages in hopes of finding the excitement of discovering a new era. I love historical fiction! Instead I was \\"treated\\" to lengthy ramblings on vaudeville and a potentially sad Christmas in 1918. Yuuk!

The only aspect of this sequel I liked was the way it conveyed life in 1912. There were many inconsistencies in the story, and esp. regarding the main character in the 1st book and this sequel. Did anyone else notice that accd. to Time and Again, Si's father took him to the Big Apple in the 1950's to see the el but in the sequel his father was a vaudivillian who died when Si was an infant? It seems to me that Finney should've reread the original before writing the sequel, and that he was just grasping for any sort of a tale.

Gone is the excitement from Finney's first novel (Time and Again), which so captivated and influenced me to write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deadly Dull","review":"If you have read Time And Again, you will be extremely disappointed with this sequel. In the first book, Si Morley traveled into the past and there were long passages describing a long gone New York City that were well written and absorbing. Jack Finney tries to duplicate that by again sending Si back and all it comes off as is long winded and boring: an excruciatingly boring buildup just so Finney can introduce Al Jolson; page upon page of boring descriptions of vaudeville, clothing, architecture and early flight are other examples. If I did not know better, I would say that the kernel of this book (returning to the past to prevent WW I) was originally lopped off Time And Again in order to shorten that book and Jack Finney decided to expand it into full book length just to make a fast buck. He would have been better off re-issuing an expanded, \\"uncut\\" Time And Again rather than putting out this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disapointment","review":"A disapointing sequel to Jack Finney's wonderful \\"Time and Again\\", written just before his death.

Understandably the authors didnt want to indirectly encourage readers to diagnose and prognose for their own, instead of going to sleep disorder experts or physicians. Inevitably, the attractiveness and usefulness of the book had been much reduced.On the other hand, the writing skill of the \\"doctors\\" was really bad. The use of long paragraphs, with the absence of summary, bullet points and tables really deter readers from getting the most from the book.In short, if one just wanna learn more about sleep, this is certainly a good book to look at.

However the conversation-stlyle sometimes is long, and I had to take a moment to recall, \\"What was the point again?\\" Overall, the style suited me well. I really enjoyed the book and have recommended it to many people.The reason I give this book 4 stars instead of 5 is this: IT NEEDS AN INDEX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing his touch","review":"Dead Hand is an example of what happens when a good author runs out of ideas.The plot is appealing enough - we Americans LOVE renegade Russian generals - but even that may be starting to wear a little thin. Unfortunately the characters need lots more work, the story line seems to be jumbled collection of disconnected scenarios, and the small unit combat actions - the passages which Harold Coyle has always been so good at - are pretty much absent from the book.Mr. Coyle's musings on the nature of military leadership are borrowed from Ted Fehrenbach's study of Korea, \\"This Kind of War\\" and the description of the meteor strike reminds me a little too much of Niven and Pournelle's \\"Lucifer's Hammer\\".Dead Hand leaves me with the feeling that the book was written in a great rush to meet a contract date. It also leaves me feeling that a good writer has become burnt out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointing","review":"Having read Coyle for many years and been amazed at his ability to transfer the feeling of men in combat, I was disappointed by this offering. It reads like a B Movie or an Episode of the old \\"Combat\\" TV show. Nothing is new, everything is old hat, you can just about write the story as you read along. The tough Scotsman, the soldier with the misunderstanding wife, the soldier torn between duty and his mentor. Way under the level that I would expect from Coyle.It seems as if Mr. Coyle had to deliver a book, any book, to his publishers, but he delivered a novella. If you reduce the type font and take out the myriad blank pages, the stories maybe 200 pages, and not very compelling. At no time did there seem to be any suspense or real danger that the \\"ultimate\\" would happen. If he's just going to go through the motions, he should at least put a warning in the preface.The title says it all in more ways than Coyle planned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Harold Coyle I Am Used To","review":"I have greatly enjoyed most of Coyle's books in the past, so I expected more of the same in this book. How wrong I was. The plot concept is ripe for quality action and writing, but Coyle instead spends more time waxing poetic about the philosophies of command and the ethos of combat. Of the 298 pages in the book, maybe 8 are vintage Coyle; the rest are drawn out editorials and dull character descriptions. There is next to no character development whatsoever; aside from their respective nationalities, each of the main characters is indistinguishable for the other. I honestly struggled to find the will to finish this book, and I agree with other reviewers that it appears that Coyle was either on a deadline or his new publishing house has an axe to grind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not among Coyle's best - 2 1/2 stars","review":"Although my thoughts are not as negative as many of the reviews listed here, Dead Hand is clearly not among Coyle's best works. The action and frequent battle scenes that typically fill Coyle's works were largely absent here. Instead, Coyle takes the reader on a journey of preparation that leads to the action at the end. During the build-up, Coyle goes on at length about the duty, honor, courage and valor of the soldier, regardless of rank or nation of origin. While this is clearly a noble position to take, the presentation of this theme seems to overwhelm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an option for partial stars?","review":"This could have been a very entertaining story if Mr. Coyle had refrained from spending half the book blatantly preaching about the nobility of the common soldier."},{"rating":"1","title":"An absolutely dreadful waste of time...","review":"From factual errors concerning hardware (ex. PSM pistols and AK-74 rifles DO NOT use the same ammunition), to cliched characters, to a plot that seems to have been computer generated,to a climax that was as predictable as it was unaffecting, the faults of this book are legion. I could have lived with all that, however, but for the self-indulgent, sanctimonious blathering about soldiers and their duty that actually forms the bulk of \\"Dead Hand.\\" Clearly, the author didn't really want to tell a story, he wanted to preach a sermon praising his beloved \\"warrior ethic.\\". The result is a boring story thinly coating an even more boring lecture. Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing in many ways","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who have labled this book a sad effort from a stellar writer of military fiction. The premise of the story, that Russia would allow a NATO force to invade its own territory to solve an internal dispute, is almost laughable. Never mind that all of this takes place during one of the worst natural disasters in centuries, where the Russian government would probably be doing its best just to keep up with relief efforts.Probably more troubling, though, is the complete lack of editing or proofreading. My copy of the book contains nearly one hundred basic spelling and grammatical errors (i.e. \\"loosing\\" instead of \\"losing\\"). The only reason this gets even one star is that I like Coyle's early works. Get this from the library, but don't pay money for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dismal","review":"Absolutely dismal.

When they printed out, they looked really good. There was a small problem with some of the labels - they printed out off center. I'm not sure if this is because of the template or because of the printer. I simply moved them over in the document and they printed out okay. About three out of 100 labels were messed up. I recommend these labels. I'm happy that we chose these labels for our Save the Dates. When I put them on the postcards, they looked really good =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly Nearly","review":"I wanted these labels for an alternate use. I am getting married in October, and I thought rather than just tying a ribbon around them, I would make personalized labels for them. I figured address labels would be a good size, and when I saw the clear ones, I thought they look better than the solid white ones.I thought wrong. These did not work for my purpose AT ALL. The clear showed air pockets on the bubble containers, and (even after letting the labels dry overnight) when I tried to smooth them out, there was some smudging. Even the slightest bit of moisture smears the labels, which isn't really a good idea for something that is going to hold bubbles. (See my customer images.)However, much like that guy my Grandmother set me up with when I was in college, this stuff is great on paper. I guess I can't fault it for not working on an item that is not its intended use.Luckily, I also ordered theAvery Easy Peel 1 x 2 5/8 Inch Clear Address Labels, and those worked perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap! waste of money","review":"My hp printer doesn't read the sheets right so it misaligns them. i tried a few times and they all got ruined.

BUT, not with Avery products. It is one brand that I feel I can trust to deliver a quality product time after time.The clear labels were no exception. They work great and look good."},{"rating":"2","title":"My wife used them for her job as a teacher, and loved them","review":"She said:The ability to remove a single label from the sheet is absolutely wonderful. The sheet then goes back through the printer without a problem, so you can print one label or a few labels as needed without waste.The tooth works perfectly on inkjet printers. You can print inkjet lapels in color or black and white and they come out as well as the printer is capable of producing an ink output.But the best thing that the labels have is exactly what they advertise, the \\"Easy Peel\\". Peel one label off a sheet, and keep the rest on the sheet.We will buy the easy peel labels even if they are somewhat more than the competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these labels","review":"Every once in a while, I try the store-brand and usually they are fine.

It is of the standard address size, but can be used to label items such as dvds, boxes, etc. I prefer the clear labels to others, as they give a neat effect on birthday card envelopes. I actually use the clear shipping ones for this purpose. My word processsor, which is Word Perfect, includes a template for this label. Avery makes quality labels, and you can't go wrong with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use","review":"I found these easy to use with my HP printer. They dried pretty much instantly and I had no problems with smudging at all. Once printed, the labels are simple to remove and did not tear. These are a must have if you're wanting to put labels on colored envelopes or otherwise want a nicer finish than a colored or more visible label. These work great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great labels","review":"I like these clear labels. They print up easily and look great on all envelopes. I am currently using them for business, but they would work well for personal items as well. Especially invitations as they would make it elegant being that they are clear. Easy to use, print is clear and dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"If you are a person that just mails letters often, this product is a must!The package that includes 750 labels is even more economic that the one with300- for just $3 extra you get more than double the number of labels! However, since these are clear, I would only recommend them for use with white (or very soft tone) envelopes. If you plan to use them with brown envelopes or boxes the ink may not be read as clearly, in which case I would recommend theAvery Easy Peel Address Labels, Inkjet Printers, White, 1 x 2.62 Inch, Box of 750 (08160).The printing is nice and crisp, and they are very easy to pop out and stick to your mail. I have never had any problem regarding the labels unsticking from the envelope. Also no trouble printing them or the sheets jamming the printer. The ink dries almost immediately, and it really pops out and is clearly readable (assuming your envelopes are white or soft color).I'm very happy with them and use them all the time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"truly the best panties!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"vanity fair nylon briefs are so comfy to wear everyday. i have worn them for the last 20 yrs. they last wash after wash plus stay so silky soft. they really feel like you are wearing nothing.

I thank the author for a generally accurate and error free book. Though not perfect, it is better than many Java and JavaBeans books.One thing I found somewhat irritating was that the makefile contents for the JAR utility were reproduced for each and every program. Soon I just skipped all of those; they wasted paper and room.Another irritant is that the author didn't show how to just use jar to wrap up the beans. You don't HAVE to use nmake. I was able to get along without it.I also found the 2nd person viewpoint writing style to be a little awkward (You do this, etc.) In fact, the style is a bit too wordy and drawn-out.

But Elric's character continues to be shallow and the adventures continue to be predictable and unlikely even when applying the rules of sword and sorcery. Moorcock totally abandons any attempt to set any semblance of laws for Elric's world. It's like reading a vampire story where vampires can travel in daylight. I suspect Moorcock wrote this during a decline in his writing ability as there is no less than at least 1 application of the word SARDONIC each and every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome, awesome, awesome","review":"So needless to say the cd is awesome.

When this album came out I had just broken up with my girlfriend of 2 years because she was cheating...and as track 2 says, \\"2 years is a long time to pretend.\\" The hatred on the first few tracks was really true for me at the time, and a few weeks after the album came out my grandpa passed away and as track 7 says, \\"I won't say goodbye and I refuse to watch you die, I won't forget.\\" But yeah, if you're having a tough time this album is one of the best albums to listen to. It tackles just about every mood you can think of. It's fast and ferocious at times and soft and chill at other times. It goes through all the moods I was feeling when it came out, and it's just all together one of the best albums of 2003 in my opinion.

It also plays FLAC and APE, which is how I have 90% of my music encoded.As far as the sound quality of the D2, it simply blows the iPod out of the water, iPod does not even come close. This little unit is also highly upgradable and hackable as you can put the d2+ firmware on this unit and get the benefits of BBE+, and everything else the D2+ has to offer.

The best thing about this player is the sound. The sound is full and rich, even when turned up really loud (it can get LOUD). You can turn bass up without distortion (I hate the Ipod for its awful sound quality - their headphone drivers are extremely underpowered), and you can drive lower impedance headphones than the crappy ear buds that come with portable players (The Cowon does not come with great ear buds, and you have to get something better to appreciate the player's sound quality) The only thing that I don't like about it is that the album art picture in the music folders must be called cover.jpg and my music folders all have a folder.jpg (this could be fixed in a future firmware update).

Well, it may indeed be compatible with macs, but for the life of me, I could not get it to work. I'd converted all my itunes stuff into mp3 format, but could not get any music transferred onto the player. I'd read in some of the reviews that Cowon's instructions tend to be fairly cryptic, but since I'm pretty tech-savvy, I was not dissuaded. Now I wish I'd been more wary!

Pathetic. A deity shouldn't have to hide in another country.Similar to Christian Scientists, Li has the Falun Gong believe they don't need medical treatment for their ailments and that he will protect his followers.Conversely, the Chinese government clearly staged some of the prosecutions of Falun Gong members on youtube.This is just a fairy tale.

Falun Gong is practiced freely all over the world and the founder has been nominated 3 times for the Nobel Peace Prize. This practice has helped hundred of millions to become happy, kind and healthy, yet the CCP continues to murder these innocent practitioners, and even harvest their organs for profit.

Many of the quotations and facts the author states about the practice of Falun Dafa are taken from Chinese Communist Party propaganda Articles.When a publication is using seriously flawed and false sources, I personally see no value in it. It basically becomes a book of false information which is of no use to anyone except maybe the Chinese Communist Party who have been using propaganda to persecute people for the past 55 years.I cannot recommend this book at all. If you want a proper commentary on the situation of Falun Gong and the History of the Chinese Communist Party I highly recommend you Read \\"The 9 Commentaries on Communist Party\\"In fact if you really want a clear picture on the situation in China and on major issues like the persecution of Falun Gong, the Epoch Times is a very worthy News source and currently the most respected source on China news available today."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY IT OR DIE!!!!!!!!","review":"I'll keep my review short & sweet!

Their first release, called \\"Father's House,\\" was an indie record that never made it to CD. It's truly brilliant. By contrast, \\"Jericho\\" is a disaster. It's a lame stab at power pop with some really awful lyrics (\\"She's gone away/I don't know why/She's gone away/And now I cry\\"). This band deserves obscurity. Rather than remain true to its principles, DSR chose to release this record of obvious, bland AOR aimed straight at pop radio. It was calculated to fit in with what was popular at the time, and it failed dismally. Having missed its chance to become stadium-rock gods, DSR pushed out one more dud, then it was back to the club scene. I know this CD is out of print (and rightly so), but I can't believe anyone would pay $35 for it.

They only had one CD out so they played the whole thing in just different order. This is one of those rare CD's where if you like their sound on one song, you'll love the whole thing. There is no filler on this CD, it's all good and I love the lyrical stories they tell. I'd love to hear the rest of the story beyond the lyrics, but I'm sure they're all very personal. This band is intense. There's an element of religious faith weaves through the songs. Yet, this CD came out before religious rock came out of the closet and went mainstream.

Wow.I'll be printing out my taxes an snail mailing them in. A huge step backwards since I've efiled for the past five years. I've heard some good things about Tax Cut and will be trying it out next year. Bye bye Turbo Tax...The program itself is pretty reliable although has become increasingly bloated with spam (upgrades and offers to get gift cards etc.) from previous years.

Nor does it offer options to print even and odd pages. In fact there are no page setup options.I don't like Turbo tax, but I'm afraid to switch - is anything else better, and by staying with this one, it imports info from last year.If you have Quicken, it imports data, but that doesn't always work real well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easier to use than TaxCut, but more expensive!","review":"This year I tried to save some money switching to TaxCut.

We unplug it, it heats up again and shuts off promptly with the red light flashing. Unfortunately, I am going to buy a Black and Decker, GE, or whatever gives me longer than 3 months of service. I tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"DX1900 - Expensive for a paperweight!!!","review":"Rowenta is known for its quality and durability but they failed on this model DX1900. It was so great in the 1st few weeks till it lasted when the auto-off feature became faulty as it keeps turning off EVEN while ironing. I had to unplug/plug after 5 seconds to get turn it back on and by the time you're ready to iron, it turns off again. After multiple repetition of doing the same painful process, you realized that you're already running late & not even ready to leave.Warning! It does not really matter how much you pay for an iron for as long as it works but this one just became an expensive paperweight...A BIG WASTE OF MONEY & TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought this iron because I have always had Rowenta's and I thought it would be nice to have a retractable cord. The cord is nice but the iron STOPPED heating up after 2 months. The auto shut-off keeps coming on every few seconds and I have to unplug and plug in again. Very annoying when you are trying to get things done. I will NEVER buy another iron from Rowenta because they do not back there products."},{"rating":"1","title":"DX1900 = Junk!","review":"Very disappointed with the quality of iron. I couldn't recommend this iron to any - foe or friend. My DX 1900 effectively died after 2 years of mild use (i.e. ironing approx. 5 dress shirts a week#. Even prior to the iron becoming a paper weight I was having issues the it turning off and intermittent water leaks. My mom, who irons very little #i.e. 1 or two outfits per week), had her DX 1700 die in under 2 years. As long as the product is built in China, I will not purchase a Rowenta."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rowenta DX1900 Effective Cord Reel Iron","review":"I received this iron two years ago as a gift. I didn't use it until the warranty was about up nor did I register it so there is nothing I can do and I cannot blame Rowenta for my ball drop. But a bad product is a bad product. The cord never properly reeled in - so I would manually push it in which probably is the reason it now will blow a fuse if I turn it on as it is internally leaking water. This product was never tested properly and in my opinion is extremely dangerous. I have taken my iron, put it back into the brand new box it came in and have thrown it in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed with Rowenta Rowenta iron DX1900","review":"Rowenta iron suppose to be made in Germany but it is actually made in China... The worse product I have ever bought. Unfortunately, after a few months of light use, the unit would no longer power -- at all. I am talking about the $60 Rowenta Effective DX1900!!! I thought highly of the brand, I never knew that it was made in China until I noticed the unit stopped working when is still looking new in the outside. The cord never released completely either. I am disappointed that I have to go out and buy a new iron in a rush today. For the price, I could have saved some money with another cheap unit also made in China. The safety auto-off switch is faulty. I feel betrayed by Rowenta and this product. They should keep the quality of the product versus saving money making a totally poor quality item made in China.P.S. I gave it one start because the system didn't allow for zero or minus zero rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not buy","review":"Worst iron ever. I wish I had read the reviews here first.

The light does not go on and the sole plate does not heat up. The company will not replace the iron. I have to ship it to them and the whole process can take six weeks, so I have to buy another iron in the meantime. Irons should last longer that five months and if they are broken they should issue immediate credit for a new iron and not make you wait. Mine was made in China as well. Had to stop using the other iron becuase it spurted black and then the sole plate would not stay on/not. had to keep jiggling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing performance - does not stay on","review":"When this iron stays on, it works fine. However, it turns off on its own constantly - whether I'm in the middle of using it to iron or not - and it is very difficult to turn back on. The instructions say to shake it to get it to turn on, but I have to shake it very hard and for a long time, and sometimes even this does not work. Very disappointed, especially since Rowenta is supposed to be a good brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine until a month after warranty expired","review":"Like many others who gave this product a low rating, I was satisfied for the first year. Simply put, it did what it was supposed to do.Just a few months ago the auto-off function would constantly kick in for no reason. It got to the point where I couldn't use it anymore because 30 seconds after warming up, it would shut down. Plus, the retractable cord stopped working right around the same time.I called customer service who politely informed me if it was within the 1 year warranty, they'd replace it, but, as it's not, I'd have to pay to get it fixed. I purchased it about 14 months ago, so no free replacement here.Ultimately, the problem is the product appears to be cheaply manufactured, which leads to an incredibly short lifespan. Rowenta has lost a customer and gained an advocate of choosing competing brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"great - until it stops working","review":"We're on our 3rd Rowenta Effective DX1900. When these models work, they're great. But after paying a decent amount of money for it, I expected it to last. Now on our 3rd replacement, we're getting rid of it. The safety auto-off switch is defective, and it keeps turning off every 10-15 seconds. I used to be able to shake it violently to make the auto-switch turn back on, but now I have to unplug and plug it in every time. I tried calling customer service, but they were totally unhelpful and wouldn't own up that they are selling a defective product.

Too bad for Rowenta for not testing their products properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"designed to malfunction?","review":"I decided to spend a little more on an iron that would last. I thought Rowenta had a good reputation. At first, I loved ironing with this iron. It made the chore of ironing easier and more fun. I've had it about a year now, and it has gone from spotty to extremely aggravating and consistently malfunctioning. After a few weeks it would unpredictably stop maintaining temperature, and got worse and worse over the year. I realized that the automatic shut off was being activated spontaneously, and nothing I could do would keep it hot. I even read the manual. I gave up and bought a black and decker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good but not reliable","review":"The iron works well and has nice features, especially the retracting cord and the no drip water feature. Unfortunatley the overall quality is lacking. We have had this a little over a year and it has quit functioning. It appears that the safety auto off function is broken and shuts the iron off before it even heats up. It is now useless. This is the first Rowenta iron we have had and it will be the last. The irons are pricey and not any better than the Black and Decker, Sunbeams, etc. especially if you look at the high price of the Rowenta's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who wants a cold iron?","review":"Did not purchase on Amazon--have been very disappointed--no way on earth to keep it hot----may get hot for one minute--then if you set it down to reposition whatever is being ironed---it turns off and cools so rapidly you won't believe your eyes.

Just going to make you mad!\\") And I'm not buying Toshiba again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does What I Wanted","review":"This is a low-end product, but performs well. Has played everything I've fed it so far. Problem with blank screen cited by another reviewer is a Catch 22. If you hook-up component video out of the box, you may get a blank screen because the unit is not set for component output (a selection you make during setup). I hooked up S-video which gave me a screen, made the component selection in setup, and reattached the component cables. Works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Unit arrived defective, wouldn't play any of my DVD's. Plus design and construction is very cheap compared to my current player.

Beside that, excellent choice, I would buy it again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk!","review":"I probably used this machine less than 5 times. It, like my other Toshiba DVD player, just stopped working. Toshiba tech support is worthless. They referred me to a document that told me to clean the tray and make sure I had the correction region. Totally insulting!

Do Not Waste Your Money. Finally they relented and are sending me a Return authorization. I will never ever deal with these people again beyond disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give Me Strength","review":"Never in my life have I despised a mere machine as I do this dinky thing.Bought it (via online auction, you know the one) because I have a Toshiba TV also with what they call ColorStream.Where do I begin?The tray release is eensy-weensy and must be pressed and re-pressed before it deigns to open or close.In fact, all the controls are eensy-weensy and irritating to finagle.Gimcrack is the word for this item, a thing so cheap and flimsy it will hardly sit down on a shelf.But then, I despise the accompanying manual just as fiercely.Some labor group must have PAID Toshiba to deliberately mislead and confuse and omit information from the defenseless consumer.The front panel lights up and says \\"NO\\" instead of \\"ON.\\"That really sums it up.Next time I see a Toshiba product, I too will say NO NO NO NO, and a thousand times NO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"multi zone dvd player","review":"I have now joined the real world of music.

It tries and tries to load a disk but it just won't. The Toshiba website suggests unpluging the player for 2-3 minutes to see if that resolves the problem. It didn't. Prior to the breakdown it was a fine unit - never had any problems or quality issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toshiba SD-780KR - CAUTION - Multi-region no longer","review":"Our unit used to be region-free until this morning when it decided it was Russian and set itself to Cyrillic and region 5. A belated review of the owner's manual indicates that is exactly what the unit was originally designed for. The language has been set back to English via the remote, but it still won't play any of our region 1 or 2 discs. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitle Features Work Poorly","review":"This DVD player handles both Region 1 and Region 2 films, but the subtitle feature is a problem. Changing the settings on the screen during initial setup of the movie doesn't translate to changes while watching it - only pressing the subtitle button on the remote affects that. But more annoying is that often the subtitles appear too low to be read completely. Resizing the screen made no difference in my ability to see them. The same films work perfectly on my Mac, which is set to Region 2; the subtitles are clear and easily viewed. So I'm retiring this DVD player and trying a Philips DVP5990, which got better reviews. Here's hoping...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within 6 months","review":"Just wanted to put my 2 cents in and let folks know that this machine just stops working for no reason.

I like life without a bunch of dials, buttons, and lights. This product is nice and thin. Looks sleek. Has played every DVD I've put in it (even one's I've bought in Europe). And, the remote makes the functions of the player easy to use. Especially, swapping among different languages and subtitles.Supplier delivered on time and what it promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within just over 3 months","review":"I got this from Sears for $59.99 and it failed just outside the warranty period (which is 90 days). When I put a DVD in it says loading and then \\"no\\" - which means it can't read the disc.We watch maybe three or four DVD's a week and I am truly disappointed with the purchase. The machine was easy to use with a good remote control and is also slim (which is a nice feature). I was hoping to have this for a few years but it is not going to happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 9 months of light use!","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers comments. The screen says \\"bad disk\\" when you put in perfectly good DVDs. The same DVDs work fine in my laptop. The only reason we bought this player is that the salesman at Best Buy convinced us it is a wonderful player for the price. Since I was about to have a baby I didn't have time to research this more thoroughly. This is absolute garbage.

The display would light dimly but the disc drawer would not eject. Eventually, the display went completely dark and the unit was pronounced dead. Bought another brand, for less money, and ended up with nicer features. This unit did not set it's own time nor did the remote work the TV controls as does the newer unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horizontal motion sometimes a problem","review":"Generally, this is a good player. My only problem with it is horizontal motion. On some Region 2 discs, I've found that there is a slight stuttering or jerkiness during horizontal motion. It doesn't show up all the time and it's more evident on some discs than others. Also, it doesn't output component video straight out the box. I had to hook it up composite and then change some menus to get it to output component. The component output is much superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO LONGER PLAYS DISCS - ONLY 3 MONTHS OLD","review":"I had been prevously watching divx and store dvd's on this player. After 3 months of use it will not play the discs that it had previously played and will not play any discs at all.....its just keeps saying loading and nothing happens....I feel totally ripped off.....will not buy Toshiba products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, ease of use, keeps on ticking","review":"This is mainly a commentary on some of the other reviews. Not a dispute, just my own observations.1. I have had mine since 2007 (it is now July 2010) and it still works like new (others have reported that theirs stopped working after a short time).2. If you watch closely, you will see the occasional subtle skip in playback of a region 2 DVD. This is due to the difference in frame rate between the PAL and NTSC systems. PAL playback is just a tad slower than NTSC (25 frames per second vs. 29.97 frames per second) and so the player has to correct for this in regular intervals. Compared to my experience with loading PAL-encoded DVDs into the movie making software (set to NTSC) on my computer (no, I am not bootlegging movies!), where the audio and video get highly unsynchronized after a few minutes, I'd say this DVD player does a fine job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 3 years of light use","review":"No longer turns on after only 3 years of light use.

It displays \\"Loading...\\" until the disk is ejected or the unit turned off.Just prior to this, it would play, but hang-up abould 1/2 of the way through.I feel I was ripped off. The purchase price of this unit new should give me more than a total of 10 - 15 hours of playing time."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked for over a year.","review":"This is the second all region player I have owned. This one worked fine for over a year and then the picture began to stutter. My last one had this problem too only it went out much earlier after I bought it. If you read reviews of all region players it seems many of them from all companies often don't work for long periods. I now have to go on to another one as this one no longer does subtitles as well. I had a phillips before so I am hestitant to buy one of those again either. So I would say if one of these becomes available try a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Christmas present, but disposable.","review":"Ok, I barely watch DVDs at home, however it is always nice to have a DVD player to suite your entertainment needs every once in a while.Please don't buy this one, you want something that will last forever and will not just break all of the sudden even if you don't use it. I used to think that Toshiba was that leader brand in \\"home entertainment\\" systems but not anymore. This DVD player was a tease, it looked perfect, simple and user friendly, but just the fact that so many people are having the same issue is an offense to all customers. One DVD player braking is understandable but when you browse in Google or just in this site and find out that many people are going through the same hassle, it says that quality control did not do their job.I will stay loyal to other brands such as Sony, Panasonic, Samsung, Sharp or LG as a last resource.Sorry if I am harsh but enough is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT!","review":"I received this as a gift about 14 months ago and earlier this week I suddenly got the \\"No Disc\\" message everyone else seems to get.

Both of them are now going into the garbage after only 5 months. We had never purchased Toshiba products before, but we had always heard they made quality merchandise. Well if these players are an indication of what they call quality, I will never buy another of their products. The players stopped playing any DVDs after the first few months. Whenever you put in a movie, you get a message that says \\"bad\\", which I guess means the dvd is bad. We have tried at least 10-12 different discs and always get the same message, so we have finally given up. The two players we have are going to the garbage man this week.

It's made by Toshiba but modified by a 3rd party - in this case, Northstar Electronics. They modify it so it will play all regions. In the first 90 days we used the player about a dozen times when it suddenly ceased to operate for no reason whatsoever. I tried to use it one afternoon and it just wouldn't work anymore. The player turns on, and the drawer can be opened and closed, but otherwise it will not play any disc from any region, nor will it play CDs. After some research I discovered that faulty modifications often result in this kind of problem with a player. I cannot recommend this product or Northstar Electronics. I suggest spending more and getting a player that has not been modified in-house, but instead was manufactured specifically to play multiple region DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player broke after only 4 months of light use!","review":"I bought this DVD player because I trusted the Toshiba brand after owning 2 Toshiba TV's over the years and being very pleased with them. Needless to say I have owned this DVD player for only 4 months and now it refuses to play any disks. I have put in several brand new DVD movies into the player and it keeps saying \\"Bad Disc\\" on the screen. Or, it will get to the main menu and then freeze. I've tried everything I can think of to make it work, but the machine is clearly broken. I only watch about 1 DVD a week, and am very gentle with the player so I can't imagine why it suddenly has stopped working (other than poor craftsmanship). Of course, the Warranty is only good for 3 months, so I've just wasted $60 on a player that I now have to replace. I am very disappointed with this product, and definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subtitles don't work and cd skips","review":"I'm a happy Toshiba HD-TV owner so I figured this would be a great DVD player, especially since consumer reports rates the now obsolete 3960 as a great buy. Initially I was happy with the picture quality, sound etc but the subtitles feature does not work. I've tried with several DVDs and also tried to resize my tv screen to all sizes. If you're wondering why you might care about subtitles, try watching \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" which has no English soundtrack. Then the next disaster, I played a couple of music CDs and they would skip every 10mins or so. Sorry Toshiba, I'm dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One year working life","review":"I have to agree with the numerous negative reviews of this player, all having to do with short lifespan. I have been extremely disappointed with Toshiba products lately - this dvd player, returned a laptop, etc. I now feel bad about recommending Toshiba to friends based on experience from years ago when Toshiba was at the top of their game. Anyway, this was a great player for one year, then it died. It really kind of boggles me because basic DVD players have matured, and you should be able to buy anything off the rack and it should just work for years.

It's as if the band had the breath punched out of them. But there was also a kind if identity crisis that engulfed them.

The author provides vivid details of how depressing earth would be along with its sad surviving population. I thought it put a new spin on the zombie genre to some degree. I also appreciated the brother and sister relationship which was one of the most endearing qualities about the book, since family (brother & sister, parent to child) relationship played a role in the plot development. Since earth is a wasteland all you have is the memories of your past family members and the few that are still living.I was somewhat surprised by the ending since it left on an upbeat note.

Although all of the context wasn't extremely detailed, I did really like all of the lists included. There are great guidelines for things to cover with mamas and the rest of family; a list of how to prepare for your interviews; and tons of resources for more information. My favorite part is a list at the back that touches on every type of contact you should make and resources you should try to build. I would encourage new doulas to pick this book up as a little helper to keep in their doula bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource!","review":"This book is an invaluable resource for anyone who is interested in become a postpartum doula. The author emphasises the importance of the role of the doula within the family unit, and how having assistance postpartum can make for a more relaxed, cohesive family unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful resource","review":"Mark Graham Brown has produced another useful, direct, and informative business book. I found the checklists and interview questions especially helpful in my executive coaching and consulting practice.A couple of clients dampened my enthusiasm with concerns over terminology and level of sophistication for implementation, but the material actually helped me to pinpoint their concerns and address their questions.

There is little in this movie about Russian dolls. Only a side plot which becomes the main plot toward the end. Xavier, the main character, is somebody you can't feel for, a shallow guy, that you really don't care what happens to him. The movie is long and boring, and needs a good editing job. At least 40 minutes could be cut and nothing would be lost. This rambling movie has little direction and has a predictable ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Sequel","review":"Romain Duris and Kelly Reilly have great chemistry in this sequel to L'Auberge Espangole. However, Audrey Tautou has only a brief cameo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tries to be charming, but fails on many levels","review":"The plot is uneven, with various characters getting lost and simply acting as foils for the main character, the love story sort of comes out of nowhere, and I agree with the other viewer who says that Romain Duris has no business carrying this movie. UGH, he has no ability to act as the central character, lacks the necessary looks, wit or charm -- or acting depth. Good grief, he has nothing going for him. I did not see the original of which this is a sequel, but a 2/5 is a very generous rating for this movie, which is thrown together at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smart, Funny, Chic Relationship Movie...Hollywood Wishes It Could Do This!","review":"I'd never heard of this movie before I saw it by chance, and only just now found out it has a prequel. Must see...Must see... Russian Dolls was stylish, fast-paced, deep, funny, and hopped around Europe like a travel show with a plot. The comparison of the relationships shown in this film and the famous Russian dolls (store one within another) was a perfect metaphor. I'm ordering it today on DVD. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably dumb","review":"An incredibly stupid movie with every cliche of French romantic comedy but not an ounce of life.

Where the beer flows like water and the people are friendly and love having a good time....this cd captures the essence of the freespirited Texas lifestyle and the Texas honky tonk(\\"Are you a real cowboy?\\"). It's a must for any fan of the Texas feel and lifestyle. Houston is a troubador in the truest sense and this cd will leave you feeling what it's like to be somewhere deep in Texas on a Saturday Night!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what you think","review":"According to Amazon.com, customers who bought \\"The Day Trader\\" also bought: \\"Day Trade Online\\" by Christopher A.

Look for one of the above titles if you want a book about trading. Buy Borsellino's book if you want to read a boring waste of time and money. Fights and ego stoking is what you'll find here, with nothing about how to trade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book for people looking for trading education","review":"I guess I'm spoiled by Martin Schwartz's excellent book Pit Bull. I was expecting a trader's autobiography something along the same line with The Day Trader, but what I got was the first 130 pages of Borsellino talking about what a tough guy he is and about his mafioso father. After that he dips into a high-level discussion of the changes to the commodities and NASDAQ exchanges over the years. There is virtually no mention of trading technique or psychology, outside of the constant tough guy braggadocio, which is pretty sad to hear from a 40-year-old guy. And definitely don't buy it if you're looking for trading advice or techniques. There is none to be found. If you want a nice biographical read about a trader, read Pit Bull or Reminiscences of a Stock Operator instead. Borsellino simply doesn't write well enough to keep this one interesting. The story wanders around too much and is too repetitious."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is not a \\"technical book\\" about fundamental or technical","review":"analyses, but a kind of \\"inner mind\\" book for trading. All the reviewers above don't mention that you must have some kind of personality to have success, and borsellino is definitive somebody fighting for success, and this is something you can learn from this book. So don't expect the usual \\"trendline\\" stuff or Price-Earning talk, but an inspiriation how eager you must be to be successful - yes, this book is an ego trip, but even \\"a simple ego-trip\\" must be learnend. I think it's your personality, that decides if you'r successful in the markets.This book tells you how hard it is to be in the markets.An interesting one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This book was one of the worst I have ever read.

However, in a trader reader perspective, it is at least 2,000 pips (in yen/$ term, the range in 2002) below the quality level of \\"Reminiscences of a stock operator\\" and \\"Pit Bull\\". So unless you had no other book in your mind that you wanna read or you are a contrarian, I strongly recommend you to spend your valuable time on other ones, like those I mentioned above, or scan through the Amazon database for better alternatives."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Day Trader, From the Pit to the PC","review":"I expected, from the title, a book that would provide some insight into day trading.

If you talk to other traders on the floor, and people from Montini High School in Lombard,IL; they will tell you the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not trading oriented","review":"The book can be summarized as follows: the first half dwells on father-son relationship in an Italian family in which the father is connected to the Mob. The second half is a meandering discussion on the future of trading - will it go electronic and if so what will be the organizational structure. If you are looking to improve your trading skills or obtain insights into trading you will be sorely disappointed. On the other hand if you are looking for a frank and honest background on Lewis Borsellino then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Talk About Fighting","review":"I was expecting a lot from this book, but unfortunately it didn't deliver. The book delves too much into how many fights the author has been in, how Italian-Americans are always accused of being mobsters and how his convict dad wasn't a bad guy. Not enough useful information for would be traders, but plenty of information about the author's money management firm, fighting and his dad."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring ego trip","review":"What do you do when you want to glorfy yourself, but don't have enough material for a book? Puff it up, then have your friends submit favorable reviews to Amazon.com. Insights into day/electronic trading?

Well, the book is not about day trading. I founs perhaps around 3 or 4 sentences that talk about day trading and that's about it. The authors has focused more on his personal life. This should be named an Autobiography of Borsellino instead.However, he is a good writer and has written pretty well, I must say. His personal life experiences are very touching and interesting to read about. He does warn us in the beginning that he will be talking about his life, but I did not expect it to be of such *great* extent. Perhaps he believes that if we know about his personal life, and understand it deeply, then we will be better traders.The reason I am assigning a 2-star is just because of the misleading title of the book. But it doesn't mean that Mr. Borsellino is not a good writer. He writes very well indeed!Thank you, Steve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Read","review":"I didn't expect a book on \\"secrets\\" of trading; I did expect an entertaining read about trading in the pits and off the floor. The book fails miserably in both areas. The author drones on about his father and the \\"tough\\" life he was brought into. He spends more time telling us how great his father was than giving us a glimpse into what truly happens on the floor. If you want a very entertaining book on the trading life with wit and wisdom, I suggest Buzzy Schwartz's \\"Pit Bull\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMERTÀ ON TRADING SECRETS","review":"A hot contender for the title of worst trading book ever written. Rather than a discussion of the one issue that might lead one to respect the author - his trading - he subjects his readers to 200 pages of whingeing about his victimization on account of his father's mafia connections. While Mr. Borsellino goes to extraordinary lengths to deny that he has maintained these, he produces such a mind-numbingly tedious volume that one begins to wonder whether its publisher took the decision to publish on the basis of an \\"offer he couldn't refuse\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst TRADING BOOK EVER WRITTEN!","review":"This book is not about trading, it is about all the people Lewis and his father beat up. Borsellino must know something about trading but he fails to demonstrate it in this poorly written narrative of is his dysfunctional upbringing. I am embarrassed to have paid money and spent the time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring account of life as a local in the pit.","review":"This tome will have little to offer anyone outside the pit in terms of practical information about trading.It dwells excessively on the authors heritage and the influence of his father. I found Marty Schwartz' PIT BULL to be a more entertaining story about the life of a trader. The one gem in the book is the author's revelation that he traded upwards of 250,000 contracts per year and his admission that if he had to pay normal retail clearing commissions he would not have made any money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"On-floor commentary","review":"It has been said on the floor that Lewis Borsellino has now written more books than he has read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"If you think you are buying a complete tax package you are not, the Premier doesn't give you a whole lot more tax info, but also doesn't include any state tax.

Their suggested solution is to burn your tax file to a CD, take it and your original CD to a Windows computer, install a Windows version of TurboTax, open your file, take out the password, save the file, burn it to a CD, and return to your Mac with your fingers crossed, hoping for the best. I do not have a Windows computer, so this does me no good.For at least one week Intuit has failed to address this problem successfully.

Instead it is a really basic overview. The Sonic DVDit! product they have screenshots plastered all over the book and include a demo version on their disc isn't a tool that has ever been used for any commercial title (it is a consumer tool). There are only a few screenshots of Sonic Creator, and no mention of Daikin or Spruce authoring systems which do the lion share of professional titles.The 30 pages on DVD Audio was informative and kept the book from being a total waste.A scant 2 pages on how to get your disc replicated was why I bought this book.

There are some great unexpected surprises on here, such as world drumming & the tongue-in-cheek \\"Keep Young & Beautiful\\" [if you want to be loved...].

I was worried that I'd never hear her beautiful voice again. A voice that I grew up on. Of her two solo efforts, Diva is the obvious choice. It has original material whereas Medusa is all cover songs. Diva has the great hits \\"Why\\", \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\" and \\"Little Bird\\" plus great album tracks \\"Money Can't Buy It\\", \\"Legend In My Living Room\\", \\"Stay By Me\\", \\"Primitive\\" and \\"The Gift.\\" Annie showed that she could go solo and hold her own. This is a must have for any rock collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, intelligent pop.","review":"To a previous reviewer: \\"Diva is an honorific to be bestowed, not claimed\\"? Don't condescend, and don't criticise a work just because you haven't read between the lines. The title is meant to be ironic, as testified by the videos,interviews and bonus track \\"Keep Young And Beautiful\\".That's precisely what gives the largely gentle album its refreshingly intelligent pop edge. She's playing with the role of the trapped and fallen \\"diva\\". But best of all, she still manages to provide some sincere and beatiful tracks which transcend these ironies (notably \\"Why\\" and \\"The Gift\\"). All good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"My All-Time Favorite Album","review":"Annie Lennox is amazing. Her vocals and style in 'Diva' take my breath away!There is not one track on this entire amazing CD that I ever skip.

But the first time I heard Why? I was hooked.This CD is a total departure from the sound of the Eurythmics. It has a stunning mix of ballads, pop, soul and jazz. The orchestration is second to none, and Lennox's vocals always meet or surpass the challenges presented in the songs. Her vocal range is incredible - it's as though she knows that her best instrument is that sultry, powerful, soulful, beautiful voice. I don't think there's a better, purer singer around today. The depth of emotion she expresses through her lyrics are such that every time you listen to the CD you get a different interpretation. I know that every time I hear it I find something I've missed the last time. This CD is definitely one I'd put on my \\"Desert Island List\\" and I consider it a necessity for any complete music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful album that has gone through life with me","review":"I remember having this cd when I was very young and I wore the cassette tape out, listening to my favorites like \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\" and \\"Little Bird\\". It has become a part of my life, kind of a soundtrack, if you will. It is probably THE album I have had the longest and have listened to over the years without remotely tiring of it. It's such a brilliant piece of work that you CAN'T grow tired of it, instead you only want to listen to it more. Her hypnotic voice and her cool, dark lyrics combine to make her first solo album extremely tasteful and impressive. To me, it's better than Eurythmics, though they were a great band, too. (Anything with Annie is destined to be great.) \\"Diva\\" and Annie herself are part of me and will remain so. This is an album that is more than just another cd, it's a journey that will grow with you through time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work Of Historic Merit","review":"Not just one of the best works of the decade, but an openhearted and exquisitely executed personal chronicle that stands among the top albums of the contemporary era. \\"Why\\" could be the themesong for a movie about the desires and delusions of the 20th century.

'Cold' elevates her voice and spirit to new heights while 'Walking on Broken Glass' makes her signature style shine. This early edition makes way for albums that continue to showcase her incredible voice and talent as a soulful singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"I cannot describe adequately how much I love this disc.

It is hard for me to imagine anyone listening to this album without enjoying it. I had my head in the sand about Annie Lennox before surfing in to her \\"Unplugged\\" session and I fell in love. I bought Diva the next day. When I play it I never fail to be thoroughly entertained. After hundreds of playings, it only gets better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly diverse music styles","review":"I do deep tissue body work, and this CD is incredibly inspiring.

Even in her Eurythmics albums, there had been a glut of fillers among the greats. In this solo album, Annie gives us a very beautiful collection of songs with no hit of filler, but her performance is too restrained. This album leaves you with an impression that Annie is being to precise, to controlled, to give the songs the full power of her talent. It makes you wish she would just cut loose and sing it from the heart instead of for the microphones. Yet, with that being said, this is still a Great album. Her restraint keeps this from being a true Masterpiece, but it is still a great one. Five Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied","review":"I was very satisfied with my purchase of Annie Lennox's DIVA CD.

I just figure it will cost me more to ship it back than what i paid for it :) Maybe next time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie is truly a diva","review":"I just bought this cd today and already have listened to it three times. I've been a huge fan of Annie Lennox since her days in the Eurythmics. Her voice is rather unique I think. I absolutely adore the first song off this cd \\"Why\\". The melancholy of the song literally moves me almost to tears. \\"The Gift\\" and \\"Stay by Me\\" are other favorite tracks of mine on the cd. As a solo artist, I prefer Annie singing ballads but when she was with the Eurythmics I loved it when she rocked out. Either way I love this woman's voice and her music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demi Moore Danced to This!","review":"This CD is worth more than the selling price! As I said in my title; the three songs were \\"Cold, Money Can't Buy It, and Little Bird.\\" I was really excited when I received the CD, and inspired me to dance more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal and brilliant","review":"This album means so much to me on so many levels I won't begin to mention them all here. Suffice it to say Annie Lennox is both auto-biographical and universal with every sentiment on this record. The songs are all hummable, some even danceable, but mostly they evoke SOMETHING on every listen. If you have ANY doubts, cast them aside. This is a brialliant record."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT work but softer than Eurythmics","review":"Annie's first solo cd is a really GREAT work. Her vocals are very strong and beautiful. This cd is much softer than her work with Eurythmics. I think the cd is EXCELLENT but, I still prefer her Eurythmics cds the best. She sings so beautifully on such classics as \\"Why\\", \\"Walking On Broken Glass\\" and she gets back to her Eurythmics style with her dance hit, \\"Little Bird\\". I also love the passionate song, \\"Cold\\" and \\"Legend In My Living Room\\". Keep up the GREAT work, Annie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"Our roller brush wore out on our vacuum, so ordered a replacement.

(Her main credential: she was married to his son for a while back in the 80s and 90s).But Warren Buffett and his investing strategies are not as simple as the author seems to imply. And markets change fast.For instance there are also some bullet proof \\"Buffett companies\\" listed that you should have bought at the top:Fannie Mae (collapsed) Freddie Mac (collapsed) MBIA (a toxic asset dump that has also collapsed)--the author also recommends Circuit City and print media as great investments... But you get the point.This book was lightweight when it was published 11 years ago and though it holds some overall interest can hardly be recommended in 2009."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good start, lacks depth","review":"This book is a good primer for understanding concepts like ROE and P/E ratios but lacks deeper valuation methodology. I'm sure that these quick litmus tests are needed but I am still trying to find a book with better techniques. The book provides a good example of analyzing for growth in the last or second to last chapter.

Any book suggestions, other than \\"Security Analysis\\" (just finished), are welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"~eh~","review":"This book was so-so. Good points: It gives a decent overview of a good company in qualitative terms. Bad points: It is repetitive and fails to deliver in quantitative terms. If you are a real numbers cruncher, this book isn't for you. I think if you really want to get a good understanding of Buffett, you should read Warren Buffett: The making of an American Capitalist. A new investor should not invest strictly by the teachings of this book, while an experienced investor can simply disregard its shortfalls.I do have one gripe about Mary's book in particular, however. In Buffettology, she mentions that a hypothetical company with earnings of $1 million a year in actuallity earns nothing if it has to replace its machinery every other year at a cost of $2 million. Isn't the cost of this machinery already factored into earnings (through depreciation)? According to accounting rules, it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Answered many questions for me","review":"I'd like to add to the other comments, buy the calculator and follow the examples. I've read and reread many books on Warren Buffett and how he supposedly makes his investment decisions. I've also read 20+ years of his annual reports to shareholders. Buffettology finally pulled most of the information together for me. There were always areas that didn't quite make sense in the other books on Buffett. While it is impossible to know if Buffettology is showing Buffett's personal investment theory more correctly than other books on Buffett, Buffettology offered the most complete and understandable method I have seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Key points of the Buffett methods.","review":"Right from the horse's mouth!

The title alone is a JOKE","review":"This book is a royal sham - not worth your time. There is little in this book worth reading. For starters, Mary \\"Buffett\\" has no right to use that last name... She's no more a Buffett than your gold-digging neighbor. The supposed formulas that she profers as belonging to Buffett in reality have little to do with Buffett's methods or his thinking - he is on record many times as refuting what she claims as his method. What does she say about multi-disciplinary cross-examination of the investment problem set? Nothing. What does she say about how to define a moat and determine its durability? Very little. Instead we get her assumption on growth formulas... just where did she derive that? The family Thanksgiving dinner? Right. Of all the books on Buffett I've read (let's just say it's well into double digits) - this is perhaps the worst..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opportunism at its lowest","review":"No, no, no. Give me a break, Mary Buffett gets divorced and suddenly reinvents herself as a Buffett know-it-all. Come on if the ignorant out there think that by reading this book they will be able to replicate Buffett's success, then they still believe in the tooth fairy. Mary Buffett is doing nothing more than capitalising on her supposed discovery of the \\"holy grail\\". If she had, do you really think she would have to sell books? Besides many great minds have tried, and failed, at trying to replicate Warren's success. I find the book simplistic, patronising, and written as if the author has just discovered Finance herself. I would recommend potential readers look elsewhere for insights into the Warren Buffett mind, by more qualified authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Entry Level Introduction to Buffet Methods","review":"This book is well written and very clear. It is designed for the beginner and those wanting an intro to the basic methods and culture of Warren Buffet.

The return isn't there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time or money","review":"In two words this book was rudimentary and horrendous. If you want to improve your knowledge of investing, don't read this book. Mary Buffett seems to just be trying to make a quick buck and gave no thought to the damage she could do by trying to convince people that she knows anything about how Buffett thinks or investing. Stay as far away from this book as you can. If you want to learn how to really invest, you must do the tough reading and read books like Security Analysis or The Theory of Investment Value. If you are against tough reading, then I suggest One Up on Wall Street. For your own sake, stay far away from Buffettology."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to read investment book","review":"Benjamin Graham's Intelligent Investor is probably the best book on investing available, but buffetology is the easier version of Graham's, so i love it three times as much. it's so easy that i could read it while laying on the Bali beach in a recent holiday. caution though, maybe because it's so simple it's probably too simple for sophisticated ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book is perfect for business people who want to improve their economic skills, but also for students who want to know more about the global economy and what skills does Warren Buffet used to make money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Terrible Book....Booooring","review":"My first thoughts of this book were wow this is written by his ex-daughter in law???

The book goes much deeper into the specifics, but an understanding of the above is a great starting point for any investor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a book that explains how to master the stock market","review":"To be honest, I have only listened to the tape called \\"Buffetology\\", but at the end of the tape Mary Buffet explains that the book goes into more detail about the math part of picking your stocks. So, I believe the tapes are just as imformative. I'm not only mesmerized by the content, but also by Mary's voice! I know that sounds crazy, but seriously, her voice is as compelling as the content.The wonderful thing about listening to the tapes, is you can stop, reverse and play parts over and over and over in the privacy of your car--like I do going to and from work--and the information slowly sinks in. It's so clear, logical and interesting that you wonder why more people haven't developed this philosophy and passed it on before Mary came along. I'm just so grateful to her and David Clark.

The order in which the material is presented is perhaps the greatest strength of this text. Kozen starts with a treatment of Finite Automata, then makes a transition into Context Free Grammars, and finally to Turing Machines and a general exploration of computational undecidability. One weakness was that there was little in the way of applications. I think that the greatest understanding of how grammars and TM's work comes from actually using these structures in computer programs.

The characters have about as much depth as a mud-puddles and the plot has suffers from an equal paucity of skill.

Though stylistically this is a departure from Bromberg's jazz outings, in one way he keeps to the familiar jazz structure of head, melodic improvisation, head, then outro. And while he improvises with technical mastery as fine as the familiar guitar shredders, he does so with interesting melodic phrases and each track is graced with some very cool rock grooves. Brian's tone is sweet and the overall production is well crafted. As one of my favorite bass players, Brian Bromberg has amazed me with fine upright and electric bass playing since his recording with Rob Mullin's Jazz Jazz. This latest release is by far the most different, but only in terms of style. Brian's moving melodiscm and great writing is present throughout and I am thoroughly enjoying this offering.

That made it very easy to tell if I did the steps right. I occasionally used the CD, which showed every step of every lesson, and actually talked you through them. I learned enough PowerPoint that I will be able to create really good presentations! What a great way to learn PowerPoint.

I have a glass top stove, so was concerned about choosing a set that would be suitable. This set is all I hoped for. They heat quickly and evenly. I have never put cookware in the dish washer, which is not recommended for this set, and cleaning them is a breeze. I love the bright yellow color. I'm sure I will be enjoying this set for a long time and would recommend them to all my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good product","review":"We bought this based off of what a friend said about the product. When they arrived they were extremely small, warped, and unusable. i would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Stand Rachael Ray","review":"...but I overcame my feelings because the reviews were great, the set was inexpensive, and I love cobalt blue. The set is very pretty, which is what I was looking for to replace a set of pots and pans that had not aged gracefully. Didn't need something fabulous, since I already have a collection of individual Calphalon, Le Creuset, etc. The pieces are rather small, not in any way generously sized, and the saucepans are designed so that they are wider at the base than the top, which I guess she thought was cute, but really isn't practical. If you need to saute more than two or three servings, you'll need to buy something else to make your famous pasta sauce for your friends. The glass lids and silicone handles are very nice, and the enamel finish cleans easily, but, honestly, I would have returned it if I weren't lazy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality expected more from Rachael Ray","review":"So very disappointed with this product. Enamel is chipping off after 2 months and one of the sauce pans it so warped that the lid will not go on. We have used and cleaned them per the manufacturer. I strongly recommend not spending your money on these. We have other Rachael Ray products that we love, this on is a fail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Color comes off in water!","review":"I was really excited to buy these, loved the color and loved the silicone handles. Unfortunately I have discovered the porcelain enamel rubs right off, even with just plain old water.I noticed the first week I bought the set that the most of the pans already had minor smudges exposing the metal of the pan under the green paint. Then one day I was toweling off a pan I HAND WASHED and noticed the green enamel rubbed off all over the towel. I simply washed the pans with warm soapy water, nothing harsh.I am extremely dissappointed with the quality of these pans. It is a great design but they are evidently made with very cheap workmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful on the inside not the outside","review":"The non stick surface is holding up well, but I swear if I look at one of the pans the wrong way it fades and discolors. I really don't want to get to wordy in this review... just make sure when you hand wash them, then rinse them first with cold or lukewarm water, and then once all the soap is gone you can do a final rinse with hot water. They don't tell you that in the instructions. The discoloration has happened with every liquid dish soap I have tried. Scented or not, gentle on the hands, whatever. One more time, rinse first with cold, when you can't see any soap residue left go ahead and rinse some more, go get a snack, eat dinner or whatever, then you can rinse with hot water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratch easily - low quality","review":"I bought this set just three months ago and I am so dissapointed to find scratches on two pieces already. Other cheaper brands last me longer than this. I found scratches on the smallest pot which I used mostly to boil water! I never used metal utensils when cooking so I really dont understand why scratches appear so fast and so easy. And it became even worse when scratches did not stay as scratches at all; they allowed a big piece of the top layer to come off. Now one piece is junk. I purchased this set because it looked beautiful and because it relates to the famous cook. Now I better search for a real quality product other than basing my purchase on just the look and the name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted about 6 months which is still 3 months more than IKEA","review":"I was really tired of using TFAL, Cuisinart & IKEA non stick cookware. These usually last about 3 months (and lose shape as well). Rachael Ray products are better (they haven;t lost shape yet) but they have lost their ability to be non stick ( bought it Christmas 2009). FYI we use it everyday for which it did pretty well. I plan to try calphalon next to see if that does better in terms of daily use. I would suggest buying Rachael Ray porcelain enamel non sticks mostly for their color and style. If you plan on daily cooking, try something else. Good luck & happy hunting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but has functional flaws","review":"I loved this set, but after I started using it everyday, I realized that the design just isn't very functional and practical. Cooking oil stains the bottom of the pan-- I've been soaking the same pan in dishsoap for 2 days, scrubbing and everything. There are two circular metal pieces that attach the handle to the cooking surface; these metal pieces face the cooking surface as well, getting gunk stuck in their rivets. It's a hassle and chore every time I wash to get it clean. I'm also expecting these areas to rust ~1 year. Not to mention that the handle is shaped in a strange angle-- it puts the load on the upper area of your lower arm, instead of your stronger wrist area, making it clumsy and difficult to lift your pan with food in it. Also, if you heat this above medium heat, the pan turns an icky brown-yellow color, and returns to green as it cools agan. Blech. I've learned my lesson-- skip the pretty and invest in real cooking tools next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"just recieved and happy so far","review":"I just got my set yesterday and tested it out on frying bacon.

I did only get the 8pc set not the 10pc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cooking With Rachael","review":"So far we are quite pleased with this 10 piece cookware set from Rachael Ray. The cookware is attractive, cooks evenly, and has lids that fit well. The long, silicone handles really are comfy and grippy and are oven safe. Despite the stated durability of these handles, we only keep the handled cookware in a low temperature oven to keep food warm.The pieces seem to cook evenly and are very easy to clean. Once the Spudette left a dirty pan in the sink overnight. No paternal lecture was necessary because the pan cleaned readily with a few quick swipes of a wet sponge. Thanks, Rachael.We do wish that the set had come with a 12 inch skillet. Ten-inch pans just aren't big enough for Hamburger Helper or my famous fried rice. We do have a previously purchased 12-inch skillet for more demanding dishes but it's not as nice as the Rachael Ray pieces.This really is a nice set of cookware, and certainly worth considering, especially if you can get it for somewhere in the 100 dollar range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pots and pans that look great too!","review":"I was in need of some good pots and pans and I loved rachel ray so I decided to give hers a chance. I looked at all the different ones and decided on this set because I didn't have a dishwasher. They are great pans, so far I haven't scratched the nonstick and I am pretty rough on them. They clean up in a breeze. The one thing that I have noticed is the blue outer coating has chipped in some places but I don't know if that is something that happens from wear and tear.

Throughout the series we are given hints as to the role of God. His position has been described as aloof, even to the point of doing little or nothing to counter the machinations of Satan. This book attempts to answer the question of God's laissez faire attitude. The story revolves around three main characters. Jolie returns from the last book in spirit form. Orlene, daughter of Gaiea also returns. A new character, Vita is introduced. Vita is a troubled teenager, trying to make ends meet through prostitution. Orlene and Jolie show up in an attempt to save Vita, for she is supposed to play a role in the fate of humankind.

I would've liked this book better if Anthony had shown some of God's powers.... what makes him so special. That and repitition are the only drawbacks of this book.

The entire plot seems to be to put someone into the office of god who doesn't think that having sex with young girls is a sin. Over and over the characters tells us it's okay and how great it is and how if they're \\"really in love\\" a grown man having sex with a child isn't wrong. Well it is wrong.

The slot the legs fit into splintered. I repaired them with wood glue and clamps and they rebroke in different places a few weeks later! What a rip! It looks great, but poorly designed.

Because of this, it's sometimes hard to tell what's happening in the match. Instead of commentators talking during each match, you'll be \\"treated\\" to hearing nothing but noises from the crowd. Most of the matches take place in school gyms in front of maybe 40 people. The Konnan match is clipped into bits & pieces. At this price, you're better off getting the WWE's Chris Benoit dvd, since it has way better matches with Benoit, Guerrero, Sasuke, Liger, & 2 Cold Scorpio from around the same time period (mid-90s), plus it's been professionally produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price.","review":"This dvd is just not worth the price. It should only cost five dollars or so. It's got some hard to find matches but it's bascially a very unprofessional dvd. Some matches look like they were recorded with home video cameras.

I was there in the neighborhood from the beginning. I still have over 50 grey tapes. This CD is nothing but grey tapes put on CD in a completely differernt order than they were originally in. The sound quality is POOR. It sounds like someone played the grey tapes as loud as possible and recorded onto the computer and sold them the next day. If you have grey tapes, you don't need this CD bc you already have all the music in its original form. If you don't have grey tapes, get grey tapes (or grey tapes on CD), but don't waste your money on this CD. It gets 1 star only bc that's the lowest I can give it. It deserves a ZERO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal to Get Free Super Saver Shipping","review":"I ordered these because I only needed a few more dollars to get free super saver shipping on another order. So, I didn't really look into, or care about, the quantity of the pieces. I was pleasantly surprised when I received 8 of them. As the description claims, they fit just fine with Thomas wooden railway pieces. I take off one star because one of the pieces has mildly warped since I received them (the piece still fits and works, but you can definitely tell it has warped by placing it on the flat surface of the train table)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lavish and exciting","review":"The Mountain is a long-awaited addition to the video catalog. Set and filmed in the French Alps, it tells of two brothers, Zachary and Chris Teller, and their mission to climb a treacherous peak - one to search for survivors of a plane crash, the other to search for loot among the debris. Spencer Tracy looks more like a father or grandfather to the young Robert Wagner's younger brother, but together they make their ascent. The climbing scenes are hair-raising and make up for the almost cardboard characters. Older brother Tracy is the good, honest, almost simple man in contrast to Wagner's worldly, greedy and selfish younger brother. These two fine actors more than make up for the lacking in the script. This movie is best enjoyed by suspending belief and allowing yourself to be enthralled by the scenery and the excitement of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mountain","review":"This is an excellent adventure movie. Spencer Tracy plays the older more experience brother in mountain climbing. Robert Wagner is excellent as the spoiled younger brother who expects his older brother to cater to his needs at all times.

Whether this omission is the result of the studio's misguided notions of economy or sheer callousness, I wouldn't know. I do know that there are countless cinephiles who will pass on this movie, because they have less than perfect hearing, or they are non-native English speakers who need subtitles to fully understand the dialog, or because, like me, they like to watch movies at low volume with the subtitles turned on. Anyway, my comments are meant for the sizable segment of the home video market who resent it when studios ignore their wishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Kitty Backpack","review":"I got this for my 5 year daughter old for Christmas.

She was complaining this evening that it was too heavy! (She had really packed it with very important items!) I sort of winced at paying $15.00 for it, but I guess it's worth it.

It includes what you would expect like the XM antenna, cigarette lighter power cord, and two different types of cradle attachments so that you can easily use the Inno in your car and the cassette tape adaptor. I have had pretty good success with the FM modulator whether I am in the woods or in the city, but of course having a cassette adaptor is going to provide the clearest reception when playing it inside of your car.It is probably a little expensive price wise for what you get, considering that all of these goodies probably cost 10 bucks to make total, including with shipping. But then again, you did buy the Inno in the first place and that means that you could afford to put down at least $300.00 for portable satellite radio and MP3 player in one and that to me pretty must justifies charging another $70.00 bucks to the Inno in your car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Great book with wonderful barns photos in beautiful settings.

You get to pick what your first horse looks like, and you get to pick it's tack. You also clean it when it's dirty. You ride through dense forests, climb snowy mountains, and gallop across wide beaches in search for the missing foals and horses. Barbie gives you tips along the way, while you pick up silver coins, open treasure chests, and when you are trying to build a friendship with your horse. It also tells you what buttons to use, while you are not moving around.

But your daughters are unlikely to care, as this game presents hours of play possibility in the world of Barbie and her friends. My two daughters, age 10 and 7, have been at it for days. One other caveat: The box may say \\" for one or two players,\\" but the main game is single player only. The secondary \\"mini games\\" are two player, but only in the clumsiest split-screen fashion.This title was $49.95 at full retail. As a parent, one begins to feel ill-used.

Obviously, this game was made for little girls, but there's better games out there that might appeal to girls without insulting their intelligence.I'm actually exaggerating a bit, this game is not nearly as bad as it could have been. Most of the gameplay is built on riding your horse, which borrows a lot from the Zelda 64 riding engine. Once you get off your horse though to look for runaway horses, watch out. Barbie is slow on her feet and can't run, which can get very annoying. There are also side activities, like unlocking outfits and washing your horse, which is as rudimentary as using the cursor brush to move over a horse.But overall this game sucks. If you want to buy a game for your sister/daughter/niece, get her a real game with quality gameplay, like Mario Kart: Double Dash or Super Monkey Ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"interactive junk!","review":"I'd rather watch Dragenball Z running backwards than play this game! There's a story, but it's stupid-- not borring stupid or funny stupid--just plane old box-of-rock stupid! Let's skip it, ok? Gameplay consists of Barbie collecting coins, opening chests, and useing her cell phone in the woods. And it's about as fun as it sounds. The thing that realy draws you out of the experience though is the fact that Barbie talks to you. This ruins the sense that you are the on-screen character. I gave it 1 star only because I couldn't give it 0 stars. And if you buy it you'll just be putting more money into the Barbie doll company's bank account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money...","review":"Advice in this book is trivial (like: learn English, study in US if possible to have local education, make friends once in the US) and to some extent outdated - author arrived to the US in the early 70-ties as did most of people she talked with."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Personal Review","review":"I appreciated all the time the author takes to explain her quilting process.

I hasten to add that I had just finished the Enderby Trilogy and that is a hard act to follow, and I was expecting similar.Some 20 years after, I have revisited the book. What you get are the sites, sounds, smells, ambience, attitude (loved the bit about the young Malaysians adopting 50's rock and roll attitude)and the entire human continent of Asia unfolding in one locality - sikhs, tamils, chinese, arabs, mestizos etc. You can feel the heat and humidity and anxiety.This is book is cinema for the imagination.

There is also the memorable line, uttered by my daughter during her skit, that \\"boys are creeps\\".The more audiences and parents watch this stuff, the more pronounced its effect will be -- like the negative effect, discussed by Robert Bly in his book Iron John, that Norman Lear's father-bashing sitcoms have had on fathers in this country.

It is true that you can buy a card whose performance outstrips the write capability of your camera.This card is just beyond the point of diminishing returns. It is fast enough for any of the current DSLRs. So your card will not limit the performance of your camera. And that is the minimum you can expect from your card.

I don't know what they are made of, but it couldn't be sugar because If you lick it and watch it, it forms this \\"powdery\\" coating on it that feels like some artificial chemical, and you can actually taste the powdery stuff it forms and it's disgusting.Unfortunately I'd already eaten one trying to figure out if it was just the first couple layers, but the entire thing was disgusting and strange.I will not be purchasing from Penguin Mints in the future. $15 dollars gone to waste.

Until I read Patent's book, I never understood why my baking went awry. Now I know it was the flour. Although my cooking is appreciated, I never became a baker. But I love this wonderful book; just to read the recipes is delightful. With all-encompassing guides on how to bake the best recipes from the past, this charming book has turned me on to baking again. Greg Patent has written an interesting, historically fun and excellent book - one I will frequently use and then pass on to my children and grandchildren."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice read","review":"I admit it.

Everything I have tried-- ranging from his rice bread, challah, jalapeno, cornmeal, and cheddar bread, brioche, peppered gingersnaps, big lemon-frosted sugar cookie squares, apple-plum crisp, lemon meringue pie, and many many others-- have been amazing. The directions are clear and easy to follow, and the results are exceptional every time. When thinking of baking, whether to try a new bread recipe or to discover a new decadent dessert, this is the book I look to first. In fact, I just made my husbands favorite dessert last night for his his birthday yesterday... the most amazing, tallest lemon meringue pie we have ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good baking book","review":"I've had this book for a few years now and have made many things from it; the recipes work and the baking times seem to be worked out. Some of the recipes appear to be borrowed from other sources and have some ingredients changed. And as some reviewers said, some are mediocre, but overall I think they're quite good. One thing to remember about the yeast bread recipes though, is that several of them call for 4 teaspoons of salt; in my opinion these amounts should be reduced to 3 teaspoons. I made one recipe for wheat bread and used 4 teaspoons and it was too salty. (Incidentally, I use salt in cooking and don't have any restrictions). After baking the yeast bread, I reviewed other yeast bread recipes in other books, and almost without exception, they call for 3 teaspoons of salt for every 6 to 7 cups flour. Of course it was too late, and my bread was too salty. So I took a pen and changed all the recipes to 3 teaspoons where appropriate. But a good book overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whose America?

He likes to use a lot of parsimmons, which, hey, how many of us really do? He doesn't give you a warm and fuzzy feeling reading his book, either. He's kinda bossy/preachy, which I did not care for. There are better baking authors out there that I urge you to try. Don't be fooled by the title of this book. He starts off with some history, and then BOOM, he just starts adding in recipes that many of us have never heard of. Don't buy it before trying it out. Also, read the other reviews very closely to see how many of them really tried the recipes before reviewing this book.

No question. I was able to remove all the gunk from all the way back on my tongue. It is steel, so no breaking, the scraping edge is just right for your tonge, and you can use one hand or two.

Still, 8 years of fresher breath for <$10 is pretty good.It works great to remove the build-up on the back of the tongue on which odor forming bacteria seem to thrive in. Works much better and with much less gagging than just trying to brush the tongue. Even with regular teeth brushings, I found that this build-up was a problem, especially after eating sugary foods. Dr. Tung's scraper removes this easily with just one or two sweeps and it is very easy to rinse off the scraper afterwards. You don't have to put a lot of pressure on your tongue with the scraper either; if it's bleeing afterwards, you're probably being too heavy-handed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I thought....","review":"I have tried several different tongue cleaners in hope of finding the one that actually works and gets rid of the white stuff on my tongue.

I had a plastic cleaner that did a much better job but I can't find it now and don't know who makes it. (Aargh!) I think if you have a small mouth like me you may want to think twice.

I didn't know what was going on, and brushing my teeth (and using the toothbrush on my tongue) frequently didn't seem to help. My doctor recommended this tongue scraper. I couldn't find it in stores so I'm glad it was stocked at Amazon. It's a little gross to see what it takes off your tongue! However, it definitely works. If I haven't used it for a few days, I start to notice the gross taste again.Incidentally, I had been using mouthwash and my doctor mentioned that this can actually make the problem worse, and that the best defense is to drink a lot of water, brush your teeth frequently, and use the tongue scraper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best tongue scraper money can buy!","review":"My boyfriend has the original of this tongue scraper that didn't have the rubber grip handles and he loved it so much that I decided to give this one a try.

Most of the gameplay is built on riding your horse, which borrows a lot from the Zelda 64 riding engine. Once you get off your horse though to look for runaway horses, watch out. Barbie is slow on her feet and can't run, which can get very annoying. There are also side activities, like unlocking outfits and washing your horse, which is as rudimentary as using the cursor brush to move over a horse.But overall this game sucks.

The other episodes center around Marik, with a bunch of unecessary Joey and Mai flashbacks. Who needs those stupid flashbacks. But all in all, it's a very good DVD because Marik and Kaiba are in all four episodes. Here's the rundown: Ep 122, 123, 124 = 4-way duel bet. Yami no Marik, Kaiba, Yami no Yuugi, and Jounouchi. YNM and Jou both lose, so they battle first in the semifinals. YNY and Kaiba are next.

During this time, I had accidentally left it in jeans which ended up going through a full cycle in the washing machine (detergent and all), dropped it about a million times, and have thrown it at various people and objects during several different ocassions. All this had done virtually no damage to this phone, and today it continues to operate as well as it did the first time I bought it.Keep in mind, that while the RAZR is a great phone for basic functions such as talking and texting, its video/photo features are primitive at best. It is absolutely nothing fancy and probably old-fashioned by today's standards.

Phone starts to beep after 2-3 hrs of talking.- Calendar, alarm, notes, contacts cannot be synchronized with Outlook.- Awful camera resolution. Plus, the camera doesn't take video.- No MP3 player.THE GOOD:- Free!

Limited Text Messages, no ringtones that are worth while, alerts are constant and repetitive for a drained battery ( Here's a tip motorola - save battery power, STOP THE DAMN ALERTS!) Next, how about a functional T9 dictionary, because the suggestions and predictions that this one makes are like wierd spelled w3ird and of instead of the...home instead of good...and people is puprse....I know that it's made for gooks but still keep your slope grammer elsewhere cuz we don't want it in the USA...bottom line...don't waste your money on any motorola cell phone products because they are a parasitic device hellbent on destroying every last hope of a functional and user friendly Cell Phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"motorola razor cell phone","review":"This is a great phone.

Easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO and NO never buy RAZR any more","review":"Look at this:1.There is no way to snooze an alarm, you have to open the flip and browse to snooze, already woke up by doing this.If you press external button to silent an alarm it shuts it and alarm will not be active anymore.2.Side buttons ALWAYS pressed accidentally switching ring style to VIBRATE oONLY or to ALL OFF. Which REALLY annoying because you WILL miss the call!!! What the stupid design!!3.

I would give it 0 stars if it allowed me to.","review":"As an previous owner of the original RAZR V3 from about 6-7 years ago, I thought I would give the phone another try despite the negative reviews I read. Those reviews were right on as the phone, which appear to be new, did not behave that way. The camera lens on the phone show mostly static with just a hint of actual photo coming through. The battery after fully charging lasted only 1 day with very little talk time. After 2 charge cycles, it stop charging completely. Calls were constantly being dropped. The paint on the back of the phone was chipping off. This was just the few things I found in the day that I had the phone before returning it for a refund. Amazon refunded my money so I have no complaints about Amazon or the reseller, just the product itself. It is just not a good product by Motorola. I ended up getting a Samsung S3600i which is, by far, a better phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEVER BUY THIS ITEM","review":"When they say no warranty I should have KNOWN BETTER. I am a victim of this disgusting product. I got the item in 10 days, seems like from China. I charged it and inserted my AT&T sim, turned on. The screen lighted up for a few seconds and went blank. Tried to turn off and on several times, the key pad lighs up but not the screen. DON'T BUY IT. BUY ONE WITH WARRANTY."},{"rating":"1","title":"razrv3","review":"I am really dissapointed with this phone. I was advertised as new, but was refurbished. I can hardly hear the person talking.

And after 2 weeks of use the hinge became weak which causes the phone to short out and drop the calls.I'm no expert but I've had 3 Razors (new ones), but this is a dud.--Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"motorola razr v3","review":"I ordered this phone as a replacement for my Blackberry. I didn't receive the phone at least 3 weeks after ordering. The phone was cheap looking and used (supposed to be new.) The SIM card slot and the box had scratches on them. I returned the phone the very same moment I saw it. I definitely wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprises!","review":"I have to say that it was not a good buy at all!!!!I bought this phone as a gift for my husband and when he opened the box the phone has the name CINGULAR on his back and a SIM card from them too. When you turn on the cell phone shows AT&T; at the little visor.Besides that, one of the keys doesn't work.That's what you get when you trust people and buy something without warranty. To tell the truth I bought because it was on the Amazon website and now I know: You cannot trust everything you see on their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola Razr V3 (Unlocked)","review":"After receiving my new cellphone, I discovered that it was not compatible with my phone carrier (Verizon), but the seller was more than accommodating by informing me to simply return the phone and they would reimburse me, which they did. Excellent customer service. I look forward to doing business with them in the future. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"This phone does nothing but evoke anger in me. I bought it because of the features is claims to have yet none of them work. For one the manual, boasts you can use a memory card in it, which is false because this phone features no memory card slot. It says it has MP3 playback and all that but good luck getting any of it on your phone. The phone won't even receive E-mails like it's supposed to. I have a bottom of the line phone from Motorola that's two years old and it has this feature. I have no problem with the phone other then that, it looks great and I don't mind the Keypad. Other then it coming with a damaged LCD screen and the issues I listed above I would have loved to keep it.If you plan to use it for a phone and nothing else it's great but otherwise I'd pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive","review":"I bought this product with high hopes at a high price. It did NOT live up to my expectations at all. The phone is NOT a good value for the money. It shuts off randomly for no apparent reason, often makes a buzzing/static noise and drops calls, then restarts the phone. Sometimes the screen turns black and just wont do anything. First phone I have had to replace at some point during my contract. Pictures are not very good quality, although I could really care less about that. Bottom line is do not buy this phone without SERIOUSLY SHOPPING AROUND FIRST!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"phone is nothing but problems - not authentic razr","review":"I've ordered 3 of these phones from 2 different sellers and had problems with all 3. The screen went out on the first one after 2 days, and Amazon promptly refunded my money but couldn't send another since they were out of stock. I ordered another from a different seller and the phone arrived with a huge crack on the screen. After arguing with the 2nd seller, he finally agreed to send a replacement. The replacement (3rd phone) worked for few days and then the audio went out so the person on the other end would only hear static. A total waste of time and money. The text messaging didn't work on any of the 3 phones."},{"rating":"1","title":"so overrated","review":"The nice thing about this phone is that it's thin, but it comes with lots of drawbacks. The phone is rather wide and when using a bluetooth wireless headset you lose your individual ringers so you don't know who's calling. If there's ever a time you don't want to look at the phone to see who's calling it's when you've got a wireless headset. My biggest gripe with this phone though is you can't hear it. Even with the volume turned all the way up it's nowhere near loud enough. You need to be in a dead quiet room to hear your voicemail, for example. Lastly they're rather unreliable. I had to exchange mine twice due to display failures and the one I've got now the outside screen doesn't sit right, it sits down below the metal edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"The phone is piece junk.I was excited when i got it but so dissapointed when i used it.Phone doesn't work.It just wasting my money.We returned the phone last 22nd of december but until now we never get any response and dont get our money back yet.Out of 5 star i would rate this 0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Style over substance","review":"It may be thin but that is just about its only saving grace.

But I didn't receive it till Tues.09/02/2008.So, I'm rating Amazon 1/2 star. for false delivery service. Sharon :)-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Very Good Phone","review":"This may be an old model, but it is a very good, basic phone. It's still relatively small and light, and both the talk and ring volume are much louder than other phones I've had over the years. If you buy the Motorola Phone Tools software, not included (I bought mine for a prior Moto phone from Amazon for a couple of dollars) and have a standard USB connection with your PC, you can load your own photos for wallpaper, etc., and make your own ringtones from MP3 files. It also backs up your phone book and SIM card, all very easily. Now that the phone is so old, the price is realistic. I got mine, new, for under $130. For that price, I'm not too worried about the lack of a US warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lemon","review":"The phone did not work when I received it.

Totally disappointed, menus are very confusing, camera is poor quality, but the worst is battery time I have to charge it every other day even when the phone is \\"waiting\\" (I rarely use it). I replaced the battery with a new original one and is the same. Really, if I could rate it with no stars I would do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died within 2 months of use","review":"I went ahead and purchased this item even after reading all those negative reviews.

It clearly says it is not covered by any kind of warranty beyond 30 days.Luckily I have an older phone that I can use while I look for another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice phone...","review":"The only problem I think with this phone is that it is too fragile. It is not as durable as some of those Nokia models or Sony models... Once you drop this one (even from a height of 1 feet), come back here and search for good deals on cell phones, cuz you are gettin' yourself a new one! Congratulations!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good phone, bad packaging","review":"I purchased the phone for my husband for a Christmas gift. He is very happy with the phone overall, however, this particular phone did not come with an owner's manual in English. It came with one manual in Czech and one in Slovakian. It was a bit of a hassle to go to the Motorola website and download the manual which was around 100 pages. Even then, having read the manual myself, it does not seem to clearly explain how to use many of the functions on the phone. We have learned more by just playing around with it. For example, it came programmed to display military time (24 hour clock) and European dates. The manual offered no guidance regarding how to change that setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cheap phone","review":"I bought the RAZR V3 to replace my wife's broken RAZR. The matte black finish is great, quality is just fine, and it works well with our carrier (ATT). However the phone came out of the box with Portugese or some similar language. I was easily able to change it to English, but it seems to not have an English dictionary for the auto fill feature of texting. It doesn't recognize even the simplest of English words."},{"rating":"1","title":"purchase of the motorola razor cell phone","review":"this phone does not charge, i left the charger on for 24 -48 hours. it does not charge and I cannot even use it.The phone is useless. i want to return it but i do not know how"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste","review":"I bought the product it didn't last for a day.

Apparently the \\"M\\" on the phone does not mean it is really an original Motorola Phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as expected","review":"This product, was just as I expected.

I also hope that it will work in Europe, too, as I plan to use it there next month. The price is very good and I like that I can use it without having to be in any particular network. I got the cell phone in just a few days, in very good condition (it was well wrapped in the box).The only problem I had was when I had to charge the battery twice before actually using it because after the first time, it kept disconnecting the call after first minute of talking. Checking the internet, I discovered that the problem may resolve if the battery was taken out and after putting it back, recharge the battery.Overall, I give it 4 stars as it is really good for this type of phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Three reasons not to buy this phone:1. It may be unlocked, but it is not unbranded. It still says AT&T; every time you turn it on, in the menu, and on the battery cover.2. The battery loses its charge within a day.3. It does not ship with the advertised \\"European charger with U.S. adapter\\". It is simply a U.S. charger.This phone is simply a lemon, and reading other reviews I realize I am not the first person to say so. Don't make the same mistake we did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A buyer's remorse","review":"I regret buying this. I only use a cellphone when I travel, so by the time I realized that this one is defective it was too late to return it. I've tried two new batteries and the phone is simply unable to hold a charge for more than 24 hours, even when it is turned off. If it is in standby mode I'm lucky to get 12 hours. (I'm not activating Bluetooth.) There must be some power management problem in the hardware.I was left in a lurch on a recent trip to Europe when I discovered that if the battery is completely spent,the phone cannot be charged with a USB cable.Apparently Motorola is stuck with a warehouse of defective Razrs and is dumping them on the Internet. It's disappointing that Amazon has let itself be a party to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"I will never buy another refurb phone.

Their was a buzzing sound in the backgroud (I've heard a lot of complaints about this...). The sound is too low, which makes it hard to hear people when you're talking to them. Only supports MP3's that are of very low quality for ringtones. There isn't an MicroSD support, so no removeable storage for pictures.I would go with the V3i, V3x (If you have Cingular, don't get the V3x, it doesn't support the 850 GSM Band that Cingular uses.), or the MING (A1200).NOTE: These phones can not be washed in the washing machine, you can ask my friend Kaia...what a ditz heh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a original Motorola","review":"Please don't buy this one.

Normally, on a phone that has the face on the outside (Sidekick) it can break if you drop it, which happened to me. So I bought the V3 thinking that this wouldn't happen to a flip phone. Well, 10 days after buying it from Amazon, I closed the phone, only to realize when I reopened it that the face had cracked. I couldn't believe that Motorola would make such a flimsy face and charge so much for the phone. When I contacted the seller, they said they had a 10 day return policy and would not give me a new phone. I am now dealing with my insurance company to try and replace the V3. Overall, this has been a lousy experience that I will not repeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"no so good.","review":"For the price and the company this is a rather dissapointing phone.

It's the perfect size and just what I wanted. I give it two stars because when it was working, it was exactly what I wanted. It's small enough that you can get good targeted injections, unlike some of the huge stainless ones. However, the plastic cracked after just a few months rendering it useless. I don't know about you, but I prefer things to last at least a bit longer than a few months. I didn't even use it more than two or three times. Complete junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cajun Injector Deluxe Marinade Injector","review":"I ordered this product hoping to use it for poultry. My first and last attempt was a complete failure. The Injector would not draw the marinade up the tube. I poured some marinade directly into the tube and it would not come out.I have returned my original Injector and am currently waiting for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it until cylinder cracked","review":"I used my Cajun Marinade Injector a total of maybe a dozen times and it really did do a great job.... until I went to use it the other day only to have marinade squirt all over through a crack in the plastic cylinder. Disappointing to say the least. I gave it two stars because before it broke, it worked great. Having read multiple reviews citing the same problem, I know now that the cylinder failure I experienced is a common problem with this model. I was happy enough with the injector performance that I'll consider spending the extra $10 to get the model with a metal cylinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last One Day","review":"I knew this product was a cheaper than other flavor injectors but believed I was getting a great deal. Instead I got a product that cracked on the first day of use. Disappointing, don't waste your money.

Never a good sign. Still, the trailer looked interesting to me, and I'm a fan of the road horror movies like \\"The Hitcher\\" and \\"Joyride\\", so I decided to give this one a spin.I should have stuck to just watching the trailer, since it actually shows the only good part of the movie, where the evil car latches a steel hook to this poor girl's vehicle and drags it down the street at 60 with her trapped inside.I wanted this to be better. It had a flicker of ingenuity, and then it just died. If you're looking for a creepy road movie on Amazon that you can pick up for cheap, I suggest \\"Dead End\\" before this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this movie was funny..not on purpose..","review":"Caution spoilers for anyone who actually wants to watch this garbage...I can't believe some people actually enjoyed this movie. i'm all for cheesey entertainment..but this was supposed to be a thriller!!..I'll admit the begining started out hopeful..after that...AAARRGGH! Okay, for one thing the killer is immobile..well he has this miraculous wheelchair and prosthetic limbs that somehow amazingly allows him to kill all these females..?? He somehow gets the character,molly, in his killer car and takes her to this remote location..what the mother was keeping this woman from getting out of the car and whooping the gimps ass????? she could have gotten away a number of times!.. makes no sense..he also manages to drug her and change her clothes...what the...could've grabbed the syringe and jabbed the gimp ..AAARRGH..forget it.i won't waste anymore time reviewing this...in my opinion it was one of the worst movies i've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highway men made for one bored one woman","review":"Highway men, a movie that seemingly promises action and adventure fell short and felt more forced than thrilling. Caviezel played the role as well as I guess that he could have but the movie's plot seemed to have had major flaws as to why no one ever questioned his sudden opperance on crime scenes and it didn't have enough small conflicts to build to it's final climax. There is no sense of closure in the character in tne ending. The deranged automotive driven maniac is very similar to paced movies such as Joy Ride or Duel the exception of the emotional and revengeful sentiment that it entails. Highway Men isn't the sort of fil that you want to rent if you inviting over friends who are thrill seekers but is more appropriate for cozy nights when you happen to browse over it on cable TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"fear FARGO...","review":"What an original idea for a serial killer- a half robotic/prosthetic madman with a hit-and-run fetish,in a symbiotic relationship(literaly!)with his chosen method of destruction: a souped-up 72 El Dorado. Call me crazy, but I really dug this. Colm Feore is always a superb villian, and the direction is solid. I gave this 4 out 5 only because of the short length of the feature-other than that minor complaint, great job, Mr. Harmon! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie Buff","review":"I like James Caveziel in anything that he plays. I loved him in \\"The Passion of the Christ\\".

The story has promise, but it definitely falls short. It could have been done a whole lot better because the concept isn't bad. Ultimately a real stinker.BTW I'm a woman and it didn't even give ma a chill, even though I watched it alone late at night. It started out good, but after the first few moments, it just misses and never gets back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Day's Work","review":"Robert Harmon directed the very solid Jesse Stone adaptations. Jim Caviezel and Rhona Mitra are attractive actors. So 'Highwaymen' had potential. But it is not a good movie.Surely they started filming with more than an eighty-minute script. What happened? Would the missing scenes fill in some of the plot holes? As other reviewers have noted, what we're left with is a poorly-stitched composite of movies like 'Duel' and 'Joy Ride'.It lacks character development, credible detective work, logic, and good dialog. The villain should have been gross, filthy, demented, and terrifying -- but he looks like a middle-aged Hollywood actor who just had a salon facial and an eighty-dollar haircut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well . . .","review":"Okay, I'll admit it. This won't be a classic. It probably won't have a cult following-well, maybe a small one. But it was an okay thriller to pass two hours . . . give or take. There really were some \\"on the edge of your seat\\" moments. And it takes a skilled director to make an automobile seem terrifying on a movie screen.Has anyone noticed that an actor who played Jesus (Jim Caviezel, *PASSION OF THE CHRIST*) and an actor who played the antichrist (Gordon Curry, *LEFT BEHIND SERIES*) were in this movie together?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Iowa State fight song","review":"This product is not the Iowa State University fight song, it is the fight song of University of Iowa.

Or so I thought. The album not only picks up from where the first left off, it actually moves itself a couple of notches in sophication, and class. The arrangments are really well thought out, and pretty much most tracks really packa punch. There's the dark over tones, and huge rhythm sections, and lots of Jean-Luc Demeyer's great vocals. His vocal tone really works well with C-tec material. Tracks like \\"I Die Tomorrow\\", and \\"Cut....Lacerate\\" are just bulldozing their way through, while \\"Gesellschaft\\" has to go down as one of the classics of Industrial Electronics.... its just MEAN!!Looking for something different, and wild... Get this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be prepared for a lot of unexpected, pleasurable surprises...","review":"This is an unusually fine recording by some great (totally underrated) jazz musicians.The musicianship is excellent, the arrangements are great. Dick Oates on sax is terrific:check out the stuff on his solo into the first piece. Things don't get any better than that.Ted Rosenthal is sterling and constant on piano. The same is true of Brian Lynch on thetrumpet. Give this recording a shot. You deserve to hear great jazz like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've seen on running","review":"I've looked at quite a few books on running and this is the best general book I've seen. It is ideal for the beginner, which is what I was when this book was recommended to me by friends. The focus is on steady progress while minimizing the risk of injury. If you want to finish your first marathon, this is the book for you. You aren't likely to find a method easier than Galloway's 30 week program with alternating hard and easy weeks. If you want to improve your marathon performance, that's covered too. There is a special chapter on women's running written by Barbara Galloway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for all Runners","review":"Galloway's Book got me started running in the eighth grade. I'm now in my second year on the highschool cross-country team and I still find myself picking this one of the shelf for help. There is perfect advice, insight, and ideas for all areas of the sport; training, form, shoes, food. Put simply, Galloway's Book has everything for the young or old, beginning or advanced, spare time or serious runner except the shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Foundational Referance Book.","review":"This book is a must. Jeff Galloway explains the basics of running in an understandable, and applicable, manner. What I have found most useful, in my three years of owning this publication, are the \\"race pace\\" reference charts. Tremendous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book on how to Train, Recover, Eat and Run Again","review":"A very easy to follow guide book on training for your particular event. Not over whelming in minutia but covers the facts in straight forward communication. I particularly enjoyed Galloway's approach to marathon training; however, I could not bring myself to run over 26 in training as he prescribes, but it makes sense to finish the race psychologically and phsyically strong. Nice large pages with diagrams that covers a variety of topics including injuries, how to recover and how to avoid them. As a distance runner, Galloway is careful with speed workouts as too much stress in a speed workout can lead to quicker path to injury. Very approachable book by runners at all levels by a guy that represented the U.S. in the 1972 Olympic 10K. One of the famous Florida Track Club members that included Frank Shorter and Jack Bachelor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it.","review":"Great running training and is amusing to read as the author presents things in a realistic way and with humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Confidence Builder","review":"I had been running for a couple of years, Doing 5k and twice a 10k. I had made great progress dropping from 185 pounds to 155 pounds. However my progress had stopped, I could not break the 29 min barrier on 5k or the 60 min barrier at 10k. Not until I read Galloway's book, yes all of it, did I understand enough about how running works to make some goals. It is funny while informative, Answers the questions you want asked, differentiate what is his opinion and what he believes is fact. I am now on the verge of a Half marathon and have little doubt i will make my goal of 2hr 20min. Not bad for a 55 year old. I reccomend it highly.And oh yes, I have done a sub 27 min 5k"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Galloway allows us all to run a marathon","review":"I love this book. Jeff Galloway provides a program in which anyone can run. By incorporating \\"walk/shuffle\\" breaks you increase your endurance with minimal injury. Similar to \\"The Penguin\\"'s program but allows you to increase both speed and endurance to your maximum potential. I am running a half marathon on June 20, 2009 in Alaska for Team in Training and I have been utilizing Jeff's program. I average a pace of anywhere from 11.5 to 12.5min/mile. That may seem turtle slow for seasoned runners but for a 53 year old woman who never ran until a year ago it is amazing; without Jeff's program I don't think I could have done it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galloway loves running","review":"I appreciated his infectious love for running, and the way he speaks to runners of all different skill levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of Information","review":"This book has everything.

I borrowed the book from the local library, thinking I would browse thru it and return it.

A must for school libraries, hospitals, and training facilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Galloway's Greatest Book","review":"I read Galloway's Book on Running and I found it to be very insightful. Although it is one of his earlier books I believe that it is one of the most helpful in terms of how to train and all of the necessary components that are essential to running well are included. I have read all of his books and have found that it is the best one. I have used the book to help me run 32 marathons including 17 in my home state, and his, New Jersey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for getting started","review":"If you want to get over the mental hump and start climbing the mountain to improved fitness, buy this book. The book is intended to make you feel o.k. with being able to run 1 or 2 miles per run in those terrible first weeks when you start struggling/running. It is a feel good book that does not try to force you into rigid running schedules. Warning: it does get you hooked on running."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must to complete a marathon or qualify for Boston","review":"I have been running since 1964, competitively and for health. My dream had always been to qualify for the Boston Marathon, but I had failed time and again. I joined the Leukemia Society of America's Team in Training while I was undertaking Galloway's marathon training, and I will tell you this...The only time I ever qualified for Boston, was after I devoted a full five months of following Galloway's marathon advice to the letter. And maybe it was also a little grace from God for helping cure leukemia at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Same As Before","review":"I originally bought this 6 months ago for my son. It was just the right level of challenging for him. It included writing, matching first sounds to pictures. It also had a several mazes and other fun things. We moved and the book didn't make the trip so I ordered it again. They have completely changed it and the material is very simple. Half the book is now mazes which of course my son loves but are not really educational in the slightest. If you are just looking for fun worksheets this is fine but if you want any kind of educational material I would skip this one completely.

However, most of those pages are helpful because they are coloring, which he needs practice with. He has known all of his letters and numbers since he was 2, so most of these skills were not helpful to him. So if your child is already comfortable with recognizing letters and numbers, I think I would try to find something more challenging. Most of the pages in this book are connect the dots or coloring. It is helpful with letter writing skills, and with teaching him to follow directions. I do wish it was more challenging, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast","review":"Well i got the workbook pretty fast and was in great conditions.

One of the distinct features of the original edition is the use of graphical analysis in the study of sentence structure. This approach does give me a deeper understanding of English Grammar. It is also the reason why I considered buying my own copy. However, I bought the newer edition. Graphical analysis has no place in the new book since it is considered counter-productive in modern English teaching.By and large, I like the original edition.

But at the start of this book, he has of course lost it all and through the course of the book everything just gets worse for him, culminating in him discovering he has a 12-year-old son he didn't know about and having his house burn down! There are amusing patches in this and it's still well written as the others, but more farcial and less \\"real\\" than the other books - I remember reading the first, \\"The Diary of Adrian Mole, Age 13 3/4\\" when I was close to that age and struck by how honest and real it seemed.

I selected the right club, went through my pre-shot routine, concentrated on the target, and trusted my swing. It wasn't perfect, but I got into less trouble, got out of trouble easier by playing the smart shot, and walked off the course smiling.

I played as a pro for a brief period, lack of sponsorship and no significant improvement in my game after turning pro led me to give it up (I still play as an amateur)... though I had dreamed of being a World-beater!

But beyond the facts and history, this particular volume is an example of masterful storytelling. I read this book during my morning and evening commutes, stuffed between strangers on the train. Branch transported me to another time and place, at times on the brink of tears. Branch devoted decades of his life to crafting this story. His efforts leave us with an honest and beautifully told story - one of our nation's most inspiring and tragic."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERYONE should read this book","review":"The first few years of the civil rights movement and the years leading up to them are covered in this volume of Taylor Branch's trilogy. After reading this, one really gets a sense of why this movement was truely epic in scope and importance. The narrative does a great job of describing a mass movement with all of it's advances, setbacks, complexities, and contradictions. One gets a vivid impression of the pace of these events and the real change of consciousness that occured among an entire people. Don't be intimidated by the size of this book, it's exciting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An engrossing summary","review":"When I picked up this book I wasn't particularly interested in Martin Luther King.

Her dedication and devotion is apparent on every page. The book is not only filled with fascinating information, but is also so beautifully written it pulls you right along. Inspiring and uplifting. It clarifies a lot about the Roerichs and gave an intimate portrait of the family and their struggles and joys.

When Priscilla out grew the house the author and \\"Papa,\\" had to sleep with her on the first three days. they even brought another sow in to teach her to act like a pig. This book is funny and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and flawed","review":"The book starts off by ridiculing the reading habits of Japanese workers. While it improves from that point, some of the methodologies are deeply (and deliberately) flawed. For instance, the author concludes that Lexus vehicles are not actually of high quality because they did not appear at the top of the JD Power five year durability reports. Of course, in the year the author chose as his baseline, Lexus had only been sold in the US for four years; the author deliberately ignored subsequent reports which put Lexus at or near the top. And of course in the decade since the book was written, Lexus has continued to rank at or near the top.The book is full of such errors, and while it's possible that some of them are honest mistakes, my conclusion was that the author decided to write a Japan-bashing book, then looked for ways to create \\"evidence.\\" Eberts is a fraud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Match With Facts","review":"This book is either a clever piece of propaganda paid for by American industry, or the author is not fact checking. Consumer Reports provides ample comparisons between US, European and Japanese automobiles, and the Japanese win hands down. The Japanese have pushed precision manufacturing to new levels because of their focus on quality. The book falls down because it essentially manufactures data to support its contention -- which is the wrong way around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Material","review":"This book was very easy to read and follow.

Considering the targeted age, which I think is 4 or 5 year olds, I can handle some minor inaccuracies. It communicates on a simple level the difficulties that the Separatists felt in England, their courage to leave their homeland for an unknown territory, their lengthy time at sea, and their ideas about their unknown Indian neighbors which were corrected by the generous way the Indians helped them. It ends by simply stating that we still observe Thanksgiving today, inspired by this pilgrim's feast, helping a young child understand that we are still connected to these courageous people.

Teaching our children a biased viewpoint of the First Thanksgiving empowers racism to continue in this country. Popular renditions of the First Thanksgiving (such as this book) give children the mistaken impression that the relationship between American Indians and English colonists was one of mutual help, respect and friendship. This popular belief does not take into account the way in which the colonists persecuted the American Indians, sold them into slavery and drove them from their homes. Not to mention the epidemic diseases colonists brought to America, genocide and erosion of tribal soverreignty.

I was severely disappointed with it and do not reccomend it to ANYONE. I do however reccomend the refurbished products at apple.com.

Tech support was rude & dismissive. And the voice recognition menus to get there were torturous. We exchanged the unit for another one. This one will not load music correctly. Tech support is again unable to help. We are returning #2 and getting another brand entirely. Beware of Phillips. Lousy support. Very difficult product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty Little Gadget","review":"I received this little MP3 player for my birthday in place of an IPod due to the shortage of IPods in this area. I must say that I am overly pleased with this item. It holds tons of songs, the play back is very nice, FM tuner is great, options are nice, mine came with a docking cradle, usb cord with power cord, little rubber sleave, ear buds and of course software. The screen; however small, is very easy to ready and very bright making pictures very visable.The only things that I find a little frustrating with the actual player is that the battery charge does not hold for as long as I expected it to. The software which is Windows Media supported is a bit confusing and one needs to work with it if they a novice with WMP. All in all this is a great little player for the money. Especially for students on the go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, bad shelf-life","review":"I really enjoyed the ease of use and other fun features like the picture albums. The battery life was fantastic. The integration with Windows media player was great (no third party P2P needed). But...notice I am writing in past tense...the hard-drive died a couple of months into my deployment to Afghanistan. Not a great time to be without tunes. So I contacted customer support. At first they said it was out of warranty. Which was weird, because they only started making them less than a year ago!? Then they said they would replace it, but I couldn't ship it to them from overseas. So I had to ship it back to my wife who had to call philips and get an RMA and a UPS label and finally ship it to the factory and get it back and mail it back to me. Anyway, I am not too impressed with the quality of the product or the customer service experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got what I paid for","review":"This item is really on the cheaper end for mp3 players as far as how many songs it can hold (3,000 vs. the ipod's 1,000). I haven't had any problems with it at all and so far I am pleased. I purchased the device as a replacement for my creative zen micro, which just stopped working all together after a month of limited use. In comparision, this product is much better and more reliable. My only complaint is that the battery doesn't last as long as I'd hoped, but overall I am happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk and customer service is a bad joke","review":"Just bought this HDD1630 and spent 2 hours trying to get it to work. Tech support was the worst, like speaking to a rock. Sorry, a rock has more knowledge then Philips tech support. Installed all of their software and was told that Philips onlys sells the mp3 player but dose not support the software. In short if you want to waste your time and pull your hair out then I would go out and buy this Philips product now. If you want to listen to music or audio books then do what I did and return this piece of junk and go out and buy a sandisk for less money and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"$200 thrown away.","review":"the thing began to malfunction 2 months after i bought it. when i called to complain, they would give me instructions that never worked... well i just switched to different problems every time.it freezes all the time and i have to reset it, the screen goes black randomly, it's slow to respond, the battery doesn't last long anymore. oh, and the rubber things always come off the earphones so i had to buy new ones by sony.i've had it for 1 year and a half and it won't sync with my computer on any program anymore. i tried repairing it with the device manager it comes with, but it never works. there's a wall between the player and my computer.i'm buying an ipod as soon as i can afford it. you should too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it til it quit completely on day 3","review":"The color is great, blue light is definitely sexy. Touch navigation was sensitive and easy to use. Uploading music was a breeze. Sound was great, even the color display was equal to my cell phone. Options for saving battery life (backlight timing, skin options, etc) nice touch. Slipped right into my pocket while shopping. Well all that is past tense because today (the 3rd day) I attempt to turn it on to fully discharge the battery before recharging and it will not even power up. I figure it was in need of charging, so I plug it in to the wall... no life. Change outlets, no life. I plug it into the USB and it shows nothing. I'm so sad. I love this little thing and now I may have to get an iPod which makes me feel like a sell out. If anyone else had this problem and it is easily fixed, drop me a line. I want to keep it, but only if it will work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great...for 2 days.","review":"I did lots of research before purchasing this product. When I decided on it, I knew I was taking a chance. It arrived and I was extremely excited. It charged great. Adding Mp3s was so simple. The fm tuner was amazing. The voice recording was surprisingly ok. Then, on the third of having it in my possession, it just quit. I charged it. I let it rest. It just wouldn't turn back on. I had barely used it. I hope that it just happened to be the one I received. If so, I would change my rating in a heart beat. The two is for 2 days it did work. The main problem is that now I am very scared of buying an mp3 player. I don't know who to trust."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"This item was purchased for my son's birthday in August. He's 13 and loves it! The only complaint I heard about it since then is that the earbuds often fall out of place. The player comes with 2 sets of earpieces and he wasn't impressed with the fit of either. However, the download and playback process is simple and easy to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of crap....waste of money","review":"this thing worked semi well for the first month. it lagged alot but the colors were good. month later, the headphones blow out but they were crap from the begining. then it starts lagging to the point where i have to reset it. then today i turned it on and it said hook up to computer. it read it as a hard disk and i cant fix it now. hopefully phillips can replace it or something. even so, dont waste your money. i havent heard any complaining about the ipod so you might as well buy it. its compatable with pcs so i guess its ok...thats how pissed i am. im supporting the ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but problems","review":"It worked great for about 2 weeks and after that it has turned into nothing more than a problem.

I thought this one had the best reviews and I decided to purchase. Im glad I did. The cons to the reviews where about the case. After searching for a case better then the one it came with, I found an alternative. Fellowes has these cool plastic protective stickers that you can put onto the mp3 player to protect the face. I have yet to experiance any type of problems with the device itself. Overall I love it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 10 days...","review":"I got this to replace a Zen Micro because the store didn't have a replacement. What a mistake! Although it is very sleek looking and the color screen is nice, there are too many negatives to ignore. The headphones sound awful, I had to use a pair I already had. The interface is very cumbersome and it was PAINFULLY slow to transfer music to the device, because I had to download first to Windows Media Player--you cannot transfer directly from a CD to the device. I also don't like the control buttons on the side, and the hold button does not eliminate the change in volume. Not a great design.Also, after 10 days it died. Nothing, nada--lost all data (but it is all on my PC with media player), and it wouldn't take a charge. I am getting another Micro. Much better device for the money, and much easier to use.I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing mp3 player","review":"The philips gogear is sleek, reliable, and just plain awesome! It holds 3 times more than the 2 GB ipod nano, has fm radio, radio and voice recording, and better sound quality for the same price. occasionally the screen freezes, but simply restart it and it works fine after that. I like how the buttons light up when you touch them.Overall,this is a great kid/teenager mp3 player, that holds over 700 songs if you have it on the highest sound quality. I'm 14, and I think its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"not please","review":"This product had flaws such as battery would not hold a charge. It was slow to download music.

I've taken care of this device and I've never dropped it or contributed into something that could've damaged it. I would say the device is WEAK. I still have everything; s for the stuff and the durability is fine, but when it comes for the stuff to actually work : FAIL. I regret buying it and I don't know what to do with it, it's just sitting there. My advice is to buy something more than 50% of the people on earth have, so everyone is familiar with it; as for MP3 players, Apple iPods are the best, hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unusable without new software","review":"WARNING!! This player only works with Windows Media Player 10, which has been replaced by WMP 11 6 months ago.

They machine wash and dry wonderfully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy!","review":"What a delightful surprise of a CD! The Larry Eanet Quartet plays with assurity and delicacy, and quite a bit of class, too. Reedman Ron Hockett is especially strong on clarinet, though his soprano sax playing is most lyrical. Two Ellington tunes feature his soprano, and they are exquisite: SULTRY SUNSET and LADY OF THE LAVENDER MIST. He plays tenor on only one track - IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO A DREAM (another Ellington composition) - and it's a highlight of the CD. His tone is beautiful; hopefully he'll play tenor more on other CDs. Larry Eanet is a wonderful piano player, never overbearing, never showing off. The rhythm section is supportive and bright. Every tune is a delight, and the CD is the epitome of classy, imaginative mainstream swing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"Sometimes you're just in the mood for a good scary movie. This is not it. Bad acting, bad story.

The text jumps around, she refers to characters that have little or no context, and employs too many unique British references and terminology. All in all a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Race Wrench Set","review":"This is a high quality wrench set, and the colored caps match industry standards. I am a big Losi/TLR fan and I have both race wrench and nut drive sets. The handles are not quite as comfortable as they could be, and that is why I took 1 star off the rating.As a side note the 22, 22T, and 22SCT require a 1mm wrench for a single screw in the rear pivot. This screw is actually optional, but it makes assembly MUCH easier. I mention this because the smallest wrench in the set is a 1.5mm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and helpful","review":"This is my 3 1/2 year old daughter's favorite book.

Cute book, I'm buying a copy for friends, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book will make your little ones paranoid.","review":"This book repeatedly emphasizes that germs are mean and that they are everywhere and that their sole purpose is to GET YOU. Very scary, actually. It puts them in your body, in your food, in the air and the miminally addressed topic of keeping yourself clean does not banish them. The next page just puts them all back somewhere else. It is not clear at all that handwashing, not letting other people sneeze on you, washing the floor, not leaving food overnight on the counter are effective ways to keep healthier. The emphasis is on a ton of very cute cartoony germs in multitudes. The health aspects are implied only--and poorly at that. Behaviors like nose-picking are RIDICULED. Not good for kids up to about age 10, especially if you're trying to teach health and cleanliness issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chef Harvey 5 Piece Garnishing Tools (#4400T)","review":"I purchased the Chef Harvey 5 Piece Garnishing Set. It consisted of a corrugated garnishing tool, food decorator, spiral slicer, twin curl cutter and paring knife. With shipping and handling it cost $22.00. The food decorator is made out of such thin metal it feels like it will cut your hand if you give it a firm grip. The spiral slicer has a thick plastic screw tip that splits the carrots rather than cutting them in a spiral. Twin curl cutter is just as cheap to the look and feel. Not surprisingly, at the bottom of the invoice, it says \\"thanks for your order - non returnable\\". So even the company must know it's an inferior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"it doesnt stand up to little sisters","review":"Well I bouhgt Yuna and Ricku a while a go and I was having a lot of fun with them.

I would highly reccomend this book & this series to anyone who is into mystery genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for the Dough","review":"If you are a Janet Evonvich fan, you will love this and all the books in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kenny Mancuso!","review":"Janet Evanovich's 2nd book kept me at the edge of the seat wanting more!! This book is a very exciting, lots of action--and humor with Stephanie's Grandma, laugh out loud funny. It's a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie's still learning...","review":"Likes:'Two for the Dough' was a fast-paced, exciting read. There was not one boring section in the entire book. Grandma Mazur and the rest of Stephanie's family is hilarious and I liked how they were a lot more involved in this book than they were in the first book. Grandma Mazur even helps Stephanie with catching Kenny Mancuso. Stephanie is still learning the trade of being a bounty hunter and 'Two for the Dough' is filled with laugh-out-loud moments of her trying hard to be a good bounty hunter but completely failing. Even though she still needs the help of Joe Morelli and isn't ready to work on her own yet, you can see that she is getting better and has improved since the first book.Dislikes:Ranger and Eddie Gazarra were almost nonexistent. Ranger wasn't involved in the story at all. In fact, if I remember correctly he was only in about 2 scenes in the entire book. Eddie was maybe in 1. I expected Ranger to play a big role in catching Kenny Mancuso."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just fell in love and laugh so much! Thanks","review":"Hi,don\`t want to write a two pages review but after the first it is just getting better and better and also make me laugh so everyone around me when I read look at me and ask me what is going on!Thank so much to the author for sharing and please keep Stephanie Plum alive for long!!Regards"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these books","review":"These books are so fun - I am re-reading the entire series. I think I read them so fast the first time (because they are so much fun) that it almost feels like reading them for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"LAUGH OUT LOUD!","review":"THIS BOOK WAS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE. I COULD RELATE TO SO MUCH, AND I REPEATEDLY LAUGHTED OUT LOUD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie's granny is a hoot!","review":"I really liked Janet Evanovich's first Stephanie Plum book and looked forward to the second in the series. I was not disappointed.In this book, Stephanie enlists the help of her grandmother -- a character if there ever was one -- to help her track down a killer and 26 missing caskets.There are a lot of twists and turns, but the ending is worth it all. Grandma Mazur saves the day, albeit by setting fire to an arsenal of stolen ammunition...and from the basement of the local funeral home!Read this book and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"I heard how the Stephanie Plum books were supposed to be great but they're not even decent shallow reading. The characters are one dimensional stereotypes, and speaking of stereotypes there are plenty. I've read the first couple of books and can't believe she was able to get a whole series out of this character. Plum is annoying and the mysteries are easy to figure out. This second one read like a Tv movie. Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not JE's best book","review":"I like reading Stephanie Plum's novels because although they don't have anything to learn or to think about you'll laugh while you read them,this book doesn't have jokes and the end is heavy as lead, grandma Mazur doesn't have the spark that has in other books, and at the end Morelli knew exactly what happened with the bad guys just because he is a cop. I think JE wanted to finish the book and just put an end to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I keep coming back for more","review":"I bought # 1 while on vacation because I had a couple of friends that said they've enjoyed the series. I thought I'd buy 1, maybe 2 but I'm hooked. It's a fast read & good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephanie Plum is getting even better!","review":"This is the second Stephanie Plum book. Could it be as good as \\"One for the Money\\"? Yes! Stephanie's back, and so are her mom, dad, grandma, Morelli, and all the others that made the first book so great! Stephanie is coming into her own in this book. She's working on collecting the bounty on a guy who shot a mechanic in the knee. Then, the mechanic turns up dead. Stephanie is gaining confidence in her job as a bounty hunter. She's even offered a side job by the sleazy funeral director, Spiro. This is a great story. You'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for the Dough","review":"I am hooked on the Stephanie Plum series! I purchased both the abridged and unabridged of this book and by far get the UNABRIDGED VERSION. Much much better! Ranger and Joe very hot! Stephanie as crazy as ever!! It is great to get lost in these stories.
