These are $59.99 sheets, without a doubt. And, since Pinzon is Amazon's own line of sheets and you can't buy them anywhere else, I think that the $150 \\"list price\\" is false advertising. As $59.99 queen-size sheets, they are what you expect. I washed them with detergent and fabric softener before I put them on the bed. They are tough sheets in all senses of the word. They will probably wear well but they feel \\"tough.\\" These are not the sheets you would buy for the Princess who could feel a pea under many layers of mattress. It may be, and I hope, that these sheets will soften up with wear and washing and I'm not going to buy another set right now. But, as the title of this review indicates, I got what I paid for.

The 4 year old sheets still felt smooth in most areas while the new sheets felt like peach fuzz all over - the noise from light friction caused by the new sheet compared to the quiet old sheet was shocking.

Others, who hate Kola Boof for her political and social views, are totally scared that she is going to be heard and understand by the masses.This is a masterful poetry collection that dramatically and emotionally exposes the true heart of a very brave African woman.

Does that make her poetry good, or even bearable? Unfortunately, no it does not. It would indeed appear that reviewers are praising this author for having survived many difficulties rather than taking an objective look at her poetry.When I read poetry I really don't care about the author's personal history. I only care whether the poetry is worth reading. This is not.

Nearly the entire story is revealed through a third-person description of Lindy's thoughts, and there is, thus, a huge distance between the readers and the characters and events of the story.

I would read an excerpt of this or a chapter first before making it a choice selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic","review":"What a poetic book, it is a sad story that is more than well written.

This novel is the same way, out of focus. It sounded like it would be an interesting read. Murder. A Stolen baby. Hiding out in lush, humid Galveston. The character never came to life--Lottie, Lettie? See, I can't even remember her name. There's some pretty writing here, but I couldn't enjoy the book for the distance. Also I had trouble understanding why Lettie would perform an autopsy on her own sister. It seemed cold and gruesome. Next I couldn't understand why Lettie took her sister's baby and left town, making her escape seem like an abduction. It didn't ring true and I felt even more distanced from Lettie because I couldn't understand how her mind worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Angst gets in the way","review":"When I first read the synopsis of this story I thought it was going to be about a woman, who with the reluctant permission of her family and fiance, goes back to her grandmother's house to grieve for her lost sister and rediscover her past and the things about herself that give her life meaning again. And since the father was in no position to care for his child she just takes him with her. Instead she runs away and hides and worse, causes so much more grief, that she becomes a rather selfish and unsympathetic character. Poetic language is one thing but not when pointless plot devices get in the way. This story could have been told with grace without the angst ridden hiding out aspect. I understand the point that grief can bring you to desperate measures but this wasn't plausible or believable and reduces what could have been a compelling story"},{"rating":"2","title":"If lovin Sin is wrong, then I don't wanna do right","review":"I was told this was Ms Rhodes first book.

In my personal library of opera performances, I have over 500 different titles, and this recording of \\"Ernani\\" rates among the top 20% in excellence. The re-mastering is superbly done, the orchestra as well as supporting cast are outstanding. \\"Ernani\\" is not one of Verdi's most often parformed operas, but that does not decrease its value to the true lover of opera. Even with no camera present to record the actress, when La Kabavainska sings \\"Ernani, Ernani!\\" the listener cannot help but respond to the depths of emotion of this tragic heroine. No listener will be disappointed as these two greatest of the great artists, Domingo and Kabaivanska, elevate Verdi's beautiful opera to new heights of beauty. Five stars are not enough for this magnificent performance!

I was expecting a regular romance page turner with lightly humor filled comments and instead found a well of human emotion. I am a pretty jaded romance reader but I cannot help the fact to gush aloud when I come across a book that moves me so. The story of man who cannot forgive himself for losing his two sisters while he was young and him slowly finding redemption through a Miss Hope Merridew made me misty eyed. That and him battling with himself to choose a bride he thinks is suitable for his two young and torn sisters just made for a heck of a page turner.

The tempo never really picks up like their later effort 'Interiors', but never the less, doesn't disappoint. I feel that there was just a different artistic goal on this project. My favorite tracks are 20th Century and Nadine. Both have a funk tip that gets the groove under you skin. Other notable tracks are Screen and Raise Love, both worthy of high praise. This album is a must for fans of Brad or Shawn Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching and emotional...","review":"Brad conveys emotion like Monet could paint flowers...with a natural ease and a unique style that cannot be denied. The uplifting songs on this album will make you feel elated, while the softer ballad-type songs will have you weeping like a child. When I first bought this, I could only listen to it in small doses. Too much would wear me out emotionally, and I would be put off from listening to it again for a long time. I only play it once every 2 years or so, but I still consider it one of my favorites. I remember back in '94, driving my car in the rain, singing along, and all of a sudden, I'm sobbing like my dog died. A few songs later, I'm bobbing my head along to the music like I don't have a care in the world. It's that magical.

It is wobbly, no matter what position you put it in (and good luck changing the positions!).

The dangling crab and fish came off constantly and had sharp edges. It was really hard to change the positions too. This toy doesn't even have that much to hold a child's attention.

The book is based on anecdotal evidence and observations of penned deer. Another author, John Ozoga, writes concerning the effects of age, nutrition, social status, habitat, and population dynamics among the factors influencing the onset and duration of the rut. I do not wish to disparage these observations and anecdotes, he gives sufficient from wide ranging areas to bolster his point; and; anecdotal evidence can, and sometimes does, have the force of experimentation. But then, how would one design more rigorous experiments?I think that Mr. Alsheimer is a biological pioneer for this theory. He has shown himself to be a keen observer of whitetail life, and has made an important contribution to our understanding of the rut.This book is, without question, well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"DX: Purely ponderous drudgery :-(","review":"The author frequently rhetorically contradicts himself. Content information is shallow historically and theologically, and at times is in error.

I can understand that for a 15 year old her voice is very good, but she doesn't seem to have that depth or range that would be nice with this movies soundtrack.

The next 3 songs are fairly solid too and delve a bit more into their unusual side combining acoustic with heavier riffs. The final song is a throwaway of silence and noises.Overall great ep and its a shame no albums have been released yet comprising the best of all the eps and singles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This book is not what I expected. I was hoping for some choral warm-ups, active ice-breaker games, etc.--anything for active music learning with active children! Instead, it's a very boring collection of fill in the blanks, crossword puzzles based on traditional hymns, etc. Nothing I could use for my after-school choir at a Christian school. Although, a few of these activities might be good to leave for a substitute that has no musical background.

After a couple of months all Target floor lamps break, whether it is the pole that holds up the lamp, or the on off switch. This particular beauty came broken right out of the box. One of the threads were stripped on the legs so the lamp kept falling over, after a modification with electrical tape, i got it working.

Nothing else works this way in my house and it makes me very uncomfortable! I knew better than to toss my receipt, because now target won't return it.

The first half of the book deals with \`self-management' and the bureaucratization of the Communist Party: valid themes, no doubt, but hardly key elements of an explanation of the war.

His book, though hardly a Pulitzer Prize winner, is a must of sorts for those collectors who go to shows and have always pined to either sell stamps of their own, or go into that business, or just know more about what it takes to make stamp world spin. Datz writes with humor and an infectious enthusiasm. The book is kinda short, and you are certainly sorry to have it end. I read TOP DOLLAR PAID some years ago, and have reread a couple of times since. I recommend that one too.

I am careful not to fill it with too much water. I clean it. I carefully place the filter in it. Just as I have done for months when it worked.Now every time I make coffee I get about three cups. The rest is all over the counter along with grounds. I've had a Braun for decades, never had this problem. Bought this one at Target because I liked the thermal feature to keep the coffee warm.

Condensation had built up in the clock several months ago, to the point that you could no longer read the numbers on the dials (the backlight still worked but the dials were unreadable). This was fine as long as the power didn't go out! Tonight I tried to push the button to turn on the timer for tomorrow's brew cycle and those no longer work so the pot won't brew anything, timed or not.

After the 1st return, I repurchased the same pot. Within one month, the entire clock faded to black and would not work, which meant NO timer functioning. I thought that this was a fluke, so I returned the pot (again!) and got another one. After 3 months, the clock still worked, but the option to set the clock or turn on the timer just STOPPED working.

I was thankful this was only a water \\"test run\\" and it was not my usually strong coffee going every which way ... but trying to control hot water gushing out was not a picnic either. After cleaning up the mess, I reread all the instructions and tried to reset controls, etc. Eventually, I decided this was not the coffeemaker for me; plus it has too too much plastic (which I dont like the taste of in my coffee) so I will try another brand.

The shirts are light enough to wear under flannel or woolen shirts, without bulk, and they are substantial enough to wear alone when the temperature dips.A word about fit: these shirts fit well with a good drape and without excessive or flowing fabric.

This is OK if you assume the reader has trained longer, or atleast gets the details from their own teacher. But if you've trained longer, i doubt you'll get much new info from this book. And if you've trained less, IMO you need more detailed info. If you need to ask the details from your teacher, you'd be better off asking the drills from your teacher too.Atleast one good option is \\"Attack proof\\" by Perkins / Ridenhour / Kovalsky.

Here the story, while still partly in the present, actually takes us to the past to an event that changes Q's life forever. Though the premis is good, it is drawn out ever so long, and I found myself wanting to skip ahead to where the action is.There are a few interesting events, but Q is not as well written as he was in the last book.Other major characters take a back seat to the overall plot in this chapter.The one thing that really bothered me is that Jean Luc, for reasons unkown, cannot figure out why Q is allowing him to witness events in the past. It is sooooo obvious to the reader, but Jean Luc only figures it out on the last page.I honestly think the author could have condensed book two into books 1 and 3 respectfully. Make each one of the slightly longer and cut out some of the inaction and drawn out sequences."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like Q, you'll probably like this.","review":"This entire trilogy is a gold mine for those of us who are fascinated by Q. Unfortunately, it is probably not going to appeal to those who find Q annoying, or those looking for a classic Picard-centered adventure (even though he appears on the cover).In this book, Q, having kidnapped Picard right off the bridge of the Enterprise-E, begins sharing parts of his past with Picard in typical Q fashion... by transporting them both back in time to witness the events first-hand. As he does this, he shows us a completely different being, in attitude at least, than the smug, self-assured Q we are used to seeing on the TV series. We also see that Q was at least indirectly behind several of the adventures of Kirk and his Enterprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"All potential left unused","review":"The second book in the Q-Continuum trilogy is even worse than the first one.We get a novel with as much potential as any novel can have, and it's left completely unused.\\"Q-Zone\\" centeres around Q's past, showing us Q's and Picard's journey through space and time. Unfortunately we don't get to witness the ultimate, surreal, fantastic Q-adventure, like the later released \\"IQ\\" by Peter David and John DeLancie, but insted we get to see tons of boring, irrelevant scenes, that are structured badly.Meanwhile on the Enterpprise, things progress absolutely nowhere, giving us pages of nothing intellectually, or even emotionally appealing.Irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suffers from a bad case of middle-book-itis.","review":"As is usually the case in the middle book of a trilogy, this book suffers badly from being a story fragment with neither beginning nor ending; at least in the first book of a series, we get a beginning, and in the last book, we get a bit of closure. In the middle book, we get nothing but ongoing angst with no intro or settlement. This book is a good example of why serializations of more than two books are unsatisfactory; the series as a whole continues to be of moderate interest, but this book by itself is pretty worthless. Necessary if you're to get from book one to book three, but definitely not worth reading on its own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humor-ridden bit of escape with a boomer bonus romance","review":"This was a charming read. I haven't LOL reading in awhile but this one had some nice laughs interspersed with a charming children's tale. Also appreciated was the secondary love story with the characters who were past the bloom of youth which is a generation left out of most romance novels but who are amongst the genres the most faithful readers. I passed a pleasant evening with these folks and willl look for more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captured my Heart!","review":"I was in such a good mood while reading this book I wanted to write my review before I even finished! It is the most fun refreshing read I have had in years! If you are in a funk read this story! If you are stressed out and tired of the news of the world.....curl up and read this book! It is just a sweet escape of a romance story with the best humor! Susan isn't corny at all.....she is just darned funny and RIGHT ON with her one liners!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No chemistry","review":"I tried, but I just didn't feel the chemistry between Molly and Kevin. I felt more chemistry and understanding between Kevin's mom and the painter than Molly and Kevin. Molly came off as really childish and Kevin's character was underdeveloped. Funny read, but fell flat..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I was a bit dissapointed by the lack of love there was in this story for the longest time. Hence the low four star rating. The hero runs around doing what he needs to do because he was told 'stand up and do your duty' as a child and the heroine just goes along for lack of anything better to do. Once they begin to fall in love and see each other though, the book really comes through with a great love story. By the end of the book I couldn't help but like all the characters in the novel. It made me want to run out and buy the other books in this series. I have a feeling they will be better.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Heart of Mine has love, laughter and tears....","review":"I loved this book. Within the first few chapters I was laughing out loud and there were a few tears as well. SEP is a master at mixing the funny-stuff in with heart tugging moments. I liked the way she wove bits of Molly's 'writing' into the story--very clever.This book is exactly what a romance should be. It is a keeper along with all of Ms. Phillips work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offended & Appalled","review":"I don't offend easily, but I was offended by this latest effort by Susan Elizabeth Phillips. What Molly did to Kevin was unforgivable. That Kevin even speaks to her again was unbelievable. That everyone reviewing this book is giving it 4 & 5 stars appalls and saddens me. How would we react if this had happened to a male loved one? Would we say that it was okay and he should marry the woman who did that to him? I certainly hope that's not true. If the roles had been reserved, would it have ever been published as a \\"romance\\" and would you have wanted to read it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great romance novel","review":"Loved the followup on Phoebe's little sister, Molly. Such a great romance. And nice followup to It Had To Be You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, fun, sexy, romantic read!","review":"Loved this book, just as I loved the others in this series. Love, romance, sexiness, funny. Quick read & I'd highly recommend this and all the Chicago Stars books in the series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What is it about those Star's Quarterbacks?","review":"Although this newest SEP had a predictable plot, with no real surprises, I was totally involved from the start and just couldn't put it down, not even in the taxi cab on the way from the airport.... Molly and Kevin's love story seemed much tamer than other SEP's romances, but the tension between the two kept things interesting. I really enjoyed the subplot between Lilly and Liam...sexually charged chemistry, and passionate self-discovery that only experience, time and courage can reveal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SEP disappointment","review":"I, too, anxiously await the latest SEP release. I was very disappointed in this story. It was way too similar to some of her previous books, even down to the stupid little dog. It was much too similar to the story of the sister, but that was a very good read, being the first time around. I started the book, left it on my table, read a few in between, and then decided to finish it off in the hopes it would get better. It didn't. Instead of buying this one, re-read one of her old releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book","review":"I thought this was a really good book. I have not been reading the Chicago Stars books in order. I read It Had To Be You (first in the series) before reading this book. Because Dan and Phoebe are also in this book it was like reading the sequel - 12 years later. It was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible as always","review":"Well if you are wondering if you should wait for this book to get to paperbook, DON'T-BUY IT NOW!! I usually do, but Susan E. Phillips is one of my favorite authors and I had to have it now and it was worth it. This story rounds out the Chicago Stars Football series and features Kevin (football player) and Molly (writer) who were minor characters from previous novels. By the way, if you are new to her books you should read \\"Heaven, Texas\\" (one of my favorites). This book takes these two characters to a campground for the summer (after a difficult start to their relationship) and this is where they fall in love. While it is just a little bit slow in the beginning once you get into it you can not put it down. I laughed outright many times during the story. It is just so heartwarming. And it is a must read. ENJOY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!!","review":"I loved every page of this book and loved the way Susan Elizabeth added all the adorable tales of Daphne.....how imaginative!!!!! I read it in one day because I couldn't put it down. You will laugh out loud and fall in love with Kevin right along with Molly. I can't wait to read the next book by Ms Phillips and she is quickly becomming one of my favorite romance authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another witty and fun read from author Susan Elizabeth Phillips.","review":"Although I preferred the first three Chicago Stars football books to this one, I still rank this one with 4 stars as a good read. The first three books which I felt were great are: It Had to be You, Heaven, Texas, and Nobody's Baby But Mine. In this book, I didn't enjoy the two main characters as much as I enjoyed the characters in her other books. I'm not sure why. They both sought entertainment through risk taking. Molly was supposed to be very smart, so I couldn't understand why she would give away all her inherited money. This book did have me laughing out loud several times and it was a nice romance story.DATA:Sexual language: moderate. Number of sex scenes: about eight. Setting: current day Chicago, Door County, Wisc and Northern Michigan. Copyright: 2001. Genre: contemporary romance with comedy.OTHER BOOKS:For a list of my reviews of other Susan Elizabeth Phillips books, see my 5 star review of \\"Glitter Baby\\" posted 1/15/09."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to her usual standard","review":"I can't believe all the great reviews this book is getting! The beginning was just awful and these characters have no chemistry whatsoever!! The kids were fun, as were the characters out at the camp, but Dan and Phoebe were overbearing and irritating and the SKFSA plot device was weak and underused. This book was no where near as good as Dream a Little Dream, Kiss An Angel, and Heaven, Texas. I really hope Just Imagine is better, but after two duds in a row (First Lady was the other dud), I'm a little worried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!","review":"Let me start off by saying that I LOVE SEP books. I think she is a fabulous writer and I have been so excited to read this book. However, I was sooooo disappointed by this one. I could simply not like Molly--she was stupid! Truly and literally--an airhead and I did not like the way the book started--how she started her relationship with Kevin. He's a great character and it's almost like he was overshadowed by her reckless behavior. I never thought I would be giving an SEP book a bad review but I am sorry--this one stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"terrible character chemistry and the main characters werent very likeable especially molly. she practically rapes the guy when hes asleep which just disgusted me. her attachment bordered on obsessive. ridiculous and a waste of money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Susan's books have added such joy to my life but this one was very weak. First off, the fact that Molly rapes Kevin is so unbelievable. I can't believe someone as smart and level- headed as Molly would do that. Secondly, there was NO chemistry between these two characters...they acted like brother and sister! I was bored silly.The only saving grace of this book was the subplot between Kevin's mother and the artist. Wow! I felt those sparks :)Borrow, don't buy this book. In fact pick up one of SEP's other books for they are far more romantic and fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this \\"football\\" series!","review":"I have been looking for this book for awhile, since it was one of the last books in the series that I had not read yet. I have to say its in my top three favorite from this author. I love the back stories and the front story. It made me laugh and cry and that is how I measure a good book. For it can make me laugh and cry and want more in the end that author did a wonderful job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking, No Love Story Here","review":"SEP waited to long to write a sequel to all the other \\"Chicago Stars\\" So it was hard to have total recall of the other characters mentioned in the story that appeared in the other stories. (It Had To Be You, Heaven Texas, Nobody's Baby But Mine and Dream A Little Dream). Molly acted like a child herself most of the time. And her children book characters kept popping up everywhere which gets old real fast. As for Kevin, it was very hard to believe he played football. There isn't a football player I'v seen who would live in \\"paintbox cottages\\". He acted like a dork, but at least he looks great in a t-shirtMolly and Kevin are hard to believe were a couple. They just didn't click. Not one of SEP best, but please don't let this book turn you off on SEP's other books or books let to come. It's hard to keep a series going that long. As least SEP gave it her best shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good...","review":"This story didn't measure up to Susan Elizabeth Phillips standards. There wasn't as much wit, and barely any fire, if any. I liked the Daphne story twists, but the heroine seemed a little contrived and not so well developed. The story dragged. I trudged through it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Waste of time","review":"Another SEP bottom feeder. Yes, you see lots of 5 star reviews; here's the test: did you admire First Lady? What? Found it unreadable? Well, pal, if you would like to repeat that experience, try this latest number. Forget a full critique: this book is DUMB, that's all. How could an author get so bad, so fast, after being so good, for so long?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and uninspiring","review":"I read about half of if and dumped it. It is so boring. I've read SEP's other books before like Nobody's Baby but Mine, Heaven Texas, It had to be You, Dream a Little Dream. Those were much more interesting. This seems like a cheap cop out during a writer's block.My main problem with SEP is that all of her books are the same: This is very similar to Nobody's Baby but Mine: both women trick the men into sleeping with them, women get pregnant, men force them to marry them because they don't want to breed [...], women underestimate sports jocks to be stupid but they prove to be smart, yudda yudda yudda. All of the conversations are the same, it's the same shallow humor that lacks essense and chamistry. While i really liked Nobody's Baby But Mine, this is very poor quality along with Ain't She Sweet.Phillips needs to find a new inpiration and put an end to the Stars series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't recommend it","review":"I read all of Susan's books (some couple of times) except the last one published, till I discovered Francine Rivers' books that changed my life for eternity. Oh Susan, I wish you would read Francine River's books too and understand what I am trying to say and become a new type of a writer. Then I would read your books again. Francine was like you, but God changed her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape is not funny","review":"I really like most of SEP books, but I don't like how the rape of Kevin, yes rape, was handled in this story. The main characters lacked heart and charisma. Molly, acted immature and many of her actions were immoral, dangerous and showed a lack of empathy for others. The saving grace for this book were the secondary characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"women tricking men ....","review":"I read Nobody's baby but mine after this book, and wondered why the women always had to trick the men into getting into bed with them. I had no sympathy for Mlly. As Kevin points out, if he had done it to her, it would have been called rape! Understood SEP is a feminist, but this was disgusting. The same way that I found Jane in the previous book disgusting.But she writes well. Have to hand it to her!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Phillips delivers again","review":"After reading all of the football series books (just recently finished the first by backtracking) I was happy to find Molly and Kevin's story in hardback. SEP had me hooked! A must read for all SEP fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"This book was too disjointed. I think she forgot who her main characters were. I just couldn't read it. I usually like her books but this one didn't do a thing for me. I should have waited for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, I just don't kno....","review":"Evans sings OK and all and I have to give credit for being so young and having a CD, but I can tell she's young. When you hear her voice then you can automatically say, YEP THATS A KID!! Well, I don't know about you but it's not to pleasant. I like hearing a REAL singing voice. And hers is not a REAL singing voice. So, you can buy this CD and be dissapointed or just wait and save your money to spend on a better singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE NEEDS TO GROW UP A LITTLE MORE!!","review":"Sorry, but shes young. I think she should hold off. She really needs to wait. I think she will have bigger and more fans. Write now, I mean, WHO IS SHE? Just some pre-teen singer. Shes not big or nothing. Well, OH WELL!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAY WHAA??","review":"OK, don't buy this CD. Im only 10 and i know for a fact that this CD is not worth squat. I guess she's not really that good because i dont see any more of her CD's. This is just my opinion though, be dissapointed if you want to. But if I were you, I wouldn't buy this CD. Wait for her other CD's. Then MAYBE buy it (if it's any good)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't like it!!","review":"I was excited to buy this CD and when I did I was dissapointed, she doesn't sing that well, I mean good enough, but not really GREAT...her voice is to deep. It needs to be lighter. I dont really kno how to explain it but, it's just not my kind of singing voice that I like to hear. SORRY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps visualize the story, but kids may fall asleep","review":"The film is approx. 40 minutes and does a decent job of putting Faulkner's work on screen. Some of the stream-of-consciousness is conveyed through voice-overs, which may provide a good talking point with students.Tommy Lee Jones is a perfect Abner Snipes, in fact, I don't think I could picture him any other way.The downside is that it is rather boring, though I truly don't know how it could be spiced up, since it does stay true to the story.I plan to show it intermittently as we read the text, as students really struggle with it. I do believe it will be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barn Burning","review":"I thought it did a minimal job in translating the narration provided in the book to film. It was over dramatized and I did not like the editing. I do however think that Tommy Lee Jones was absolutely gorgeous back then and brought the character Abner to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!!!","review":"I had bought this bag for my daughter who was going in a trip but it got too late. Then I went out for some days and I had the chance to try it myself and I was really delighted. I think it is one of the most practical bags I have ever bought.

So I am very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many good memories!","review":"I remember exercising with this video years and years ago when I was probably only 7 or 8.

I'd love to purchase this tape just to watch it all again. Maybe someday when I have a kid or two of my own, I'll play this for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"A well-engineered and reliable kitchen appliance, say a toaster oven or a blender, has a certain functional beauty, and so does this book. Authors Mark C. Tibergien and Rebecca Pomering specifically target and serve financial advisers who own consulting firms. Based on their decades of consulting experience, the authors offer sound advice designed to protect - or deliver - any small financial service firm from a fiscal crisis. In the course of doing so, they debunk several myths, such as the notion that you can simply sell your way out of poor financial performance, or that most small firms don't need to borrow to pay for their operations. With an appendix chock full of helpful tools, such as a cash-flow calculator, a sample financial statement and a practice-management assessment questionnaire, this is a useful book for any small consultancy. We strongly recommend this book to financial advisers who know the value of good advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for advisory firms in transition.","review":"Tibergien and Pomering do a great job of jamming a fortune in good advice into a book any advisor can buy for what it costs to get a good haircut. If you're like me, you'll keep it on your desk and use it as your firm's operating manual. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful book","review":"I bought this book for my husband and his feedback is this a good book for pointers and ideas. You take from it what is relevant to you. Would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promises and Delivers","review":"The title of this CD makes two implicit promises. I promises love songs and it promises that they will be treasured. So they are on both counts.By and large, these are not Englebert's more famous numbers, although they are definitely associated with him. They are, however, superb. His voice has both the tone and the range to do an admirable job of singing them. He also has the skill to deliver them with the right emphasis and evoke the desired images of love, longing and, occasionally, loss.This is an outstanding collection and a must for lovers of the genre or the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, very funny.","review":"This is more a book about Marinaccio than about Star Trek . . . and thats a good thing.I want to KNOW more about this guy.

This is particularly disappointing given that their German Series is perfect.The first 1/4 of the book is devoted to the minutia of vowel sounds. It has no examples to speak of, and the tape that accompanies this book actually uses wrong answers intentionally!!! Thus, if you play the tape in your car without benefit of having the book with you, you will actually have incorrect examples played over and over. This obviously leads to confusion.Again, I've used the German, French, and Spanish versions of this series. The Spanish is also disappointing, but the Italian is so horrible that even it looks great.If you buy this, you are libel to frustrate yourself and actually run the risk of losing interest in Italian.Sorry, I wish the news were better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well manufactured ducks","review":"I've bought a lot of rubber ducks that do not float well, but these are an exception. They are heavy and do not turn over. They also do not have holes in the bottom so water can't get into them. I always hate cleaning out mildew out of ducks from my son's tub. You won't have a problem with these. I wish they made more than four so my son could use them to count higher. They are a little bulky on the top, but I guess they make it easier for kids to pick up. The price was right when I bought these from Amazon--$4.19, but lately I've seen the price listed higher on Amazon. I was going to buy the ABCD or shape version too, but I'm waiting for the price to go down again. The price went up immediately after I bought these, but they were listed at the $4 for a long time while I decided if I wanted to order them. My son also loved the bag that they came in.

I watched this video, and listened carfully to the conversations he had with God. Although at times the conversations appear to be in-line with what you would read in the Bible (the most read book of all time), much of the conversation was in direct opposition to the ideas and theology given in the Bible. I did enjoy the story line of someone overcoming adversity. I wanted to warn people out there that if you are a Bible believing Christian, you may be offended by this movie because it does not align with the Bible on some points; it comes across as what I would term new-age. I would suggest that if you want to have your own personal 'conversation with God', get yourself a copy of the bible - any version - and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great antidote to insomnia!","review":"I don't know if this is the worst movie I have ever seen, but it certainly deserves a spot in the top five of that dubious list.

The author has NO respect whatsoever for the word of God. He makes up his OWN answers as he goes along. These pathetic answers can be VERY confusing stumbling blocks for teens (AND adults) who do not yet know God's word. This book is NOT biblical in any way. It's a pathetically sick attempt to draw people away from the true word of God and into a 'worldy and secular' \\"Q & A\\" session that has absolutely *nothing to do with what God's word actually says.Keep this book AWAY from children, teen or otherwise.

It preys on the emotional confusion of the heartache and pain of the human race. God did not create a world in the state it has evolved! God cares deeply for our souls and that is why He sent His one and only Son, Jesus Christ so that we could be united with God. God is holy and pure and beyond our being able to understand that concept because of the sinful state of this world we live in. God did not plan for this world to be in that state but because He has given each of us free will, this is what has evolved over time.

The most important lesson is that God is always with us however, we have to take action to create a more prosperous and fulfilling life. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring movie","review":"I agree with other reviews that say the title is a misnomer. It's true that the movie doesn't really cover the actual conversations with God that his books are about. However, the life of Mr Walsch is inspiring in itself. Even though we may not have experienced homelessness, the movie brings out so much empathy from the viewer that you feel you are experiencing it by proxy. Henry Czerny is a most amazing actor. I have not seen much of his work, but the choice of Mr Czerny as the lead was a true inspiration. He put his heart and soul into it. In my view his portrayal of Walsch was Oscar quality. Even though Walsch's books didn't feature as much as we hoped, I am sure it inspired people to go find out about them.

I have not read the book yet, but the movie just basically followed the author through his progression from homeless to author. I did like how they portrayed his homelessness. It seemed very real and I really felt for him. However, there wasn't nearly enough dialogue. There were issues that were left unexplained, and it almost seems to portray the author as some sort of prophet who actually heard the booming voice of God from above speak to him directly and he just \\"knew\\" about the woman in the book signing who lost her son... It just seemed a bit too theatrical and unrealistic, which made me not like the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conversations with God","review":"Very dissapointed, nothing to do with the book.

Was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was more about the making of the book than the book itself","review":"I was disappointed with the movie quite a bit.... I was expecting the movie to involve more of the content, depth, emotion of the books rather than just be a movie about his life while he was writing the books. Almost seems like a marketing piece for the book. It unfortunately seems to fit quite well with pyramid schemes, and those online marketer types who have secrets of making money online only to never have any legitimate business other than teaching other people how to make money online.Absolutely nothing against Mr. Walsch OR the books. The movie just felt very much lacking.For a spiritually enlightening movie, I would recommend 'Peaceful Warrior' instead.Or just read the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"I thought this movie really created a great awareness to many that we all have choices..all of the time..and everything truly does happen for a reason.

I was aware of Movie being in USED conditions. Unfortunately it was not only USED, but DVD was also \\"Scratched\\". I didn't get to see the full movie due to the heavy scratches on DVD. I don't think I will never buy a USED DVD from this seller again. Sorry, bad experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Way too \\"sweet\\".

The video basically recounted how Neale Donald Walsch hit rock bottom and pulled himself back up out of dispair and being a homeless person to someone with a bestselling book and financial freedom. The video was done in a series of flashbacks that were irritating after awhile. I was disappointed that the scenes with Walsh giving talks, he appeared facetious and extremely self serving in his lectures. I would never have bought the video if I had been able to rent and watch the video. It is not one that I would have especially wanted in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"What led to the writing of \\"Conversations\\" is more like it","review":"Conversations with God is my favorite book. It's the only book I've read more than once, I've given away many copies, and even after a decade of loving it, it's still #1 in my eyes. I was really excited about the DVD release, and got it the first day out, but was thoroughly disappointed (and not just because I went to film school). The movie barely reflects the book at all until the end. If you want to see what it's like to be homeless and destitute, check it out. We all have our own path. If you want to be inspired by one of the best books ever written, skip the movie and get the book right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled-- This Is A Tiny Pocket Atlas!","review":"Duh. ... There is a good reason-- it is a tiny, useless pocket atlas offering almost no detail. Unfortunately, the Amazon description (at least at the time I bought the book) did not mention this.I would imagine an atlas that lists only large highways and cities might be fine if you were, say, traveling from Boston to Seattle on I-90 ... That, however, is not part of my travel plan."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is not intuitive","review":"I am a computer programmer and had to use this book as a requirement for CIS class for my MBA degree. In my class I did not meet a single person who liked the book or found it satisfactory. I don't claim that I know everything about MIS. But the terms I knew are not explained well in the book. And it is very hard to understand terms I did not know. To illustrate my point, here is book's definition of the term \`hypertext markup language (html)' - \\"Page description language for creating Web pages and other hypermedia documents.\\" In my opinion you don't explain word \`hypertext' with \`hypermedia'. \\"Page description language for creating Web pages\\" doesn't sound intuitive either. Most of the definitions sound like that. The only positive thing was that Book Store gave me 50% of the book price back when I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Management Information Systems","review":"I had to read this book for a graduate-level class.

We are currently looking for an easier-to-understand book that is advanced enough for an MBA program.

It is superbly written, with entertaining references to science, literature, history, and music. The author reaches an intriguing set of conclusions linking our attitudes about people who want to alter consciousness, the ever-present desire to continue a consumerist culture, and growing ideas about multiculturalism. The tone is very friendly-- the sort of prose that makes you want to sit down with the author over a beer. I particularly like that he draws distinctions among different illicit drugs and shows an appreciation for their varied effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joe Cinque's Consolation","review":"As an avid true crime reader, I must say I was quite disappointed in this book.Realising that true crime must closely follow the course of events of what actually occurred it is also paramount that this is woven into a story that captures the readers attention and there is no doudt that this case had all the ingredients to do this .My impression was that this book was constructed nearly in its entirety from court transcripts .So much more could have colored this book if the author had spent more time in interviewing some of the other people who wereInvolved on the fringes. A missed opportunity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"\\"The Keys to Enlightened Living\\" changed my life. As I read this book I received practical information which I have been able to use in all aspects of my life. This channeled information involved those areas where I have been working to resolve issues and provided me insights and practical guidance regarding the topics of relationships, prosperity, self-responsibility, and sexuality.

In exchange for a night with Raymond, the snack-shop owner that Aquamarine is in love with, Aquamarine is suppose to go back to the ocean. She agrees. What happens? I'll let you find out! READ THE BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horrible Terrible Book","review":"This book really stunk. The idea is good; two girls, one is moving away, everything is changing, the girls find a mermaid in the swimming pool, there is romance, the mermaid goes back, the girl moves, the end. That's why I gave it two stars instead of one. But of course, the glitch. the print is huge. The wording is boring. There is no reason to buy this book unless you are a 6 year old girl that is obsessed with fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My eight year old loved this book","review":"She read it herself and loved the words as well as the wonderful artwork on the jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aquamarine","review":"Am I the only reader who was disappointed in this title?

Hailey lives with her grandparents and is moving away at the end of the summer. Claire and Hailey spend the whole summer together at the Capri Beach Club. They like to dip their feet in the pool and go have a snack at the snackbar. Raymond is the man who runs the snackbar and he is off to college at the end of the summer. One day Hailey and Claire see a shadow in the pool. Next, they set bait and find a mermaid. Aquamarine is snotty at first but finds out that she is in love with Raymond. She gets a date with Raymond but she starts to dry up! I won't tell the end but it was the best book ever! It as an easy level book and anyone from 2nd grade to adult would like to read it. This book shows that love is so important. Alice Hoffman also wrote Indigo, which is also one of my favorite books. I would recommed this book to anyone interested in fantasy, love, and friendship all in one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mermaid That Was Found","review":"As hailey and Claire, these two girls who discover the mermaid, go to the Capri Beach Club while they're haveing their last visits with eachother, they discover something at the bottom of the pool! it's a mermaid named aquamarine. Aquamarine left her six sisters to search for love on land. The next day when they go to the pool; they take some tuna so the mermaid will come to the surface of the pool and they will get to talk to her. When they finally do, they tell her about Ray, who is the guy who sells food and beverages at the Capri Beach Club. She decides to go on a date with him before Hailey moves. When they meet up with Ray and tell him about Aquamarine they tell him that she's their cousin and they think it would be cute to go on a date with her. Ray decides to go on a date with her and see how things turn out... but he never really finds out she's a mermaid till the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem of a little book","review":"A book about two best friends about to be separated by miles and time is a definite catch for me to read. And it's an unforgettable read. When the two girls discovered a mermaid at the bottom of a pool, the girls (Claire and Hailey) did everything they could to help Aquamarine meet her true love, a boy named Ray.It is a whimiscal & delightful read. It's a wonderful little book to add to everyone's library. Hoffman turns an old legend into modern day prose ~~ but the reader will fall in love with the characters and the siren song of the mermaid."},{"rating":"2","title":"A best book! I luved it!","review":"Aquamarine was a really good book.I luved it! It wasn't at all like the movie. I thought the book was better than the movie, but that's my opinion. If you want to be exicited, read the book.The movie was exciting, but left a lot of the parts out. Aquamarine, the mermaid, had a tail the whole time, not just when she touched water. She never had to worry about the beach club, or mean girls, the beach club was about to get torn down. Raymond was the only other person there besides Haley and Clarie.If you like better-than-the-movie books, this one's for you. Next time you go to the library, you should check this book out. I mean it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible, awkward, & stupid","review":"This book is not worth your time or money. The Book really is boring and ends by (obviously) the mermaid geting back to the water, and, (duh) and the guy goes with her.

She pestered me until I bought her the book. She waited with high hopes for two whole days for it to arrive. She was overjoyed when it arrived. Fifteen minutes later she finished the book and said, \\"I hate it. It stinks.\\"The book is short and nothing like the movie. Her advice? Movie is better.She is an avid reader and loves books, so this book has NOT earned high praise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aquamarine:Alice Hoffmans first failure","review":"I can't believe everybody liked this book! The characters were vapid and airheaded and the plot was pointless. A few innocent moments and sweet ideas give this book two stars instead of one, but mostly the characters were boy-crazy and unrealistic, and the writing with droning and simple language. I do not reccomend this book. It is so dumb how the plot was to get Aquamarine, the stuck up mermaid, on a date with Raymond the \\"cute\\" guy behind the snack bar at the Capri Beach Club. If you want to waste your time, read this book. If you want an adventurous, nonsteryotypical novel, read The Wind Singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aquamarine","review":"I must say that I was very sorely disappointed. Aquamarine is supposed to have travelled from the sea into a swimming pool where two best friends have spent the summer at supposedly to find love though you get more of a sense that she simply attempting to explore the human world. The only problem is that her body can't stand the chlorine in the pool let alone being on land.The real problem is Aquamarine's attitude. The author does mention that she'd been spoiled all her life and she acts rather ungrateful about everything. Then in the end, the two best human friends have no choice but to take Aquamarine back to sea probably never to see her again. How disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Middle Schoolers","review":"I loved the movie that this book was based off of. When I discovered the book, I just had to get it to expand the library for my middle school students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty - Marine","review":"Though this short story had a good basic theme and had the positive aspect of Hailey and Claire's strong friendship, the plot was completely without substance. Instead of finding a meaningful way of persuading Aquamarine to return to her ocean home, Hailey and Claire set her up on a date with a cute guy! Personally, I think that Ms. Hoffman could have come up with something more interesting and certainly something more meaningful. On the other hand, if you are looking for a mermaid story with REAL substance, try Liz Kessler's \\"The Tail of Emily Windsnap\\" (or for a different approach, Karen Hesse's \\"The Music of Dolphins\\"). Good try, Ms. Hoffman, but readers are better off with some other, more meaningful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy download version","review":"You have to manually go through all of the testimonials about how great the instructor is each time just to get to the yoga, which is exceedingly irritating and not worth it at all.

Maybe the DVD version is programmed by chapters so that you can go directly to the real stuff, but the digital download isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH.","review":"What an awful dvd! Hearing person after person praise the instructor to the skies became sort of sickening, especially since she (B. Olin) was no great shakes in my opinion, and this pandering to her took time away from the actual positions. The dvd was very amaturish and dark.

Unable to accept its awful gaps, we still would live no other way. We cherish memory as the only certain immortality, never fully understanding the necesssary plan.\\" It took over 15 years to stumble across the book that contains this quote, but it was worth the wait.

The reader who invests in this excellent book will surely have a better understanding of the Colorado Plateau, a spectacular landscape, but in addition, will be inspired to go there and to look at the land in a new and more meaningful way.

This is really a great product to get the little ones moving. My infant loved it right from the start and will literally bounce until he falls asleep sometimes.

It just looked great, and sounded like a great product from the reviews. I like the idea of being able to watch my daughter play in this, instead of her being in a doorway. It took her a day to figure it out, but she loves it!!!! She just squeals w/ joy when she's in this. (9mos) I look forward to my soon to be born twins using this. I wish I got it sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"My son loves this. He plays in it longer than he will in his exersaucer.

It does take up quite a bit of space and is kind of hard to fold down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous to baby's development","review":"As a pediatric physical therapist, I want to alert you that jumping gear has been shown to cause problems to developing hips and may cause kids to walk on their toes. If you choose to use one of these things, do not use it more than 10-15 mins. Many jumping devices have been banned in Europe for these reasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively wonderful!","review":"I agree completely with every compliment given to this product. My son is 5 months old now and has been using the Jumperoo for the last two months. (He is very big for his age!) He absolutely loves it! There was a time when we thought he was losing interest in it, but we realized he had become too tall for the lowest height. We moved the seat up to the middle height and he was jumping like crazy in it again! We will be very sad when he outgrows the Jumperoo, although, we are sure it won't be for several months yet! I recommend this product to every new parent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son loves this!!!!","review":"This is the perfect accessory for an active little boy. We purchased this for our son about a month ago. He is now 4 months old. He bounces all over the place. He loves it. It has helped him strengthened his leg muscles. First, he would just stare at the colors and images on the chair and surroundings until he got the hang of it. Now he is really enjoying the music and noise it makes. Definitely worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kimberly Sammons","review":"I bought the Jumperoo for my son a month ago. He is four months old now and he loves it. I have never seen a baby have so much fun playing with a toy. He thinks he is so cool because he can stand on one foot. He jumps up and down so much I sometimes think he is going to jump right out on to the floor. I highly recommend this product for everyone.!!! Definately a lifesaver and well worth the price!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but watch your kiddo","review":"Our daughter LOVES this toy. It's great for the baby who loves to stand all the time and the parent who just can't hold her enough.The one problem that we had with the toy is that her hands would get stuck in the leg holes even when we were keeping our eyes on her. All of a sudden, her hands were no longer playing with the toys or up in the air and we would peek under the jumparoo and see them dangling out the leg holes. :) It never seemed to bother her, but we decided to stuff one of her blankets or a towel in front of her to fill the gap in the seat area so that her hands couldn't fall through anymore.I have a picture posted to illustrate what I am talking about.Despite this issue, I would buy this toy again without a second thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticking with whole leaf","review":"The first few bags were good but thereafter it had a grassy aftertaste.

But once you could recognize all tracks this Cd hasn't bad songs. Also are, in my opinion, the most spiritually emotional band ever!. And like the title say Israel Vibration its \\"FREE TO MOVE\\". They create reggae muzik!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good band, bad album","review":"I've been wanting to say this for awhile, and this album actually moved me to write. First, I'm a roots fanatic since the late 70's. I have more reggae CDs than most people have total CDs.This album is a great example taking a great roots groove as a back drop, and saying any pretentious cliche they feel like. There's no effort here - no art. It's a hollow empty shell of roots. This is common in a lot of reggae since the mid-90s. They apparently have nothing new to say here, and cling to the album-a-year conveyor.That said, Isreal Vibration is a great roots band, and I like track 3 on this album - Here I can \\"feel\\" them, into their music and having fun... the rest is just filler.

This book helped me use the few dollars we had without comprosing quality required to make a good impression to publications.It explains the basics, what make a good PR person, and how to pull together the job of convincing others to cover your stories. How to get pics published, media visits, controversy. Logically written, it outlines options and reasons for responding to various situations.A great asset.. this book has a solid directory of resources to help you get your job done.No essential is left without guidance. However, missing from it is a \\"new\\" essential, the web. Maybe a newer edition will come out to cover this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource for beginners","review":"I've done press work for a number of years, so I was familiar with a great deal of the material covered in this book: how to approach the media, how to compile crash lists, etc. I think that this information, as it is presented by Yale, would be very helpful for newcomers to the field.What I appreciated as a more experienced person was the inside information and advice on handling difficult situations. I also found the end-of-chapter checklists useful and enjoyed reading the many quotations from reporters and PR professionals. These appear throughout the book and they tie the advice given to the opinions of people in the fields.If David Yale is considering revising the book for the year 2000, I would recommend a whole section on the internet.This book, even without much on the web, is worth the twenty bucks. The behind-the-scenes information and media relations do-s and don't-s make it a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on Non-Web Publicity Techniques","review":"Yale and Carothers have a great one with The Publicity Handbook, New Edition. Tons of super-useful stuff, ideas! But, not exactly web-oriented, unlike Michael Levine's Guerrilla PR: Wired, which fully takes the Internet into account in how to get publicity.While The Publicity Handbook is great, it's lack of useful stuff about the web does hurt it.

He can never sit still in a regular chair. After trying a sit-disc, we found this chair to work better as it allows more freedom of motion, but keeps the ball off the floor free of debris and provides more stability.After taking it up to his classroom, we realized we need another for the home and have purchased a second chair for him, and an adult chair for myself. His teacher had only seen the balls used as seats, but not this style of ball chair. She is in love with it as it is more suitable for a classroom environment and hopes to find a way to get them for her entire class.I not only recommend this to parents with Sensory Integration children, but for all children (and adults) as it promotes better posture and puts less pressure on your sit bones."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Packers DVD!","review":"Sure this DVD is short, its 22 minutes long. But this season is the best Packers' season since their superbowl runs. It shows clips from Favre's amazing game against the Raiders after his father died and it shows how spectacular their entry to the playoffs was. It was truly a miracle. And of course they show highlights from the other games as well.If you are a true Packers fan, the price won't really matter. Its nice to see parts of that great season over again. Honestly I'm glad they don't show the last game against the Eagles, no one wants to relive that 4th and 26. But get this DVD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All cheeseheads must own!","review":"The 2003-2004 highlight video for the Green Bay Packers would make a great gift for any cheesehead.

This book has all the pertinent info on almost every accredited college and university (public and private) in the country...and some in Canada. You can find tuition (from previous year) and room and board costs, enrollment, average GPA's and standardized test scores, admission requirements and largest major enrollments. It really helps you narrow down choices and then you can go to their websites for current enrollment year costs and further details.

He is so unethical I only got half way through the book and was wishing I could get my money back. He says things like inflate the price and then give them a discount so they will be happy and think they got a deal and all the time they are paying regular price. There are many other examples of unethical behaviour but really from my personal perspective, the book would have been better off left as a tree. Keep your money in your pocket on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duh!","review":"I almost feel dumber for having read this book. I'm not saying that the author doesn't make some very valid points, he certainly does, but those points are common knowledge for those involved in sales. For every valid point he makes there is at least one ridiculous suggestion... Like this one: Stake out a prospect's business early in the morning or late evening to find out what kind of car he drives so you can stick a note on it asking him to call you??? Can you imagine what would become of your reputation if you got caught playing detective? Can we say \\"ethics\\"? The book is full of sneaky examples such as that one, so if that's what you're looking for, buy this book. If, however, you desire to become a professional and well regarded salesperson, you should probably skip this title.Another gripe: $15 for 72 pages? That seems a little steep to me. I'm not complaining, I should have noticed that before I bought it, but you might find $.50 per sheet of paper to be a little extravagant."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOP MARKS","review":"Excellent reading, very informative, simple!Unlike other books ive attempted to read on this subject, i couldnt put this one down, it is a minefield of information.

This was one of the last efforts of legendary film director John Huston and this one doesn't disappoint. Panoramic shots of the field and the continuous action of the game and its players during the last half of the film are the best since the chariot race scenes in \\"Ben Hur\\".

It never explains WHAT,exactly, if anything, even posesses this chair? It was an interesting history of the WOOD the chair is built with, but beyond that, it doesnt make any sense. The Mother in this story is such a weak person, you just want to slap the crap out of her. I felt sorry for this poor abused kid the whole time I was reading the second stage of the book, and hoping his Uncle would just die. It isnt a \\"scary\\" story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I burned it!","review":"I've read many many books and this is my first review. I felt compelled to because of what an absolutely and ridiculously bad read this was. This was one of the most hollow, going nowhere fast, stories I have ever read. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did and the conclusion completely left you flat. Joey was born burning? Why? It never really told you the analogy here? Just because he had a fever for a short time? The chair's history could have been greatly enhanced and made to help add substance and interest to the story. The powers/evil/visions of this chair were never really understood. I guess the author thought his embellished-style of writing would keep the reader interested. I, for one, found it insufferable. The characters were weak, whiney and uninteresting and solicited no emotion or sympathy whatsoever. I wasted two evenings reading this and tossed it in the trash, never to pass along again. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"war of the worlds/tom cruise","review":"The movie,if you can put aside your prejudice about Tom, was very good. It was not a faithful rendition from the book. However if you are like me and can project yourself into the books you read, the movies you see, you will feel the fear, and utter helplessness of this situation. I was truly frightened by this. The movie has some ideas from the original book, has some ideas from the 1953 Pal movie, and a cameo appearance of Gene Barry and Ann Robinson at the end as the grandparents. They were the original stars of the Pal movie. The train scene really got to me of the hopelessness of it all. Where the heck can you go. There is also a second rendition as well this year.It is available on DVD and is real faithful to the book. A lot of computer graphics but well worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"echt tolles Buch!!!","review":"Als ich das Buch angefangen habe hab ich gedacht: Das ist ja echt unglaublich , wie das Kindle Max und Moritz so gut herstellen kann.

It's about a boy named Joseph Charnetski whose family is forced to live in medieval Krakow,homeless. An alchemist and his niece Elzbietka let them stay with them. However, the alchemist begins to have studies with a hypnotist that drive him mad. Joseph's father becomes the trumpeter at the Church of Our Lady Mary, forcing Joseph to practice the Heynal, a hymn that ends with a broken note. Then, a horrible man, known as Peter of the Button Face, comes to the alchemist's house to steal the Great Tarnov Crystal, a crystal that Joseph's family has been protecting for many years. He doesn't succeed, so he goes to the church tower to threaten Joseph and his father. Joseph made a deal with Elzbietka to add more notes to the Heynal when he plays it if he's in trouble. Will he? I won't tell you the ending. If you want to hear the ending, read this book yourself. This is a great book. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Normally I don't like adventure books, but this one is one of my favorite books!

Fantastic writing that keeps you spellbound and wanting more. An inspiration towards what it really means to be good and true. Eric P.

It is a fine piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"...but I LIKE the Clash!!","review":"A British history of punk, written as the history was being made. The authors went out of their way to try and be offensive and audacious, though their most pointed barbs are aimed at American rockers like the New York Dolls and Johnny Thunders who were better at being junkies than they were at toeing the line as \\"true punks\\". The Clash, the Damned, the Stranglers and pretty much everyone who wasn't the Sex Pistols get similar treatment. This is chatty and snide; just the book to curl up with at home on a rainy day, sipping tea while your old Iggy albums wreck another phonograph needle."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Looks at More Than Johnny","review":"This book features Iggy Pop, David Bowie,Blondie, with black and white photos of them.It also includes some Sex Pistols experiences.

This watch is sporty and looks nice. Recieved many complaments. You can ware it as a dress watch or just out door sports. I have colected many seiko and citizen watches both divers and dress, but this one put them together nicely for me. The bezel does not rotate like the divers do and the crown dosn't screw down either. Also to keep in mind that the lense on the watch bubbles out a little, so if you want a watch for working on equipment or rockclimbing, you would probably want to get a G-SHOCK,but other than that it keeps good time, has alarm witch isn't as loud as most, date stopwatch,and Tachymeter witch is fun to read distance over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daniel Perrine","review":"book was just as discribed and is very useful to me.

Extremely well written: doesn't put me to sleep immediately and succinctly conveys concepts. Extensive bibliography at the end of each chapter.Only two observed drawbacks: price and physical size. While I know that (almost) all students think that their textbooks are overpriced, I don't quite understand how a new 8.5 x 11 inch paperback text, running 324 pages, with few line-art illustrations and no photographs or images, and 2 color text should be priced in the $80 range?The size, 8.5 x 11 inches, as a paperback makes the book awkward for reading in an easy chair or when in bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful.","review":"The author is self-aggrandizing and unclear in his writing.

There was a very simple explanation describing quantitative research that anyone could understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!!!","review":"This book is an erudite discussion of Spinoza's philosophy which presupposes a lot of previous knowledge of his doctrine. To take but one example, the first chapter does not explain the central notions of substance, modes and attributes, but discusses them, which is mainly done by comparing the points of view of several Spinoza scholars. All in all, this so-called \\"guidebook\\" is in fact a kind of dialogue the author is having with other specialists.Therefore, if you want to get acquainted with Spinoza and undestand the basics, don't buy this book. I recommend Robert Duff's \\"Spinoza's Political and Ethical Philosophy\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing Flex about this mask","review":"I recently got back into paintball, and decided to buy the Flex 8 to replace my old Flex 7. The two masks could not be more different.The flex 8 is a small, hard, plastic mask. There's no flexible rubber used at all like on the Flex 7. It feels like a $20 rental mask. The mask is very rigid all through the sides, so it doesn't fit comfortably. There's a distinct uncomfortable lack of padding on the sides by the ears.The mask is very small. I don't have a large head or ears. The bottoms of my ear lobes show under the sides of the mask. The mask also only covers about half the forehead, even with the visor. Finally, while they removed protective plastic from some spots on the mask, they managed to add more around the lense, so visibility is worse than the Flex 7.Overall I'm massively disappointed by this mask. It shouldn't be called \\"Flex\\" anything, and it shouldn't be >$50. It's a $20, low quality, child sized mask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but Goodie","review":"My buddy had one back in '06 and I had one up until I retired from paintball rcently. Great mask. Good lenses, you can hear, nice fit, no sharp edges, and it's built on JT's classic mask stlye. I had a Flex 7 IZE back in the day, and I prefer this mask due to it no having the super flexy rubber thing at the bottom that gets your face all kinds of slapped and lips busted, etc. I have many stories...Ok, just one, but it hurt.

The end result, however, (under supervision as the package indicates) was little fluorescent green pieces all over the floor and happy dogs who were able to eat whole pieces of the ice/chicken broth mixture after destroying the two bones I gave them. It took about 5 minutes of work on their parts to completely chew up this toy. I have a lab mix and an amstaff, about 50+ lbs each...not too big but definitely chewers. Why lick the broth out when you can chew it out? LOL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective item","review":"I receive a defective one but it was not worth the effort to return such a low cost item. Mine was two front fill sides fitted together, making it impossible to fill with any liquid (pour in the liquid on one side and it pours out the other), an obvious manufacturing mistake (I wonder if some one else got two back/non-fillable sides glued together?).

I bought the 45 on the Epic label. I really liked the song and still think his version is much better than Bobby Vinton's even though Vinton wrote it. I immediately started listening for more of Buddy's works. His voiceis amazing I agree, however he never wanted to use it. His renditions, of some of the songs like,Around the World, Roses of Picardy and It had Better Be Tonight, still make me cringe.He sounds like Bill Murray doing the Lounge singer act on SNL.I'm sorry but Buddy never lived up to his abilities as a Singer. Frank, Dean, Sammy, Tony never had anything to worry about."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Handy guide for area codes","review":"This book is most useful for looking up telephone area code numbers.

Bec of the faux (stiff like) fur style, there was brownish blotching on the white part, probably to give the effect that this was made of animal fur. I wanted black and white. Perhaps mine just had more than usual, but there was a lot of brown. They looked dirty. The shoe was semi stable on and I am about 130 pounds. Height was okay if you are not used to a lot of high heels. The sizing was pretty true, you can widen the strap one hole, about 3/4 inch to make them wider. (as other reviewer pointed out-they are not best for wide feet) and my feet run a bit on the wide side. I wear 8 1/2 to 9 and 8 1/2 fit okay with the strap let out. I didn't wear them out due to returning them, but would guess they are not for walking in all day, but good at a party or at work. Otherwise, they look like the picture.

As for most replacement wires, not all the new ones in the box will match exactly to the length of the old ones.

However, this book is just one extended rant and ends up making Fraser look silly. The few times he scores points it is on easy targets. Most of the time he is simply trying too hard to be a curmudgeon. There is something pathetic about a wealthy white male feeling victimized by modern politics and one wonders, for all his railing against political correctness, if he doesn't have his own sacred cows that he never examined. Still, his anecdotes are funny and, as always, he writes beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"real nice underground","review":"i like this tape alot (or well the cd-version). i dont get how ppl can dig the new stuff from 3-6 at all, thats just lame club music.

I like the steps and combinations in this one and I think her positive and upbeat attitude reaches out through the screen to the viewer.This DVD also includes a stength and abs workout that the DVD's that I own (Her other DVD's) don't have. If I have time, I can combine my workout and get everthing done in one session, but I usually can't cut out that big of a block of time.Again, this DVD is fun, fast and funky.

It is a piece for virtuoso orchestra, and this orchestra isn't even close.The clarinet varaition is well known for it's difficulty, and the piece shouldn't be performed (or recorded) without an amazing player. This recording tries to get around this by performing that variation at a tempo that is way too slow (and not what the composer intended). It is a disgrace, taking all the life out of the music. Also, the high passage is taken down an octave. Why would anyone think that is acceptable?There are obvious French Horn clams, and while other variations have all the right notes, the players play timidly in order to get the notes, but without any musicality.Run away from this recording. Not even worth it at a budget price."},{"rating":"1","title":"See if you can find the Leinsdorf recording","review":"The best performance and not bad recording is the 1968 recording of Ginestera's Variaciones concertantes and Piano concerto played by Joao Carlos Martins with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erich Leinsdorf.

A list of sources at the back ofthe chapter is not enough.Second, the report example in chapter four is atrocious.I would not accept anything so non-standard as this from mystudents.

It fell over while mixing and bent the motor shaft. So I attached the new barrel to the old mixer and used it on and off for another 2 years.

Imagine our disappointment to find that the main game is only a one player game, so we can't play it together. The main game is ok, but not that much of an improvement over the previous versions.Like other reviewers have said, the mini games are very hard to control. The adults and the kids became very frustrated playing these games.

The big selling point for me were all the multi-player mini-games. I knew that there would be a few throw aways but with 50 choices there had to be something worth playing with friends. Boy was I wrong, all of the games are pretty bad. Many are boring (landing a space ship?), some are limited by graphics (rock, paper, scissors), and nearly all have a truly wretched control scheme (Whack-a-Monkey).If I hadn't played Wii Sports and Rayman first I would have regretted buying a Wii based on how poorly the Wiimotes function with this piece of software. There have been several times when I swore my Wiimote was broken, only to switch back to Wii Sports and see everything acting perfectly. Overall this is a disappointing launch title that not only doesn't do the Wii's unique control scheme justice it actually makes you think its bad (which it isn't)Spend your money on Rayman, its a blast.

Hopes that were to be let down in the worst kind of way.This game has to have the worst control of all the Wii launch titles. Using an analog stick to control a board was easy, but to use a motion sensing remote? Good idea in theory, terrible in practice. Some people may call this a \\"challenge,\\" I think of it more a waste.The mini games are the highlight, seeing as the main game is uncontrolable and generally bad. But that isn't saying much, as the mini games are tedious remakes of all the other mini game games out there (heck, even the Zelda: Twighlight Princess herding game was a heck of a lot better, and not even a \\"mini game!\\"Do I recommend this game? Nope. Based off my experience with it, would I buy another Monkey Ball game? Only if it's analog controlled.1/10 rating. Just bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!!","review":"I hate ripping items that I spent $50 bucks on, but I figure I need to do this as a public service. First off, I want to state that overall the games are boring. My family played this game on a Saturday night and honestly, none of us had a good time playing ANY of the games. That in itself is a bad thing when you are talking about an 8 year old and a 12 year old with two willing parents. When you are able to make a game where EVERYONE is bored, you should NOT be proud of yourself, but instead you should stick your head in a hole. I am upset that I plopped down my money for this game and I can promise you, I will NEVER purchase another Monkey Ball game again in the future. Do NOT waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention Sega: Learn to use the Wii Remote!","review":"This game had a lot of potential, but didn't live up to it. The one player game is like other Super Monkey Ball games and uses the Wii remote fairly well to control it. Nothing special, but not bad.The multi-player games all look fun, but the controls are AWFUL! Completely awful! After playing Wii Sports we all know the Wii can do so much better (for example, a better multiplayer party game, Raving Rayman Rabbids, has absolutely no control problems). Just as bad, the pre-game explanation of how to use the Wii controls are unclear at best.This game is best avoided. Maybe rent it sometime, but save your $50 for a good game (RRR, Zelda, Trauma Center, etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ugh","review":"Me and my kid were drawn in by the cute colorful graphics and 50 party games.

One can't dismiss this in a review stating that 1 or 2 or 5 of the mini games are fun, therefore justifying a 5-star rating. Sega needed to make 10 of these mini games exceptional, dump the other 40 early in development, and then spend the rest of the time tweaking the main game. Then, this package would deserve 5 stars. As it stands, half of the mini games are unplayable (once you have played Wii: Sports and can see how the games are supposed to react to controller movements). Of the remainder, most are not fun, frustrating, or simply not 'special'. And really, that's what it comes down to. SMB was supposed to be a 'special' title. Instead, it's going to be one of the first bargain bin games for the Wii."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems a little rushed.","review":"The Main game is enjoyable- but that is a formula that has been set in stone. The controller adds a new element- and its a blast. However- they are trying to sell most people on the MiniGames- and they just aren't good.I have played a handful of them- and they all control very poorly. Half of the time- we just started over because one of the controllers would go eratic. I hope that this isn't a sign of what is to come from SEGA for all of their Wii games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the family!","review":"Ok, I had to make it 5-stars due to the lack of credit from the other reviews. Yes, this game has focused on the mini games and sacrificed on the details of the more popular games like Monkey Target (a game in which I love). Even to find only 10 games out of the 50 make up for it though. My wife does not play video games...that is until the WII, and SMB: Banana Blitz. She, myself, and our two sons had nothing but fun going through and finding all the games we liked. And yes, controlling some of the games can be frustrating at first, but with one or two tries you get use to it. All you have to do is give it a chance, and you'll love it! But if you are looking for the more challanging & detailed games like Monkey Target, you may want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of the Nintendo Wii's Possibilities","review":"Okay, so I've played only a handful of games so far for the Wii. Unfortunately, I wasted time and money on this one. I, like many of the other reviewers, feel that it simply did not live up to it's possibilities.The controls are my main complaint. It really doesn't register half of the movements you make in the mini games and that DOES get annoying. I believe that time and practice could make a few of the games playable, but, I need to emphasize A FEW.The main game is okay, the controls are definitely better than the mini game portion. However, I wanted this game primarily for the 2-4 player capabilities. The main game did not justify the $50.00 purchase for me.My overall impression and opinion is that this game needed more time in testing before they released it into the markets.

The controllers DO NOT work. Don't get caught in the trap... even if your Wii is set up perfectly this game will fail to work for you. The only possible explanation for this is that Sega thought you might need a hand getting your relatives to put down the Wii and help clean up during the holidays. Not that you'll really notice at first... it will take you hours just to make sense of the \\"instructions\\" for each mini game. You'd be better off if Sonic the Hedgehog personally screamed the instructions in your face. If by some strange twist of fate you manage to crack the Rosetta Stone visual directions, you'll be greeted by a stiff dose of boring gameplay; contests that are over in seconds, computer controlled \\"characters\\" that gang up on you without reason, and a handful of wrote mechanics that hardly pass off as gameplay.Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor poor use of the Wii Remote","review":"I currently have 6 Wii titles and this is easily the worse of the lot.

Most of the kids (ages 4-8) found it too hard and frustrating, and when I played it, it made me half motion-sick trying to roll the characters all over the place. I guess we just didn't understand the premise of the game. I've never played the original, so if you have, you'll have a different frame of reference.

He was 4 at the time & was excited to have a new Wii game to play. Excitement soon turned to frustration & tears as nothing seemed to work right with this game. Okay, maybe he was just too young for it. So, all the adults in the house took turns trying it to see if it was just a game for older kids/adults. Again, nothing seemed to work right. Once you figure out what to do (which is very difficult by the way), the games end incredibly quickly. This game is horrible! I would not recommend it to anyone.

In Whack-A-Mole we could only get the hammer to show up on the screen maybe half of the time. In red light green light my younger sons could not get their guy to move. It seems like you have to have percise movements in order to enjoy this game. The main game might be fun if you took a lot of time to master the controls, but who wants to do that? We were expecting a fun family game, and instead were very disappointed. We expected so much more. The Wii format is fantastic, we ended up playing Zelda, and taking turns controlling it.

While crusing my dream, the development of the \\"box\\" has certainly benefited the international exchange of goods with distant countries, and the development of a more eclectic way of life.

Knowing Marc I was not surprised at the depth at which he has handled the subject (is there any more to be said?) but quite surprised to find it was interesting and entertaining. The development of the container (1950s to the present) has changed our lives in ways which I was oblivious. It is a (maybe the) reason that New York City has lost its shipping industry, the reason that the office bulding I work in (former Cunard lines shipping office) now houses a law firm, the reason that I see the giant cranes in Elizabeth New Jersey out my window, behind the Statue of Liberty. It is also the (a) reason that my shirts are made in Malaysia and my underwear in Vietnam.

Most people might have ignored the import of the box during the past half-century, but economist Marc Levinson offers an insightful tale that will help you appreciate this oft-overlooked advancement. If it weren't for the container, Levinson argues persuasively, for good or ill, there could be no Wal-Mart and U.S. manufacturing jobs couldn't have migrated to China. This history lesson recounts the box inventor's quest and offers some subtle perspective for businesspeople struggling to foretell the future. At times, Levinson bogs down in the details of 1950s labor relations, but his work mostly moves quickly through the highs and lows of the container's story.

The container, along with the jet plane and advanced communications, are the three major innovations that have made the world a smaller place and permitted globalization for all its benefits (and shortcomings). I would prefer to see more of the business economic facts covered including the economics of a successful container line today. The coverage of United States Lines in Chapter 12 is too superficial and could be expanded. Overall a great attempt to cover the history of the container industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"steve smith- drums giant!","review":"in this educational dvd steve explains and demonstrate the playing of jazz drumers giants. he also takes it one step beyond and explain how you can orcastrate it on the drums. doing so he had opened my mind and gave me a better understanding of jazz plaing. offcourse, you can adopt alot of the ideas to rock and other styles of music. buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comparative Ethnography Hits the Spot","review":"Mercer Sullivan's text follows three youth cliques in the Brooklyn area (in neighborhoods he coins Projectville, La Barriada and Hamilton Park), and studies their involvement in, and desistance from, local youth crime. The study is largely ethnographic, and so Sullivan alternates between dialogue between his subjects and an analysis on their criminal patterns. Sullivan also discusses how the physical ecology of the neighborhood, the transiency of the residents, levels of education, economic opportunity, family values, and access to a network of human resources--a system of social capital--affects the youths' criminal careers, and whether or not these acts of criminality are for the purpose of entertainment or income-generation.Being published in 1989, the text is a bit outdated, but his discussion as to youth crime in neighborhoods of social isolation is still very relevant today. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A detailed look into the current democratic system","review":"The book is very detailed and informative in the election process. The book covers everything from the primaries to push polling as well as finacing and campaign reform. The book walks you through the political process starting with the time before the primaries and ends with the rap up of the election.If you are just entering the world of politics or you would like to know excatly where your votes goes, this is a great book for you. It is easy to read and goes into great lenght on the presidential elction process.

If offers proof that true Christianity is simply an extension of ancient Judiasm, as opposed to \\"one of the three monotheistic religions of our world,\\" which is often assumed.

As an author myself, I certainly appreciate the commitment.Secondly, it could easily have been pruned down to one volume. I only read through all three because I am a die-hard ST:TNG fan, thirsty for my heros after the long drought of their adventures (hint, hint to the powers that be).

The ending scenes are discustingly sentimental and full of clishés, robbing the book of any credibility and seem to be added in a rush, as if as an afterthought.In short: pointless.If you want to read a good Q novel read \\"IQ\\" by Peter David and John DeLancie, wich is one of the most original Star Trek books to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not worth the money.","review":"How frustrating to pay for 3 books to get a story that really isn't worth a single book. Definitely agree with the others that this was too drawn out. In fact, many times it seems things are thrown in JUST to link them to other Trek references. I'm never a big fan of stories that do this, try to pull in characters and situations we've already seen, other than the essentials (I guess it's supposed to make the author look clever)...but this series did it so much I wanted to scream. In fact, I can't think of single character or plot device that was completely original and din't have SOME reference to something else in the Trek universe.Having said that, there were things to like about the books, so I give it 2 stars...not totally awful, but not sure it'd be worth reading when you have other choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Well, being a long-time Trekkie (TNG is my favorite), I was quite disappointed with this book. Liked the premise, liked the characters, did not like the execution. This book, the 3rd of a 3 book trilogy had way too much talk and background info for my liking. It appears the author took 1 exciting book and split it into 3 much weaker parts.

However, I had used the lock for just three months when my bike was stolen. It was only locked up for 3 hours in a well lit area at a college campus. Cable locks, for all their convenience, clearly don't do their job.OnGuard also has a tendency to make the top portion of their keys huge, taking up space on your key ring."},{"rating":"1","title":"not durable","review":"I bought this lock to lock up two bikes for short amounts of time when taking long bike rides. It only last about six months, the key is now stuck in the lock. Not broken, just stuck and I cannot remove it.I have to agree that the lock mechanism is poorly designed. The key is very fiddly to get into the lock, and the lock mechanism is 'sticky'. Before the key got stuck, it was slowly becoming more and more troublesome to lock and unlock the mechanism.The only saving grace is that that the key got stuck while the lock was open, so i did not have to test how easy it is to cut this lock myself while I was 25 miles away from home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy and a perfect length.","review":"When I first got this lock I was afraid that it was TOO thick since it was difficult to unwind. However, after just a few uses it loosened up enough to wrap around both my tires and my seat!Beware, cable locks of any thickness are easy to cut if the thief wants your bike enough. The truth is, not much will stop a thief on a mission. This is a great bike lock for low to mild theft areas. It is visually intimidating and can secure all parts of the bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after very light use","review":"Other reviewers are correct about the durability (or lack thereof). Bought this lock in 2007 and used less than a half-dozen times, but something inside the lock mechanism is defective and came loose. Good news is that a simple email to the company resulted in a free replacement, including an upgraded lock that presumably doesn't have the defective mechanism. Other than the defective locking mechanism, the heavy gauge cable lock seems very tough and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay normally, mine was defective","review":"This seems like a fine lock for the price, but mine was defective - the locking mechanism now spins around and doesn't open. I like the fact that it came with four keys, but it is a little annoying that there is no physical sign for the top and the bottom of the key given that there is a right side up when you insert the key. I ended up cutting the plastic key body and marking the keyhole so I knew where the top and bottom were and I didn't have to fumble to get it in. Also, the thing to attach the lock to your bike is incredibly poorly designed. There is essentially no way to attach it without it getting in the way of your legs when you bike, at least with my 30 year old road bike. Maybe with modern bikes with fat tubing it would work better. I like the velcro strap that is there to keep it together and the fact that you can insert the end into the lock and it will lock without having the key inserted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Lock","review":"The key broke in the lock.

Initially, I ordered them in my regular size, which is 10 and they they were huge on my feet. I exchanged them for a size 9 and those were no better. The boots are made very wide and the ties do not help to keep them snug on your feet. When I walked with them my heels kept coming out of the shoes so I gave up trying to MAKE them fit.

I recorded the title track off the radio around 1996 and kept it on master cassette all these years. A soulful bluesy ballad, this track exudes a sultry sound unlike any other jazz trio ballad I've heard before or since. Very lyrical with \\"right-on-time\\", bluesy chord changes by John HIcks and a sensual, bass-walking performance by, I'm guessing, Ray Drummond. Guess I won't know who the bassist is for certain until the CD arrives. If the remainder of the tracks are anywhere near \\"Lover Man\\" quality, this could become my favorite jazz trio CD. The Lover Man track? - a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful program of Holiday ballads","review":"There have been many fine recorded tributes to Billie Holiday, ranging from Zoot SimsFor Lady Dayto Hank JonesFlowers for Lady Day, but this beautiful album by John Hicks is one of the best of them. The songs Hicks has chosen to play are representative of Holiday, and like the great ballad singer, he moves forward gently, playing with character and color. His playing is like liquid gold matched by recorded sound that's perfect.Here are the tracks and timings:Lover Man 8:31What a Little Moonlight Can Do 5:58Fine and Mellow 8:55God Bless' The Child 7:10Easy Living 7:42Billie's Blues 8:47Some Other Spring 6:40I Thought About You 8:03Warmly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but not with TVs","review":"Works, but not with tvs. Amazon vendor failed to mention, but it is the first \\"special feature\\" on the manufacturers website.

This is one. It's so fearless, so exhilaratingly creative, so completely inhabited, and captures the feel of life so well it's almost a living, breathing thing in and of itself. If aliens landed on earth and asked me for a book that portrayed midwestern life in a small town, my first impulse would probably be to give them Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio. However, if they wanted to know what that life felt like in all its quietest, loneliest and most intense moments, I'd give them this one. Monson is a genius.

This book could have been written in about 200 pages and been a lot more readable. You already know how the book will end when you start to read it. You ask yourself if you really want to devote your valuable time to this marathon of words. If this was a movie it would have to last for a few hours.

I bought several and now am thinking I've wasted my money. He took a realistic story and destroyed it with an unbelievable plot. All the bad guys, who have so much power that they can have anyone in the world killed within 24 hours of the victim hearing about the Secret Plot to control the World cannot even protect their top masterminds from being kidnapped by a New York lawyer, his consultant ex-wife, and a couple of low-level military officers. Then, each bad guy willingly spills everything about the Secret Plot merely upon learning that one of his colleagues has insulted him? Give me a break. Don't even get me started on how unrealistic the relationship is b/w the main character and his ex-wife.

She gives us characters we can believe in, who show us that we can not only accept but find joy in our differences. Nora Roberts has tackled off-beat subjects before and once again she has taken the extraordinary and given it a face and a heart and made it as believable as the nut next-door. It is always a treat to read and re-read these stories and I eagerly await the next chapter in the Donovan family saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read!","review":"While this certainly wasn't her best work, it was an excellant piece.

To start out with the one thing I liked is how things from one book or cousins story overflowed to another cousins story. However, when reading it, in general, I believe that the book could have been 20 pages long just the same as 500+. The Dovan Legacy is very wordy and most of it doesn't have a real place in the book. The book COMPLETELY revolves around the \\"supernatural\\" powers the cousins possess, while trying to depict them as normal. When I finished the book I got really mad because I had wasted so much time reading it. To top off my disappointment when I analyzed what I had read, it occurred to me that it doesn't have a plot. Instead of this book try Danielle Steel's \\"Star.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Was this Nora Roberts?","review":"I am an avid reader of Nora Roberts and I can't believe I wasted money buying this book.

The book tells the story of three cousins, Morganna, Sebastion, and Anastasia, who just happen to be witches. Each of the three stories is filled with fun, romance and just the right dose of fantasy. The three cousins certainly don't have it easy as they try and explain their special powers to the people they are beginning to love. These stories are touching and funny.

It is a nice light read and is also very tough to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weak and Strong","review":"I thought that Captivated and Charmed were the weaker of the stories. I throughly enjoyed Sebastian's story in Entranced. I hope others do not quit reading the series because they read Captivated first... though it isn't a bad story! Just a little fast (but that all makes sense seeing as it was written for a monthly publication) I suggest the Dream series, which is my personal favorite, thus far"},{"rating":"2","title":"Postcards from Route 1-800","review":"My favorite novels are the travel stories; Huck and Jim down the Mississippi, Gus and Call up the Montana Trail, the Joads across Rte 66. \\"Wait and See Annie Lee\\" is right in that roving tradition, but with a sly dada-ist twist. Although bodily rooted on the Continental Divide Annie Lee wanders the network of 1-800 emergency phone lines.

This book is a case in point. (Oh and \\"Gender\\"--for what it's worth--is a GRAMMATICAL term. Humans and other animals don't have genders; they have sexes.)(Ah, another aside: Now I happen to know a particular institution which at least until very recently irrationally discriminated against woman composers (that is, on the basis of their sex, not on the basis of their music or ability), and I don't suppose this institution is anomalous in this regard. Woman composer shouldn't have it tougher than men composers--men composers have it tough enough, and we should hear and read more of the outstanding woman composers of the present and past, but as someone below points out, to do so we'll have to look elsewhere than in this book.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the point.","review":"NatGeo dropped the ball on this one.

The pace moved along really slowly, and it was clear what would happen at the end. The jokes were bland and overall weren't very good. The animation was okay, but not great as it probably could have been. I'm not a huge fan of Shrek, but I'd say you should watch that instead of this. For small children I suppose you could have them watch this, it's more mild than the Shrek series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boringly ever after","review":"I usually wait two days after watching a DVD before writing its review. Unfortunately for this movie, I saw Shrek 3 at the theater the day after watching this on DVD. The storylines are eerily similar, however the execution of this movie was much worse. The plot of this movie is simple; Cinderalla's evil stepmother leads an uprising of villians and villianesses to take over Fairy Tale Land. Prince Charming's manservant and Cinderalla lead the good guys and win the day for all.The animation of this movie was ok; not smoothflowing like traditional cartoons, and not pure CGI realism like Pixar movies.

Anyway, Sarah What's her Name and her husband play the main characters and lend nothing to them. Ella is annoying and self-absorbed; Rick is whiny; and all the other characters completely forgettable. I can't believe that Sigourney Weaver, an amazing actress, stooped to participating in this!Animation is terrible, no charisma like in Shrek (it looks like someone made it in their basement).Okay, enough bashing.

I think one of the wolves, too; and the gnomes were pretty solid) plus a few isolated bits of animation... other than that it's completely terrible; which I guess I was hoping for something like 'the emperor's new groove' which looked stupid in previews and turned out to be this like cult movie; and so so awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Happily N'ever After (Widescreen Edition)","review":"Happily N'ever After (Widescreen Edition) is a mediocre animated movie that fails to live up to its title. The movie plays on the cliche happily ever after but the plot is tedious and the movie feels long even though it is only a little bit more then 83 minutes long.

Will shares his feelings with his psychic friends, his best friend's sister and the dogs and insulates Tess from her problems from her crazy stepmother and her ex-fiance. Tess doesn't even know what Will does for a living until the end of the book. Give me a break! They had no real connection and the ending seemed contrived. Except for the initial spark of attraction, the two treat each other more like siblings until the very end.

This is what happens when a virtuoso blues guitarist doesn't have a thing to prove and slips into the groove. Playing that is listening, ear cocked like a hound dog's in the wind, Robillard hearing whatever it was Collins must have heard when the inspiration for this one came to him. (Definitely not the same thing as imitating licks or covering a tune.) Also a plus is that Duke doesn't burden you with overload in the vocals department but when he does open his mouth, it's so right it hurts. In general Duke sings a lil too much for my taste--he should let the guitar talk for him more of the time. The other great cut on this album is \\"Never Let You Go\\" where again Duke stays mainly in instrumental mode.

While the historical facts may be accurate, the difficulty is that the authors view medicine as the only viable role for women in the healthcare field. They quickly dismiss the role of nurses and other ancillary healthcare workers because they are not the bosses in the healthcare delivery system. Their goal is to convince the reader that until women dominate medicine, there is little that they can offer patients in their attempts to maintain health. Ardent feminists will enjoy this book. However, those who believe that there is more to maintaining or regaining health than pills and surgery will find it a denegration of the work of those who play other roles in healthcare delivery."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I purchased this book looking for an historical perspective of women healers.

Incredibly good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Hype","review":"I was fooled into thinking that Kola Boof was the \\"next big thing\\" when I read all the positive reviews on this site so I purchased this book. What a mistake. Now that I think about it, I find it odd that nearly all of the glowing reviews of this book are from \\"readers\\" who only have one review to their name. It leads me to wonder if many of the reviews here are being written by the same person.\\"Flesh and the Devil\\" showed a lot of promise at the beginning but the story starts to fall apart almost immediately. Kola Boof had a very good idea with this novel of two Afrians whose love trancends many generations but she just doesn't have the talent to properly execute the idea into a coherent enjoyable story. To be perfectly honest, by the time the story got to modern day America, I had completely lost interest. The characters are one dimensional and the plot is just plain silly. The longer it goes on the more unreadable it becomes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serena Ryder's Magical Voice","review":"Serena Ryder has an absolutely amazing voice. Her live performances are tremendous and she gains more fans with every show. Her choice of material for this release is a bit odd, and - in the hands of a lesser talent - would be totally forgettable, but she is able to pull it off with her voice, a very tight (esp. Kevin Breit) supporting cast and good production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disturbing Movie","review":"This movie was extremely disturbing and I wouldn't suggest watching it if you are not a sadistic person.I dont mean to be a spoiler but picking up 14 year old girls, rapping them and killing them doesn't make a good movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Devil's Double","review":"Much has been made of Saddam Hussein's multiple doppelgangers, who the notorious dictator used to stay one step ahead of those who might capture -- or kill -- him. Based on factual events, The Devil's Double focuses on the same phenomenon as it applied to one of Hussein's sons, Uday Hussein. Dominic Cooper here plays dual roles as both Latif Yahia, the Iraqi lieutenant chosen as Uday's double, and Uday himself; as Latif discovers the depths of Uday's dark and psychotic behavior, he must come to terms with what he's been asked to do in Uday's name. I was fairly split about The Devil's Double, though I liked Cooper's dedication to the role. Directed by Lee Tamahori and co-starring Ludivine Sagnier, Philip Quast, and Latif Yahia himself in a supporting role, I balked at The Devil's Double's graphic portrayal of Uday Hussein's cruel and sadistic nature, but am willing to recognize the strength of Cooper's performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Acting, Uninteresting Plot","review":"The acting was amateur and awkward.

I really could not get into this movie but they say this is all true what happen over in that country so it is up to you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good action movie but hardly based on a true story","review":"I really enjoyed this movie from the start. The plot was excellent, built around a classic suspense script turning an ordinary man into a good-guy Hollywood hero. Actually, not only a hero, but the real Bruce Willis cliché type of a hero. The sad part, which none of the other reviwers seem to acknowledge, is that it's so painfully obvious not based on much truth. The story is just way too much Hollywood with probably no other sources than Yahias own. I would not bet any money whatsoever that even 10% of what happened on the screen is based on any real events. It didn't surprise me when I searched for Yahais story on the net and found that his account has been questioned by journalists from Guardian and BBC, and probably many others. This type of story just doesn't play out in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie based on Factual Content","review":"This movie is great! It's about Saddam Hussein's perverted and twisted son Uday Hussein (and stated to be based on actual facts). It is a very disturbing, perverted and invoking, yet interesting movie that will really open your eyes to just how twisted this guy was and also gives a peek inside the mind of a terrorists mentality. It's almost comparable to an Iraqi version of Scarface, but in an extremely bad bad way. Uday Hussein actually makes Scarface look like a very nice guy in comparison. ;-) In fact, if the 2 were to meet in reality; Scareface would likely give this punk both barrels. \\"SAY HELLO TO MY LITTLE FRIEND!!!\\"But seriously, if you like suspense, drama and thrillers and enjoy movies that are based on factual events then this is a must see. My wife and I rented the movie from Blockbuster and I ordered it the following week to add to our library. Very well written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"So I was very impressed with this movie. I though the writing was well done and I was glad that they found Latif Yahia to get his take on things and hope he was pleased with the end results. Dominic Cooper was fantastic as both Latif Yahia and Uday Hussiem. I was really able to tell who he was being because of the subtle characteristics he would use for each character to make them just a little differnt. And it must not have been easy portraying Uday because well...he was such a monster. I really enjoy watching these types of biopic movies and would recommend it to others that likethese kind of movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"A true story that seems to be fiction....but its not...so this makes it even more scary and riveting.

I imediately bought King's of the Wild Frontier, and loved it. To this day it is still one of my favorites. Shortly after buying that, I got my hands on the US version of Dirk, and was equally pleased with it. The one day, I ran across a cassette copy of the original Do It 1979 release, and snagged it. I thought it was so much better in ways, than the US version. I still have that cassette to this day. When this remaster came out a couple years back, I was THRILLED to see it was a remaster of the original version.The remastered CD is amazing, with much more clarity and energy than my cassette could provide. I love all eras of Ant Music, but the first two albums hold a nearer, dearer place in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dart is amazing!!","review":"This is another great album! All the songs are great, especially \\"Closer To The Light\\" about Bruce's (and mine) favorite songwriter, Mark Heard, who died of a heart attack in 1992."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tell me if there is better","review":"If I have a complaint about Bruce Cockburn's collection of music, it is that it is too political for my tastes. The fact the I lean toward conservatism might make listening to some of his music a bit hard to swallow, although I do appreciate his dedication to his principles. From purely a musical standpoint, Dart to the Heart is a great change of pace for Bruce Cockburn. I just finished recording a few tunes onto cassestte for a friend of mine. I chose the two instrumentals, Train in the Rain and Sunrise on the Mississippi, as well as Love Loves You too and Tie Me at the Crossroads. Those tunes are awesome, as is the rest of this set. Bruce Cockburn, polically motivated or not, has always impressed me with his awesome guitar work and incredible songwriting ability. If you want thoughtful, introspective music that speaks to your soul, then give this a listen. It is one of the mainstays on my cd player and one I am proud to introduce to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dart to Your Heart","review":"It is apparent that the previous reviewer Geoffery Himes knows very little about Bruce Cockburn (or Richard Thompson for that matter). Every now and then Cockburn will stray from the political, social and/or enviornmental issues, and address matters of the heart and mind on a very human level. He has done this on 'Dart to the Heart' and he will probably do so again,..it is a cyclical aspect of his carreer that most of his fans find to be refreshing. The imagery on 'Dart to the Heart' is an excellent example of Cockburn's personal side which i think most fans knew was lurching somewhere behind the rocket launchers, landmines and euro-panorama's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Invites to dancing, attractive rythm, mastery of accordeon","review":"My first encounter with Aniceto Molina invites to listening to more of his music: almost all songs on his album made my feet itch to dance. Traditional themes are freshly put in song, a pleasure to concentrate on the wording. Songs of his own hand are mixed with songs of other great vallenato masters, and show the remarkable talent of Aniceto and his mastery of the \\"binomio\\" (accordeon). I use the album for practicing steps of cumbia: for its clear and seducing rythm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must get starter book.","review":"I remembered buying each certain volume for nearly $... each back when I was still in middle school.

The Reading Section was especially terrible-- the questions on the actual test involved more thinking than finding your answers word for word in your passages (as this book misleads you to think). Also, there were only vague explanations to the questions/ concepts they tested you for in this book. Use your old SAT books or use MCAT books. Even though the Barron's book is almost as bad, if you must buy one, buy the Barron's PCAT study guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another study guide","review":"I bought this book the week before my test, to get in a little bit more practice. There is really only one test in the book, that covers all five areas of the test. The questions in this book were not in the same format as the actual PCAT test.

It is really funny how all the characters have some connection to each other and how continuous misunderstandings among these 26 characters lead to absolute chaos!

A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Reading","review":"This reading of \\"Black Orchids\\" by Saul Rubinek is WAY to fast.

Endless restatement, obfuscated in painfully cultivated strings of verbiage, of trivial fact is used to document an hypothesis that if stated clearly could be supported or refuted in about a page-and-a-half and then likely consigned to the graveyard of such endeavor. The prose is a true caricature of Derrida's; the logic is a laTour de force. Typical of such works, the author begins with a premise and then selectivley seeks textual support. Of course, such an approach can be conveniently utilized to support any premise and if written with sufficient opacity will pass for scholarship and great insight.The book is an unreadable bloody bore; its value is restricted to its caloric content relative to the market price of a barrel of Texas sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this book!","review":"This is a great 'oyster read!'

If you're a lover of the macabre, or if you are someone who enjoys cartooning and drawing, you'll get a kick out of this book.This book depicts every day scenarios with a slightly warped, twisted or uncanny fix. There are NO Addams Family cartoons here. It is more of a focus on crazy things that happen in our daily lives (and at funerals) with a few witchy caricatures thrown in for fun. What is so baffling about Addams' humor is his complexity, for some of these drawings are like being inside an M.C. Escher drawing. Helps you to get a little laugh on the absurd in life. And since this book is now becoming vintage? You'll be able to see things have not changed with us humans that much! If Addams were alive, he'd be cartooning the ghosts in our machines..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliding Scales","review":"Of course this album isn't as good as other Bad Brains releases. Fact is, this is a great little record that never got its due. I don't care if it's HR or Israel I or Chuck Moseley or whoever. I don't care if Earl or Mackie is playing drums. The point is that the album was well-written, well-performed, and well-produced. \\"Rise\\" is a modern-hardcore anthem not atypical from something that would have been on their previous album \\"Quickness\\". \\"Hair\\" is a funny cover from the play/movie of the same name. \\"Love is the Answer\\" is one of their best reggae jams and utilizes quirky little noises under Israel's smooth flow. \\"Take Your Time\\" alternates between upbeat jazz-funk and sprawling power chords. \\"Unidentified\\" and \\"Peace of Mind\\" have some of the mathier passages found on any Bad Brains album. All in all, a good album that more people would like if they heard it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh!","review":"As I have been reading these reviews I keep asking the same question, \\"Are they talking about the right album?\\" I don't get it. I love the Bad Brains, they easily make my top 3 of all time favorites, but I can't find anything good about this album.

Singer Israel Joseph has his own style which he uses to great effect and drummer Mackie completely rocks the house. The songwriting is strong with powerful riffs and conscious lyrics; the production is clean. I saw this lineup in concert and thought they were great. Yeah, HR has his thing but do not dis-count this CD just because he ain't on it. The title track is one of my all time favorites, \\"Hair\\" is slammin' and there are only one or two songs that perhaps lag slightly. Check it out and decide for yourself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy This. This is BAD BRAINS in name only","review":"This album is terrible. Bad Brains don't exist without HR and HR is absent here and thus album is terrible. The new singer is just a terrible impersonator and he cna't cut it. The songs lack the energy and power of previous releases and even more they just aren't good. The only positive to come out of this whole thing is that Bad Brains realized they aren't Bad Brains without HR and thus re-formed."},{"rating":"2","title":"T.I.

His Flying Dutchman and Tannhauser overtures are incredibly exciting and quite frankly my favorite renditions of each. The Lohengrin overture is rapt and shimmering, and his act III intro is not a mad dash to the finish line as most conduct it, but still a joyous introduction to the wedding march that follows. The Meistersinger excerpts are truly astonishing. His overture is possibly the slowest ever recorded, but nothing is lacking. He even pays attention to counterpoint and highlights it where his colleagues like Solti race through and aim for a kind of orgasm in every bar. Listen to the place where wagner has the meistersinger theme played with the prize song melody with the second violins doing their own thing. Amazing how clear it is. His dances certainly do that as well. very good recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"What legacy?","review":"I found Klemperer's conducting on this CD to be grossly exaggerated, sloppy, and utterly lacking in subtlety. It is as if Klemperer bought into the propaganda that Wagner's music is inherently blustering and unbalanced (which is what I was taught in college). Reading a Wagner score should disabuse any good musician of that errant notion. Even the Rienzi Overture. Here, Klemperer hacks through it while his brass players struggle to keep up. George Szell, on the other hand, is able to find tremendous grace (in the main theme especially) with his Cleveland Orchestra recording on the Sony Classical Wagner Overtures CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"Golden earring has been one of my favorite bands for many years. Because of the enormous number of albums the band has released, it is hard to put together a complete collection. But this is a good collection to sample Golden Earring's music including solo pursuits.I am a huge fan of their music from the mid-seventies through mid-eighties. I own all the albums in this timeline, but this collection gives me a good sample of their other sounds.The collection is smartly packaged with a book of the band's history covering the songs on the CD's. The book is in Dutch - which I think is very cool (Golden Earring is true to their loyal backbone of fans - their home crowd). The English translation can be found on their website.The band has a complete shift in sound from their beginning to present. This is a nice collection for the die-hard GE fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I'm proud to be Dutch","review":"Great Album of a great Dutch Band, it's good to know that they've done well in the USA.

I just hope the next Stratovarius album won't be as bad as this solo project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the plague","review":"If you like good heavy rock music, or even music in general, stay far away from this cd. Timo carries over absolutely nothing that makes Stratovaius a great band. I have a very wide range of musical tastes (not just harder! faster!), but this solo cd is all weak pop songs, that feature nothing interesting or worth listening to. So, save your money for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?!","review":"What on Earth was going through Timo Tolkki's head when he wrote this piece of garbage. Nothing about this album has anything to do with the true reason Tolkki's in the music biz (which is, of course, Stratovarius!) Tolkki is a great guitarist, but this puts his skills as a musician to utter waste. Instead of an album in the classic style of Stratovarius, we get bland, boring, completely un-metal pop! And I don't mean a la Motley Crue! I mean the f***in' Police, who are fine, but not what Tolkki should have done! Also, what a waste to have Michael Kiske and Sharon Den Adel (two more excellent metal voices) sing on two tracks. I will say this, though, it's great to have the original Strat keyboardist, Mika Ervaskari, back with Tolkki, but that's about it. Avoid Tolkki's horribly un-metal solo stuff at ALL COSTS, and stick to Stratovarius or Kotipelto (the solo project of the OTHER Timo in Stratovarius.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't work!","review":"After reading the 5 star review, I bought 2 pairs.

I had read these first two novels when much younger - my take from later years is even more positive, although Updike's sexual obsession - and that is what it is - gets more tiresome more quickly to an older reader. To someone who has lived through the same times, these Rabbit novels are a gift, an illumination. These editions are far better than the one-volume Everyman edition, which is too heavy and can result in serious injury. Go for it. Read them quickly, in succession. You may be annoyed at times but the cumulative effect is to understand more about America, American decline (in particular note the Japanese Toyota executive's comments in Rabbit at Rest) and probably yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"America through the decades","review":"I've reread these novels multiple time; each rereading has garnered me more insight into the time in which it evolves. Though ultimately pointing toward the hollowness that directed societal evolution through these times, Updike really catches all/most of the themes of suburban America.

This is unusual for me as I usually love anything I read. If you don't like depressing stories with unlikable characters, don't get this.

The 3D-interface is non-intutive, and overkill for a simple card game.The box reads \\"Master card champion Omar Sharif shows you how to improve your game and takes you through the bids.\\" For having a world bridge experts name on the box, one would think that the game would come with a tutorial on how to play the game or an interactive helper but the game fails to provide even this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible game","review":"This is by far the most disappointing bridge game ever. The 3-d effect is absolutely useless.The play is useless as it highlights every play and bid. There is no challenge to this so called game.I would have rated it a zero if that were available.

It was a great introduction to bridge. The lessons logically progressed and Omar Shariff was a gentle and patient teacher. Unforturnately when Windows XP replaced Windows '98, Bridge Deluxe II was no longer compatable. Many years passed until I finally found what I thought was the Bridge Deluxe II that I fondly remembered. I didn't think twice and bought it immediately. What a disappointment. The tutorial provided was of no help and was essentially the equivalent of being thrown in a swiming pool while told, \\"Sink or swim\\"The graphics are \\"cheesy\\" and were better on the original '98 version. Using the new program is a hit or miss proposition. I've navigated through a lot of programs in the last 13 years.

Some of the tunes were so bad I doubt that records of them were ever made. I HOPE records of them were never made. Watching this was painful. I...found myself fast forwarding not just the stupid plot, but the out of tune and very very corny music. This is the worst rock n roll movie I ever saw.

Because the 4-pack of Bic Velocity pens I have been struggling with has been so aggravating! As other reviewers have noted, the writing is smooth and comfortable. But after a few hours use, the thing starts skipping. Mess with it for a few strokes and it comes back, but then gives out again a short time later. So, I'm moving through my 4-pack, more quickly than I expected to, and when the last one starts acting up, I'm moving on to something else. I did get a nice lead on an alternative in one of the other reviews though. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"They skip.","review":"These pens are, as far as i'm concerned, useless, as they skip.

I came across a similar BIC pen called the INTENSiTY CLiC, which is the ultimate pen. As a left hander, when you find a good pen you want to load up on that.But it looks like the Intensity Clic is either only a corporate branding pen that can only be bought in large quantity, or they discontinued it.So I thought I'd see if this Velocity Gel is the successor. It's pretty good, but totally not at the level of smoothness that the Intensity Clic is at.For the price though... can't complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good feel, Does not Write.","review":"I have a box of 12 of these pens.

I found the book to be somewhat ambigous when explaining things such as significant digits. A few more examples could have been used. However, the book fulfills it's purpose.

I'll be sure and check before deadline from now on. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad it was cheap","review":"Like one other reviewer, I am scratching my head about all the raving five-star reviews here. This performance is somewhat interesting and yes, Baker's voice is nice to hear. If you already have more recordings of the 2nd than you can count, sure, add this one to the collection. But if you are looking for one to return to again and again, this ain't it. The tempos are sometimes a bit off -- as if the communication in the performance hall was sometimes distracted by god-knows-what. The coughing? Yes, plenty of that to be heard here. Also, most irritating, the editing between movements is sloppier than sloppy. The hiss goes away and then suddenly you hear the next movement already in progress and feel that you missed something. Ah, yes, you did. Only a fraction of a second but that's too much. BTW, I really think this is worthy of two stars but gave it one just as a counterweight to all those unfathomable fives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy is a nice word for this performance","review":"I'm just completely overwhelmed by how much hype Tony Duggan as well as several other reviewers have given this performance. One reviewer stated that the other recording Klemperer performed with the Philharmonia was \\"overrehearsed\\". If that means that it's more \\"together\\" then I agree completely. What we have here is completely sloppy and in certain movements such as the 3rd, we have this un-bel-ievab-ly sloooooow drivel coming from our speakers. I have many recordings conducted by Klemperer that I absolutely love but this is a cruel joke. Other recordings that are \\"performed\\" in a unified way are Mehta with the Vienna Philharmonic, Bernstein with the New York Philharmonic from the 60's on Sony, and Bruno Walter's account combined with the 1st Symphony on Sony. I just cannot believe how overrated this recording really is. Don't buy it just to hear how bad it is. Just trust me on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Celtic Music","review":"If you love liting melodies and soothing celic music, you'll love this album.

Excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talking Water: Western Winds on Celtic Shores","review":"The trio of Talkiing Water consists of Scots fingerstyle guitarist, Ian Melrose, Berliner, Kerstin Blodig and Urs Fuchs. It started as an experiment to allow all three to try their hand in other musical directions but as a team. The result is a refreshing, contemporary blend of Celtic, Norse and modern that is not found on the North American side of the Atlantic. Kerstin has the voice of an angel but also is a top-notch musician/composer/arranger. Why she is so little known in the USA is unfathomable. All three musicians use their musical skills and insights to produce a sound that feels familiar and yet enlightening at the same time. I never tire of hearing them play. For an even more contemporary release, listen to \\"Power Of The Moon\\", a more recent CD by Talking Water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"A good cd with a few good songs.

Well worth the 8 bucks i paid for it"},{"rating":"2","title":"What An Album!","review":"I first heard cuts from Raintime through MySpace music and thought highly enough of it to buy the album and check 'em out. One word: WOW! Incredible musicians with more drive and progression than most music in America today. The album rips and shreds from the very first track and never lets up. The more my kids and I listen to Flies and Lies, the more we love it.The only downer is when vocalist Claudio Coassin belches broken glass from his mouth when he attempts his 'evil' voice. I mean.. come on! He obviously has incredible vocal talent and can hit every note on the vocal spectrum, so he doesn't need to belch the broken glass, really.Other than that, this is an incredible album and I would say a 'must-have' for all metal-head collections. I am seriously looking forward to future releases from these guys. They are truly under-rated and need more exposure in America. ROCK ON, RAINTIME!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, killer bass!! Heavy to carry though.","review":"This box is excellent!!! I love the separate bass volume control. It is pretty heavy though, I don't think it's that portable. The remote works fine, cassette has auto reverse. Same controls are used for both CD and tape (FF, RW, etc.), clever idea. Has a wireless FM transmitter that you can use on any radio (maybe in your car with an MP3 player too) besides with the Kaboom box. I would have liked to get it in Black BUT... it costs $40 dollars more, so white it is. The price is also the lowest you will find, no tax and fast free shipping.

I was surprised to find no tone control on the unit. The sound quality is only ok, and I end up setting the subwoofers to the lowest level as it muffled up the sound when set to anything higher than minimum. The wireless option is only decent, as there is quite a bit of static noise (just like what you would hear with a cordless phone). The Mic/guitar input is good, but it only accepts mono (there's no Line input for stereo). The remote control is full-function and is handy. The unit is big, heavy, and rugged enough.I was hoping to use this as a more portable option instead of hauling my Fender Pd250, but the sound quality is way lagging behind what I get from the Fender.I'm keeping it regardless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I am a fan of the writings of Joseph Chilton Pearce. I had hoped that reading \\"Magical Parent - Magical Child\\" would be a valuable learning experience. After reading 36 pages, I decided that I would not spend any more time reading this, very disappointing. I do not doubt that the author has good intentions in writing the book. But I think he attempts to cram too many disconnected ideas into the book. Part of each page of text - in margin - is a quote from one of the LCP books. This makes the book very awkward to read. Sensory overload. Too bad, because I think JCP ideas are very powerful. I would not recommend it to anyone to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virtual Pool 3 is the best Pool simulation I've ever played.","review":"This game comes complete with rules and ladders to climb your way to the top in ANY pool game you can imagine. It also has many games you've never even heard of. The unique thing about this game is that it guarantees to improve your (real life) pool game, which is absolutely true. Your angles will get better, your cue control will get better, and you will just have more fun. Beware, as this game will become addicting and you will lose track of time.The cons about this game? The original release of Virtual Pool 3 featured Jeannette Lee at the very top of the ladder, as well as occassional cinema scenes where she lets you know how much of a loser you are compared to her. This version does not have her at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vista crash","review":"When I purchased this item from Amazon.com the information said that it is compatible with Windows Vista.

I got this game becase I like playing games on my PC and since I also love playing pool, it seemed to make sense. Beautiful graffics, especially for a 2 year old game and the game plays smoothly on my a year and a half old gaming rig. There are a lot of game types to pick and fun to play for someone who has little or no knowledge of the games but for a seasoned player, it might seem like torture when even a simple shot takes almost a minute to line up and still miss despite your best efforts to make sure the shot was correctly lined up. The same shot in real life would be in the pocket in about 5-6secs. In my opinion, this gameshould be for fun only cause it does not compare to playing the real game.

How anyone today could get a Mercury era space suit, much less wear it without the air conditioning unit, while riding a horse on a Texas ranch, really makes for great fantasy. When Billy Bob Thornton's character tries to launch the first rocket himself and it fails, igniting the rocket sideways on the ground (and he survives?!!!) is farfetched, to be kind. The only really interesting part is the conflict between Thornton and Virginia Madsen after that.I've loaned the DVD I (sadly) bought to three people; only one had any positive comments.

We bought it.Only we've been sorely disappointed. Sorely. We don't get much sun in Seattle, but this past weekend was sunny and hot (for here). We lathered up ourselves and our kids in our Badger spf 15, and in the length of a single soccer game, each of us was crispified.I guess I'm just tired of sunburns. I've had too many.

At about 4 PM the two guys faces were VERY bright red so much that a friend commented on how red their faces were. Mine was not. Of course part of this has to do with skin type- their faces are more prone to getting red with the sun than mine (although Im pretty fair) - so I cannot be certain.

I have to admit that I wasn't sure what to expect because I've been trying to find a product that would allow me to wear my naturally curly hair without the puffy afro and the frizzy look. This product gives me the soft curls that I have been looking for. And the price was right, I paid a little over $40 for all three products. I have used Ouidad deep conditioner in the past and met with great results but I can't always afford it. But this was a pleasant surprise and I can't speak enough about this product. I love the fact that it's not just for mixed chicks with curly hair (which I am) but it's for everyone with curly hair regardless of ethnicity. I highly recommend these products, it leaves my hair soft, my curls defined and very easy to manage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"It does tame my hair and make is shiny, but if you put to much in it weighs it down.

If you use a whole lot if makes your curls look real nice. But you have the more you have in your hair the heavier it makes your hair.

This stuff made my hair hard and dry and left flakes.

My hair is natually thick but has a wavy,curly texture i wanted something that kept my wavy curls but helped frizz. I'm so disappointed. I've heard so much good things about the product it really ticks me off that it worked better on my grandmothers hair she has no frizz her hair is like a white person's but it's curly. It made me wonder if i used it right i did like it said in the video the girl in the video had the kind of texture of hair i did but it didn't work on me. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Wonders","review":"This product alleviates the frizz. I have course, wavy, long hair and the leave-in conditioner takes the place of 3 products that I was using to do the job - a leave-in conditioner for curly hair on my damp hair, spray gel or mousse, and then an oil cream moisturizer for more de-frizzing and helping with fly-aways after my hair had dried. The first time I used Mixed Chicks, I used just about as much as I would my regular leave-in conditioner on my damp hair and when it dried, I didn't need the last 2 steps of my usual routine! The stuff rocks! - It's going to save me so much time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff","review":"I have been looking for a good leave in conditioner for a very long time, and feel like I finally found one. I am mixed (Black/White) and have fairly dry hair. In the past I have used leave in conditioners and then had to use a gel or mousse to keep my curls tamed. I was able to use this leave in with no other product, and it left my hair soft, tamed, and with a nice shine. Also I comb my hair in the shower, and with many products after being in my hair for a day I have had great difficulty getting the comb through my hair the next morning (yes even with the water streaming down!) Mixed Chicks creates no tangles, and the comb easily goes through. It is heavy so if you're used to light weight leave in's be forwarned. Definitely a great product for curly mixed girl hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful product!","review":"My children are inter-racial & my daughter has a blonde afro & she was always crying when it came time to get her hair done & by the end of the day if was a giant frizz ball.

I was shocked to see such high reviews for this product. It must really depend on your hair type because it did nothing for my 3c/4a natural hair. It made it sticky and crunchy and did not moisturize it. That was the most important part though-- no moisture! I was sort of impressed by the product when I first got it because I was newly natural and didn't really realize what moisturized hair feels like. It does not feel like this. Maybe if you have naturally oily hair that needs daily washing, this product will work for you. If your hair is naturally dry like mine and requires a lot of moisture, steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it where it is","review":"I was not impressed with this conditioner especially for the price.

I have naturally curly, wavy, and straight patterns of hair on my head, but mostly curly. I shampooed and conditioned my hair. Afterwards, I sectioned my hair and used a substantial amount of the leave-in conditioner. I allowed my hair to air dry. This product made my hair look dry and kinky. It also made my hair feel dry, like it was coated with something or had a residue on it. Maybe, I used too much, I don't know? I wish I had not purchased the large bottle. This product has a great smell, but it is not for me! Nevertheless, I guess I will have to keep spending money, until I find what works for me!

I am half Puerto Rican and half Lithuanian. My hair is a 3b and I absolutely love this leave-in conditioner. I have searched so long for hair products for my thick, 3b, corkscrew naturally curly and naturally dry hair. What I love the best about this product is that it not only thoroughly moisturizes my curls but it also stretches out my curls as they dry. Usually after washing my hair and letting it air dry, my curls curl up to my ears which I hate because in reality my hair is down to my shoulders and it takes a couple of days before my curls start stretching out in-between washes. Bravo Mixed Chicks! I hope this stuff is around FOR-EVAH! For me the shampoo and conditioner work incredibly as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Supreme Leave-in Treatment for Curly Hair","review":"Everybody knows curly hair needs special TLC--but does it have to be a pain? Not any more, not with Mixed Chicks Leave-in Conditioner. After shampooing and conditioning, slather on this stuff, comb through--and leave it. Just that--don't mess with your hair until it is dry. What will happen? The Mixed Chicks conditioner will soothe and coat your curls--coaxing them into corkscrews that are shiny and that stay in place. When your hair is dry, fluff lightly (not much) to loosen the wet look. Ta-da! Gorgeous, shiny, healthy curls. Not oily. Just set and natural. Really, this product is as close to a hair miracle as anything on the market for people with curls."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Hype Than Hope","review":"Didn't work for me.

I asked a fellow curly girl what she uses and she told me about this product. I had seen it advertised in a magazine as well. I was excited about this product, hoping it would moisturize my hair while giving me great frizz free curl. The product did an excellent job at reducing the frizz in my hair. Unfortunately, it also weighed down my curls. I normally go three days in between washes, but by day two, may hair needed to be washed again. I looked at the ingredients and assume that the wax is what weighs the frizz and the curl down. I have tried putting less product in my hair, but to no avail. I still end up with flat, although frizz-free, hair.On another note, I bought this product from the Mixed Chics website. An ad in a magazine said I would get 10% off when entering a promotional code. There was no place to enter the promotional code, so I put it in the comments section. I never got my 10% discount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everybody 4b/4c","review":"When I used this product, I noticed a scent similar to relaxers(like chemicals). My hair type is 4c crown and 4b edges. I didn't see a difference than other leave-in conditioners. When I washed it out 2 days later, my hair had excessive shedding like I had when relaxers were being washed out of my hair. Since going sulfate-free, I observe the amounts of shedding that I have because the difference has been that I shed at least 60 percent less hair. With this wash, I saw more shedding than I have ever seen since going chem/heat/sulfate free. I will be giving this to my friend who recommended this product and not using it again. I gave it 2 stars because the childrens leave-in works well on my daughter's 3c,4a hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I'm an African American woman with 3C hair type. The first time I used this product was in the whole little set - shampoo, conditioner, and leave-in. In my opinion, it did not appear to \\"work\\". Curls were not defined and it was frizzy and ridiculous in about an hour. Don't get me wrong my hair felt extremely clean and hydrated but I ended up doing my usual straigtening. I've since figured out (1) that the set is not mandatory (2) this product has to be used a couple of times before it \\"works\\"(3) you need to be quite liberal with it and (4) taking from these reviews the second and third times I made a water, leave-in and hot oil 6 mix to define more for an evening out. It's not magic nor is it a chemical treatment so it will not give you ringlets if you have 3C and higher. However it does help to maintain curly styles after the pool or the beach. Great job ladies! I am a loyal customer now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do anything for me","review":"I have wavy hair that will hold a curl if I curl it, but it gets very frizzy when it is humid out. I figured I'd try this since it got a lot of good reviews.

Using their \\"easy to use\\" bone rigging tool takes a long time to set up and use. It took me ten minutes to make one for a stick figure.

Like any media application (Photoshop, Final Cut, 3d Studio, etc) there is a lot to learn and producing quality animations takes time.The only caveats I can think of are that the mac version still has some bugs (though there are various work arounds, and they are expected to be fixed in the upcoming version 6) and the documentation is less than perfect, but there is an active forum full of experienced animators that will be glad to help you.To conclude, I would fully recommend Anime Studio to anyone wanting to experiment with animation, but not ready to swing for a more expensive tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted my money","review":"I had never used an animation package before and did not know enough to avoid this one.The problem is not that it is hard to learn, it's that it's not worth learning.The drawing tools are crude and primitive.I can't see getting anything really good looking out of this package.What I didn't realize is that the program has no support for converting any files types into a vertor image which could then be animated and this version does not allow any vector import.So you are stuck with either using this programs lousy drawing tools or \\"upgrading for $180 and hoping that works better.I was not looking for a \\"pro\\" grade setup ,but this is worthless.Wasted my money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story of Love and War","review":"Celtic Love is an enchanting 10-story book which revolves around what humans know best -- LOVE.

Lovers are broken apart by war, kidnapping, marriage to another, pride, religion, and/or death. They are brought back together by love and love alone. Sometimes, however, if death does occur, the lovers cannot rekindle their relationship that they once had.I love this book because it takes you to the world in which the writer, Caitlin Matthews, is in when she writes the book, and to where the lovers are when the plot is taking its place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book for young children","review":"This is a nice book for a young Catholic child (ages 4yrs and younger).

I wish they were drawn to appear happy (even a slight bit) as they sing and receive Jesus in the Eucharist.

DIDN'T THINK THEY COULD PULL IT OFF...","review":"Well, I confess: I was so sure that the A-Teens were doomed to being just a one-hit wonder after their \\"Abba Generation\\" album. Their initial releases in Europe were under the name Abba-Teens, after all.Fortunately, I was wrong. This new single is fantastic. First, it's not an Abba remake; nothing wrong with that, but it's nice to hear some original material. Second, it doesn't sound like every other teen pop song out there, which means it doesn't have the same overused Britney/Christina/Backstreet/N'Sync drum machine beat to it. Third, the girls can now actually sing without heavy post-production. However, the boys can't...we hear more of them in this song than we did in the whole \\"Abba Generation\\" album, but their vocals benefit from some heavy-duty processing.The song is catchy with a good melody and a solid and very endearing chorus. Nice job, A-Teens! I hope the forthcoming album is as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The A*Teens finally stand out on their own","review":"When the A*Teens made their debut during the summer of 1999,(then known as the Abba Teens) they were very obviously cashing in on the teen pop-and ABBA-mania craze - and very successfully. Delving into the vast collection of ABBA hits from the 1970s, these Swedish teens made an entire album out of ABBA covers. The songs were awesome and became hits all over Europe. Now, over a year later, the A*Teens are back....and this time they are doing their own music. Those who assumed that this group would become a one-album-success are proven wrong with the release of BOUNCING OFF THE CEILING(UPSIDE DOWN). This single proves that these teens are set to conquer the music world one more time. The song is a wonderfully crafted piece of teen pop. It is good to see that the A*Teens are capable of more than just cover versions....they actually are creating a legacy for themselves now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light switch","review":"I purchased the light and the switch worked only a few times, we hadn't even removed it from the packaging when it quit working.

At first they were great- used them for camping and thought they were wonderful. Then we put them away and didn't need them for several months. When we recently had a power outage, we found that the flashlight wouldn't stay lit unless it was constantly cranked! This is way more work than we hoped.

Springtime in Texas means windstorms which produce too many power outages to count. With the three Garrity Power Lites I just bought, I know my family will be able to reach efficient lighting when the power goes out. Even my two year old daughter can open the crank and get it going.

I can understand the direction G-Clef took with this project. Many bands will take material from another genre and adapt it to theirs, a la The Section Quartet, Me First and the Gimmie Gimmies, etc. I've never quite heard a rock album adapted to jazz and I can appreciate what G-Clef has done. It's not easy! I actually enjoy listening to the tracks on this album and as a saxophonist, I can very much appreciate the playing on this album as being excellent. The musicianship is great, although I believe the production is lacking just a bit. Overall, I think music geeks (like myself) and the general public would be able to find something they like about this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical tastes differ but this is great interpretive jazz","review":"If you are a lover of both jazz and Evanescence, then I bet you will find these solid jazz interpretations right up your tin-pan alley. The work here is done, for the most part, by a highly competent jazz trio and they rework these songs with alot of passion, They seem to have a keen understanding of what made the songs good in the first place. Some of the results are quite stunning and sometimes even beautiful; others fall flat or, at best, seem a bit contrived in origin. Overall though I give this compilation 5 stars. I really like the stripped down, pedal-to-the-metal sax, bass and guitar interludes that make up most of the production. I keep playing this album over and over. G-Cleff hooked me because they rock in a jazzy and very hip way;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish, Not Worth The CD It Comes On.","review":"An absolutely rubbish Track.Evanescence would be dissapointed, no furious.It sounds like someone drowning a cat.Sorry No.Not worth recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Evanescence Fans","review":"I would rather say, what a nice idea, but i think their motivation was doing a \\"parody\\" and i think thats why they call themselfs \\"G-Clef\\" (most of the Evanescence Tunes are written in e-minor -> G-Clef).In my opinion they are just a view frustrated Musicians, which are \\"pissed-off\\" because of these young talented Artists, who selled a view million of the great work called \\"Fallen\\", and the G-Clefs didn't.Just my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am Happy I finally found a place that carries this book.","review":"I am grateful when I see how many people Read this book.

His poems run the gamut from athletic career ironies to his daughter's struggle with French to his creative reconstruction of the Lord's Prayer. They're laced with wit and compassion and insight. He died young of a brain tumor, a malady which had killed his own KC Royals coach and another player.

Or what he represented.Provides unnecessary background information to the nth degree. The first half of the book is relentless in pushing Cervantes to the background amid extraneous detail.You get all the facts, but nothing touching the essence of the man. Stick to Don Quixote. We shall await a biography worthy of the great man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reel to reel","review":"I bought this on a lark just to see the reel to reels used in the film (I use them). I wasn't disappointed, but the movie was certainly not one of Connery's best. It's one of those movies that exploited current technology of its day, but looks ridiculously inept by today's standards. Any movie that jumps on the technology bandwagon will look dated in ten yrs-it's just a chance the producers take. It's definitely a walk down memory lane, but not any sort of defining moments in movie history fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tape Measure","review":"The Anderson Tapes conspicuously mentioned in this film's title are very peripheral to the film's plot. Instead we have a brilliant \`caper film' set in a New York City townhouse in early 1971. The images are still memorable of a balding Sean Connery as the leader and brains behind the heist. And who can forget that stoic and peculiar looking member of Connery's team, Christopher Walken in his first film. What an impression he made. This film still looks current even today. This is a real suspenseful film full of great characterizations. A good one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tape Worm","review":"Sean Connery turns in an excellent and memorable performance in this excellent thriller competently acted, well scripted and neatly directed about a heist where everything is not what it appears to be. This film is full of great characters and suspense. Quincy Jones composed a great score. Look for Christopher Walken's distinctive face in his film debut. It will keep you on the edge of your seat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning-this is NOT a period piece","review":"The Anderson Tapes is an example of what director Sidney Lumet is capable of creating: an entertaining yet somehow thoughtful film. This was the movie that actually made me appreciate Sean Connery. In the Bond films he was doomed to be typecast. Sidney Lumet bailed him out and Connery owes him big time. Great setup and cameos: including an underrated scene with the great Garret Morris as a limber police officer, who would go on to become one of the original Not Ready for Prime Time Players on Saturday Night Live just a few years later (along with Belushi, Chase, Radner, etc.). Christopher Walken looks like a baby in this one and Martin Balsam is pretty funny. Nice flash forward scenes make it seem like it can never be a dated film. Chilling last scene makes the film and a point about our technological age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Press Play","review":"Sean really seems to relish his role as a tough-guy ex-con in this intense caper from the early 70s that holds up nicely. The conceit that everything we're seeing and hearing is culled from various surveillance tapes is a little distracting and doesn't quite work. But Lumet's brisk, no-nonsense take on the action when the heist goes live still delivers. Good NYC locations and Qunicy Jones jazzy score help. The punch card type of the credits and those awful \\"futuristic\\" sounding, echoing computer beeps on the soundtrack are what make the picture seem much more dated than it is. Plus Lumet's inclusion of more than a few gay caricatures.It's fun to see Chris Walken's debut and Dyan is sensationally sexy. Only Alan King's irritating over-acting mars the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Level for Contractors","review":"I have owned many different brands of levels over the years and I can truly say this is the best I've owned so far for my needs. It's really accurate and solidly built. My employees will borrow it from my truck and use it for framing, trim and concrete work to hanging cabinets. I do have a request that it always be returned cleaned and preferably in one piece. After a couple of years of use it has lost its white empire logo but the blue anodized aluminum is holding up great. It is still highly accurate and the first level I reach for. I will be purchasing the digital version next. Let's hope it's as good. These are a little more expensive that some of the other brands, but you do get what you pay for with with this level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not serious literature but who needs it?","review":"Laurence Shames will never win a Pulitzer Prize for these novels but his stories about the Key West we tourists never see (and I have read them all) are a lighthearted look at the under-belly of Key West all delivered with tongue-in-cheek humor.

Mine actually has a problem with one end of the ducting kit. So I contacted them via e mail on their website, three times, not once did I hear back from them, not once.

It was easy to put together. My only complaint would be the window adapter for the exhaust doesn't fit my window. So I had to adapt it to fit.

The trick is to keep the return air as cold as possible.

It drew me back to playing with my sisters and brothers or friends in intricatly designed fantasies from our forts of cardboard boxes to the evil neighbor kid who taunted us. This movie was a way back machine and brought out some emotion I hadn't expected.It takes you up and down and up again. It made me laugh and cry. I don't often watch kids movies anymore but I was so wanting to see it from the beginning that I looked for it and bought it.

But not to fear, those of you who love the book like I do, the jump to the 21st century cannot undo a timeless theme: the power of friendship. This is a lovely story, both funny and heartbreaking. This is a story which shows that hardship and tragedy need not overwhelm the human spirit, but can be used as a tool to strengthen who we are.

Pretty good, and there are some surprising twists that I wouldn't expect. One review described it as \\"Chronicles of Narnia\\" meets an After School Special. Pretty accurate, IMO. Hits a little too hard upon the Bible a couple times for my taste (at least 'Narnia' was more subtle about it), but otherwise an entertaining movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD Cover misleading","review":"I agree with the review below, although I know nothing about the book which this movie is based on. This was in no way a light hearted Fantasy. It barely has any effects or creatures, except for about 20 seconds at the very end.(when the DVD cover makes it look like \\"The Neverending Story\\") Definitely NOT for kids under 10, as this movie got pretty dark and depressing. Wayyy too many stereotyped characters that I did not care about. I just thought this was a really awful movie that is not for young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge To Terabithia (Full Screen Edition)","review":"Very good. Good Movie. Have sent it on to the grandchildren after reviewing. Would purchase something similar in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"good graphics but weird storyline","review":"I watched this movie on the cable.

BUT I STILL LIKED IT.WORTH RENTING AND KID FRIENDLY.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY. GOOD STORY AND LIKEABLE CHARACTERS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I seen this movie. this is one of the best movies of all time. I think Josh Hutcherson and AnnaSophia Robb were at their best and each should have been nominated for an academy award/oscars and won it. However, The movie would have been better if Josh and AnnaSophia have kiss each other on the cheeks or lips."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Kids","review":"The commercials were very misleading. My grandson wanted to see it because the commercials showed trees that \\"had eyes\\" as he put it. We took him to see it and were disappointed because he is only 3 and the movie is really geared for older kids and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointlessly depressing","review":"This film could have been almost acceptable as a tragedy, if there was a point to all the suffering. There wasn't. It could have been a kid's adventure move if the characters had been written to see anything remotely amazing or grow in any more meaningful way. Not so. It could have been a morality play if characters' intentional actions were linked to consequences. They weren't.As it is, the film is a vile protracted trudge through pointless suffering, punctuated by fleeting and insipid moments of sad fantasy by doomed characters. No good deed goes unpunished; all opportunities for growth are resolved in dime novel or mean-spirited fashions.If you love suffering, guilt, shame, futility, and incompetence set in an uncaring and malevolent universe, this is the film for you.I'm still retching.(As a postscript, the two young actors were excellent in this otherwise waste of an effort)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave it here","review":"I love the fantasy classic films like The neverending story, The dark Crystal, Willow, and many others. But film is full of emptiness not fasination. The story is anti-climatic and holds no thunder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I purchased the video \\"Bridge To Terabithia\\" to watch with my Grandaughter. We prepared for movie night with great anticipation of seeing a beatiful movie. I have to say that both my Grandaughter and I are extremely upset with the direction in which it went. The death of Leslie was unbelieveable. My Grandaughter kept saying \\"she isn't dead, watch I know she isn't really dead\\" and I had to be the one to try and explain it to her. Was it really necessary to have that happen? This botherd me all night and I needed to vent. I will not reccommend that anyone I know with children buy this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depreeeeesssing!","review":"I never read the book, so I watched the movie. When it ended, or even before it ended, I asked Why? What was the point? The young, beautiful heroine drowns toward the end of the movie. The depressed young boy then takes his little sister to the fantasy land and smiles and the movie ends. I could have done better. I would have brought Leslie back to life (as was Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and I don't know else, or better yet, let's not kill her and give the author a raspberry! Brrrrrp! Nahnah, nahnah, nahnah my movie is better than your book. Leslie lives, Leslie lives! Instead this book got the Newbery Medal which is awarded annually by the Association for Library Service to Children. Did they all forgot their childhood?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God I saw this movie as an adult","review":"I can only imagine all the little kids in the movie theater crying their eyes out as the sweet little girl cracked her head on a rock and drowned in the river. And did they have to bring religion into it? Since she wasn't a Christian, we can only assume that she is indeed burning in hell. This movie sends out a lot of negative messages to children like, if someone is bullying you, create fake documents to publicly humiliate that person.2 stars for the acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another collection...","review":"This is movie was okay. The HD graphics were up to par and the uncompressed sound is always phenomenal. The video is in widescreen, but with the format it has, it's perfect for those who don't like to have the black bars on your top and bottom screens. I was expecting more from the 'fantasy' part of the story, but rather you are left guessing if they are only imagining things or is it really happening once they cross into the other side of the woods. My conclusion is that they were only imagining a fantasy world fueled by events occurring in their lives and school on a subconscious level.I was expecting more from the movie in terms of the storyline and the animation fantasies, but sadly the most you'll see of the land of Therabithia is at the end...everything else is quite contemporary and there isn't really a 'dreamworld' to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"May be better than the book.","review":"I've read this book many times. The fantacy part of the DVD was greatly embellished. Great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Things I learned From This Movie","review":"1) Hard working blue collar families have no fun.2) Well educated white collar families are really great.3) Its okay for a female teacher to take one male student on a field trip without anyone else knowing.4) Class bullies are the victims of child abuse.5) School security is very poor.6) A child's imagination is sometimes pretty boring.7) The best way to inform a child that their best friend is dead is to just blurt it out.8) Advertising your film as a light children's fantasy when in reality it is a dark juvenile drama is okay if you are Disney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Stop Imagining.","review":"By far, a true justice to a great story. Watch this movie and remember why it is so important to never stop imagining. BWell. =o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Family Film but....","review":"have the Kleenex ready! My mom, 10-year-old son, 6-year-old daughter, and myself just finished watching BRIDGE TO TERABITHIA. This is definitely a family film that everyone will find enjoyable. However, since it does (at least most of the time) closely follow the book of the same name by Katherine Paterson (Bridge to Terabithia), if you've read it you'll know that the tears will come.As a fantasy film, it's on the light side. This isn't the kids' version of a huge fantasy epic such asThe Lord of the Rings - The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition), so don't go into it expecting to see tons of special effects.However, as a \\"struggling to fit in\\" story that features two middle-grade students, this movie scores high. This is the type of \\"bullies-crush on the teacher-surviving middle school\\" story that will never be out of fashion.Overall, an entertaining yet sad family film I would recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expect","review":"We took the kids to this movie expecting something to the effect of Narnia - because when you see the reviews & trailers - thats what the kids are expecting and what it looks like the movie will be about. Everything you see for the advertisement as far as fantsy - thats it! The story wasn't bad - but its definately not what i or my kids expected - whats bad is - there were A LOT of small kids in the theater expecting somthing different - so as the story progresses and one of the main kid character dies - you think 'great.. this was suppose to be a fun movie i was taking the kids to see.' VERY disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upsetting and terrible for kids","review":"Do not let your kids watch this movie. I am not sure what lesson it is supposed to impart. Well I do, but it is not successful. Everyone is mean, the kids, the teacher, the parents. And since when is killing off the 'good guy' and a kid at that I great idea for a kid's movie. I have not read the book (nor will I) but I am hoping it was better done than the movie. Acting on kids part was good but I never got into or understood Tarabithia and found the entire movie either boring or upsetting depending where we were. We will never watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridge to Depression!!","review":"I thought this movie was TOTALLY too depressing! I mean, the girl dies, and the whole land of Terabithia is dark with lots of evil spirits. And- the girl DROWNS!! I think this movie should be rated PG 13. It's just WAY too sad!!Also, the main characters barely spend any time in Terabithia itself!! Why is the movie even called Bridge to TERABITHIA? I just REALLY thought this movie was TOO sad. Please take my advice- DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sieve for Treasure","review":"'Bridge to Terabithia' is a portal to a better life for children and teens. Not simply a call to exercise one's imagination in an electronic age, 'Bridge...' never goes too far to illustrate kids making best use of their resources, including sifting all the elements of boredom, bullying, and fear that resonate in their lives. Sort of like 'Pan's Labyrinth' for children, country kids Jesse (Josh Hutcherson) and newcomer Leslie (Anna Sophia Robb) both find a land of enchantment that's only a swing on a rope away across the river. Mending their lives and making it more meaningful, they both learn to enjoy and draw--pun intended--from their talents and friendship in their ordinary lives.Based on Katherine Patterson's Newbery Award winning novel, 'Bridge to Terabithia' is a list topping family movie that adults will love as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story for the family","review":"I wont go into any details about the movie, do not want to spoil that.This is a great movie for the family. i would watch it with your children to answer their questions. It teaches/shows the child a few things that are very helpful. It is a very good life teaching story. really great for the whole family"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay,","review":"so it was sad but that really wasn't a BIG part of the movie. A good family type movie. It deals with death so beware. It was a good movie.Two teens becoming best friends after a friendly foot race.

More depth than most Disney movies.I agree with the previous reviewer and I also wouldn't recommend this for young children unless viewed with there parents and even then it may be a little hard for them.BTW... Disney has BD down, this is another excellent picture quality and sound quality disk for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed, waste of time and money","review":"Disgusted is the term I would use for Bridge to Terabithia. I am tired of these \\"not so subtle\\" Christian morality intrusions into our films. The child's death is unnecessary to the story - her joy of living should have been celebrated. The author is the child of missionaries and originally planned to be one herself - this is made very obvious through the inclusion of a very awkward scene where the children go to church and then , out of the blue, have a strange, disturbing discussion regarding the nature of religious beliefs. The trailers and the film poster were very misleading - very little magic in this film. The film was slow, the lovely dips into the fantasy world were infrequent and not fully explored or explained. It cost us over 50 dollars to go to this movie (with babysitter for baby, etc.) and I feel very very cheated...(I will say that the two main child actors were delightful, especially condisering the horrendous screenplay)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time . . .","review":"I wanted special effects and imagination--all I got was pointless melodrama and dialogue about religious doctrine. The dialogue is 100% over-the-top CHEESE. This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever paid to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"What fantasy????????","review":"The Fantasy here is that this is advertised as a fantasy. That's like saying the Nazis were goodwill ambassadors. I threw it in the trash after I watched it.Maybe the producers and I have a different definition of \\"fantasy\\". A general rule of fantasies is that you don't kill of your heroine right in the middle of the story. That's not a fantasy, that's real life.Whoever gave this movie 5 stars is either on the production staff, relatives of the child actors, or mentally disturbed.Yah, lets all go have fun watching a movie about people dying and call it a \\"FANTASY\\". Get the popcorn. Maybe they'll make another fantasy were more good people die. Make it real \\"real-like\\". Maybe have an airplane crash into a school. A real fantasy. Make you feel real good inside. Heeeey! That dude died reeeeeal good! That was fuuuuuun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPOINTED","review":"The trailer is very misleading and I was fooled like a lot of other moviegoers, it leads you to belive you are going to get some great special WETA costumes and Characters but that is only the last 5 minutes, yes the story is ok except the time I went the room was full of young kids and they were having a great time till suddenly one of the main characters diesand the feeling in the whole theatre went from happy to depressed.This is not a good family movie and was not a happy experiance for most of the people especialy the young children. Be aware they will show you coolcharcters on the poster and the dvd box but there is only 6-7 minutes of any of those and to me it was totally misleading and very teen formula with many scene that look like they were just used to attack teeny bompersprogamed to fit a certain market, reminded me of the boy band crazethought up by some promo guy at Disney."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatdaheck?!!","review":"unreal. most boys if they had a chance to spend time with a hot little number in the woods would be playing doctor or strip oker, no fighting made-up monsters. if the kids were younger-- 6 or 7 if would be more believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terabithia is all imagination!","review":"I went into this movie also thinking that the children would be visiting a whole new world not unlike middle earth or even narnia, but things started getting suspicious when they barely even mentioned or entered the world after 30 mins (1/3 of the movie) passed. I look up the movie on rotten tomatoes and lo and behold Terabithia is nothing more than an imagined world.I promptly turned it off as I felt deceived by the advertising and many of the portrayals of kids just weren't realistic. I usually always avoid movie synopses because they reveal everything - but in this case, I should've read it! This movie is about two kids growing up having to face countless bullies, school and family. It's a light hearted coming of age flick and if that rocks your boat then watch it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Girl take two","review":"Don't be misled by the posters, this is just an updated version of a script done long ago. Nothing special, a real let down considering the great Narnia movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not play.

Shame on you Walt Disney Company!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I love sci fi and fantasy.

One of Disney's best! A must have"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good life lesson movie","review":"My little boy loves this movie. We have watched it more than once. It always touched my heart the friendship and love for each other the little boy and girls find. It is fun to watch kids use their imagination. That is how we played when we were kids. We didn't sit in front of the t.v. for entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Deep Movie for the Child in Us","review":"For those of us who fantasized about make-believe lands, this movie is right up our alley! Two misfits (a boy and girl) become friends, bonded by a play area across a stream from the boy's house. They swing across the stream on a rope that the girl says is enchanted. While on the other side they imagine a different world called Tarabithia which seems to come alive.As the two bond together, they seem to make peace with the rest of the world from the kids that bully them at school to the boy's seemingly cold father, and the boy's sweet little sister that he seems to always ignore.This is a movie that you really need to be an adult to understand. This is a different experience from the other movies of this genre (The Chronicles of Narnia, The Golden Compass). I found this movie very enjoyable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"extremely emotional movie","review":"ok, I won't go into the plot or all the graphics which I thought were awesome and no, I did not read the book before we bought this movie so I had no way of knowing about the death which takes place halfway through the movie.As a mother who did lose a child tragically and my surviving son who lost his brother, this movie really did a number on us both. I really wish there'd been some sort of warning so that I'd known that there was a scene that would bring up the horror that I've already lived through once and had no desire to experience again - even in film!Otherwise, I do have to say I honestly enjoyed the relationship between the main characters and really loved how they created this whole imaginary world and could have really really loved this movie but again, the tragedy just destroyed my enjoyment of it and we weren't able to resume watching it after that.I'm giving it a 2 rating because of that one scene and how it detracted from our enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie is not what was expected and not for kids","review":"I have grandchildren ranging from newborn to 12 and although the newborn didn't comment on this film, the others had plenty to say. They hated it, everyone of them. It was sad and left them all feeling really depressed. I can understand, it did the same thing to me. We all assumed this was a movie about cool fantasy creatures, but it wasn't, it was so filled with sorrow.Maybe this would be a good film for fathers to watch who neglect their sons in favor of little daughters, because sons have hearts and need love too. Maybe it's a good movie to help parents see how cruel children can be, and maybe by that they can teach their children to be kind human beings and not bullys. But I wouldn't recommend this for anyone but adults, and only those who want to feel totally at a loss, and have a ten ton weight sit on their hearts. This is a sad, sad film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a kids film","review":"Well to put it simply it was not at all what I expected. I was looking for a fantasy movie; which was not this film. The filmmakers sure wanted you to think that it was though by the previews.I really did not enjoy this film at all and wish I had not purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good gift for the kids","review":"Buyers beware! Don't be fooled by the commercials and deceptive marketing tactics used to promote this horrible film. If you've already seen this film and actually liked it, then go ahead and buy this film. However for those who had not seen this film, be warned that this movie is no Narnia. What is seen in the commercial accounts for only 5 min of the film. The film is very slow moving which perhaps one could deal with it were not for the unexpected death of a main character. This is not a kid's movie. So unless you're ready to talk to you kids about abuse and death, you might want to leave this video where it belongs, sitting on the store shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent family movie!","review":"If you are looking for an excellent family movie, I highly recommend the Bridge To Terabithia. I had no idea what this movie was about when I bought it. I was not disappointed at all. It is a very good childrens (not too young) movie or an excellent family movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing fantasy, jarring reality","review":"To paraphrase the quote of a old playwright \\"In my youth, I loved writing tragedy, until I learned that life was quite tragic enough without my adding to it.\\" The creators of this movie would have done well to remember that, because unlike Narnia, you will leave movie this dragged down and not lifted up. If you hold a Christian faith, you'll also wonder why the movie takes a gratuitous swipe at God and those who hold religious beliefs. You'll not leave with any real since of wonder at the fantasy world of Terabithia, because it simply has no depth. Most of the action occurs at a small public school and in a depressing, poor family's home with the stereotypical overbearing father and distracted and aloof mother. The imaginary play between the two main characters stretches the movie's credibility even further, with poor development and/or explanation. In short, if I saw this movie on broadcast television, I would channel surf right past it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Christian spin","review":"Katherine Paterson was the daughter of Christian missionaries; her children's books evidence her faith and understanding of the human condition - especially as it pertains to the very real world of children. Sadly, this film uses Paterson's story to present Christians as depressed, dark, repulsive people. In the end, Biblical truth is pushed aside rather powerfully by the harsh father of the Christian family at an extremely emotional moment. Instead of celebrating faith, this film seems to deliberately undermine it. I grant it two stars for the creativity of the fantasy land and for the delightful performance of the young female lead - but I would never recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Christian movie","review":"Right in the middle of the movie your child will face a mockery on Christianity from someone who apparently has no idea what Christianity is about. They pervert and make fun of the profound Christian teaching which they can't get. They could well not bring it up in the movie, but no, they think that their brilliant ideas are so valuable and smart that they have to spread them out on innocent minds. This is called cheating and robbery. Don't let your child to be robbed by this Walt Disney movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Lesson learned...","review":"Never buy a movie without seeing it first. I bought this movie after seing the trailers and constant requests from my daughter. I finally gave up. Silly me... I wasted my money. The movie introduces you into this wonderful world, raising your expectations, and then they drop this stupid plot, with absolutely no purpose. I had to spend more than an hour after we saw it, trying to calm down my very upset daughter, who was crying almost hysterically, yelling: \\"why Mom, why????\\" But, lesson learned."},{"rating":"1","title":"let down","review":"This movie is like three films in one. The fantasy part is very small and has very little to do with the main plot. Although I'm not sure what the main plot is? That we should live in an imaginary world to escape thecruel one we really live in?Alot of unrealistic things in this movie and I don't mean the Fantasy parts.1. Grades K-8 in the same school?2. A young female teacher taking a male student out alone on a saturday?3. Josh Hutcherson, AnnaSophia Robb would never have been considered \\"losers\\" in any school I've been to.This movie is depressing and falls short of tying all the elements together. And once again Christianity is attacked by Hollywood.I read AnnaSophia Robb is a Christian, I'm surprised she would except the lines given to her in the scene after Church. The kids have a poor understanding of the Gospel the way they explain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!!!","review":"I should have read the reviews before purchasing this movie. I was expecting fantasy and all I got was a very depressing storyline. I don't think any child would enjoy this movie and as an adult I definitely did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adaptation","review":"Just about every children's book gets turned into movie at least once. Examples include Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, and many Disney tales. Unfortunately, the award-winners do not do so well at either the box office or from the critics. This list of movie letdowns include The Indian in the Cupboard, The Phantom Tollbooth, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, and Watership Down. Luckily this is an adaptation. Based on the classic children's book of the same title, the screenplay of this movie was written by the son of the book's author. The author had written the book based on the experiences of the son after he lost his best friend, a girl, when he was 8 years old. Now that boy has turned his mother's book into one of the better family movies this year. The familiar children's themes are all there; longing, family conflict, busy parents, fitting in, school bullies, first loves, and pain-in-the-ass siblings. Add in a lot of special effects by the WETA group and you have a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected!!!","review":"This is an unbelievably well crafted movie by Disney and Walden Media.I bought this movie for my teenage kids, and expecting just that, a movie for kids. While my kids enjoyed the movie very much, unexpectedly so did I. It is a wonderful movie about kids imaginations and their relationships with each other and the adults in their lives. I won't spoil it, but others have mentioned that there is a sad part of the movie which \\"traumatized\\" their children. Children from the age of 5 to 17 have watched this movie in our house, and all have enjoyed it. If your child is overly sensitive this may be an issue, otherwise probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT was that!?!?!?!?","review":"This really was a great movie, and I do highly recommend it for anyone who knows what's coming - a coming of age story about a young boy and girl facing the tribulations of growing up and public school.BUT that was NOT what Disney advertised. I bought this based on the disney advertising to watch on a lark with my young daughter. We both sat there on the couch with our draw dropped in shock. My daughter kept asking over and over and over, when does Leslie come back to life! This was NOT appropriately marketed.A great movie - had my daughter not watched it - with terrible TERRIBLE marketing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Good Movie","review":"I bought this Disney movie to build on my Disney collection.And glad I did.There are may different emotions involved in this film.Touches on many things.Happy,sad,joy,pain,fantasy,closeness between family / friends.As for me this movie is good for anyone of all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Dreadful!","review":"This is most definately not a childrens movie. I would class this as a \\"wolf in sheeps clothing\\". It has some very serious undertones in it that any child under the age of 10 really isn't ready to deal with. Even I had trouble working out if I was watching a fantasy, a drama/tragedy or kids movie.It leaves one with a very empty feeling and wondering what the whole point of the movie really was. If I want to feel miserable watching something ........I'll watch the news thanks.Give this one a WIDE berth!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy and fluffy","review":"I watched this movie with no knowledge of the plot. I should have done my research before watching it with my 5 and 10 year old as they were both mortified by the entire film...kids are constantly bullied and pushed around and other horrible things.

How disappointed they were when the seeing of these imaginary characters were few to say the least and mainly at the end. I found my nine year old twins getting bored and restless, when usually they will sit through this type of movie, it was I think a little boring and over the heads of some kids. I was also surprised at the early departure of some movie goers due to the younger ones being fidgety."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Disney","review":"I've never written a review, but feel compelled here. The fact that it was depressing set aside (if I want this type of tragedy, I'll watch the evening news), I was disappointed in some of the lessons taught.Specifically, making revenge look good is not a good ethic to teach your children. I had hoped that Jess and Leslie were somehow different from the other kids and above doing that. Also, I felt the movie made light of the situation where a child confesses her father has beaten her. Children should learn that a situation like that should be reported to a trusted adult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, awful, traumatic Movie for kids","review":"Did these people see the same movie I did? The cover and previews are lies. This is NOT a happy kids movie. It's not a Happy anything!This was a horrible, awful movie for kids to watch. It will leave them crying, saddened, and dealing with issues they should never have to deal with.I can't believe Disney put this movie out. I'm 42, and I came away from this HORRIFIED.I don't want to spoil this story, but parents?

Both cards have caused problems in my digital cameras. The read/write speed is inconsistent causing the camera to freeze and shut down. Trying to retrieve the pictures via a memory card reader was a nightmare. 95% of the pictures were corrupted and I lost priceless photos from a family vacation.

Unless you enjoy a long, detailed account of very little happening, read another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Ramnath's playing is very lyrical and beautiful. It is quite soothing. Sometimes Indian style violin playing can be difficult and shrill. Some Indian music is quite challenging. This music is less challenging and seems to have a feeling of using folk melodies. If someone really wanted to try Indian violin for the first time, this would be a wonderful disc.The recording quality is fine and will not disappoint most listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow... Better than I expected!","review":"I purchased this book a whim and I am glad I did. The story was interesting and I liked how Ms. Rae keep me guessing until the last few pages of who the \\"bad guy\\" was(esspecially since I never would guessed) which for me makes a truly excellent romantic suspense novel. I really wish the romance had of been a bit more focused/detailed however my only complaint is the fact that the two lead charcters never talked about Elizabeth's issue with Drakes's job or about her lie of omission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!!!","review":"I enjoyed this book so much I could not put it down!

It requires you to have the original book to work along with it.Get the REAL book which also includes the exact SAME exercises that are featured in the companion, with the exception being the companion includes loads of empty space for you to be write in.So, get the REAL book and get a cheap journal to write in those exercises (instead of this costly, redundant workbook), and leave this companion on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soiled fabric right out of the Box Twice!!","review":"I bought this cover and the fabric was soiled, like it was contaminated and it wouldn't wash off. I exchanged it and got the second was soiled also. (Same Thing)I just returned it and got my money back. I can't believe these people don't look at the items before they send them out,especially after one has been returned for the same problem. They act like we are just suppose to accept it when it is a brand new item. Keep making this crap overseas with poor quality. They will probably just restock it send it back to another customer. Bad service. At least check your stock to see if they are all like that and get rid of the bad ones. 2 in a row that were bad.

Not Great.","review":"This light is not bright enough even for the tiny under the stairs closet I put it in.

The other is still working."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Garrity vs. the Hipe","review":"I bought this light and the Hipe 3 To provide more light for nightly bathroom trips than the standard nightlight and to save the energy from flipping on the overhead light. This one is considerably larger than the Hipe with no more light, maybe less. It's also heavier and promptly fell off the wall we attached it to. You can click it on. An advantage is that you can set the amount of time it stays on. The Hipe is more sensitive to movement turning it on, but it goes off very quickly, and there appears to be no way to set it to stay on longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for 12 hours.","review":"I gave this 2 stars because it did work when I got it, and if it had continued to work, it might have been a good product.I followed instructions, and hung it under my stairs, where it is very dark usually. I set the timer so it would go off after a couple minutes and left it alone. Light went off, I'm assuming the timer worked.Next day I went to look under my stairs and I tapped it - it flickered but didn't come on. I repeatedly tapped it and it sometimes would flicker on/off but would never come on and stay on. I'm not going to bother to send it back because of postage. I instead picked up a $15 floor lamp at IKEA and it's doing the job just fine.When it worked, it was bright enough to see by, though I wouldn't recommend it for a closet or other area where you need to be able to discern differences in details like colors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much light, need to have specific use","review":"This light is not good for general lighting ... it may work for a very specific lighting need but doesn't even do much good for even relatively small spaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"This is very cheaply constructed, feels like it will fall apart. After about 3 uses, batteries needed to be replaced. It works when it wants to, usually have to tap it (hard) several times before it will come on. It is bright enough for back corner of my clothes closet, but definitely CANNOT be used as additional lighting. This is strictly to help illuminate a pitch black area for safety/ easier navigation, it will not give you bright light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, BRIGHT, portable light","review":"THis light is great for my attic. I recently installed an attic ladder and some planking to use my attic for storage space and I didn't want to hassle with the wiring for an electrical light fixture.

Two of these give me all the light I need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very bright, very useful, but not very warm light","review":"This light is very bright for a battery powered tap light. The timer feature is a nice touch, and the ability to disable it is better still. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that the light has stong bluish tint to it. I don't mind, but others in my house do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I needed a replacement headlight for the old style Step 2 toddler train bed. The light that was in it had batteries that leaked and there was no way to fix it. I called Garrity and asked for the dimensions. It came quickly and was packaged with Duacell batteries. It worked perfect for my application. It slid right inside the hole perfectly. It has a thumb wheel adjustable timer of up to 5 minutes. It is bright...a bit blue but not over so. My daughter loves that she can tap the light on the front of her bed now. it's a 5 out of 5 for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great when it works","review":"Worked great for 2 months.

The style of writing got extremely annoying after about two chapters. I only finished because 1) I had a few bucks invested in it; and 2) I'm from St. Paul and the places and events were of interest. With a subject as serious as this I feel the author could have handled the material in a much more adult manner; as it was I felt like I was reading a jr. high school diary. And not that well written a diary either. Sorry..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes a Critic","review":"I heard this book & author discussed on Garage Logic: Rave reviews.

I felt connected with the characters and think about them a lot- even though I am done reading it. I see Gretchen and Cal and Sandy and Lola in my own school and can learn from their experiences. This book is easy to understand and relate to. It is a very quick read. West is able to translate common looking situations into life lessons. Streetcars is also a funny book that all high school students can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"Very good book with unexpected twists and turns. Once I got started I didn't want to put it down. I will definitely look for other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read!!","review":"Until They Bring The Streetcars Back is a good thiller. The first 50 pages are kind of slow but after that the action picks up. West uses setting very well in this book and he even tells you how if the setting was different that the whole story would be different. This book is not a fairy-tale but it teaches a great lesson of life. It gives you the taste of the real world. This book will get you emotionally involved, which makes it all the better to read. So if you are looking for a good read, I stongly recommond this book. And if you grew up in the Twin Cities you maybe able to relate to the setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoopie!

I think that this video is very good for begginers or intermediate dancers who have not studied Egyptian style. With that mentioned, it would have been a great additive if she could have shown what makes Egyptian dance so unique...say from Lebanese or Turkish or Greek or just plain belly dance. i wanted to grasp that element of it. I see a difference in music, costume, and style...but i would have liked to have had it explained more in the style. that will be in another video i come upon someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packed with Information","review":"This DVD was not quite what I was looking for, but it has a lot of information about Baladi Style Dance. It would suit someone interested in teaching this style of dance, as it gives a good grounding in the musical origins and stucture of this style. Worth having if you want to move past just learning routines."},{"rating":"1","title":"More about arabic music than dance","review":"The dancer seemed very knowledgeable,however, the video seemed to be more about learning about Arabic music and Arabic rhythms than about bellydancing techniques.

The practice section has been the most valuable teaching tool. I have learned so much more from this dvd than any of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this one was a major disappointment.","review":"I guess this movie proves that you can have two terrific stars and still have a flop. There were so many things I found irritating about the story. First, Gable's character's attitude toward the heroine's flying abilities like a pat on the head and a smirk. Yes, I know it was a product of the times, but still it made me dislike his character. Not to mention the terrible racial slur in the end of lets fool this African tribe with our so called 'magic.' Despicable. Most times I can handle racial slurs of the time, but this was just too blatant and ridiculous. Gable usually can make any character likeable, but by the end of this film I was wishing Myrna would kick him to the curb."},{"rating":"2","title":"An historical, child's view of life in China around 1920","review":"Mei Fuh is a wonderfully illustrated collection of memories of author Edith Shaeffer's childhood in China in the 1920's. She vividly describes the sights, sounds, tastes and smells that are characteristly common to children. China in this era is quite different from the China of today and the descriptions included in this book may generate thoughtful study of the history of this period of history. I would recommend this book for a look into the unusual aspects of childhood experience in China of the 1920's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lies, lies, lies","review":"Don't get suckered into buying this book. I did, and it's not worth it. You'll be wasting your money on a bunch of offensive, racist bull. Ah, but Kola Boof is black, yes? You will say. Islamophobia runs rampant throught the book, as the author apparently has a historical axe to grind. When I bought this book it was the 2006 version, and there were a bunch of reviews about how \\"wonderful\\" and \\"amazing\\" her life has been. There is absolutely no proof to supplement any of her claims, if you don't believe me just go to wikipedia's areticle about Kola Boof and read what people are saying there. The version I got was also horribly proofread - the spelling was simply TERRIBLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ludicrously overblown cartoon","review":"The contents and style of this book are exactly like the crazed messages and \\"poetry\\" she writes--full of self-indulgent caterwauling about skin-color and mixed breeds, whom she considers of a lower order. This is not what African people anywhere in the diaspora need. She has written nothing of value to anybody of any race, and indeed needs to check into a mental health clinic and get her head examined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure what to make of this book","review":"I found this book to be full of grammatical errors, not to mention a constant rambling of how this writer has been helpless about everything in her life. She came to the US at the age of 8, yet continues to refer to herself as an African. If she is an African, where supposedly the women have no control over their destinies as she points out repeatedly in her book, then why in the world did she go to Africa alone? Not quite sure what to make of her. This woman chose to sleep with as many men as she could...oddly enough all rich, powerful men. Again, no chance of finding someone in those countries, who were not willing to finance her ostentacious lifestyle.I found that this book was full of gory sexual details, which is probably what she hoped would help sell this book in the first place, because other than that this book is about a woman, who's ability to narrate is extremely impaired.My advice: Don't even bother - total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"underwhelming","review":"I \\"bought\\" this book free for my kindle.

The author obviously doesn't re-read her own words for consistency and truth. I felt it was an insult to my intelligence as a reader, writer and as a human being."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fantastical...","review":"Ms. Boof's claims read more like FICTION than fact...a la James Frey, TOO unbelievable to be believable.A must read for anyone interesting in buying themselves a bridge, dining with the Easter Bunny and having Santa Claus play the lead in their annual psychiatric rendition of Truth or Dare.Otherwise, save your money and wait for your local library to get a copy, and hope your local librarian has better sense than to waste the budget...."},{"rating":"1","title":"So monotOnous","review":"Given the overall reviews, thought it might be an interesting read, but Ms. Boof manages to repeat herself hundreds, if not thousands of times.

Read the first couple of chapters if you must and save yourself the agony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to believe","review":"I have almost completed this diary by Ms. Boof. However, I can already say that I find her life in so many parts unbelievable; it reads like a bad soap opera plot.

If you want to read a story that is truly one that is difficult to believe, this is the one for you.

Glad it was free or I would have been annoyed at having paid even a dollar for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Kola Book, But Not My Last","review":"Kola has a rare gift for painting a picture of her words on nearly every page. I cried when she was hurt, laughed when she was happy, and felt her pain and her victory. She writes ultra hot erotic encounters, as well as devastatingly sad accounts of her rape and abuse. It's a wonder she escaped those experiences with such strength, determination, and courage. While I don't agree with all of Kola's opinions in the latter part of the novel, I applaud her fearlessness at saying exactly what is on her mind. Overall an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diary of a Lost Girl","review":"I like the author's courage and honesty. All we can do is try to be the best person we are, and Kola definitely tries to honor her mother and her father. I cry for all the lost and abused girls."},{"rating":"2","title":"African History that we desperately need","review":"Kola Boof's autobiography is gripping and breathless. I could not put it down. This book is a wealth of African history, especially about Black people on the Nile River, in Egypt and Sudan. It was really wonderful to read about black women's daily rituals and their continued connections to Queen Nefertiti and other great female rulers. As a black man, I closed this book with a whole new respect for the Black woman in America, not to mention in awe of all that Kola Boof has endured. She could not possibly be as gifted a writer as she is if she had not went through these things. Her beauty is surpassed only by her uncommon wisdom. What a shame that so many hate and despise this Egyptian-Sudanese mother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probe Lub","review":"It arrived on time and in good condition; however, I was disappointed with this product.

This CD is absolutely wonderful, in all aspects. The musicanship is impeccable and the production and sound quality couldn't be better.I picked it out to hear the Mendelssohn Piano Trio No. 2, and that piece is done so vibrantly and ecstatically that it's surely one of the best on record. Not to say that the other pieces aren't on an equally high level.I can't imagine any classical music fan, and especially chamber music fans, being disappointed with this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"We used to play in Joe's garage","review":"This is the first Jan & Dean album recorded after Jan Berry's horrific car crash. Previous Jan & Dean albums had been produced by Jan, so with Jan layed up in the hospital, Dean Torrence produced this album. He actually ended up making a minor masterpiece. But to backtrack a little, the album actually started when Dean heard a demo of the song \\"Yellow Balloon\\". Dean loved the song, and he decided to make it the next Jan & Dean single. Then he decided to record a whole album based around \\"Yellow Balloon\\", with all the songs having a \\"rain\\" theme. He even went so far as to include rain sound effects between all the songs. There were ten songs on the original album; five originals and five covers. The CD version features the complete original album in mono, plus 13 bonus tracks of stereo versions, alternate takes and backing tracks.

It is taken from a live concert in Munich, but audience noise is almost nonexistent. Klemperer is at his finest, and he conducts with total commitment to the music. The Bavarian Radio Symphony also plays spendidly for Klemperer. I would sum up this performance by saying it possesses great depth and integity, warmth, clarity, and energy. It never loses momentum. It also sounds very spontaneous and free. Klemperer plays his music straight with no overly-romantic schmaltz. He lets the music speak for itself. Don't miss this great recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good old Klemp","review":"this Bruckner 4th is very unlike his recordings with the Philharmonia it feels very spontaneous, almost improvised as they went along, a wonderful recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"This is a beautiful example of chant. I really loved this because the pieces are from the nun's singing of the Liturgy of the Hours. My favorite was the Matins reading. Of course, one might get a little more from this if you understand the Latin, but English translations of every piece can be easily found. I think the emotion and devotion evident in the nuns' voices is very beautiful and moving. This is an excellent addition to any chant collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my rice bowl","review":"I use this as my rice bowl. 1 to 2 cups of rice fit nicely in the bowl. I love the colors.

Well, they delivered big time! \\"Miracle Mile\\" is an unbelievably powerful album, much like \\"Fire and Love\\", but more polished with that same true hard metal sound and great vocals by Jamie Rowe and company.

Get this CD, trust me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for use with back yard poultry!","review":"We heard about Oxine a few years ago, and use it on a regular basis. We keep it diluted in sprayer, so we always have it ready and on-hand! We use it to disenfect the chicken coops, feed containers, waterers, bedding, incubators, as an egg dip, and more.

Unfortunately the steep, round curve of the product pushes my shoulders together too much, and ends up introducing just as many issues as it prevents.Also, while the adjustable velcro function is nice, If you happen to apply it at the wrong angle, it can take some fidgeting to get it back in a comfortable position.

I was delivered from new age and for a season I had to fight off the spirit of witchcraft so I bought this book. It wasn't what I expected but it gave me a roadmap to victory not on witchcraft in the black magic sense but in regards to the enemy trying to distract and confuse you.For example, when things get foggy and your not sure of the vision the Lord has cast for you, stay on course until you clearly see the other side. A couple hours in the prayer closet and this revelation broke me free from discouragment in ministry.It's a small book but has good information in it and shows the sources of many things that may come at you and how to overcome them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think again?","review":"This book was amazing. To all of you who think of it all as just a big lie, you're sadly mistaken. Some of you wicca people havn't yet found the true nature of this source of power you're dealing with.

My friend who is a Christian got ahold of this book, she read it then came storming up to me and in a very rude tone said \\"I think you should read this!\\" I began reading it but I found it extremely offensive, I am a Wiccan practitioner and Our one law says \\"And it harm none, Do what thou wilt\\" In other words it's against the \\"law\\" to harm somebody.The worst you can ever do, unless you believe in harming yourself, is a justice spell. Because of this books misleading content and its misunderstood perspective of Witches my friend now believes that I am going to attack her, that there are evil witches around every corner and that they all wish to eat her alive and such. I dissagree with this book to the furthest extent any Witch or regular person could possibly dissagree with anything. This book is nothing but fire kindling to my way of thinking, for a fire to burn Witches."},{"rating":"1","title":"talk about stereotyping and miseducating!","review":"I haven't read this book. i don't want to. but as a practicing wicca, i find it very disturbing that someone could write a book about wiccans, and claim we attack people...if this person had done their research, they would have known that wiccans do not do magick to hurt people..we believe in the law of return, so attacking people wouldn't be wise...i'm very hurt that people still think wiccans are evil..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOK OF HATRED AND INTOLERANCE!!!!","review":"This book is nothing but a tool for those with hatred and intolerance in their hearts.Don't waste your money or your time with this book.

The spirit of Witchcraft is to create benefit for self and others. It is to live in peace and harmony with one another and nature.

It's books like this that make parents skeptical on whether or not a teen witch is good! Sure, there are those \\"power hungry\\" witches out there, but not ALL of us are!

The rubberwood playing board (rubberwood is an environmentally friendly renewable resource) and glass \\"stones\\" make for a feel of quality while playing the game.Game play is relatively simple. Equal numbers of black, white and clear \\"stones\\" are put into a bag, and players take turns drawing from the bag and placing the stones on the board. The catch is that one player is trying to make three-in-a-rows with black stones, and one is trying to do that with white stones, and they are forced to play each other's stones strategically and defensively to protect their own potential rows and keep the other player from building theirs. The clear stones can be played as either color (or both colors!) and add another twist.This game is as clever and fun as it is attractive, and it is sure to be a hit in your household."},{"rating":"2","title":"a different twist","review":"Lining three stone up in a row might not seem to take much thought and then..., you realize that you only get to play next to the last piece played, you might not be playing you own colored game piece and that you are having a lot of fun!This is a ver inovative game that makes you think as your play.It is fun for gamers of all ages.Another nice aspect of this game is that the game board is sturdy, solid wood and built to last, although you are given extra game pieces should you lose them all they would be simple to replace and the game is easy to learn though not as simple as it might seem to play!Great fun. My daughter (age ten) and I (age 57) love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Birthday Gift","review":"I bought this game for my granddaughter's 7th birthday. We had more fun playing the game than I thought we would. It is a game of strategy and planning what the other person might do to block your moves.

I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book!","review":"I read this book after my infectious disease attending recommended it. It is absolutely fascinating. I could not stop reading the book! Not only is the material Informative, but Shilts extensively researched his sources and created this stunning piece of investigative writing.

It will be required reading for a wide variety of college courses (if not already).What is especially poignant about reading the book now is the somber knowledge that its author later died of the disease himself.

While this book has become a major read for those who are into \\"victimhood\\" the sad truth is that Shilts is far more guilty than any of those he condemns in this book because he was the one who transmitted the virus, not the owners of the baths he paid money to in order to have his night of fun and ultimate death.Shilts was sick in more ways than one when he wrote this and deserves condemnation rather than praise.

This book gave more then that. It gave me insight on the theories and rationales on the topic.The coverage extended somewhat beyond financial risks, giving background on risk management to an organisation as a whole.The structure of the book was easy and logical, first part being the background and theory or risk management as a whole, part two detailing into the maths of risk management, and the last discussing control processes.One lacking part (which I was looking for) was that it did not discuss in detail the business processes themselves. I may have over expecting it, but the topic seem to have missed out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!","review":"Christopher Culp definitively combines a thorough reference work on company-wide risk management with a sweeping discussion of the best hedging practices. Since this is also a textbook, you'll find the kind of math that would make even Einstein sweat. But, as the author notes, he's written this book for senior managers, so you have a note from the teacher that you can skip the math and statistics if you have a staff for that. Instead, apply your executive thinking skills to absorbing Culp's excellent lessons in risk management theory and practice. We recommend this book to senior managers and directors - in other words, any executives who create, implement or supervise risk management strategies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"Culp integrated the corporate risk management puzzle with great ability. With a solid theoretical background and valuable pratical insights, this easy-reading book is worth every dollar it costs - a positive NPV for sure. But it is far from an introductory text.

Gooding after causing the mistrial of his guilty client, is disbarred and tries to write a book to get by at a home he inherited from his father. He is tempted by a book offered to him to critique by an elderly man that dies shortly after that. What ensues takes many twists and turns that keep you guessing. It is ashame the transfer from the film to DVD was done in such a poor manner. Sterling Millenium Series should be avoided if this is the type of DVD quality they produce.

I found this book to be very poor in terms of usefullness of the contents. It was all fluff and appeared to be aimed, at best, toward management level people who don't have the competence to make factual based decisions on equipment purchases. It not only did not provide facts or data, it didn't provide many clues about how someone trying to make a decision would go about fact based decision making with respect to EDM.

While the picture quality is excellent, the coverage of each race is maddeningly inconsistent with in several cases the pivotal action being left out. The other 60 minutes is taken up by video tours of the participating countries (in most cases they used the exact same footage from previous year's DVDs) and the obligatory camera onboard lap which again differs little from previous years.

Her stab at combining pop and opera just doesn't cut it. I don't know if it's because her music selections were poor, I am no expert, I just am a HUGE fan of the pop/operatic genre. Her voice and the songs didn't really come together with that powerful dynamic combo that sends chills down the spine. I suggest Sarah Brightman who has pretty much domniated this genre, and also a less well known artist that I love named Laura Turner. I am always searching for new or obscure artists that perform in this category, and when I did discover Emma, I was disappointed. She was anticlimatic from what I was already listenning to.

Some people have compared this one to \\"Give out but don't...\\" but I think it sounds more like \\"Evil Heat\\" without the electronics and drum-machines.There were no surprises or great musical moments on this album, just ordinary straight-foreward rock. Sure, songs like \\"country girl\\" and \\"99th floor\\" were pretty catchy, but nothing special. Not what you'd have expected after a four year long wait. This music could have as easily been composed by \\"the Hives\\" or some other \\"alternative\\" rock band.Also the lyrics and vocals were sometimes very cliche.

Well, this is one of those albums. I'm not sure what it is about Primal Scream that every other album strikes me as a stinker but they do have a propensity for erratic work product. While this effort is at least inoffensive, it is also uninspiring and ho hum. It's a great party tape so long as you are at the party with the artists, if you knows what I means.

For the first several months it was AWESOME. I liked it because it did everything, and it was all wrapped up in one system. However, less than two months after I bought it, the store stopped carrying it, and wouldn't tell me why. Not surprising because about four months later, it started giving me problems. Average DVD's, which would be read just fine on any other player I could find, were said to be unreadable. I get this obnoxious message telling me \\"this type of disc cannot be played.\\" I found that if I opened and closed the drive enough times, it would finally read and show the movie. Now, less than a year later, I have to buy another system if I want something reliable. Never again will I fall for something that sells itself as \\"all in one\\" because if one part goes wrong, you lose the whole system."},{"rating":"1","title":"All-in-one didn't last long!","review":"I owned this system for only a year when it started malfunctioning.

Rather, it provides extensive information on the people, history and sights of Portugal. In addition, the information is splendidly presented with vivid photographs and succinct coverage of all the major cities and sights, and even some remote locations. After paging through this book one almost feels intimately knowledgeable with Portugal's history and culture.If you are interested in finding a great place to stay or eat I would recommend looking elsewhere.

Typically downloads begin at 200k/s then immediately slow to 21k/s.After spending 4 hours on the phone with technical support the technician told me to return the router. Amazon gladly took the router back and even sent me a replacement via 2-day shipping!The replacement router has the EXACT same problem but Linksys has no clue about what might be wrong...Sorry Amazon but this one is coming back too!*By the way, I am a network admin so I am pretty familiar with networking.*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete rubbish, do not buy","review":"Quite simply, this product does not work as advertised.

Linksys has:-asked me to make scores of shot-in-the-dark changes, none of which fixed my problem-sent me 4 different firmware versions (2 of them beta), all of which slightly changed the problem without fixing the problem.-asked me to diable the firewall in an attempt to fix VPN (this is like taking your car to the dealer with a broken engine and them removing the transmission as a solution).-asked me if (this is the best) I have tried any of the other RV-series routers to see if they work.

So, IE won't look at it because it doesn't like the certificate. Firefox and Chrome will log in (after warning) and although you can see and operate the navigation structure, there is no content so you can't do anything with it. Searching for answers to this problem reveals hundreds of angry and frustrated posts about this product - something I should have done before purchasing it.

The replacement unit had exactly the same issue. It looks like those routers have serious MTU problem, which cannot be configured properly whatever it manual or auto configuration option.

The entire movie is a Filmmaking 101 lesson - how not to make movies. It's a shame that good actors such as Jason Biggs and Isla Fisher were used, abused rather.There's usually a reason for not releasing movies in the theater, and this movie rightfully set on the shelf for two years before getting a straight-for-DVD release last week.

Anasma seamlessly combines two very different styles of dancing in a way that is easy to understand and learn. Whether your style is more for bellydancing or hip hop, Anasma shows you how to approach the other one. Her methods are fluid, graceful, and beautiful and she explains how you can make yours the same. Just watching the demonstrations makes you feel like you can do whatever she can, but the intricacies of the choreography don't leave you bored too quickly. The drills are quick enough to do a few daily and the menu makes it easy to customize your learning process. The dvd is professional, simple, and well laid out. It takes a little imagination to adapt this style to club use or anything besides performance, but the effort is well worth it.

The reference to god and how those who did not believe had a change of feelings. Was nice to see in a movie although I feel it may have been over done just a little That's why only 4 stars.

It is horrible. This film is full of people who can't act. The script is just atrocious. The premise: is there one? The disappearing woman who wears lip gloss in a color way to young for her. The pregnant woman who delivers in the Mayan temple...Why was SHE added in the mix?The rescue worker who was in dire need of a shrink LONG before this 'event' happened.

The game is tedious, repetitive (basically you buy things and resell them for more, period), and endless. The pieces are badly designed and unplayable (not enough space on the board to fit all pieces, game pieces are falling). It's all about money changing hands all the time, often in the same amounts, so you are constantly giving each other the same pieces of paper. Only educational value is to count numbers in the thousands and make change. My estimation is that it takes more than 3 hours to finish a game, but became boring after 30mn.

In this volume, we learn a lot more about Inu-Yasha personally. The first story arc deals with a little problem of Inu-Yasha's that occurs at every new moon ^_^;. I don't want to give it away, but I will say that his gentler, more sensitive nature is revealed. In the second story line we learn a lot more about Inu-Yasha's *real* relationship with Kikyo.This book was fantastic. Takahashi really knows how to tug at your heart strings. She's been called the \\"Queen of Romantic Comedy,\\" but my name for her is the \\"Jane Austen of manga.\\" Like Jane Austen, she writes tender love stories that involve you to the very end.

A pity; consign it to that list of Opera d'Oro sets to be wary of - very much for the devoted Donizetti completist or die-hard fans of the two singers in question.

Already I have been confused by the incongruence between the recordings and the book, answers in the back of the book that seem to contradict the lessons, and poor organization of the information on the page, especially for visual types like me, the book is a mess! Also, there are apparently two different Welshes - northern Welsh and southern Welsh. The two Welshes use different common expressions and words. This book throws it all at you at once, and it's too confusing to try to separate whether you are speaking northern or southern. It would have been much better to concentrate on one at a time.I think this could be a good program with better editing - perhaps they will update."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant \\"pirate\\" sound","review":"I loved the Met broadcast of Fedora with Domingo and Scotto in the lead roles, which I have listened/watched over and over on TV via DVD. I like the music in this opera so much I decided to invest in a CD of Fedora that I could listen to while sitting at my computer. From the first few notes, I found the sound of the orchestra playing the overture appallingly bad. But I wanted to cover my ears when Renato Tebaldi started singing.... and I could go on.....Wish I had taken the time to read the other review which mentioned this is a pirate recording. Ugh.

It is authentic, inspiring and a pleasure to read and own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such depth!","review":"Jan Karon's little gem, \\"Patches of Godlight\\" is a remarkable book. This insightful author has selected some fine passages from the the magnificent writings of G.K Chesterton, C.S. Lewis, Thomas a Kempis and many others. What makes this book such a pearl is the simple fact that quotations contained within it deal in great depth with living as a follower of Jesus. Something that impressed me most is that this is not just a book for Christians who live lives of pure comfort, but for those who struggle with many issues of faith. Although this book contains short passages, you will find that they have a tremendous relevance especially in an age where people prefer to talk about the weather than about how to live a fulfilled life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, at best","review":"I have been a Mitford fan for a long time. I read the first four books in the series, and anxiously awaited the next visit with all of my favorite characters in Mitford. I have been disappointed in the last three books, and I hate this! Patches of Godlight did have some of my favorite quotes from the first books, but after several pages, it seemed to be the same thing, over and over. The 'coffee stains' in the book were not in color, which would have made the book more like Father Tim's journal. And crumbs of the famous Orange Marmalade cake might have perked it up also. I thought the book, without the dust jacket, was very nice. I am glad I was lucky enough to find this book for a very nominal price- I personally would not have spent the retail price for this one. I am hoping Karon's next book will be more like the original Mitford books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patches of Godlight","review":"Dear Father Tim,Millions of readers admire your wisdom and only wish we could make an appointment to discuss our issues.

You would also need the same company's DVD for precalculus. Another problem is that the instructor doesn't go into nearly enough depth; so unless you already have a solid background in college algebra, you will not pass the CLEP test without a much more rigorous course of study than is possible with these DVDs alone.However, this is a great product if you simply need to review, or if you want to supplement your readings by watching a real person explain the concepts and work through example problems for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider what a brave effort this was...","review":"Ok - you've got one of the most over-the-top progressive mid-70s bands in history containing in their catalog mammoth concept albums full of endless songs and then... the 80s hit. Somehow they managed to get a recording deal with IRS and release Camera Camera. Considering all the factors this album is a landmark! The songs have a slight edge, are shorter, but still have cool arrangements and, of course, the greatest female voice in history -- Annie Haslam. I just put it on after probably 15 years and I loved it. I saw them a few times back in the early 80s when they were promoting this album. And let me tell you right now -- they rocked. They seriously rocked. What a great trio Dunford, Camp, and Haslam were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad sad sad","review":"That this previously progressive and interesting band would try to artificially cram themselves into an 80's pop pigeonhole is just sad.

The results are hardly compelling, but not quite as dreadful as you might think.\\"Camera, Camera\\" contains more than its share of filler, but also contains some genuinely catchy pop moments such as the shoulda been a big hit single \\"Bonjour Swansong.\\"But on the whole this is not an impressive chapter in the band's career.

I'm not sure what all the people that gave this rave reviews were seeing that I wasn't, but I think I watched this all the way through without once laughing or being frightened. The premise is similar to that of countless slasher films over the years: tragedy happens at remote camp, killer is never apprehended, years later more hapless boobs return to same remote camp, only to be fodder for aforementioned \\"never apprehended\\" killer. The humor in this really falls flat, and cleverness never enters the picture. Sure, there's some gore, but nothing you've never seen before. I usually enjoy Reggie Bannister (Phantasm, etc.) but he's rather unlikeable in this and hasn't much to offer. I think from now on when I see the words \\"Cult Classic\\" on a brand new film, I will pass. 2 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a thought provoking page turner.","review":"Mr. Curley's perspective on spiritual phenomena, while highly personal, is enlightening and entertaining at the same time. There is much to think about after reading this book. In this subject area, I prefer material that poses interesting questions, rather than proposes ultimate answers. I was left with a deeper sense of mystery about our world, the human psyche and soul, and the interaction of these. A good read, and a pretty good page-turner as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in this series so far","review":"I have read the first five books in this series and I would say that this one and Ramage and the Drumbeat are the best of the five. This one has an interesting plot (involving captured post office packets) that is something a little different from the norm. Creating complex, realistic characters has never been Pope's strong suit, but I think he does a little better here than usual. The best thing about this book, however, is that there is some good action at sea and another situation that develops at the end that is very suspenseful. Another very good thing about this book is that there is not yet another new, bland romance for Ramage to get involved in. His first love, Gianna, returns and is as fiery and funny as ever. Pope's books are certainly not great literature, but they are fairly well written and make for good, light reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellant series of the great sailors of yesterday !!!","review":"Excellant series of books by this author, i am thrilled by the action, the history of these vessels and sailors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adventure","review":"I have very much enjoyed the four previous books in the Ramage series. The writing is clear and crisp and the historical background to the stories are very well research. I was not as optimistic about this particular book as it is about Post Office packets. After all, what could be slower than the mail? In fact, this story is anything but slow. It is a fast paced mystery that will take you on an sailing voyage from the West Indies to Portugal.The Ramage series is great escapist literature. This is ideal reading for the summer vacation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible recording &#65533; cough!","review":"The music, performers, delivery, and presentation (I assume) are wonderful but unfortunately, the recording is horrible - even for 1966. It sounds like there was one microphone for this recording, and that is was far removed from the stage. There are the additional annoyances of multiple microphone taps and the incredibly annoying incessant cougher in the later acts.

After achingly sitting through \\"Koko\\" and \\"Mystery,\\" I questioned whether I should read The Throat. I looked it up on here, and it got good reviews. Definitely not worth the time. I'm at the point where I've given this author all I can, and I might give up on him. Straub weaves too much events, information, and characters for you to even care about what's going on. The \\"killer\\" could be anyone in the story, or perhaps, how's this: nobody in the story. Booooring... and this was the LONGEST of the trilogy. Most of the action happens \\"off-screen\\" so to say, and your entire time reading is spent trying to piece informatin together. Try an author like Stephen King or Dean Koontz, who can be intellectual but also ENTERTAIN. The only book I've read by Straub so far that was bearable was the one he wrote with Stephen King.. \\"The Talisman.\\" (a great book--one of the best)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"I read Mystery and thought, \\"how disappointing\\", because I've read Straub before and was impressed by his wordplay. I then discovered that it was part of a trilogy and started scouting my library. I haven't read Koko (the first book) yet, but managed to get The Throat, the final book of the series.It's awful.Fifty pages into it, I was tempted to get out a pad and pen and start again, making notes of all the characters and trying to figure out who the narrator actually was in the context of the events in Mystery, to which he kept referring. The narrator claims to be the author of the events in Mystery, but had written it as fiction - he then goes on to give an account of being hit by a car (as did the major character in Mystery), but under COMPLETELY different circumstances than in the first book and... I give up. It was just far too convoluted for enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and Dull","review":"I really do not like this writer. I have read 2 of his books and afterwards I feel like my time has been wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"The agony...","review":"I endured as I tried to give this book a \\"fair shake\\". I only made it to page 80 and had to stop. For me the book was a bit dis-jointed and I found the author's style not to my liking. Perhaps, I will try to give it a second chance some other time but for now, I am moving on to folks like Koontz and Saul whose style, in my opinion, exceed that of this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A trilogy is about 100 books too short for this master.","review":"The most recent in a series (sincerely hoping to see manymore), \\"Throat\\" grabs the reader and doesn't let go.

I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"A much more interesting read than other books I've attempted in this genre (and, for that matter, than Straub's Ghost Story). I usually don't like mystery/horror novels, but picked up a copy on a lark, and found it spellbinding. The story was tight, had believable twists throughout, and featured characters that kept you vacillating between loving 'em and hating 'em. Not gory at all, just well-choreographed and clever. If his other books read like The Throat, I plan on picking up more Straub in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straub's Best is One of Suspense Fiction's Best","review":"Don't be put off by the description of The Throat as part of a trilogy; it does have ties with Koko and Mystery, but you don't need to read those to understand and thoroughly enjoy this book.The Throat presents a terrific mystery/suspense novelist at the absolute apex of his form; it's every bit as good as Harris' Silence of the Lambs -- in fact, it's better. Read The Throat, or stop calling yourself a suspense fan..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jam pays Homage to Early Who","review":"Having owned both as separate CDs, I am delighted to see both offered on one. This is an excellent cross-section of the Mod group that, at their peak, were the top group in Britain. Even though I'm American, I always appreciated the gritty back to basics the Jam offered. Clean Rickenbacker guitar chords, punchy bass and precision drumming all drip of early Who - but with a slightly rougher edge. Lyrics laden with anti-societal/parental themes - precursors to what \\"Rage ATM\\" are doing today. Definitely the best the Jam had to offer as they slowly got softer with subsequent albums. (Hmm! Just like The Who!) Well worth the buy - highly recommended!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"The book cover was very promising but what is inside is very disappointing.

While the language may be a bit difficult for teenage (14 and up) readers to plow through, the historical descriptions and politics that play out in it are wonderful. (And accurate from what little I've read of the period!) Social customs, class structures and well-worded descriptions of late medieval to early renaissance England fill her books.

Jones has added his own contemporary judgments to many of these items instead of presenting the information objectively. The book also contains numerous contradictions. For example, in one entry he claims the KKK was founded in Nashville in 1867; in another he claims the KKK was founded in Pulaski in 1866. I would certainly not give this book to someone from another state.

This CD has now gone on to be a highyly sought-after item by Streisand fans as it is now out-of-print. A few years ago I was lucky to find a copy at Wal-Mart for $1.99 in the bargain bin!The album is mostly filled with songs sung by others, but no Streisand soundtrack would be complete without a song sung by Babs. \\"The Main Event/Fight\\" was Barbra's first attempt at singing disco and in this collection there are 3 versions: the main song itself, a shorter version, and a beautiful ballad interpretation of the single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless","review":"This cd brought back many memories of a time long since past.

The oher reviewers are saying too much about the plot, which is full of twists. A great movie, with an European sensibility, which would have never gotten made in Hollywood. At 140 minutes, there is not a dull moment. A great thriller, mystery and historical WWII movie, with no CGI baloney to ruin a perfectly acted movie. The actors carry the movie. The movie is in Dutch, German and a little English here and there, but the dialogue is never too complicated to where the subtitles are inadequate. If you want to see a great action/adventure film of the kind Hollywood can't seem to make anymore with out throwing special effects at it, this is a great, great movie.

Well shot, acted, and with a view from the European occupied view this film is a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good WW2 Thriller","review":"This was quite an interesting and suspenseful WW2 drama. Set in Nazi-occupied Holland, the film follows Rachel Stein (Carice van Houten), a Dutch Jew in hiding, as she becomes involved in the Dutch resistance, eventually infiltrating the local Gestapo headquarters by seducing it's Captain, Ludwig Muntze (Sebastian Koch). What follows is a tumultuous odyssey with lots of betrayal, sex, violence, despair, humor, and even love where you would least expect it. Good guys turn into bad guys and vice versa.Personally, I'm all about graphic (female) nudity so that didn't bother me in the least, although I didn't need to see that much of Franken! Overall, I thought the film was very good although it seemed a bit scattered, and there were a few aspects that seemed a bit stereotypical and/or implausible. These are just minor criticisms though, in an otherwise enjoyable and compelling film. Four stars.Oh and I almost forgot, Carice van Houten....Yikes! If only I wasn't married my love."},{"rating":"2","title":"no spoilers listed here","review":"I'd rather just say I watched this movie twice on back to back nights as I found it quite entertaining. The sub-titles didn't distract from the plot and the set up didn't spoil the plot. You can read any review and they might spoil the story, right ? But rather than story, which is superb, its the pacing and characters that grab you and make you at times love and hate them. It's got two gristly sequences which in my mind didn't have to be so in your face. But beyond that its a story of survival and one that even when you know the answer might take you on other roads to complete the screenplays idea's.

Towards the end of the movie, I couldn't stop watching it as I was curious what was going to happen next.One of the things I did like about this movie was how it portrayed some of the Dutch as collaborating with the Nazis.

And they really are only good to hold very flexible cord (like that on a computer mouse or keyboard). For stiffer cords (like lamp electric cords), they simply don't do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do what I need them to do","review":"I ordered these to protect headphone cords in backpacks, and that is what they do. They are SMALL, but I KNEW they were small. Like another reviewer said--about the size of a mini donut. They do seem that they will not take years of abuse, only because the plastic on the top seems flimsy, but thus far, it's fine. For just over a dollar each, it's a good purchase. AND It does keep my headphone cords tied up and neat in my backpack which is why I got them in the first place. My son likes it for his pocket. He now keeps a set of headphones in his pocket for his iPod touch which he uses at work. At times, he needs the audio, but the theatre is no place for audio when it's not needed, so this worked well for him at work. AND like he said.....it doesn't scratch his iPod either. All in all, we liked it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful But Small","review":"These work as advertised, but as others have commented they only work for small diameter cords - even some of the longer USB cords will have a problem fitting in here. That said, they work well on an appropriate length and diameter cord. They'd be perfect if they were an inch in diameter larger - but they aren't. I'd also prefer that the set would come in one solid, neutral color rather than having the back of my desk look like a kaleidoscope.

The follow-up LPs of the Damned, Slaughter & the Dogs, Dead Boys and the Jam were frowened upon at their initial releases. Today, however, those albums ARE good. But the Adverts' second effort was a terrible album in 1979-and it's STILL terrible! It's not even a rehash of their great debut \\"Crossing the Red Sea\\". It's just poorly produced early techno pop recorded by a sleep-walking band. Time was not kind to this forgettible album & never will be. Even die-hard fans of \\"Red Sea\\" should miss this one.(However, decent versions of a few of these songs can be found on the Adverets' \\"Peel Sessions\\" CD.

I don't think, however, that many customers are going to enjoy the movie due to the dialogue and speech patterns common to,particularly, the Cork area. Good story line, and very consistent with the history of that time. A better movie for the american audience is the one about 'the big fella' Collins, with Liam Neeson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"I was greatly affected by this film, and though I do not know much about Ireland's history, I liked the way the story was told: by a small group of people mostly from the same village. We see the national events through a handful of characters, and the movie covers the Irish War of Independence, and the immediate Civil War after a treaty was signed with the British. Cillian Murphy is brilliant along with his co-stars, there is courage and stark vulnerability in each performance. The role of the English was definitely not a surprise, as throughout medieval and modern history they oppressed the Welsh, the Scots and the Irish brutally. I don't want to give away the plot, but I thought it was a masterpiece, dramatic, harrowing and very realistic. This is definitely a film that should not be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely enjoyable","review":"An hour into it, I was barely maintaining enough interest to continue watching this movie when I distinctly heard the director yell \\"Cut!\\" at the end of a scene. I did a rewind a few times to confirm what I heard. How could you leave this in your movie?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Accurate Portrayal","review":"The film makers went at lengths to make this an accurate portrayal of what life was like circa the 1922 treaty. This film has a lot of heart and feeling. It has its violence as to be expected, but the makers did not glorify it to try and sell the movie. It was done with tact and their point made. The commentary is great as they explain a lot of history through an unabated story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wind that Shakes the Barley","review":"Excellent movie on the Irish Civil War, though very violent there is very little blood shown. The director concentrated on the acting and the scenery and not on the latest over the top special effects."},{"rating":"2","title":"the wind that shakes the barley","review":"Well costructed with fine acting . Could have benefited from more editing, a little too long"},{"rating":"1","title":"Art or propaganda?","review":"Paul Laverty has produced a sensitive script about the relationship between two brothers who end up on different sides of the civil conflict in Ireland during the struggle for independence in the early 1920s. Unfortunately director Ken Loach has taken such an extreme pro-communist position (very few Irish at the time were communists) that the whole story becomes distorted into propaganda. A very sad waste of a good film. Extremely violent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wind That Shakes the Barley","review":"The Wind That Shakes the BarleyExcellent movie and seems to be as true to life as you could see in a film. It presented the conflicting emotions of the people at that time in a very realistic way. The film made the historical events of the time seem much more personal and therefor the pain, suffering, sense of loss and triumph much more real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ireland's internal political turmoil","review":"It is always exciting to see a new way of describing Ireland's complex relationship with the British government. This film is set in 1920s when local Irish men organize themselves in the fight against the British military forces policing the civilians. The goal of the resistance is to get full independence that would allow Irish nation to have it's own government, economic policies and educational system and courts. Film felt as it was dragging on. Characters were poorly developed and there simply was not as emotional force to it as I have expected. If you really wish to see a movie about the complex political time of that period, mixed with complexities of the relationship between upper and lower classes of the Irish own society, skip this movie and watch \\"The Last September\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shows the criminal British as they were","review":"If ever one needed more convincing of British atrocities and brutalities committed against those who sought freedom, look no further. As the saying goes, the British should always remember Irish history, the Irish should forget it. Superb acting, very understated. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality video","review":"We tried to stream this video to our TV via ps3. It usually works very well. The first three times we tried it wouldn't even play. When it finally did play the poor quality of the video was so annoying we finally just gave up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful movie","review":"A story description has been written about this movie. I just wanted to add my 2 cents. This movie was recommended to me by an Irish lady while touring Scotland and Ireland. I have waited almost 2 years for it to show up here in the USA. A powerful and strong story of the fight for freedom in Ireland not unlike our own fight for freedom. The landscapes are beautiful and the characters ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent in European PAL format. Can't watch.","review":"I got this through an Amazon approved seller, Movie Mars. It doesn't play. A message shows up on my screen that I am unauthorized to watch this video and to consult the owner's manual. (The same message also shows up on another movie from Movie Mars, Apt Pupil.) I checked the label on the discs and the label reads that it is PAL (European) format. This won't play on an American DVD player. I contacted Movie Mars, the approved seller. They told me it won't play because I purchased it as \\"Region 2\\". I can't find anything in their description about PAL format, or Region 2. They will refund my money providing I pay the return postage!! I'm done with Movie Mars and am extremely disappointed in Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent depiction of a painful part of Irish history","review":"I found this to be a beautiful film, about a painful part of Irish history. I had an great uncle who what killed by the Black and Tans. I have to admit, I was not that familiar with this time period. I felt a great sympathy with the oppression they had to deal with, and the film gave an insight of what has shaped the Irish character. It also, made me understand, the character of my family of Irish heritage.I have to admit, I had to watch this twice, in order to make sense of the Irish accents. When I suggested, my mother watch this, she said the accent was very similar to my grandfather, who had passed away before I was born. He lived in Ireland during this period of time, so I would say it was a very authentic film.This film really struck a chord with me, maybe because of my Irish heritage, but I would recommend it to anyone who would like to get a sense of the real Irish struggles, through this very authentic depiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Film!","review":"An inspiring and amazing film about the Irish uprising in 1920. The film was superbly done in everywhere but it's very violent. The violence, considering what the film is depicting, seems necessary however. For those not familiar with Irish history, keep in mind that it's an Irish film and limited background is provided. I'd suggest reading up on wiki or taking a knowledgeable friend with you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and deep","review":"A powerful film based in the brutal reality of early 20th century Ireland and the struggle for independence. The major problem? Without a good background in the struggle for Irish independence,the major players of the time, and the prevailing attitudes of the period, it may be difficult to grasp the fuill meaning of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish it was better","review":"We began to watch this film and had to stop it after about 20 minutes.We had a hard time following the dialog due to what could be classified as poor audio. Some stuff appeared to be mumbling.We also got a bit sick of the constant use of the \\"F\\" word. I know the British soldiers back in the day probably had some really salty language. But come on 7 times in less then one minute is a bit much.The violence although likely realistic got a bit much as well.So if they had a stronger pull in the beginning and a bit better film making skills used we might have stayed a little longer to watch it.I was hoping for a fulfilling film that gives light to the conflicts of moral values, need and desire for independence and the war that ensued.I'll definitely have to be careful with unrated films in the future.I'd say spend your time instead reading 1972 by Morgan Llywellyn.1972: A Novel of Ireland's Unfinished Revolution (Irish Century Novels)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Wind That Shakes the Barley","review":"I couldn't get past the beginning of this show.

I was finally able to see this movie after waiting anxiously since it took Cannes. I was not disappointed. I went with my husband who is not the fan I am and he was impressed as well. The acting is superb, even the flubs, and the photography, (and, of course, Ireland)is stunning. What I would most like to interject into the reviews is that the movie was an exceedingly accurate representation of the Irish situation as it was at that time. (Though I liked the movie Michael Collins, I could not say the same about it in its details.) I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to understand the various sides to the issues which the Irish, the British, the pro-treatyites and the Republicans confronted at that time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal but honest and necessary","review":"anyone who ever said 'gee why do the irish hate the english people so much?' ought to see this film. to those who lived it - some of my relatives - the thuggish behavior by the black and tans and other british soldiers turned loose to \\"teach the irish a lesson\\" is a disgrace that's yet to be appreciated over here. it's a stain on british history that the english government treated a proud and free people like this - but then, they did the same to every colony didn't they? american patriots who are proud of OUR revolution against england would do well to watch this and appreciate the irish version of the same thing"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Troubles\\" in a Nutshell","review":"The Wind That Shakes the Barley is an outstanding nutshell review of \\"The Troubles\\" which plagued Ireland during the waning days of British colonialism. The story is a poignant expose of British cruelty in its attempt to subjugate the Irish people. However, the film is equally poignant in its examination of the internal strife between two brothers, both patriots in their own right, who share a dream of Irish independence, but each choosing divergent paths, directing them on a collision course with destiny. The movie is both disturbing and endearing, and leaves the viewer with a better understanding of the true price of freedom."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wind That Shakes the Barley","review":"A superb movie of tough days in Ireland - wonderful acting - great and captivating action and scenes.

It was released in the UK, but not in the North American DVD format. It was finally released in 2007. I finally received it and LOVED it. They could have chosen to show the extreme brutality of the Brits towards the Irish Catholic, but they left it at a minimum (on purpose). The director did not want the \\"violence\\" to be the story. Granted, there are a couple cringing parts to the film, but the director could have shown some of the more of the documented types of torture and abuse on the Irish Catholics. Note- This movie truthfully has no \\"good guys\\" in it. It was people that had a job to do, as bad as it may have been. Granted, I lean towards a side and the movie does as well. Overall, I would highly advise getting this film even if you have just a drop of Irish blood in you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wind that Shakes the Barley","review":"Unbelievable movie of the Irish Revolution.

All three versions reveal a gorgeously sung, dramatic characterization. This recording, however, has the worst sound of any Opera d'Oro I have heard, and that certainly puts it in a (low) class by itself. Not to beat a dead horse, but it sounds as though the microphone were being held by an audience member with whooping cough sitting in the middle of the orchestra pit. The rest of the cast seem adequate but no match for those on either of the commercial recordings.

Here her singing is much more exciting than on the VHS tape of a production in English, and her French is exquisite. Corena is a classic Sulpice, Hirst sings all of the high C's without strain, and Greenspon hams it to the hilt.

If you are the kind of person whose mood is improved by hearing four bars of \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" followed by a tiny slice of \\"Do Nothin Till You Hear From Me,\\" then you will enjoy this cut. I found it most annoying.There is no reason to listen to this instead of a real Duke Ellington album, such as Far East Suite, or Early Recordings, or the Blanton-Webster Band. There you will not hear a single cliche, and the soloing will be much better as well.

As with the other two it also ranks as a great book without any comparison to others. Not much else to say. I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Country/Bluegrass music","review":"Well make that country, bluegrass, folk, you name it. These ladies cover a wide range, which makes for a great album. This is one of the few country bands being really innovative. It's nice to see artist crossing boundaries in the name of good music. My favorite off this CD is \\"Real As A Dream\\" but their cover of \\"If I Needed You\\" is fantastic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"This book is not what I'd expected. Expecially from the reviews its gotten. I have VC++ and right off the bat I couldn't even get the 1st example to work.

I've been waiting a long time for this DVD. Why NFL films released the histories of the Packers and the Cowboys before the Raiders is beyond me. The important thing is it's done...it is going to be awesome. The 2003 Raiders Season dvd was pretty good..you know this one will rock. If you are a serious Raiders fan, or if you are a Chiefs or Donkeys fan who wants to learn something about winning....buy this DVD! GO RAIDERS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love 'em or hate them","review":"This is a Raider Fan's \\"Must Have\\" DVD! From the history to the memorable moments, it's all here. For the younger Raider Fans, this also shows the history of the Raiders and you'll see why Raider Fans are notorious for being the most loyal. As a 30+ year fan, it brought back many memories for me and to have it on DVD and not wait for it on ESPN Classics or NFL Network is a real treat. I definitely loved the \\"Old School\\" Raiders where crying was not allowed the rules allowed football to be played the way is was meant to be....\\"Man to Man\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must-Have\\" for any Raider fan out there","review":"This is two DVD's packed full of Raider highlights starting from the first year in the American Football League up to their last Super Bowl appearance two seasons ago. Special features include pieces on John Madden, Lyle Alzado and George Blanda. Disc 2 has the 1997 playoff game against the Baltimore Colts in Baltimore along with features with rivals like Pittsburgh, Kansas City and Denver. This DVD you will never get tired of watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed, full games are better. I have them","review":"I agree that just watching highlights of classic games does the game no justice at all. You need to see the entire game, the ebb and flow, the momentum changes, the crowd, the blocks, the power run on 3rd and 2 that kept a touchdown driving going, etc. to fully appreciate the game. I have just about every classic Raiders game in its entirety. The Ghost to the Post game, the Holy Roller, the Super Bowl wins, classic games against the Dolphins and Steelers. Email me for more information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb early 70's British \\"folk\\"","review":"A must own for Richard Thompson/Sandy Denny/Iain Matthews completists recorded in '71. RT's lead guitar dominates the record while Sandy and Iain do some wonderful harmony work. Dave Mattacks is also there as well, so this is fascinating for Fairport fans (it was for me anyway!). All the songs are excellent, with a southern California country rock feel (no doubt due to the presence also of Chris Hillman, Sneaky Pete, and Rick Roberts) that seeps in. Forgetting the star studded back up, Ellington's sweet voice, great songs, and uncluttered, sympathetic arrangements and production make this a very nice addition.Nicely put together package with lyrics, full credits and great remastered sound . The disc is on a fairly obscure label (talking elephant), so I HIGHLY suggest you get it while you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be very careful with this product","review":"I have a silky terrier that's right over 15 pounds, so I have been giving him the entire dose every time.The other owners are right. He gets very quiet and protest the application every time I put this on, however I did not have burn marks on my dog. I proceeded to use it for 2 years on my terrier. It has worked perfectly.This past September, however, zodiac finally failed me. I reapplied my dog after about 3 weeks because I thought the dosage had weakened, however, fleas just go around the area and appears to have increase in numbers. I currently have no clue if I can apply Advantage 2 on my dog because it seems dangerous to put more insecticide on him.The flea situation has not improved. It's been over a month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT put this on your DOG","review":"We tried Zodiac Spot On tick control for our small (and awesome) mutt. Within 24 hours he was shivering uncontrollably and trying to scratch the area where the poison was applied. We called an emergency vet who told us never to purchase Zodiac or other over the counter meds like this and that these reactions were very common, especially in small dogs. I regret that we did not check with our vet in the first place, but will NEVER make the mistake of putting this crap on my dog again. Thankfully, after three baths and a lot of liquids, he is doing fine.Disclaimer: I do NOT work for any vet or pet medicine company. I am a just a dog owner who doesn't want to see this happen to your dog or you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful","review":"We recently applied this to our two small dogs, both Shih tzu's. After an hour, one of them began yelping loudly, constantly twitching to get at her back to where it was applied. She can't walk without pain, and doesn't eat, sleep or drink. We've taken her to a few different vets, one of which gave her cortizone, but so far nothing has helped. However, the other dog seems to be perfectly fine, though I doubt we will be re-applying it. After looking online, several people seem to have experienced similar problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Do not waste your time or money on this product. I decided to try it because, if by chance it worked, I'd be paying $20 every three months for my three dogs instead of $50 a month for their usual Frontline. My three dogs are going back on Frontline immediately. I also tried the Zodiac Flea Collars which only keep fleas away from the neck line for a couple weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DANGEROUS, PLEASE DO NOT BUY","review":"I put this on my dog and she had a terrible reaction. I immediately gave her a bath and tried to wash as much of this off as I could. This is a very dangerous product (I now know), and has killed many dogs or made them very ill. It certainly does not help with fleas, and is a total waste of money. When I purchased this I was told it contains the same ingredients as the more expensive brands, please do not believe this, you and your dog will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this dangerous product!","review":"I was trying to save a little money and decided to use this product instead of Front-line or Advantage plus. When I put this on my dogs it seemed like the fleas became even more aggressive than they were,and it did not kill any fleas. The dogs were itching like mad and could not even sleep or sit still.I have been reading around the internet that this stuff has sickened and even killed people's precious pets. AND they use cruel testing methods on beloved companion animals which I read on the Peta site. After four weeks I spent the money on Front-line Plus and within days the fleas were all gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother.","review":"I had read review after review about how great this product was.

Just because they're Nordic and fairly photogenic, that doesn't mean they should be chosen above all the aspiring jazz trios and quartets who don't have a recording contract.I've got most of Keith Jarrett's albums, and several Lyle Mays, Bill Evans, John Taylor and Chick Corea CDs, but I have to say that I've heard several hotel bar bands that are more alive than this trio. I'm not even convinced it's jazz -- it certainly wouldn't come within the Wynton Marsalis classification of the the genre.The trio's other album is just as soporific. (And I appreciate that most other Amazon reviewers think it's great.) This is Horlicks for the soul. If you want excitement in your piano jazz, try any of the Keith Jarrett at the Blue Note box set."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Bill Evans","review":"Nice simplistic mood music...but dont metion this guy in the same breath as Bill Evans just yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tord Gustavsen trio hits 'The Ground' running.","review":"This CD has been blowing my mind for about two weeks now. I'm a big fan of ECM, I think they've been putting some really interesting jazz out there for awhile (Joe Maneri, Jan Garbarek, Charles Lloyd,Keith Jarrett, Dave Holland, etc.), and this is no exception. From the subtly glowing, out of focus album art, to the heart rending beauty of songs like 'Being There', and, 'Kneeling Down', through the slow drag of the intro to 'Curtains Aside', up to the brilliantly upbeat outro to 'The Edges of Happiness', this CD is amazing. It's solid all the way through, a perfect soundtrack for all kinds of activities, something to just sit down and let float through your mind too. Tord Gustavsen on Piano, Harald Johnsen on double bass, and Jarle Vespestad on drums. I am bowled over by this fantastic outing.Just thought I'd share. I always like to spread the good jazz around."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"The thermostat is pretty cheaply made. The knob doesn't push on easily and that piece that attaches the thermostat to the heater bends in when you try to push the knob on. I finally gave up and just stuck it on a little so I can turn it, but it will probably fall off. I needed another one and got one from a different manufacturer. The other one is a LOT better made at a slightly lower price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Superb","review":"Coming from a true audiophile, I must say that this system is the very best you can attain in its price range. The clarity is remarkable, and the power is astounding. You will truly not be disappointed in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for the money.","review":"There isn't really alot to add that hasn't already been covered by the other reviewers. This watch is really light and does all the things that it's supposed to do. I like not having to worry about it's accuracy. The solar battery is really nifty as well. The one minor problem I had with the watch was the band. Casio puts the largest one on the watch and unless you have a wrist like Hulk Hogan, the band will need to have links removed. I had no problem taking out the links myself. Instead of paying $10 or more to have a jewler do the job just take a thumbtack and push out the pins yourself. Make sure to push out in the direction of the little arrows on the back of the band. Put the pin back in right and you have adjusted the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE READ BEFORE BUYING","review":"I bought this watch from amazon and as soon as I took it out of the box, I packed it back up and sent it back. It might be a great watch with tons of cool features, but before you buy know what you are getting. The face is NOT blue, it is actually purple so don't expect a nice blue faced watch. Second the watch is massive, not face diameter, but how much it sticks off your wrist. I measured it around 3/4 inch, but am unable to find any websites with exact demensions. In any case it is not a heavy watch but a purple bulky watch, be warned!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good....doesn't work.","review":"Bought this watch to give to my husband for Christmas. The overall look is great, a little bulky, but nice overall. The watch face isn't purple in my opinion (other reviewer's mentioned this) and my husband didn't think so either. May be that I got a lemon, but the hands stopped working after two days. Tried resetting them by hand and they didn't hold time for very long. The digital time worked fine, but who wants a watch with hands that don't work. Overall I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does everything, looks nice, not too expensive","review":"The important things work. Its Solar, it sets the time automatically. So far the crystal has not gotten scratched and the case still looks pretty good. If I'm wearing the watch at night, it has problems syncing up, but works fine if I set it on the nightstand. I love how the hands spin around when you run the stopwatch. I only have a couple of minor complaints. The backlight lets you read the time, but the LCD display is in shadow, so you can't see anything there. Secondly, the little dials aren't terribly useful. In stopwatch mode, they're good for reading up to the first minute, but the power-gauge dial is used for minutes and is hard to read, and the 24-hour hand isn't used at all. Combined with the lighting problem means you can't use the stopwatch very well in darkness. After getting this watch, I've found out about a Citizen Eco-drive chronograph that looks nice, without the atomic time though."},{"rating":"2","title":"The American Band that won't quit","review":"This is a great set! It has all of their hits from 1963-65 plus one that I think is new. It is the title track to this album \\"Mojo Workout!\\". If you are a 60's fan you will enjoy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastically enthralling....it draws you in","review":"I thought is was possibly the most far-fetched but not entirely unreal and untrue take on racism and the way some Caucasians see Afro-Americans.

And I fully intend to read it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a novel, but a boring illiterate screenplay","review":"Why is everyone calling Negrophobia a novel? It's not a novel, not even a novel \\"written in the form of a screenplay.\\"It IS a screenplay. An unproduced screenplay.A screenplay with no story, no real characters. There's this white girl, Bubbles, about whom we learn nothing. The entire script is her stream-of-consiousess, a succession of surreal racial stereotypes.Negrophobia may have worked as a short story or short film, but its gets boring after 10 pages. The author makes one point: there are many ugly racial steroetypes out there. Okay, we get it after 10 pages. We get it after 40. But silll...nothing happens. No story develops. Just more stream of consciousness till the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"This book prepares you for the ACT much better than the packets ACT will give you. It has plenty of practice and great advice, you will get a higher score :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, Hot, Horny and Fun!","review":"First: this book consist almost uniquely of explicit sex scenes. Very explicit. That said, I must add that it's gorgeously drawn and coloured, and what's more that it gives you a kind of XXX comic which (however kinky - and believe me it IS kinky and then some!) is playful, funny (not idiotic though) and even sweet. Seldom I have seen before such nasty kind of sex scenes and found authentic beauty in them. Yes, the book includes various sexual practices (featuring also a transexual, sorry if that is going to put you off) and gives a wild and totally unbound wiew of sex BUT is never depressive, squallid, heavily guilt-ridden or violent as (sadly in my opinion) a lot of XXX comics still are. On the contrary it's joyous and even has some truly poetic moments (i'm NOT joking) and a good dose of clever sense of humor: check the witty op-tricks to have an idea. Five stars and then some. More like this one, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a nostalgic trip to a bleak era","review":"I can't believe no one has reviewed this yet - this is one of the best (if not the best) compilations of music from this era. The booklet is filled with photographs and information on this pivotal point in American history - socially, economically, psycholigically, and musically. Many famous artists are contained here, but in earlier stages of their careers than we have become culturally familiar with (Ellington, Armstrong). The effort to cheer up a 'depressed' nation rings through here, with a mirth and joy that we have certainly lost in these less-than-disastrous times. While a couple tracks serve better as period pieces than entertainment (Henry Ford's Orchestra?!?), this excellent collection entertains today as well as when these hot jazz and early blues songs were flowing from radios that are now antiques.Hot tip - this may go out of print, as have many other collections from Columbia Legacy. Get it before it becomes a legacy itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have read the reviews more closely!","review":"The concept of this product is good, but the design is not practical. I did not even use the product, but returned it after opening the box as the design flaws were immediately evident. While the recipes printed on the bottle are good, they are difficult to read and the markings are hard to make out for measurement purposes. The mixer part of the bottle does not reach all the way to the bottom; the gap is more than 1/2 of an inch. To serve the dressing after mixing would be too cumbersome -- you have to remove the entire top with the mixer attached to it, which would result in dripping or spillage (the seal is tight). And last but not least, it is made of cheap plastic, not glass. I do not recommend this purchase at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"pwilson","review":"I prefer the spinner to have a more substantial base to it.

Container is plastic.

However, two problems were evident after opening.1. The gears in the mixer head are not well made and don't mesh well. I could rarely get the handle to turn a complete revolution without the gears jamming up inside.2. When I was able to get the item stirring, the stir stick in the bottle wobbled wildly. This is because the bearing that holds the stir stick in the mixer head is very loose and allows the stick to wobble back and forth.Overall, a poor quality product. I have returned this for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointed--Try the Other One!","review":"My husband and I are RBD fans, and I bought this DVD noting that it was recently released and assuming it would be current. I'm not sure when the concert in L.A. actually occurred, but it's quite obvious that it took place early in RBD's career. The venue was small, the audio was terrible, there was very little staging, and the performances were so disappointing.

Ms Rowling has an unique talent for wrapping the similarities we all share in a blanket of magic and mystery.

This was a used book said to be in very good condition. Whoever read it before, could not have missed this mistake. Amazon's solution was for me to mail back the ENTIRE set for a refund.

I already had all the books in hardback and ordered this set to have copies of the books I could take to the beach or anywhere else they had a greater chance of getting damaged so it didn't seem worth it to send them back. When I received the books, there was a lot of damage to the case the books are supposed to be kept in and there is damage on the spines of almost every book.

This is a very poorly written book with stereotypical characters, thin plot elements, shallow thematic development, silly attempts at humor and about as much originality as a typical television show. It is really sad to see something like this get so much attention. If kids grow up on this sort of thing, it is no wonder that as adults they have no sense of thoughtful and well-written literature. Read this only if your idea of great literature is Robert Parker, Stephen King, or a Spiderman comic.

After all, if you weren't interested in the plots and storylines, you wouldn't be considering this item. What I will address is the fact that this collection is, hands down, the best value on the first six books of the series you will find, period! (Price at time of writing was $100) I'm a member of several book associations, and even they cannot match it. The books themselves are hardback, with excellent quality paper and high production value. The jackets all show the colorful illustrations of Mary Grandpré, and have raised lettering. The bindings themselves are library quality, and durable, with metallic lettering on the spine. It was a must have for my hardback Fantasy library and collection and, though most of my books for it have been obtained via a SFBC membership, Amazon definitely provided the best value on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest","review":"How can it get any better?

Once I started I couldn't put them down. I instantly fell in love with Harry and his friends. What an amazing world J.K. Rowling has created! These books were written for teenagers but I never felt like the writing was beneath me, even though I'm 36.

After seeing pretty adaptations of other childrens books like 'Bridge to Terabithia' and 'Chronicles of Narnia', this one was a pretty big letdown. Everyone seemed like a stock character, and I never got involved with the by-the-numbers storylines. Looked good, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was like, \\"Wha?!?!\\"","review":"I am sorry I spent all three dollars on this movie. I never read the book, nor would I. This movie was so boring and, really?, people's souls are called daemon's? Wow! Alright then, I guess whatever floats your boat. I wouldn't watch this movie again if it was free!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay adaptation of Pullman's fantasy opus","review":"This was a decent, if cursory, adaptation of \\"The Golden Compass,\\" the first book in Philip Pullman's controversial \\"Dark Materials\\" trilogy. The original print version is both innovative and tendentious -- an absorbing fantasy world built as a means for the author to exercise his strong antipathy towards organized religion. The movie glosses over the anti-religious message, although not quite to the extent I'd imagined. The condensed plotline can be a bit jumpy, but on the whole this is an enjoyable action film, with the social commentary lurking just below the surface -- it's dumbed-down a little, but still basically the same as the book. Worth checking out.

But don't just take my word for it... go do the research for yourself!Peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Cheesy and convoluted","review":"This move is basically trying to be Harry Potter, but just can't pull it off. The plot is pretty ridiculously convoluted, none of the characters are really developed all that deeply, and its basically just a bunch of cheesy CGI. (Complete with the bear from the Coke Christmas commercials) I didn't like this movie essentially for the same reason people didn't like the new star wars movies, its just all action and cheesy CGI, no real heart to it. Just a mush of wannabe Harry Potter with toned down versions of Lord of the Rings scenary, and maybe a hint or two of Magic the Gathering or World of Warcraft (Hey, the bears armor was soulbound!) I gave it two stars because I found it mildly entertaining, despite the fact I found myself still laughing more at the movie than with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip off","review":"Am I the only one who finds it ridiculous that the studios are trying to charge $35 for a film that is one third of a trilogy? The cgi are impressive but the plot leaves the viewer hanging, as does the book. Unlike the Lord of the Rings and the Chronicles of Narnia the Golden Compass really doesn't stand on its own. However, I suspect that Middle America will be very upset if the trilogy is filmed and the third episode is true to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've read the book, you'll hate the movie","review":"I have read the complete series of His Dark Materials books, including the Golden Compass. I was very excited to see this film when it came out in theaters, and even though I knew they would make the book into a children's movie - the movie was horribly disappointing. If you have read the book, you will NOT want to buy this movie.The movie is jumbled, includes characters that don't show up until later books, characters are not developed, the sequence of events is mixed up, and it's only an hour and 45 minutes.I was extremely disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little less magic","review":"Any artist that produces a work that features the theme that wicked and dour adults grind the \\"magic\\" out of children has not been in a classroom full of 14 year olds lately.

A well adaptation of the first of three books. The special effects are wonderful and the storytelling was great. I did have to watch it twice to understand most of it. The ending was left wide open, but that is understood because their will be 2 more movies to follow. Nichole Kidman does a wonderful job as a villian, and it was very well thought out to not only capture adult's imagination but children's as well. The little girl who plays the title role does a excellant job as well. The Polar Bears, especially a particular fight scene involving them, add color to a sometimes slow movie. It's no Lord of The Rings but it is far better than most fantasy movies these days . I don't believe this movie will go against any religions either, I cannot speak for the next two, but this one is fine. Just try to remember if that is an issue to you that it is just a story. I look forward to the future installments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Compass--truly golden","review":"The Golden Compass is a must see. Talented acting, extraordinary special effects, superior direction, and a story-line that is startling, poignant, and exceptional, makes this a movie that anyone can watch repeatedly, and from each viewing learn more. It is fiction, but by reading between the lines of the plot one can find a very real account of modern day absurdities, attempts at mind control, distortion of facts in favor of fantasies--even in the sacred halls of academe where a few outsiders attempt to dissuade and adulterate true research. It is difficult to wait for the sequel, but until then we do have the books which are classics that will most likely outsell C. S. Lewis and his novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I almost turned this movie off. I think they could have made a good movie. You can tell the story was based on a book with an actual plot. This movie had none of the elements of plot normally associated with a story.Unfortunately, this movie didn't even have good special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"The main problem with this movie is that I never believe what's going on. It's feels like a Narnia knock-off. An adventure for an adventure sakes. I never understood WHY LYRA. What made her so special? Even Nicole Kidman's performance is a reminder of the White Witch in Narnia. I never really understand the dust thing and exactly what they mean about it settling in their daemons. I thought about watching it again to try to understand again-but I just don't want to. My time is worth more than that. However, I suspect that the book is a lot better than this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of pretty, supremely forgettable","review":"Truly not worth the big to-do that went on with people boycotting and denouncing it when it hit theaters. It's pretty, but not pretty enough to watch just for that. The movie suddenly ends, without answering any of the many questions it raised. I'm not sure if there are movies planned of the sequels, but it seems that this would have lent itself better to a mini-series format -- but of course, there's not as much money in mini-series as there are in feature films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the book.","review":"Save your money and by the books. This is one of the most fascinating and captivating stories I have ever read. The movie just disapoints and completely leaves out the meat of the story. The movie you create in your head will be worth it. The movie had such potential, adding things that never happened in the book and leaving out key pieces just left me feeling like I wasted $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a family movie","review":"I bought this since it was listed in the kids and family section. Its clearly not for young kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Golden Compass","review":"This movie is not intended for children at least not mine, since it is about magic.

While the story is fine for the first 2 books when you get to the 3'rd it turns out the plot is about \\"God\\" being a fake and satin being the only one smart enough to recognize it...this part of the story is narrated by 2 homosexual angles. It just went too far for me and I wish I'd know that this is what the trilogy was about before I started it. Granted I haven't been able to make it to the end of the book but read 1/3 of the last book before I gave up hoping it'd turn into something good.This is a review concerning the books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Christian Cult Film","review":"THE GOLDEN COMPASS is written by Phillip Pullman, a proud athiest who belongs to secular humanist societies. He hates C. S. Lewis's Chronical's of Narnia and has written a trilogy to show the other side. The movie has been dumbed down to fool kids and their parents in the hope that they will buy his trilogy where in the end the children kill God and everyone can do as they please.

After the afore mentioned stuff you have to suffer thru, The actresses gives a speech after the likes of Al Gore to save her polar bear from \\"global warming\\". I bought the DVD to see a movie, not to hear about Hollywood's junk science agenda!Don't buy this! Hello Hollywood: stick to entertainment, not politics. I've read reviews that the classic Sci-fi movie \\"The day the earth stood still\\" is being remade but the theme is not about preventing global war this time, but Earth is going to be wiped out because we didn't take care of our environment.

(but it's comming)","review":"The movie is faithful to the book- In this movie, as in the first book, there is no talk of killing god but it is coming in the second book! The movie is prettily made. My only concern for children, is the possible sequel. The series IS about killing god, it is actually explicitly stated in the books- those who deny it are staring at white and calling it black. You do not have to be a religious zealot to see it you just need half a brain. The anti religion whiff is already in this one, but very mild. If you yourself hate god this is definitely a series for you. If you don't, you can still enjoy the special effects. As long as you are a thinking adult, aware of the antireligious undercurrents and the God hating agenda (which Pullman admits freely) you can definitely use this movie to promote thinking. For young unsophisticated children who are yet incapable of multidimensional thought, the book is cunning brainwashing; this movie is just a little dip."},{"rating":"1","title":"????????","review":"When I watched this movie at the theater I wish I could just yell out \\"START THE MOVIE OVER PLEASE!\\" the reason is: This movie was probably thee hardest movie to follow, the whole time i was just wondering what the hell was going on!

You shouldn't have to read a book to go see the movie.Sitting in the movie watching it. the Char's will say something that you have NO idea what in the world they are talking about. (and on several occasions) It makes NO sense, it has nothing to do with ANYTHING.The writers \\"Assume\\" you have read the book.We all know what happens when you Assume now, don't we?0/5 Stars for a film that makes NO sense, Will more than likely have an equally horrid sequel to it, and the highlight is when a bear fights.

The end doesn't complete the journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre effects, preachy, disconnected plot","review":"First, the visual effects were pretty weak. Think \\"Made for TV\\" movie and thats about right.Second, the story seems to stop and start. Very disjointed. You'll spend 15 minutes hiding in a cupboard listening to some drawn out monologue and then \\"a miracle occurs\\" and the heroine is in the next scene. There is little flow to the film, its almost like the scenes were their own episodes with only the thinnest transitions.Third, talk about preachy. Big bad Magisterium controls everyone and everything and is harming children only opposed by the last \\"light\\" of the world, a college. Yeah, ok. I mean we all know that colleges are beacons of enlightenment, I mean the frat parties are BRILLIANT. Come on, I'd like my indoctrination to have a modicum of sanity.Bottomline. This is one movie the kids will yawn at and parents will roll their eyes through. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"very weird","review":"well i have to say this was a very weird film. the fact that they callled their souls deamons was very odd. i do not think that the creater of the golden compass wanted to include any message that would be against god (for all you who didnt know the author of the books doesnt believe in god but i dont think he believes in saten either.)um so yeah very weird movie i didnt get the concept of dust and what it is or why the gobblers wanted to take the children and remove them of there souls was odd and that \\"cut\\" was removing the dust which i still dont get!!!!! watch the movie see what ya think but i just happen to not like this movie with a burning passion because well it is very very confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Film Adaption","review":"I read all of three books of Dark Materials. I am very much aware of some \\"adjustments\\" of artistic licence in adapting the novels to the films.After screening the film in widescreen format on DVD, I felt the film doesn't do the books any justice at all. They rearranged some of plots and omitted lot of materials just for sake of compressing the novel into 109 minutes. They could have make it 180 minutes like \\"Lord of the Rings\\". I would say next to Michael Crichton's \\"Timeline\\" this is the worst ever.Those people who adapted the novel and made the film should never been allowed to ruin our experience. The author ought be ASHAMED for allowing his novels to be corrupted this way!I hope the \\"Subtle Knife\\" and \\"Amber Spyglass\\" would be better with 180-minute length."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I looked forward to seeing this movie after reading the book.

Best said it was a huge let down from the book. Don't even bother renting this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding movie. Not for snobs, violence junkies, or dumbasses","review":"Despite some of the whining from those who really must have a hard time deciding what a good movie consists of, this is a damn good movie. It has good acting, quickening plot, tons of action and top notch CGI. Yes, you have to suspend your disbelief, just like any other fantasy epic, but once you do you are treated to a very intricate story with subtle, thought provoking undertones that carry the author's intentions admirably to the screen. So, if you want to rub your nose in the stupid, violence for violence sake crap that dominates the industry and wins awards because those who vote are sadly as dumb as those who pay money to watch, then go sit in front of \\"no country for old men\\". If, however, you would care to exercise your mind and delight your eyes and ears then get this movie, relax, and watch an excellent adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"I just don't get this movie. It doesn't make sense: the filmmakers thought that this story was good enough to make a movie out of it, but then when they did make a movie out of it, they completely changed the story! I personally watch a movie for its story, not for the pretty effects.People have commented on how it left you feeling like it was made so that there could be a sequel. Really, I don't see how they're going to make a sequel. They cut out the entire last third of the book, which included the extremely important climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass (Blu-ray)","review":"The Golden Compass [Blu-ray] This movie is a little confusing at the start. If you have read the books you will know what is going on but if you haven't I suggest watching the movie a couple times to understand it better. The Blu-ray version as usual is outstanding when it comes to the video quality. It is a good movie and it moves rather fast. I had to watch it a few times to get the gist of what was going on but once you do you will enjoy it. I hope that they make the other two books into movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden Compass","review":"This is a good movie! I read a lot about religious undertones in the book and the movie, but personally I just don't see it in the film. Anyway, the picture and sound quality are both very good if you buy the blu-ray version!It looks fantastic. Hope you all can enjoy the film like I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZING.....","review":".....Amazing how they managed to completely miss the point of the book. They took all the action from the book, but left out the important information that supports the action. The movie briefly mentions Dust at the beginning...and never goes anywhere with that idea. Never mentions anything about the religious beliefs behind Dust and its connection to children and their Daemons. I personally dont see how they can make the 2nd film....because thats what it most deals with...(atleast as far as I have read into it so far.)The movie as a movie was well made....as a book to movie adaptation it is horrible. Read the book first, then see the movie! The book is WAY better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Book, But Close","review":"After reading all three of the books on Lyra's adventures, I still enjoyed the film.The casting and characters were well done, even in the limited plotline.For those viewers with vivid imaginations the Golden compass will be a a pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to make everyone happy and failed","review":"The filmmakers tried to make 1) an original and fresh Harry Potter size franchise for the studio, 2) a film that wouldn't offend religious viewers, 3) a film that would still promote the author's atheist/anti-church agenda.1) Fail2) Fail3) FailThe result was a watered down story that appealed to no one. It felt as though the story was on fast forward for those who'd read the (much better) novel. And, perhaps to me the strangest decision of all -- probably in an effort to succeed at number two (see above) -- they didn't include the amazingly powerful closing scene of the book.Highlight of the film for me? Sam Elliott as Lee Scoresby. Perfect casting.Stardust was the better film. Wish it had had Golden Compass' marketing budget.Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"bbbbbooooorrrriiinnggggggg !!!!","review":"I cannot believe the hype about this movie. I admit, I was wary about the movie because if the author and the anti-Christian reviews. But after seeing this film, I think the real horror is that children may die from being bored to death. Where was the plot? My husband and I laughed at the ridiculous plot, weak character development, and the 80's-looking special effects. I expected beautiful special effects because of the trailer on TV and the other reviews, however, the effects for laughable. If you want a good laugh, grab a glass of wine and watch this ridiculous tale. If you are looking for a movie with a plot, search elsewhere. If you are a parent worried about the anti-Christian author - don't worry about this movie. Most likely, your children will search elsewhere for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD doesn't play in the US.","review":"Thank you for selling me a promotional screener that was NOT MEANT FOR SALE, to boot it was made for a different country and will not play on US DVD players.

I hope somehow you get fined for selling me something that was never intended for sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has originality died completely ?","review":"If great CGI is enough for you, then this is your movie. I just can't help but notice that the substance of the movie is an almost well-masked DUNE rip-off. We have brass/gadget technology, seekers, a girl whom the witches prophecied to be the one, the evil older female who denies the possibility the girl is the same one prophesied by the witches. The Egyptians are the Fremen. The dust is the spice. I could go on. Add this to the familiers via Harry Potter and a poorly written script and you've got a disaster of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This was a really bad movie.

I simply cannot imagine an adult, much less a child, wanting to sit through such tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This review is for those who hated the books but thought the concept behind it was good. If you were hoping if the story was taking through a different filter it might be good you will be disappointed. This movie was just as big of pile of rubbish as the book, if not more so. I actually lasted longer in the book than the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Audio Output On Blu-Ray Version","review":"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-Ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-Ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-Ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-Ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book","review":"This movie is all over the place.

(After all, something made director and screen play writer Chris Weitz think that this production would be worthwhile.) I never read the book, now I never will.This cinematic catastrophe is loaded with story-line gaps, an endless parade of lifeless characters, and general plotlessness. As a viewing experience, it is only mildly endurable for the special effects. What a cast! But it doesn't help. What a budget! But this movie makes Kevin Kostner's Water World look like a work of genius by comparison for all of the criticism it received in view of its titanic price-tag.I found myself nodding off and the movie made as much sense half awake as it did with my initial full attention. What a cinematic disaster. Anybody got a golden plot compass?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Golden Compass","review":"A very good movie although the ending leaves you hanging, that might be a good thing as the need to know what happens next is very pulling.

Then I watched the Golden Compass. I was grateful that it left out a lot of the banalities of the book, but then the movie ended with about a third to a quarter of book left to go.I saw the credits start to roll and I thought \\"Huh! Where's the rest of the story? WTF?\\"Other than that, I felt the movie represented the book very well. If only they had finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking fantasy with beautiful imagery!","review":"We don't own a TV, but love to watch movies on our big screen.

Thanks and we want more....more.....more!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, bad movie","review":"Good message, poorly done. I didn't see how the story was anti god at all. I'm pretty sure the book is about choice. It basically all goes back to eve and the apple if you make it through all three books. -Original sin and all that. But I'm quite sure it's just to make you think, not to bash your own way of thinking unless you want to bash how others think for themselves. The book conveys this quite well, while the movie just doesn't flow properly and seems to lack any real personality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"This movie is real dull, without much of a plot or story. The worst thing of all is that THERE IS NO CONCLUSION. A real ripoff. I guess they expect us to wait with baited breath for a sequel to finish the story? There were also some good actors totally wasted in this drivel, like Christopher Lee and Derek Jacoby. I also wasn't expecting this to be children's movie, but that is what it is. Oh, by the way, they ripoff Chronicles of Narnia. They wish they were 1/100th as good as Narnia. Even the voice of the ice bear was a ripoff of the talking lion of Narnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"I thought this was a very good movie.

The story was the Achilles Heel of this movie. It was all over the place and just didn't hold together. An allstar cast could not pull this out. I am guessing this is yet another case where the movie does not do the book justice.The two things that really stood out were some of the atmospheric special effects and the acting of Dakota, who was excellent as the young heroine.But nothing can save a wandering story with lots of holes that leave way too many questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"This had the potential to be an interesting movie...excellent actors, interesting story, nice special effects....but the story was missing something.

( i guess it just tried to compress too much and jumped too fast in a 2 hr movie).It felt it lacked the personal touch of a true sci-fi. They relived too much on the special effects to carry the movie and I felt the actors weren't believable enough.As if they were saying hey viewer, this is sci-fi, so why should I give it my good gun-BLEEP. (even though I just think Daniel Craig is sexy even when he acts fake.)The book was much more enjoyable and I'd certainly wait until the DVD if you're really that interested, but I'm was just passing the time and I'm glad I went to an early showAlthough I'm kind of disappointed I still spent any money on it.Grade: C - -"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Finish It","review":"I didn't read the book and am not familiar with the author, so all I can do is comment on what I did see. What I saw was not impressive. I wanted to like it. I like flights of fancy, but it was pretty juvenile. I think if you are to get swept up in fantasy, you have to be able to suspend reality. This did not do that for me. I didn't like that everyone had their own demon. That was a major turn off. I just never got drawn into the plot or the characters. Not sure why. This type of movie usually speaks to me. It is visually pretty, but not stunning. The acting was okay, I guess. I just found it all boring. The story was slow and never took off."},{"rating":"2","title":"A World of Wonder","review":"A great adventure film, heroic and set in a land that is enough like our own world to resonate but with differences that make the heart leap in wanting them. Yes, I want a daemon! If you have read the book recently, then dont watch the film yet, because you will be annoyed by the (mostly necessary) changes they have made to make it fit the limited time. Watch the film first, then read the books which have so much more to them, but the imagery of the film definitely enhances your imagination when you read. The child actors are simply brilliant, not sappy or sweet. But the best is the armoured bear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"If you read the book don't see this movie, they did nothing but mutilate it.

Yeah, the graphics were ok but not as good. The story line deviates from the book. If you are a fan of the book I recommend not buying this movie. It's ok to watch but not to own.

Most of the movie seemed dark or washed of color. The concepts had so much unexplored potential or was missing some meaty back-history that would have given the present moments more meaning. Some of the CG was nicely done, but not exceptional. Overall, I was just plain bored while watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twenty Minutes...","review":"Twenty Minutes...that's as long as I lasted.

Having enjoyed Harry Potter, Narnia, Fellowship of the Ring, this movie just seemed to steal ideas (battles, CG animals, witches.....)even Nazis....

The characters are boring and one-dimensional, either evil because \\"that's how things are\\" or good because \\"we aren't going to take this anymore!\\" The film was shot with no regard to pacing at all. There are gratuitous shots of scenery just so the filmmakers could show off how wonderful their environments were. The whole thing even wraps up with a plot synopsis of the upcoming films, which runs something like:\\"Can we go home now?\\"\\"No.\\"\\"Why not?\\"\\"We have to find a way to milk this franchise for all its worth.

Lets face it, this should be almost as good as Lord of the Rings or Narnia. But the problem with Compass is that you don't care about anybody in the movie because it has been watered down (I don't know how much since I have never read His Dark Majesty.) That and the scripts weren't that memorable and the acting was mediocre (having Wyatt Earp's brother only made it more confusing whether this was Golden Compass or Tombstone.)

It is nicely filmed and the visual effects are lush and pretty (even though some of the daemons don't look that realistic some of the time). However, I just couldn't accept the plotline, such as it was. It is, as I said above, too silly for words. Now I know that the books have come under considerable fire from the loony wing of the US evangelical community for the atheistic views that Mr. Pullman is said to have built into them and which, they said, he was trying to inculcate into children. Perhaps this explains the dilution of the story from the book into a rather insipid kids' adventure yarn. The one highlight for me was Nicole Kidman's chilling villain. Nothing else.The comments of some of the other reviewers have persuaded me to read the book, to see what might have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of the book....Watch out!","review":"The casting for this movie was fantastic; the acting was great, and everyone did a really good job. The special effects were even good...But if you're a huge fan of the book (like me) then I'm afraid you'll find this movie to be a disappointment...I was so sad after watching it; I had waited forever for it to come out, and then it hardly follows the plotline for the book at all. The ending was cliche as anything (kids all running out of Bolvanger while the facility blows up...what?!?!?!), and it wasn't supposed to end where it did. The movie rushed into everything and left out so much that was in the book.I would have expected a lot better of New Line, especially with their good adaptation of The Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I can't believe the lack of integrity in this film.

This version is produced in 7.1 channel sound. When played through the sound system of my TV (only a 4-year old Toshiba), the sound was full of static at numerous points in the film. Every adjustment I could think of to work around the problem failed. The 5.1 channel extras disc played just fine. The static ruined what could have been an enjoyable movie. So unless your TV and sound system is really current, you could wind up with a bad sound experience too. I have no complaints at all about the video presentation of the film. The visual experience was terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worl- A- Girl","review":"Great CD by a fine all girl band. A very hard CD to find.I have searched a long time for it and after years found it on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The talking cross","review":"It is wrong that the Maya Indians had been abused since the Spaniards put a foot on this continent, but the Caste War showed a people that are savage, revengeful and that made the same atrocities as the Europeans: killed innocents, rape, killed prisoners...Then the fake of the Cross that talks and told them to have a religious vendetta against the Europeans and its descendants, gave you a bad image of the exploited and abused Indians that were rebelling against years of sufferings and hunger. The book was written from the White man perspective and although it is based in historical data it let the Ideology of the writer to surface. That is not good for a history book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I definately recommend this book","review":"I think most people are smart enough to take things in context. Not everywhere and every situation will match cultural norms, but this book is the best place to start on Pakistan. I look forward to reading others in this series as I travel elsewhere. I read the travel books on Pakistan but this one gave the most preparation to the culture and what to expect while most books tell you places or events of interest.A definite must when heading that direction!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rather unbalanced","review":"althought this book is relativly well written and candid it seems as though the author does to full understand the culture and often misrepresents it. the pictures (although black and white) are quite nice and the descriptions of the elite in the major cities such as karachi and lahore are close to true but not always agreeable. I visited pakistan for my friends wedding a few months ago and this book contradicts most of what i learned about their culture and ceremonies. what i found most misrepresented was the issue of sexism in pakistan. the author mentions how women have less authority than men but conveniently forgets to mention the respect and facilities they are awarded as mothers,sisters, and wives. all in all i felt this book isnt the best way to go if you really want to understand the country and the people of pakistan, this book isnt the best way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is Up?","review":"When I bought the \\" Edited Version\\" I assumed that the word N***** would be gone.

I had to pull over to the side of the road, unable to continue until it was finished. For those of us so far away from the site of last week's horror, connected only through television, radio, and print, it has been hard to move from the numbers to the names to the lives of all those lost. Our prayers have been frequent and our thoughts constant but we have still been removed. This helped me and I hope it will help us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable and Exquisite","review":"I read this book about 7 or 8 years ago but I think of it often. It's beautifully written and translated and is very powerful. I highly recommend it for anyone dealing with the loss of a child or anyone who knows someone who's lost a child. When I read the book I mourned for these little girls and their parents. It's clear to the reader how loved Mathilde and Elise were, how very special they were to their mom and dad. Genevieve Jurgensen captures a parent's love for a child exquisitely. This book is the most memorable book that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reads like a diary of sorts on the process of loss & grief","review":"Some pages were hard to get through, but overall a wonderful documentation of this womans tragic loss and her recovery from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent book for thos experiencing the loss of a child","review":"Somewhat difficult to read due to the translation of a very alliterative book, but worth the effort.

Much like all of Stephen Pearcy's stuff away from Ratt, this aspires to be spotty, insipid, dull, and in general just garbage.Its odd because the guy CAN have an unbelievable sense of melody and sing stuff that no one else can, as evidenced by the STELLAR new Ratt effort. But, while the first Arcade was pretty darn good, this is just utter crap.If the price ever gets to where Amazon is paying you to take a copy of it, it MIGHT be worth it. Otherwise, save your money and listen to 'Out of the Cellar' one more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album they had to make","review":"After four failed attempts to hit it big, including playing at Woodstock, this was the album unknown to the masses sensation King's X had to make to see if they could make it big and be popular with the masses. Well...it didn't quite work out as planned...except for a shining slab of sonic perfection that is the actual music. The boys brought in Brendan O'Brien and tried to look similar to the popular grunge acts of the time, but it all seemed a little forced. Anyway, the music is superb and will not leave you disappointed, whether you have heard of these guys or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterful concept album about melancholy","review":"First off, musically, this is one of the best hard rock albums ever made. But beyond that, the emotional depth of the lyrics is beyond anything I've ever heard. I actually have never liked lyrics about depression, but these songs are all so true that it doesn't come off as the least bit whiny or annoying. Every song deals with some aspect of struggling with life and the feelings associated with it. The words are all so perfectly written and delivered that you can feel the emotion in every line. The lyrics never bring me down, though, because the music is so powerful that it beats all negativity out of me. No album has ever spoken to me like this one, and whether I'm up or down, this album always takes me to a better place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flexion point and a fine album","review":"The sound of this CD marks a huge departure from the style of the previous four albums. For many longtime King's X fans it's a case of \\"I like your old stuff better than your new stuff\\" but, taken at face value, this is one serious, low-tuned rockin' album. While KX took another turn after this with \\"Ear Candy\\" and seem to have struggled to find their bag since (although Mr. Bulbous may put this to rest), Dogman stands as possibly their strongest album since Gretchen.As for the lyrics... (\\"cartoonish nonsense\\" my foot!) it's oblique sometimes perhaps, but the picture painted is that of frustrated, contemplative, and determined individualists. For those who are familiar with KX' music, that sums up to a very candid lyric sheet. Welcome to the charm of King's X."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guitar Case","review":"I thought that it was a five-star case. That was why I purchased it. Only problem. I never got one.

I was pulled into the film and ended up reaching for a box of tissues. A couple of major relationships didn't play as fully believable, but didn't detour me from the emotional depth of the film. Those who are fans of movies like The Notebook and A Walk to Remember are likely to find this a satisfying movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Gift","review":"We had heard about this DVD, and we found that to us it was wonderful.

A cynic may proclaim it to be predictable and clichéd but a movie this meaningful should not be viewed through cynical eyes.

Fortunately our Administrative Assistant was able to stream a movie directly from Net Flex."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable in the extreme","review":"I'm definitely in the minority among viewers, but to me, this movie was like a Hallmark channel movie of the week reject.It was totally predictable, with more cliches and stereotypes than I would have thought it possible to jam into a single film.The huge gaps in reality alternately annoyed me (a child going through end stage leukemia and chemo is totally healthy looking and perky) and made me laugh (a month in the Texas sun doing hard manual labor and the star doesn't even get a little sun burned or calloused).The end moral of the story seemed to be that if you have enough money you can do some good in the world (yet, it never addressed the fact that the money was made by exploiting the earth for oil and raising cattle, among other things).There was nothing remotely \\"spiritual\\" about this maudlin and manipulative film. I found it a total waste of two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelente película.","review":"La película es muy buena, sobre todo para compartirla con tus hijos, tiene un contenido que es entretenido y con valores.Tiempo de entrega muy bueno, calidad del producto muy bueno.---The film is very good, especially to share with your children, has a content that is entertaining and with values.Delivery time very good, very good product quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Movie of 2007...so far","review":"This movie really surprised me, as it's not the usual type of movie I'd enjoy, especially one branded as a \\"faith\\" film. I watched primarily because it was billed as the great James Gardner's final movie before his retirement...Gardner didn't appear much on screen, but this movie definately felt his presence throughout. I know the phrase \\"a moving experience\\" gets tossed around like rice at a wedding, but \\"The Ultimate Gift\\" is truely deserving of the description. 4.5 of out of 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly inspiring movie!","review":"This is a rare type of movie in today's market. The message that this movie promotes in inspiring and heartwarming. The journey that Red sends Jason on is something that Jason really needed. He has grown up in privledge and not really knowing about his family. Jason grows up through the journey and learns what is really means to be a friend/family.Drew Fuller and Abigail Breslin give stellar performances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"This was a great heart warming story that I would recommend to just about anyone.

This was a good, clean family movie that you can watch anywhere anytime!!!

This movie is a gift, a gift of a life changing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously? So Bizarre!","review":"We don't get it! We loved The Christmas Card, November Christmas, but this movie has absolutely no character development, is disjointed, and really poorly done. For as much as we like to support \\"family movies,\\" this one is weak all the way around. Quite phony, the young girl character is really bizarre, and relationships don't develop, they just all of a sudden \\"are.\\" So far out there. We have no idea how this gets the high ratings it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Message","review":"The Ultimate Gift delivers a great message to the viewer via the taped advice from the grandfather and the importance of knowing the difference between beauty of generosity and the ugliness of selfishness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must Watch Movie","review":"I found the movie to be excellent. It really speaks to the carefree lifestyle many people have. Many of us have lost the importance of being in a place where we can make a difference. That is what life is all about. Making the world better for others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern-day \\"Pay it forward\\" fable ...","review":"Despite the fact that it is a transparent morality tale and fairly hokey, I found myself liking this movie despite those features. This is a touching modern day fable that reminds us that the best and most priceless gifts -- THE ultimate gifts -- that we can give others is not money, but rather time, fulfillment through work, love, friendship, learning and the spirit to tackle new challenges.Add those together and the money may follow but - even if it doesn't - those other qualities are what constitutes a legacy from generation to generation.The movie evokes a Hallmark Movie of the Week Special, and I don't mean that as a criticism. There is little overtly Christian in the film. There are a few oblique references to heaven and a few scenes of the characters sitting in a hospital chapel; nothing that is in your face, though. This film projects genuine \\"family values\\" and stops just a whisker short of being too didactic. Worth seeing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING-- A MUST SEE FILM","review":"This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. I loved every moment of it. Jason Stevens, played by Drew fuller, goes to the reading of his grandfather's will expecting to get nothing but what he finds is that his grandfather has an \\"ultimate\\" gift for him. He has to do a bunch of different tasks to recieve his inheritance. He decides to do as his grandfather wished and goes through each and every task to finally achieve his ultimate gift. This is a warm, heart felt movie that anyone can fall inlove with. You begin to identify with Jason Stevens even though he is a self-centered rich boy as he goes on his journey to find the ultimate gift. This movie is by far a definite must see film. Don't waste anymore time contemplating whether or not this movie will be worth the time because it is and it will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Gift","review":"It is a good clean, inspiring, family movie.

We can heartily recommend this to anyone regardless of age or sensitivities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I think it was put together very well. There isn't any language or any nudity, which I think is very important. Some of the scenes might be a little intense for the very little viewers. The movie also has a great message about life and also about money. I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"The movie seemed to get off to a slow start, but I think this is primarily because I couldn't get into the introductory scenes in which greedy scumbags demand their entitlement to an inheritance. Once the plot is set in the introductory scenes, the movie seems to move right along and features excellent performances by the primary cast. I think this is an excellent movie for the entire family, although parents may want to preview the movie to ensure all scenes are appropriate for their children."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Gift","review":"Great movie....

In fact, the only people who knew it was out were those who heard from friends. I was dragged by a friend. And I'll be honest: I absolutely did not want to go see the movie. I was in a bad mood and didn't feel like watching something that would \\"feel good.\\" I, however, am SO glad I went. What a difference a film written and directed with values can make! If you aren't a Christian or are living in the world, scoffing at everything that seems too obvious or too trite, then skip this. You probably wouldn't understand anyway. For those of you who want a change from the violence, sex, nudity, and so on that Hollywood assumes (incorrectly) sells (examine some of the top grossing movies of all time, and most of them not only aren't rife with all the aforementioned nastiness, but are actually VALUES films), you will ADORE this movie!

I am always looking for films that young people and adolescents can relate to and keep their attention. This movie does just that.I teach grades 10-12 using health education as a foundation. I recently had my students view this film and had remarkable reactions. The most profound was having about 1/3 the class passing the kleenex box around, males and females. It was comforting for me to see these students felt comfortable sharing their emotions in a public enviornment among their peers and their instructor. It gave me a little peak inside their hearts.The assignment I gave them was to make a list of the gifts given and what their personal feelings were regarding each gift. Would they have done things differently.If you want to show a film with a powerful message about life and living and displays all variances of emotions, this is the movie to show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you have any wine for this cheese?","review":"My wife and I watched this movie at a family Christmas gathering, and we were shocked that they took this movie seriously.

The results are really amazing. And this book will become your diet bible for the rest of your life. No book has ever captured by attention and changed my way of thinking about dieting. Both men and women will benefit from Body Opus. A definite must for all people who want to go beyond \\"normal\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"BodyOpus is the one","review":"This book is really one of the best books written about fat loss. Not by any guessing but by easy to follow methods to help any bodybuilder or fitness head decrease body fat and preparing for contests if thats your thing. I got hold of this book a few years ago and at the time the low carb diets were laughed at in Australia and now they are all the rage. Dan was truly ahead of his time but his calculations and his science that he applies are truly amazing. Yeah there is all the knockers out there who will whinge about constapation and head spins. How about knocking the results- wont hear too many of those. RESULTS. Any way I vary the diet and it suits me and is easy to follow. The drug section is very detailed also especially in the diretics and thyroid area.Also there is no index on this book but you can find it easily on the web."},{"rating":"1","title":"Budgies","review":"I followed this book to the 'T' and felt like the bottom of my budgies bird cage the whole time. Ketosis is (for me anyway) not a place you wanna be. You stink, you go to the toilet about once a month, you suffer from total lethargy and you can almost feel your arteries hardening. I don't know how Dan died but if he followed this diet I can guess why.The upside is - well there isn't one. I dropped hardly any body fat on this diet and the carb loading phase only merited nominal strength increases - and no more than I would have gotten on any high caloric bodybuilding diet. Save your arteries, the abysmal moods and workouts and stick to the basics. John Berardi (a real PHD) has some excellent diets which are far healthier and in my humble opinion, far more successful. At least they have been for me. Check him out or others of that ilk.RIP Dan - I hope they are serving vegies up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy","review":"This book was supposed to be in great condition but the first time i opened it it fell apart.

You should have the guts to play with your thyroid with this one because he recomends you to take T3's. I wanna be ripped, but i dont want to take the risk.

Though bodyopus itself is only for people in shape (under 15% bodyfat), the modern and iso-caloric diet can be used by anyone to get to the point where one can apply bodyopus."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT for the faint of heart","review":"I completed this diet for several weeks pre-competition. I am NOT a user of steroids. I entered a bodybuilding competition in the 156 and under weight class and BLEW the competition away. This diet got me shredded.NOW that being said, this was probably the most difficult diet I have EVER been on. The kind of dedication one needs to have to sustain something like this is out of this world. This is NOT a diet one can sustain for lengthy periods of time, at least in my opinion, and one that is certainly not healthy to sustain for any period of time beyond a few weeks or several \\"cycles.\\"The book is very informative and lays out all the necessary ground work for completing said diet successfully. The author does state that not every diet is for every so results may vary. I STATE that you will never know until you try. GIVE IT A GO. As long as you are deemed healthy BY A PHYSICIAN, I see no reason not to try it out.

And that's exactly the case here. Despite the actual Body Opus portion of the book being very small, it definitely works.It's not the easiest diet to follow, the 2 hour+ glycogen depletion workout is an absolutely killer - but the results are indisputableThe book does have several flaws. Dan negates to include a lot of information (how much protein one eats on the weekend, dosages of the the supplements he recommends... etc etc) and parts of the book are woefully inadequate (the training sections could definitely be beefed up) - but perhaps that's because some things aren't an exact science and different methodologies work for different people.Regardless, highly effective and a definite must read for anyone serious about getting in shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I was expecting more from this book. Don't get me wrong it was good and I liked it, but I felt like the author (God rest his soul) was egotistical and it sort of put me off.

Originally, I thought the same way the other female reviewer felt.However, I decided to give it a chance and watch it -I was happily surprised. It really isnt that bad of a show. Yes, what Techno puts her through is extremely horrible, however as another reviewer pointed out, you have to look at it from his view too. Here is this poor kid who has no idea whatsoever on how to act in society -he only comes out because he sees \\"Daisy\\" and falls for her.

Don't buy this Anime Series!!!!!!","review":"I've never had to say this about any anime until this DVD. Don't buy it! The plotline stinks, and is way too dumb for my taste. Just the story of Techno trying to get \\"Daisy\\" ( real name, Hitomi) to fall in love with him was enough, but was it really necessary to make Techno some weirdo who had been locked in a bomb shelter his entire life? That part ruined the mood of the entire anime for me. And what was up with the pet missiles? The ending itself was just so anti-climatic and stupid that I felt angry for wasting the few hours I spent watching this disasterous anime. If you want a good anime series to own, do yourself a favor and don't buy this one. You'll only be frustrated.

Its especially obvious during the short duet between Bernadette and Brandy. Without the microphone Brandy would not be heard, and she is outclassed all the way around.Wait for the Leslie Warren or Julie Andrews version to come out.

Of course, the multiracial casting was really blatantly thoughtless (lots of effort casting , eh?). But ultimately, it became so confusing that the simple pleasure of watching a child's fairy tale was lost in the stupid Disney-type, \\"I want to make you a better\\" ( read politically correct) Disney person.

Whoopi Goldberg is priceless as the Queen and her treatment of Lionel. The stepsisters are truly disrespectful of each other and Cinderella. Bernadette Peters has her usual wonderful, overblown quality.How can you beat a movie where one of the sisters has a shoe fight by holding the glass slipper over her head to keep it away from the shorter man?Whitney Houston is inconsequential in this movie.

The weirdest thing about this version is the rainbow racial effect that the producer desired. It was plain dissonant, visually speaking that is. Really not very good. Other than Brandy, everyone else was average to mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinderella's Face Lift","review":"This is an old classic fairy tale which happens to be my favorite. I love the fact that all the characters came from different ethnic backrounds, which made it the movie interesting. My only complaint was that it was a little on the fast side, but the music, dance sequels, costuming, and the charming chemistry shared by these characters were beautiful. If you want your child to know about true love and hope, I recommend this movie.-S. Abraham"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!!!!!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this version of Cinderella.

If you want to be tickled by the absurd, watch Whitney Houston try to become an English Princess! A whole multicultural cast as funny as dogs and cats marrying each other.

Ten minutes is all anybody can take of this mind numbing debacle. The cast of this version should be brought up on charges of crimes against artistic humanity. Seriously, what was Disney really expecting the public to do with this schizoid version of Cinderella? All I can say is be careful in viewing this confusing version; it should not be watched while driving or using heavy equipment, for it may cause drowsiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRANDY IS A BARFBAG!","review":"I do not want to even fathom the tensions and B.S. that took place on the set of this disastrous flop. When two inflated ego's such as Brandy's and Miss Houston's meet, one imagines a pyrotechnical catastrophe! Those two deserve each other! Natalie Desselle, I must say, is quite charming! Kinda funny, but it seems when in comes to co-stars in her own age bracket, Brandy is constantly surrounding herself those of \\"larger proportions\\", and you know damn right well she thinks it'll make her look better.

It's all glossed up and doesn't have the warmth and innocense of the older version. This is supposed to be a play, and this one doesn't make the movie theme work. The new songs are not at all good, too. I feel so sorry for my peers who have only seen this version! They have truly missed out in the wholesome 1965 Cinderella with the elegant Lesley Ann Warren.

There is so much of neither in this project. The songs don't translate well to the gravelly, pop-scarred vocal chords of the majority of the cast, most egregiously Brandy, Whoopie and Whitney.

Although the props are great and the music performed superbly, watching this fiasco is like hearing Marilyn Manson performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. In an attempt to make a multicultural rainbow out of a classic, the absurdity of the effort becomes apparent.

But long since had it been missing from my collection, I was shocked and amazed to find it here, and it had everything I remembered. From \\"My Own Little Corner\\" to \\"Impossible\\", the songs bring back great memories of singing with old friends.

She knows the words to the songs as well as the actors lines. She can identify with the characters (especially Cinderella) and when she sees other versions of the book or the video she says that they are not the real Cinderella. I am concerned about positive images for her self esteem and this video has served the purpose of introducing her to some of those images.The cast of characters is made up of a great mixture of races which displays the diversity that I want my daugter to be comfortable with. My concern is the absence of African American Males in the video. There is not one except for the extras in any significant roles.

Jason Alexander is great. Burnadette Peters makes a great evil step mother, and the stepdaughters really did play the part. Brandi has a beautiful voice and there are additional songs in this version. I thought Whoopie Goldberg should've been the Fairy Godmother and Whitney Houston should've been the queen. It seemed more like the attitudes fit better that way, but I guess they needed Whitney to sing the Fairy Godmothers songs. Nonetheless, it is enjoyable. I bought it, and I'm pleased that I did.

The step mother, white; the daughters (one white and one black). Cinderella, Brandy, black. I don't understand why they could not show the acceptance of different racial groups in a manner that made genetic sense.I am pretty sure their was not one actor/ actress that knew how to act in a musical.

To be honest, Whitney and Brandy are not actresses; however, Whitney's voice \\"sings\\" for itself and Brandy does a passable job. Paolo Montalban in the role of the prince was charming and a cast including Jason Alexander, Whoopi Goldberg,and Bernadette Peters would have a hard time going wrong.The story is of course an old classic, but the music is timeless and the songs have my daughter singing all around the house, in the car, . . .

Some people believe she doesnt have the voice for Rodgers and Hammerstein, well to them i must say you have no taste. Brandy's musical performance was brilliant and stunning and I hope to see her in future musicals of the same sort.Whitney Houston was also a wonderful addition to the cast, adding a little more Star image to the film.

I read the entire 500+ pages hoping the 'end would justify' the book, but was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable outcome.","review":"It was obvious after 1st 50 pages what outcome would be-team would win, boy and girl would fall in love and something bad would happen to grandma. Writing style was something an 8th grader (or less) might produce. This book is far removed from good fiction.

It is long and predictable. The story and characters are shallow and inauthentic. Very cheesy! Very disappointed that I bought this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"My wife,a nursing home resident home resident, bought the kindle version, read it andliked it.

It is one I will keep in my personal library and read again & again. It just points out that deep down inside , every day average people are just plain good folks . This is one of those stories that just kept you interested until the end . When I got 3/4 of the way through I didn't want it to end & nursed it along like a good glass of wine . It gave me so much to think about when I did finish it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind Your Ponies","review":"The title sort of throws you off. This is a book about a basketball team in a very small community in Montana. It is a very good story with lots of different stories line happening. If you like sports or small towns, you will love this book. I have enjoyed all books by Stanley West. The story makes your heart feel warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of my time","review":"The novel is predictable from the beginning and does nothing to stave off the boredom of its predictability. The characters are stereotypical with no modification of the expected. The book exceeds 500 pages when it could have easily been completed in 200. When an author relies so heavily on stereotypes, exaggerated descriptions are completely unnecessary. The writing is stylistically dead; many attempts at being clever made me groan out loud. Stanley Gordon West has created a novel that many obviously adore; I am not one of those. If you got recommendations from a friend who liked this book and you trust that opinion, read it but be prepared to adjust that friendship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Annoying!","review":"Like the other reviewers, I was irritated by the author's overuse of similes; and for me, they did seriously detract from my enjoyment of the story. This is a great little story; the characters and place are well done, and West makes you care about them. However, every time I would get drawn into the story, start to lose myself in it, here would come the avalanche of similes (some of them very bad)! Please, Mr. West, you are a good enough writer to do without this overload!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underdog Basketball team and its town and school","review":"At first the story seemed to be a bit long when the basketball team keeps losing but later you realize this is written like this to make you feel the frustration the town and school is feeling over the constant string of loses even when they do start winning you still feel this way as they lose again. You may need to like basketball when you get further into the book and they start telling the games in radio announcer or tv announcer verbal storyline way. I felt the story really starts to pick up about 55% into it and you get into the small town lives when you find out more about the different people living there and how it affects the boys on the team. So it may feel a bit slow in the first half of the book but its worth reading onward once everything seems to fall into place. The ending leaves you feeling good about the basic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, how I loved this book!","review":"Stan West is a story teller like no other. He wraps you up and takes you along on some of the most amazing journeys! This is a book that you wish would never end, because after you have become involved with these characters and this story, you only want more. I love the ideas and some of the universal themes that exists in ALL GOOD LITERATURE. Stan West's, \\"Blind Your Ponies\\" is no exception. As a Montanan, it was a pleasure to read as well, having visited many of these places. Stan, we want more! And if you read this, stop by Park High as well. I have many students who wish to visit with you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough Exposition!","review":"This is a book that will likely be made into a movie. When that happens, my advice will be, \\"See the movie!\\" I forced my way through this trough of meaningless exposition because the book was selected by my book club. It's predictable and populated by stock characters whose motivations and plights were the cause of much eye rolling. I have nothing against long novels--in fact, I prefer them--but this one is emphatically not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent Read","review":"Story developed quickly- Living in a small town he did a great job showing how sports in a small town affect all.

Stanley Gordon West suggests there will be a sequel in a list of questions at the end of the book. I would buy the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Impossible Dream rather than The Impossible Dream","review":"As a retired teacher and coach I found the book so down to earth and gentile that it took hold of me on page one and never let go. The relationship of the characters is faily common in small communities but the lessons that one can learn from \\"Blind Your Ponies\\" are countless. I started holding off my readings toward the last 200 pages because I was afraid it would come to an end!!!!!!!!! It did and I was saddened by it. I loved every minute of its reading. May have to go to Willow Creek just to satisfy my love of this book. Thanks Stanley West!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"memory card","review":"the memory card works great haven't had any problems with it at all. if you are looking for an extra memory card for your PS2 this one will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"a thorough introduction","review":"This is the ultimate starting point for students who want to enter the field of string theory. It discusses most subject in great detail. However in can't be self contained or complete at every stage since progresses in string theory are being made every day. Nevertheless it provides enough background to understand current articles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helping with the Death Process","review":"This book helped me to reaize what was happening to my loved one when he died.I wanted to find another Kubler-Ross book but this was the only one available. This book is a collection of lectures that she gave on tour.Even tho my loved one was an adult, the stories of how children viewed death helped me to understand that usually, a person knows when they are dying and find ways to prepare themselves for it. I could relate it to things that had happened in my loved one's life. I have shared this book with others. We felt a great sense of peace and comfort from learning how death affects the young and the old.Especially interesting was the comforting thought of the process of death--what happens at the time death occurs. Also the hope of an afterlife.I recommend this book to anyone facing the death of a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Information","review":"A lot of good information. I have used the magazine several times in my car restorations. Fairly easy to read and navagate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea, Poorly Developed","review":"Leiber combines two interesting ideas, actually--the absolute impossibility of proving that other minds exist, and the mass-production of human minds in the modern world. Unfortunately, the story itself is full of coincidences, narrow escapes, and other melodramatics. And the explanation of how the few \\"alive\\" people can co-exist with the \\"dead\\" world is not very convincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've used 257 MB SimpleTech flashdrives for years, so figured I'd go nuts and spring for the 8GB Bonzai.

I'd been disengaging it properly, so I can't figure out why it went bad. After a coule of weeks it was useless to me, and the \\"customer service\\" on the SimpleTech website is a joke. I give up."},{"rating":"1","title":"No so great.","review":"I ignored a couple of earlier reviews because every drummer is different and treat their sticks differently. I have had my sticks for 2 weeks and the tip broke right off. Trust me, I am not an abusive drummer and the tip broke right off as it was dancing on my Ride Bell. The sound was excellent as I gave them at least two stars, but every drummer looks for a strong stick. That is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"These do not last!","review":"These sticks claim to last 3 to 8 times longer than regular wood sticks.

I will not buy again unless proven otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this happen ?","review":"I was shocked when I saw the episodes of the second season. I would say the first season was one of the best things to be aired on TV ever. How come they just throw all that down the drain ? You really don't know what to think during the episodes. \\"Is it a comedy ? Oh, look at at satan and his friends having a chat.Am I supposed to laugh or amuse myself ? And now, is it a serious episode ?\\" Not to mention the lack of darkness so well conveyed by Frank Black in the 1st season. To sum up, the second season left a lot to be desired. The only thing I can do now is re-watch season one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This season blew - watch for yourself and see!","review":"I was indeed a huge fan of the first season, and looked forward to every episode. Season two was very different. It was like a boat without a rudder. I can imagine a bunch of college guys getting together at a party and writing ideas on a bunch of pieces of paper, throwing them into a hat, then each guy there pulls one out and is tasked with writing an episode based on whatever bizarre topic was scribbled on the scratch piece of paper. There was a complete lack of continuity; the soul of the show was lost. I am surprised the show made it through the entire 2nd episode without being canned. I have not seen any episodes from season 3. This is of course my own humble opinion. I certainly think everyone should watch it for themselves and come to their own conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very outdated gothic thriller","review":"Millennium is like Criminal Minds but goofy. When it came out on TV years ago it was actually entertaining and creepy.When I watched it on DVD the other day I could barely finish each episode without almost falling asleep. The show came across as cliche and monotone. The acting is monotone and forced. The plots are so similar to one another and focus around the same old dark and spooky themes.The main character Frank Black (Lance) is always muttering under his breath and psychoanalyzing everything in annoying detail as if I am supposed to be freaked out by that? He does that in every single episode and it gets lame and tired fast (and Lance is an awesome actor btw).Keep in mind I am a fan of the X files seasons 6 and 7. Also I appreciate horror, sci-fi, and thrillers. This show just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Millenium Madness","review":"I just received, as a gift, the entire second season. I remember watching these episodes when they first aired and would not miss a single one if I could help it. The themes for these stories are of Biblical proportions. Prophecy, the apocolypse, revelations, the struggle of good and evil and many more larger than life themes make up the 23 episones. If you compare this show with the average crime drama or sitcom, it is miles ahead. It is as if Millenium is trying to pave a new way, show a new way of seeing the world, break new ground etc. It is like we are in the middle ages and here is the beginning of the light of the rennaisance.Of particular interest is the struggle of Frank Black with his gift of vision. How this gift has caused his personal life to suffer is one of the central themes of the series. If you have ever felt out of place and time, you will understand how Frank Black feels. The stories are fantastic with the grandest of themes and struggles. A milestone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply put, some of the best television ever made.","review":"A lot of people criticized the direction Morgan and Wong took Millennium in Season 2, with more of a focus on religion and the shadowy Millennium Group, but to me it made for some of the best television ever made.There's no way I can describe in detail how good these episodes are, but \\"Midnight of the Century\\" alone is an absolute classic, worthy of viewing each Christmas, \\"Somehow, Satan Got Behind Me\\" is an excellent and spot on-target look at how evil propagates in the world, and of course \\"The Fourth Horsemen\\" and \\"The Time is Now\\" are perhaps the most magnificent ending to a television season ever. (They should have been the final episodes of the series; I like to pretend Season 3 never happened.)This show has never received the respect it deserves, but it's simply incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 3rd season was disappointing","review":"The 3rd season was sort of a downer.

Season One was almost completely uninteresting, and Season Three became an unimaginative X-Files rip off. This season, created by Glen Morgan and James Wong (X-Files, Space Above and Beyond, Final Destination) managed to create a fascinating story and fun characters out of what had been a completely lifeless and depressing show about serial killers. They made the Millenium Group into a fascinating and mysterious cult preparing for the end of the world, and introduced a variety of colorful and interesting villains as well. And man, what an ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait for third season!","review":"I anticipated this second season and ordered it as soon as it said it was going to be available! Great - it's only been about a week, and I've watched every episode two times and intend to watch and evaluate it again and again. I can't wait for the third season. I can still remember in the last season when Jordan became sick and Frank broke down and cried - the first and only time I've seen him show intense emotion. I absolutely cannot wait for the third season to come out so that I can view that episode again and again! Please, if you haven't bought the first two seasons of this show, do so now! It is the best, and you will anticipate the third season as much as I do when you see Lance Henrickson - the emotion he will display in third season when it comes available will blow you away!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Rambeau","review":"This was the season that featured, in the final episode, a full-blown video for Patty Smith's psycho-art anthem Horses, in which the images of the song were woven into images that carried the storyline. I think it was the most original and exhilarating moment I've ever seen on network television. This show had real courage (other episodes made fun of FOX and savaged Scientology (Doomsday Defense of Jose Chung - not sure if that was year 2 or 3)). All in all, a rewarding experience to see these shows again, and worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids need to move around!","review":"I am a pre K music specialist and I love this CD.

They made the whole movie silly and cliche. They gave no personality to the robots at all. The design of the robots was awful. It was hard if not impossible to make out what was going on in the fight scenes. Megatron doesn't even transform into a gun! The product placement was blatant and repeated constantly. It played like a GM commercial. Tried too hard to be funny. Didn't take the franchise seriously. It put the transformers into a typical cliched plot. Normal schmuck comes into contact with something crazy on accident and now the world is in danger and he has to help the robots save the planet while trying to get the hot girl YAWN! The only real Transformers movie ever made was made in 1986."},{"rating":"2","title":"The reason to get an HDDVD drive for your 360","review":"The extras are amazing and if you invested in a full HD 1080p TV you owe it to yourself to pick up this great little treat. The full screen 1080p hddvd package brings you two discs jam packed with transformer goodness. I found a used HDDVD drive for my 360 and was able to get one for 140.00 So get one don't be cheap and grab one if you own a nice TV an Xbox360.

Michael Bay is inept and Transformers deserved much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad interpretation of the old glorious Transformers","review":"So exicited to see my favorite childhood classic cartoon redone with modern technology. Unfortunately, this movie was a 100% letdown.The explosions, graphics, special effects - nothing new here. Seen it dozens of times.Dialect - This is the worst part of the movie. It's sufficient for a 10yr old, anyone have a high school education would cosider it childish.In-Movie advertisements - It's alright to do advertising in the movie, but don't do it so bluntly and repeatedly.The awesome fights - Well, it wasn't really so awesome to be honest. It was just a messy graphics of 2 or 3 robots tangled together. You really weren't able to see what or how the fight was going.Fortunately I watched it on a DVD, was able to fast foward majority of the movie and shorten 2 1/2 hours to about 1 hour. It was a bit of too much fast forwarding, but 1 1/2 hour should have been the length, there was just too much junk material stuck in."},{"rating":"1","title":"MEGATRON IS A GUN!!!!!!!!","review":"When I first got word that a live action Transformers movie was in the works, I was super psyched...until I saw the trailer. I guess it's only appropriate that Michael Bay directed this movie, because with the release of this movie he transformed from a respected director into a giant douche bag. Any true fan would not waste their time on this garbage. Thanks for ruining Transformers for me Mike!!!P.S.I gave this movie one star because it was required to print this review.

The only movies he ever has done that with are John Wayne or old WWII movies...so that is saying something...something from this era!I spent a weekend watching all the extras and audio commentary.

I cannot wait for the sequel to come out and I hope there is no cussing in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool special effects, but careful - some adult situations and language!","review":"This was a very nice movie. However I did not like several ADULT situations: we have two different black men insulting and screaming at their mother and/or grandmother, a portorican speaking some dirty language, a teenager girl asks an adult to remove his clothes in front of everybody (lucky he had something underneath), BumbleBee 'peeing'on the Sector 7 guy, the family conversation in Sam's room which involves the question if he was \\"MBating\\" (I could not believe my ears when I first heard this), the bumblebee hanging from the yellow camaro's rearview mirror which read \\"Beeotch\\"; to name a few.The special effects were magnificent and also the music was nice.

If you want real stimulation read some classical literature, then when you need a mindless break; watch this on the Plasma and you may actually smile for once in your life.When I saw this movie I had a smile ear to ear because it was simple and visually stunning like Jurrasic park was the first time.

I grew up watching the cartoon as a kid and loved how they made this for us 30 year olds. However little kids watching with me were a little afraid.

That's not to say I had no expectations. I hoped for a film faithful to its sources and action packed. I got something quite different. It wasn't as action packed as I thought, but that worked out prefectly. It works. The story is quite nice, and even though some parts and characters are superfluous, it's an enjoyable film.Shia LaBouef has fun with this role. The whole cast seem to actually be enjoying their time, but Shia definitely rises above the source material. Josh Duhamel also helps tone down the action movie cliches. Although he's pretty mucha walking cliche, he helps keep a base of reality in the feature.THe DVD set is outstanding. A commentary from Micheal Bay and plenty of featurettes on this two disc to keep you interested, especially for hardcore fans.Though it has many missteps, and some implausibilty, Transformers is one of the better blockbusters in recent years.

It was terrific-and I too was excited to hear the voice of the original Optimus Prime. Shia LeBeouf was great as Sam. Bumblebee stole the show, though.

Also lame. In addition, ***SPOILER ALERT*** they killed off one of the best characters. Lame.Some of the transformers themselves were cool, and some of the fighting was cool.

Well, this is not really the whole story. We had to turn it off without finishing it because of the never ending innuendos and crudeness. One Christian movie review web-site lists this as \\"offensive\\"--this is being too kind. The absence of actual \\"bedroom\\" scenes does not make a film fit for Christians.

They couldve made a smart film rich in mythology. They wouldve made as much if not more money but instead they made a garbage movie with stellar special effects. The storyline sucks, the focus is all wrong. There is so much wrong with this film its hard to know where to begin, but my guess is you would have to startw ith Muchale Bay. he should really just be a 2nd unit director who just does the action sequences.

I expect it not to suck!Whatever.The reason I purchased this film, yes I purchased it, was to show off my home theater. It's a reference disc, no doubt about that. The picture quality is outstanding, and so is the sound. Especially the SOUND!The story blew, the acting was godawful, and the whole Sector 7 bit was atrocious. This goes down as one of the worst movies of the year. Funny how this makes a ton of money, and great double feature films like Grindhouse make nothing.The film is long, and I would say only 30 solid minutes are devoted to the action-considering the film is almost 2 1/2 hours.

I thought I would possibly enjoy the humor in the film, but I felt like the director was forcing too much sexual jokes into the film (which I found to be more annoying than funny). Cheesy romance and drama. The relationship between Sam and Mikaela is nothing you haven't already seen in a low budget Disney movie. The movie itself was way too drawn out. I pretty much didn't care by the time the final battle came. I was a Transformer fan myself when I was a kid, but man, this movie just killed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editorial Review needs to be re-written","review":"I know it seems like I'm being a bit nit-picky, but Josh Duhamel doesn't play an Army sergeant, he plays an Army Special Forces Captain (there's a BIG difference). Other then that, the Editorial Review is right on technically. In my opinion this is the coolest movie ever made, but then again I grew up watcing Transformers the cartoon... I think that the actors were great, the script was fantastic: serious at times, but incorporating alot of funny one-liners. If you're an old-school Transformers fan, you'll love it. If you like action/sci-fi, you'll love. If you don't, you might like, you might not. It is worth seeing at least once, and then you can judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, Blueray is crisp","review":"Pros: action movie, some comedy, Lebouf is good, Bluray is crisp, nice, sound is great, much better watching this on HD TV than notCons: Transformers are sometime corny, they aren't faithful to cartoon/toys/even names at times, focus too much on humans and not... the TransformersStill fairly good movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little overrated","review":"I thought the movie looked great, but not that great.

The entire movie is fast paced and fun and really keeps you involved. The only nitpick I have to say is that they don't do the theme song! I was waiting the entire movie for them to start singing it and the person who I was with (who was born in 1969) had no clue what I was talking about so I had to go and find a clip of the Transformers theme song to show him. Hopefully for the sequel they somehow showcast the theme song.All in all a great way to spend a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bay Mass Market Trash Movie","review":"Yes, this is a typical Michael Bay Film. Like The island, it has no script. It has a lot of explosions, fake CG robots, sexy women who can not act, and wooden acting by the men.

None of the transformers have any personality. Only Optimus even slightly resembles the cartoon character (same voice actor, etc). The plot is horrible. The acting is horrible. Watching Shia LeBeouf act is like trying not to cringe when someone rakes their nails across a blackboard! How did this actor get to act in the next Indiana Jones movie? He sucks!Why did John voight sign on for this travesty? The effects are mediocre at best. Almost all of the transformers look nothing like what they did on the show. Note to the director-Megatron isn't supposed to transform into a plane! The humor was almost non-existant. Needless to say, I almost walked out on this piece of garbage. It's definately made for people with short attention spans who just want fast action. True fans of the cartoon show-please!!! Stay away!

My fears that Michael Bay would ruin this movie were completely realized. The first HOUR is nothing but the kid screwing around with his car, add to that lame jokes, slapstick humor, too much emo teen angst, and the worst performance from John Turturro I've ever seen. Not too mention they only gave Starscream one line in the ENTIRE film. I seriuosly hope Bay keeps his threat not to direct the sequel, Steven Spielberg could have done such a better job himself. Rent it, trust me you don't want to waste the money.Edit: I've had over a year to let this film sink in, and my opinion of it has improved. I've noticed a lot of Bay films are like that, cheesy and cliche at first, then they become comforting to watch over time. I still want to see way more robot acting in the sequel, but without the need to set up a second movie, hopefully the action will kick off right from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to the Transformers, and raping of my childhood","review":"This movie was absolutely TERRIBLE.Why were the Transformers guest stars in their own movie?Why are there even people?

The plot was weaker than 2% milk and the character development coulda been a Slurpee (translation: it SUCKED!!) There was plenty of action, but nothing to tie it all together and make us care.My adolescent daughter summed up the main character's existence as a constant attempt to get lucky with the cute mechanic chick who apparently had no reason to be there at all! Why couldn't they have developed the character of the hyper-cool cyberchick who figured out the transformers were there in the first place... now THAT woulda been a more entertaining movie!!It hurts to see that such an average film got so many to rave about it.

I could spend paragraphs making the comparisons, but I guess I'll be outnumbered here anywho.My pre-teen sons loved it and it was mostly appropriate for their age. Even if they were teenagers, as the PG-13 rating suggests, I would still consider certain aspects of this story inappropriate for minors. (Thank goodness for ClearPlay!!) It boggles my mind why they make a PG-13 movie from a children's cartoon series with obvious children's toy tie-ins. Actually, it doesn't boggle my mind, since I understand Hollywood's agenda fairly well... Sell _______ at any social cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big, dumb and ultimately boring film","review":"\\"Transformers\\" is another entry in the Michael Bay \\"Big, Dumb\\" movie canon. It starts off OK with some good action and quirky humour but all the fun soon drains away amid confusing and repetitive fights scenes, dopey attempts to make the Autobots seem like regular guys, awkward attempts at romance, and a totally predictable 3rd act. But probably the biggest flaw the film has is that the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons is fundamentally uninteresting. \\"Transformers\\" has all that money can buy but no heart - and gives us no reason why we should care about these characters be they human or robot.

If you're under the age of 17, this movie might be great for you, but for grownups, the humor is juvenile (not Family Guy juvenile, Ed Edd and Eddy juvenile), the romantic subplot is dull, Shia LeBouef comes across as a creepily horny teenager, the movie doesn't feature much in the way of action until the last 20 minutes, and said action is shot in a shaky camera style that makes it hard to keep an eye on what's going on."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very dull movie considering how much stuff they blow up","review":"A fairly dull movie, with inconsistent acting and writing. If you're a transformers fan it's worth the rental, otherwise just skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely unredeemable garbage.","review":"Horribly bad doesn't go far enough. It is difficult to imagine how big the paychecks were to get actors like Shia LeBeouf and Jon Voight to participate in this ignorant mess. Add to that a streak of idiotic, and likely inadvertent, racism that paints virtually every black character as emotionally unhinged, vulgar, or both. There are all kinds of laughs here, but mainly of the cringing, unintentional variety. I'm tempted to say that it might appeal to 5 year old boys, but why expose them to this kind of cinematic excrement?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the cartoon.

Even with so Much Hype, it disapointed :( I mean They changed so many key elements:1. Optimus Prime is a Different Model Semi2. Bummblebee is not a Volkswagon3. Megatron looks like a Bug from the mouth4. Starscream had the body of a dorito chip?5. All the Bots were way to reflextive making them hard to see in detail6. The Fight scenes looked like tinfoil getting crumbled upThe movie was a joke and a insult to what the Cartoon lived up to, being a Iconical and cult classic. Transformers the animated movie was FAR FAR FAR better than this so called Film?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"The special effects were very good, but the acting was abysmal. The plot, as usual for a teeny bopper movie, was typical of the mindless fare that has been thrown out there or I should say thrown up for the mindless. Too bad, so sad. Oh yeh, and the two teens? I'm sorry, but no one in their mid twenties is ever going to pass as a teenager. That was totally moronic, especially the girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I have an upscaling dvd player, and the dvd's looked pretty good. but on bluray, Id have to say it looks unbelievable. seems like all the effects dealing with lighting and shadows look way better, also the details like when the scorpion comes out of the sand, the fine sand in the air looks way better. plus there is tons of extra features."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome live version of a television cartoon classic!","review":"The movie is great, the story ties in very well with the original idea of Transformers, even though they had more to the plot to enhance the story for film.

I would say this movie is the F/X breakthrough for this decade. Reminded me of the F/X breakthrough T2 did when it came out.Plot was great, Shia LeBeouf, plays a great part in this movie. Jon Voight is always amazing. Josh Duhamel needs to make more movies. Seems he's meant for the big screen not TV. Kids and parents alike will love this movie. Some people say there is too much of a love story involved. I say it's a perfect combination of everything.Nothing's missing.

Especially when Michael Bay goes for the \\"cool factor\\" instead of being completely accurate to the originals (Isn't Bumblebee supposed to be a VW Beetle?).Anyways, aside from the inacuracies that plague Michael Bay movies. It still is a great movie. But at times it seemed more like an action comedy movie than an action movie.

IF they are done right. This movie is crap. Well, maybe that's a bit harsh. There were some cool special effects and action scenes. But overall, the acting, scriptwriting, dialogue, plot lines, just ruin it. I can't tell you how many times I rolled my eyes at something a character said. Plain and simple, this movie is stupid. I heard so many good things about it that I was shocked at just how dumb the dialogue was. It was hard to get past. And there are way too many unnecessary scenes, making this movie over 2 hours long. An hour and a half would have done the trick. For nostalgia's sake it's worth a watch. Otherwise, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year","review":"This movie is bad on every level acting, cast, plot, jokes and entertainment. It has almost nothing to do with the original series. I can suspend my belief for a movie, but it is bad when a movie does not follow the rules it has set up for itself. Why do they go into the city near the end of the movie?? If you like the movies Will Smith is in then you probably will like this, if not watch a good action movie like The Matrix, Iron Man, Brotherhood of the Wolf, or Wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's alright I guess...","review":"Alot of people that saw this movie around the same time that I did, of course asked me how I felt about it.

We debated and debated and then came the question, \\"Why you giving it a three and not a five?\\" My reponse was and I'm gonna try to say this without crapping on anyones parade who has'ne seen it yet, it was done kind of sloppy. I understand that it isn't easy putting building size bots to move like something a billion times better that those funny a55 things in power rangers, but don't bombard me with 10 different scenes and try to confuse the hect out of my perception. It's really hard to focus watching this movie man.

For example, every black character must say stupid things like \\"Damn\\" or \\"This s*** is crazy.\\"Pile on top of that the fact that this movie is about an hour longer than anything based on Transformers should ever be. The fact that they tried to create a plot, but somehow the movie is plotless still baffles me.All in all, it's a Michael bay movie. Explosions over substance, overly tanned caricatures with zero motivations, a world basked in endless magic hour glow, and a story that makes you want to smack your head against a brick wall repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Contender ... for the Worst Movie of All Time","review":"This may be the worst movie I have ever seen. Really. And it's not like I haven't seen some god-awful movies in my time.It's not that I don't like the Transformers (I can hear 'more than meets meets eye' in my sleep, and even like the Orson Wells voice-over in the 1986 theatrical version) -- it's just that this is a really BAD movie.Why? The movie tries simultaneously to be a comedy (it flunks, except for a single funny joke about 120 minutes into this 100-minute-too-long-film), a sci-fi flick (Shatner's Kirk from Star Trek III seems like he should have won an Oscar in comparison), a coming-of-age teen movie (it makes me long for Michael J. Fox's Teen Wolf), and a traditional action flick.Unfortunately, it tries to do so many things that its awfulness is so diluted that it's not even a good bad movie (ala Hudson Hawk, Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good image, not yet HD sound","review":"I'm an HD lover, it is very close with the theater experience; a widescreen lcd/plasma tv, 5.1/7.1 sound, 1080 lines, etc. The image quality of this movie is great, the effects looks just as i expected, the HD DVD format is great, despite of a lot of comments the quality is the same as in bluray but hd dvd is (or was) cheaper than BD.The only thing that i didn't like about the movie is that it doesn't use new hd sound technology such as true hd, instead of that it uses Dolby Digital Plus, it doesn't have even a DTS audio track. Since DDP is not so bad, if you don't care MUCH about the sound or you are just looking a better image than the DVD version you are going too love this title in this specific format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"As a kid I recall when the Transformers first came about. From the reviews I had the impression that it was just going to be an action flick. Boy was I surprised! There are some great comedic scenes! And boy that Megan Fox is not too hard on the eyes either.In my opinion, this movie is great for the adults as well as being safe enough for the kiddos. If you have not seen it, it is definitely a \\"must see.\\" And it is one that you probably would want for your personal library of movies as well. I can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked the movie, HATE the DVD","review":"All my other SD DVDs look great upsampled to 1080i. This one doesn't. It is just too dark and the colors are frequently very wrong. I saw the movie twice in the theater and it looked great. I only wish I had rented the DVD before buying.

I thought That it will has lots of documentaries about concept design and special effects, but is mostly about talking with Michael Bay and militar people bla .. bla bla...There is a short part dedicated to show some concept illustrations for some scenes but it's very short.Star wars Episode 2 or 3, and the Lord of the rings trilogy (extended edition) have really nice documentaries, lots of images, lots of sculptures, concept design, digital FX makings etc...I was disappointed with this \\"special edition\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Life lessons.","review":"If you think duty, selflessness, and honor are important qualities in life, then you will find far more in these Transformer movies than just great special effects and simple plots, no matter how old you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action-packed, good special effects","review":"This movie was better on the big screen. It's not quite the same when you watch it on TV, but then again, no movie really is. Lot's of action and cool special effects, but some of the effects were so complex that it was too hard to really see what was going on. When they transform, it just looks like a jumbled mass changing shape. There's not really any definition as to where the parts are moving to. Some of the dialouge was kind of cheesy. But again-action, special effects and a hot cast = decent movie experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Transformers is strictly for young teens","review":"Watched with 11 year old son. He loved and I hated it. Dialog borders on brain dead with plot that makes no sense. You just wade through mindless drivel waiting for action that is mediocre.

Both of them are of course more expensive. A little greedy here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlative transfer to Blu ray","review":"I'm giving this movie a high rating not so much for the movie itself, but for its outstanding transfer to Blu ray.

I bought it online because I was expecting a better buy but in the end, incuding the shipping I was better off buying it at Wal-Mart. This seller had no interest in fixing the problem and only answered me when it was convineint for the seller. Buy at own risk.

Other than the movie, it doesn't have interesting special features.

I am a fan of the original series and went out and bought the DVD without seeing it in the theaters. I went in it with no expectations and watched it with my wife (she wanted to watch it...I was happy watching Dexter Series 1 DVD). We both hated it. It was the worse movie we have seen this year. Dancing Robots (Jazz)...WTF, All Spark (just call it Energon Cube), Sam instead of Spike, stupid sex stuff, dog peeing on one of the autobots, stupid one-liners, and the computer animation. The list goes on...your life will be better if you do not see this film nor will you waste 2 hours of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Human Robots!","review":"When I see a movie with no inclination to view it again that's a movie that did not do it's job. The reason for the two stars goes to the robotics, these metal giants looked good and the transformations were cool. The movie overall was ridiculous. Imagine, you are told that certain things need to get done otherwise the planet you know as earth will be destroyed, coupled with mind bogling harvoc going on all around, you are worried about your mother's rose garden. Pathetically unrealistic! The Transformers looked and acted more real than the humans. Maybe this is what Stephen tried to convey, that humans are becoming robots in their day to day activities.

Lot's of action, comedy and adventure! I LOVE when they use well known American icon's, such as the Hoover Dam, and explain it was always a cover-up for something we American's couldn't possibly fathom!We enjoyed the movie extra's about the cast and seeing the level of detail that they put into the special effects in the movie.

The military is amazing, the dialogue is cute, all in all too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing in Blu Ray","review":"The quality of the film in Blu Ray is amazing. All the details, and color are just simply breathtaking. When I watched this movie at home in HD, it looked a lot better and more realistic to me than it did in the theater. If you have a blu ray player, and own this on standard DVD, you need to upgrade to the Blu Ray version. There is a world of difference. Enhanced audio, and superb picture quality makes this a must own in anyone's library. If you want to show off your TV's capabilities, this is the movie to do it with.I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than I Expected","review":"Many cartoons that I grew up with and was turned into movies were flops...not Transformers. There were some slow parts, but when they finally introduced the Decepticons, business picked up. There's one scene in particular that's memorable, but I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it. It's a must have for any Transformers fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See!","review":"The original Transformers movie has some of the most creative and spectacular special effects ever recorded on film. It is a must see for any Sci-Fi enthusiast. The details create a multitude of emotions throughout the movie. Even people that are not particularly interested in Sci-Fi movies will enjoy this film. It is well worth the time and I think it is most excellent! I am looking forward to the release of the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A high action must have for blu-ray owners.","review":"This movie is a high action movie with excellent audio and visual effects. It is a must have for the hi-def media room aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than meets the eye!","review":"Transformers is one of my all time favorite movies! Michael Bay did an excellant job. I was so blown away when I first saw it, since then I have watched it over a million times! You cant help but fall in love with Bumblebee and Optimus Prime. The Autobots are true heros. Megatron did have some corny sayings, but I mean what can expect, he's a villian robot!This movie left me wanting my 97' chyrsler cirrus to turn into an autobot!The graphics are beyond cool and seem almost life-like. Shia Lebouf did an excellant acting job, Megan Fox not so much: she was a bit on the annoying side, but I'm sure all the guys loved her. I hear the sequel is coming out in June 2009, I hope thats true. I'm definitely going to the midnight showing =) If you watch Transformers you are going to want to jump right into the action scenes to save the All-Spark and to save bumblebee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie!!!","review":"We love this movie!!! The special effects where awesome (even thought as many others have reviewed the transformations seemed to have been too fast...It still rocked.) Loved that they brought this back!!!! Story is great, actors are wonderful... would recommend everyone who are transformer fans or not to go out and get this action packed movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that's what I call a hybrid!","review":"Blockbuster movies live or die according to their level of humour. That's my opinion, anyhoo. Luckily TRANSFORMERS strikes just the right tone. It never takes itself too seriously and is often funny as well as spectacular. There's nothing remotely cerebral here but that's par for the course: intellectuality is not what such movies are about. The performances are solid if unremarkable with the exception of Jon Tuturro, who stands out in his role as a self-important man in black. This movie is a thrill ride from start to finish, it features some truly spectacular effects, and in the end the unlikely hero gets the super-hot girl. What more could you want from such a hefty slice of Hollywood hokum?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie","review":"I love this movie.

It should rent for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This introduced a new generation to the Transformers and honored the Inner Child in many Adults.The Autobots and Dicepticons were alive, smart and individual. Bumble-Bee and Jazz were excellent comic relief.Iron-hide was a warrior. Optimus Prime a leader and a warrior. Megatron a tyrant. Star-Scream an ambitious fool.The battles were vivid and intense, emotionally and physically - for transformers and humans.This gave Megan and Shia their careers. The audience experienced the transformers through their eyes,and the chemistry between them was irresistible.This movie was wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I originally purchased an HDDVD Player solely because Transformers was only on HDDVD (still paying for that mistake). I didn't think it would be a big upgrade from HDDVD to BluRay for Transformers but it is. It is huge especially the urban sequences. Also, decepticon faces are very visible and you can make greater sense of who is fighting in the final confrontation. This is the BluRay you must have if you want to show someone why to get one or just to show off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Great Price","review":"I bought this on a black Friday special for $9.99. Watching it again in Blu-Ray was a real treat, especially for that cheap.

Extras and bonus featuresjust as good as movie. If you grew up watchingtransformers....it's a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exelent movie","review":"This was probably one of the best films of the summer, considering most others were just flops and poorly done. this one is an actual Gem, I'm a 17 year old who doesnt even like the serious of Transformers, but this movie caught my eye, partially because of Micheal Bay and SS. But yes, i will admit the movie is sometimes to much action happening too fast for someone to gather it all, but that would not be a problem with a smaller screen, not some movie theater sized screen. But anywho, the movie itself is well done, some stupid homour, but cool, almost believable storyline, great action, and of course, a love story thrown in to appeal to the ladies. I highly recomend this movie. Im not giving it a 5 because i rarely give fives for anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Fun","review":"I don't understand all the negative reviews I've seen for this movie. This is a great movie for kids and parents with non-stop action and a good storyline. Is it Gone With The Wind or The Wizard of Oz- no, but it's more entertaining than 99% of the mess coming out of Hollywood these days. At least it's something different. I saw it at the theater with my kids and they'll be getting a copy for Christmas also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"Good movie, not fond of the shaky cam, action that is too fast, and overkill on explosions, but maybe that is just Bay's style. I am also not to fond of the new TF looks except Optimus and Bumblebee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Chinese Bootleg","review":"Picture and sound quality is terrible compared to what I enjoyed in the theater.

I'm not going to get the HD DVD player just because of 1 movie , some people might also think that way and paramount you're suck big time don't u know just 1% of the whole world who's going to buy that movie in blue-ray format now they are gone"},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A LOAD OF CRAP","review":"This was one of those films that had me looking at everything in the cinema except the screen. When I saw the trailer I thought this film could be excellent. A good story, great action scenes (which Michael Bay is excellent at) and top notch movie effects. Yes, it had the visual effects and some brilliant action scenes. But very little else. What a disappointment. The whole parent interrogation scene and robots in the garden was utterly ridiculous. So bad I couldn't believe I was watching the same movie. And 3 hours long - there was at least 1 hour of TOTAL NONSENSE.Michael Bay you absolutely butchered it. This film is an insult to our intelligence. Please...please....do not purchase this DVD....you will be disappointed.And I hear Mr. Bay is already contracted for TRANSFORMERS 2 in 2009-2010! Looks like no end to the misery......"},{"rating":"1","title":"This film sucks","review":"When I watched this movie, I found the acting very poor, there was no transforming noise, when the transformers transformed. Why on earth did they change what the transformers look like? Bumblebee was always a beetle and Megatron was a gun (or tank, depending if you reference the 80's or Transformers Armada) plus they called the tank Devastator, please that's the name given to the constructionbots when they transform into one big robot.

A great example of super Blu-Ray reviews are those Amazon customer reviews for PREDATOR - those reviews told me a lot about the transfer and the extras, and warned me that I probably didn't want to invest in the current Blu-Ray release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blank DVD","review":"I loved this movie when I went to go see it in the theatre so I wanted to buy it on DVD. I tried to play it in my HD DVD player, my friends PS3 and it didnt work at all.

What was up with Tyrese's lips in the first scene? Other than that I absolutely loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone. My Mom who dislikes all things non-romantic comedy enjoyed it also! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, Excelent bonus content","review":"Possibly the best thing about HD-DVD is the web content. When I first got the movie in the mail, of course I had to watch it with the home setup. A few weeks later I got my HD-DVD player hooked up the the web after getting the update in the mail and it made the movie even better. I am not sure how much storage in on the dvd player but it downloads relatively fast on my network and once you watch the little extra clips you can just delete them. The extra downloadable stuff is not necessary to enjoy the movie and the 1080 pic with surround sound is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"How badly can a movie suck?","review":"The answer is VERY. This movie was horrible!!!One of the worst my husband and I have seen. If you enjoyed the original transformers cartoons, then PLEASE avoid this at any cost. It will ruin the memories for you. The acting is bad, the robots are so shiny and ridiculous that it's hard to tell what they are, and the girl who is a former juvenile delinquint is just plain ridiculous as well. I have nothing good to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but not my thing","review":"This movie is action packed and entertaining. I must say though that I never saw the cartoon or followed it. I think it would be a good flick to take your teen kids and under too but I found it to be more of a kid movie.

It just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you give negative stars?","review":"TransformersI was over at my stepson's for Thanksgiving and he put Transformers into the DVD player and was so excited about it being a great movie. At first I wasn't sure what to make of it. By the end of the movie I became convinced that the writers' strike must have been before the movie was made.

No, there is no storyline whatsoever, just action and more of it. Music does the actingjob and SFX fills in a lot of desired eyecandy.

Thankfully the makers didn't retro it in any way: each generation of moviemaker should create their own version and they have succeeded immensely in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I think this movie was great. My son is 5 and loved it, although got upset when bumblebee was captured, we had to leave the theater. He loves the transformers. I went back to see it again with my husband, we loved it.

But when I chase the history of those who emigrated from Norway, I don't know if you could even describe \\"typical\\". Chance played a huge role in who met whom, who married whom and settled where ever.These folks sailed away from Norway ,or Germany, or....into an unknown and uncertain future.I believe this movie PERFECTLY captures the role played by chance, circumstance,character, and HARD WORK in settling the West.Ross Kane"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommend","review":"This is such a well conceived film that should be seen by a much larger audience.

This is a propaganda film, made by Marxists, for Marxists.The multiple flashbacks to different time periods are done badly and as a result are confusing. The plot is implausible.

His voice- so gorgeous a few years before- is shot. Nothing to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic","review":"Whoever thought of bringing back and remastering this cd? It is a horror. For the most part, Sinatra's singing is forced, murky and lifeless.Firstly, Sinatra sings \\"My Baby Just Cares For Me\\" like a funeral dirge. It is supposed to be sang to a fast tempo.His rendition of \\"Downtown\\" lacks the excitement and vitality of Petula Clarke's original recording. EVEN WORSE, Sinatra makes a noise that sounds like a frog croaking or a long burp several times during the song! What's that all about? Being this crummy, the song never should have been included.And as to the 3 added \\"bonus tracks,\\" they are 3 of the same songs, but in a live version, that are already included on the CD. Ripoff city.I'm a big fan of Sinatra; however, these are the lowest standards ever employed on an album of his. It is shamefull that Concord ever realeased this disgrace."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite reprise","review":"Actually this was my second Sinatra album. Ol Blue Eyes IS Back being the first. Being a generation behind this artist I had to go through a few rock albums first. One night on the radio I heard his rendition of Send In The Clowns and many albums, concerts and joyful days gone by he is still the guy. I own most of the available catalog from lp to cd and this record just swings for me. Give Nelson Riddle much credit for this. Anytime he collaborated with Sinatra, great recordings came forth. (Try the L. Ronstadt standards he was involved with. It's her best work).It is strange that the title track is my least favorite. It's just dull, however the rest is wonderful and well worth having. It may be my favorite Sinatra album just for the fact that it was the first great album of his that I bought. Although as a whole, I would take the Capital recordings to the Island if given the tough choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The '60s meet the Chairman","review":"'Strangers' was a huge Sinatra hit and the kind of material he disliked, but most of the songs here are much more substantial than 'Strangers' or the Petula Clark hit 'Downtown' (which is more dated than the much older and much better 'All or Nothing at All').'Summer Wind' and 'All or Nothing at All' are probably worth the price of the album. FS sounds great throughout. This is NOT essential Sinatra, but it is fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doo be doo be doo...","review":"\\"Strangers in the Night\\" was Frank Sinatra's first big hit single since \\"Witchcraft\\", eight years earlier. Some people apparently don't care for the song, but it did win the Grammy for Record of the Year (for what it's worth). Back in the 1960s, when someone had a smash hit single they would usually title the subsequent album after it, which is the case here. The album also includes the follow up single, \\"Summer Wind\\", which was also a hit, albeit not as big a one. The rest of the album features a seemingly random mix of songs, some old and some new. Sinatra sings the songs well, but some of the songs don't really suit him, like \\"Downtown\\" and \\"Yes Sir, That's My Baby\\". Overall, a pretty good album, albeit a short one (27 minutes long)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good choice.","review":"I bought this and it did not even work, plus it stuck in my car, and nearly broke it when I tried to pull it out of the cigarette lighter area.Not worth the $$..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned for exchange, but didn't get the ideam back","review":"as I said, the iteam I received didn't work at all.

The story of the AVG is one of the great romantic, adventure stories in American aviation history. And, for the most part, that is how it has been portrayed leaving one to wonder what really happened out there in those skies over China and Burma so long ago?

I couldn't suspend disbelief to accept that her wine knowledge from reading in the library was good enough to impress a vineyard owner so that he offered her a job. When Nikki talks about wine, it just seems so phony (and I'm not a wine expert). None of the characters were all that likeable to me. Wealth and good looks seem to be most admired characteristics.

The advice is not flighty, it is backed up with evidence from scientific studies. People who do vaccinate also need this advice because their children can get the diseases.I found the historical section amazing. We have been taught to believe untrue myths, and every parent needs to know the true historical facts, especially about Pasteur and Jenner.I liked the amusing anecdotes about the way believers in vaccination behave, and after reading it I am better able to cope with the anger that my decision not to vaccinate provokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written and Easy To Read","review":"I highly recommend this book to any parent who is seeking information about vaccination.

I am a Registered Nurse of 14 years, mother of five vaccinated children and work in a pediatric office.

It features Ol' Blue Eyes' worst ever arranger, Ernie Freeman, who was responsible for taking the aging Sinatra into the realm of middle-of-the-road pop. If you dislike \\"Strangers In The Night\\" (I know I do), then you'll get just the same kind of garbage with this record.This is a hardcore fan speaking here... I wouldn't speak evil of that record if there was any redeeming feature to it, only I can see none! So stick to the 1954-1964 Sinatra, and you'll never go wrong. After that, it takes a little listening before you buy the stuff. Albums arranged by Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Gordon Jenkins or Neal Hefti are keepers... As for the ones by Don Costa and Ernie Freeman, well, you can't say you haven't been warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"I thought this was some kind of joke, offering a HQ SHM-CD, by Universal Music (Japan), and the sound quality of my favorite tune, \\"That's Life\\", sounds utterly bad!

This DJ found Hudson Bell's, \\"Captain of the Old Girls\\" a few years ago and was stunned by its brilliant song-writer and great guitars. Hudson Bell takes a ballad and rips its out so that you actually feel the story he tells. I waited for his next one for far too long and found \\"When the Sun is the Moon\\" this October. I have heard people erroneously call it his debut (Buy \\"Captain\\" too!) The lyrics are stunning, gothic southern, and the fuzzy loud guitars don't tear you away from his poetics.

In real life these people would never have made it across the country because they spent 90% of their time talking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and unsure","review":"This is my first read by Jane Kirkpatrick. It will most likely be my last. This book really was such a slow read! I actually had a few conversations with friends about this book stating that I need to be ok with putting aside a book that I really do not like. I usually try to always finish a book I start. This one I wish I would of done this. Loose ends were hanging all over the place. On page 313 (of my hardbound copy) we get the idea that one of the main characters (Ruth) is finally going to get to meet her foe, then on the next page it is is just idle chatter. It makes no sense, though I read this section over & over trying to get the drift. Thinking is there a page missing, did I turn two at once etc. I found this book really just paragraphs of this & that with VERY weak characters, I did not cheer or hate anyone in the book. Blah. I gave it a rating two only because there was a bit of history in it that was interesting but even this was weak and perhaps a tad too fabricated."},{"rating":"1","title":"thumbs down","review":"I started this book with gusto. The writing was well done, the character's well developed, the speed moving along nicely. The first couple of chapters had quite a bit of action and was a page turner...and then middle of the book-bam...nothing. The story gets slooooow. Suddenly the author is going on and on about things in the characters lives that are uninteresting and of little point. The action dies completely. I struggled on, thinking it would pick back up, but gave up on the last 70 or so pages. I didn't even have enough interest to find out what happened to the characters and just felt cheated at having spent the time I did reading it. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book of Platitudes","review":"This book was a big disappointment. The story line had an interesting premise, and I was really looking forward to reading it. The dialogue between the characters was so filled with \\"homilies\\" and \\"down-home\\" truisms that it distracted from the story line. I had to force myself to finish this book, and found myself saying out loud, \\"Oh please, give me a break!\\" The unrealistic dialogue made the characters unbelievable. I certainly would not recommend this book and do not intend to read any more books by this author unless she works on her dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I like historical fiction, so I thought this would be a good book.

The book does offer that. However, I had a hard time staying interested. It was hard keeping track of the characters - if I had a nickle for everytime I turned to the page listing Cast of Characters, I could have paid for the book. This book moves very slow, there is not much action or suspense. Much time is spent on emotions and personalities.

Jane takes you right along with them on the hot dusty trail through many emotions...but such unity at the same time. I loved the history of the book. You can tell she has really done her homework in this department. It always amazes me when the wagon train adventure is portrayed on television. The women all look like they just stepped out of a clothing shop. How could you possibly look great after all those miles, little water to bathe in, and lack of supplies? This book told it how it really was. Being a Christian, I enjoyed the fact that God entered into this story several times. These women truly needed faith to make it on a journey this long. I am so looking forward to the next in the series. Jane Kirkpatrick's books are the most outstanding historical novels, both in historic accuracy and just plain good reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Together in All Places","review":"Incredibly powerful story. In reading of Ms. Kirkpatrick's research there is only one way this story could have flowed and held my attention til all hours of the night. Awesome book!

Ramage speaks with Lord Nelson and smugglers alike, takes passage for \\"Boney's\\" France, is astounded and becomes a shipwright, employs a thief, speaks to a policman of knives and sealing wax, and joins the French army! One suspects that Liberty - Equality - Fraternity meant only the liberty to reduce your brother citizens into equal misery. Of course, the British Navy's blockade also had something to do with the desperate state of the French economy revealed here (and rarely depicted in other seafaring series).If you like stories of the Napoleonic era you'll enjoy this close up view of the French Terror into which idealists descended, but if your desire is only battle at sea this volume will disappoint. As far as I know this is the only nautical novel that brings its naval hero so far and long into enemy France (perhaps Pope is fulfilling the promise of C.S. Forester's \\"Hornblower During The Crisis\\" left unfinished by Forester's death before HH gets ashore)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I've been slowly knocking off the Ramage novels, but after this one I'm taking a hiatus. Ramage, our hero, is sent to France as a spy, so we have more intrigue than action. Fine. This should have been a great thriller, but it turns out to be a long, tedious, even boring novel. Pope just can't say in 3 pages what he can say in 50 and it wears thin after a while. Most naval fiction novels consist of a series of episodes, but Pope's books tend to be one long story. Nothing wrong with that, but if there is nothing to keep you interested, then reading it becomes a chore. And that's what this is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunk With No Survivors.","review":"This is a superficial and forgetable effort at historical writing. Heavily padded because of a very thin plot, all of what passes for action is carried by secondary characters sometimes acting off-stage, as Ramage, the \\"hero\\", spends pages ruminating on his navel. The author tries to flaunt his research by inserting unnecessary multi-page historical data which add nothing, while stopping the weak story in its tracks. In the end, the plot works, and the hero is triumphant only by coincidence, resourceful secondary characters, and ignorant villians. This was the first Pope book I have read (and the last) and does not compare in any way with the works of Conrad,O'Brian, Forester or Kent."},{"rating":"2","title":"patio blinds","review":"Great service as first shipment was damaged but quickly replaced with fast shipping .

The rest of the coverage is comparable to previous years, meaning it is excellent. Absolute must-have for any Formula 1 fan.Cons: Minus one star due to one defect - with a single-disc running time that has reached 225 minutes, the video quality (compression) appears to have been compromised throughout and is rather poor in the high-speed sections.

Once I sent it in for replacement, I was told that the copy I sent out was bootlegged. I must confess that the footage on this DVD is on par with the bootlegged version I purchased in the past.The video is highly compressed, so that any time video changes, the images are incredibly pixilated and it takes some time for frames to settle to show a crisp, static imagine. I am viewing this DVD on a standard CRT TV and it can not even be compared to the DirecTV broadcast I saw last year. I can only imagine how bad it will show it self on an HD screen.So, if you are interested in the Formula 1 and want to have a memorable 2006 season, I can only say that SRO Entertainment has given us a very poor version to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"F1 2006","review":"If you enjoy F1, this is the DVD to get!

Easy cleanup as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shedding blade is more economical","review":"The furminator works just OK. It has very tiny teeth so you have to clean after every stroke. I found the straightness of the blade unforgiving to a horse's natural contours and it is surprisingly heavy. Your money is better spent on a 5-10 dollar round shedding blade, which I will order shortly. The packaging warns you about protecting the teeth and I suspect one drop on a concrete floor and it would all be over for this tool. This will probably sit on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Furminator","review":"I have not found this product to work any better than any other deshedder on the market & think it is highly overpriced.

I have always used a traditional shedding blade/scrapper on my horses, but when it broke this spring I took the small cat furminator out to the barn just to see how it would work. Didn't take me long to be convinced to invest in this model and it is AMAZING how much hair you can remove in a short amount of time. Also, my horses love it. Apparently a rythmic stroke over the major muscle groups feels really good as they both were leaning into me for more.

He loves it! Instead of raking his skin (as do the shedding blade and curry), this just grabs the hair that's ready to go and pulls it away in a sweep. No pressure is needed.

I now consider Echolyn to be one of the best 5 prog bands of the 90's based on the merits this album. If there was ever an album that grows on you . . .The joy with music like this is the anticipation of all those complex changes and weird tempo shifts. This is just about the most complex progressive rock album I have ever heard that is still accessable enough to enjoy doing most anything from driving to just hanging out.To me it's like a cross between Gentle Giant and Jethro Tull's \\"Songs From the Wood\\" album on amphetamines.

It was a load of joy and surprises. This story was more formal than the whimsical title yet the story captured the life of the Tour Guide. Another view would be the story of the children when the Red Truck arrived. It was a dream come to reality and hopes that saw completion. This was an adult presentation about the dreams of a child. This dream to promote theater for children came across as the duty of the adult to compliment the failure of school boards.

Bernard Dadié demonstrates that he is an educated man and astute observer of the world from page one. His observations, sometimes comical and sometimes dark, but always candid reveal Dadié's commitment to honesty and fair dealing. His narrative style is not unlike stream-of-consciousness lists and he takes it a step further by pulling the reader beyond the list into the experience of thought, the act of seeing, the process of judging and evaluating a novel situation. There is a certain poetry and energy in this book that Jo Patterson translates beautifully into English. Reading this book is as close as a reader can get to seeing America through the eyes of a foreign dignitary and first-time tourist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Visually stunning (better than my comparable desktop) sharp display, good speed.

Each entry contains a somewhat limiting, but very convenient, numbered list of different perspectives and ideas on the subject-- and each item on each list usually contains a reference to another section of the dictionary.

The rewrites changed much of the emotional content of the story, and actually made it harder to understand. Finally, when it comes right down to it, i felt that Dick van Dyke missed many of the traits for the character. It's an excellent show, and if it's ever being performed in a close vicinity to yourself, then go see it! but the film is not nearly as good. And also, it's a good show assuming the lead actors understand the roles...since the entire story hinges on two characters, they are extremely important and can either help or destroy the show.Also, contrary to what somewhat else said, Milan Stitt wrote the play in the 70's, and then rewrote the screenplay very soon after it was a hit on broadway in the same decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking with Dinosaurs","review":"When they said \\"USED, in NEW CONDTION\\", It Was Like New!!

There is certainly a lot that we don't know about these animals and any show is going to require a lot of speculation on this subject. What \\"Walking with Dinosaurs\\" does with this speculation is the most entertaining and visually stunning achievement with this material to date. The CGI and animatronics used here go well beyond Jurassic Park and others, not surprisinng, since CGI has grown in sophistication over the years. (7 Years is an eternity in CGI). What really distinguishes this show is the beautiful and dramatic way the Great Beasts are offered to us. Nobody has ever brought us so close and the animals themselves are really engaging.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of her profiles is the way many of them reveal the dynamics between two powerful leaders at companies like Microsoft and Intel. We [...] recommend this book as a brief introduction to the men and women whom history will record as the titans of turn-of-the-century technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cargo's yet!","review":"Ordered these back in April and have been wearing the living daylights out of them! The size runs true, I'm a big guy and I bought the 44x32, they are super comfortable with room to move. Slightly longish for a 32L but true to the product picture they do collect a bit around your ankles. Lots of pockets for anything from keys, smokes, lights, cellphone(s) et. al. They fit right, you will be complimented on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great construction pants","review":"bought these because they can withstand anything the jobsite dishes out. Love the cargo pockets to keep my phone and wallet close by whle still wearing my bags at work. Don't shrink. Pockets last 3 years after putting linemen in them all the time. Color took over a year of washing to fade. They even come in odd sizes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work pants","review":"These are excellent work pants. I would recommend them to anyone. They are well made, heavy duty, and have five belt loops. Also reinforced knees. They make excellent fishing pants in cooler weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!","review":"My husband LOVES these pants! They hold up in the construction business and look nice when he goes out on job bids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Design out of this world","review":"Very comfortable design and fits very well, rugged and material is very nice, wish to have the whole color serie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware.","review":"The pants that i ordered were suppose to be some what grey/stone. But the color of the pants that i bought were Forest green, and whrn i attempted to put them on they did not fit. They are not true to size. I cant seem to get ahold of the seller, so i guess im out of luck. Guess thats what i should of expected when ordering online. Was surprised to see all the good reviews considering my experience was not so pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I bought these pants for my son who always complains about the seat room in his jeans. He loves them and says he has complete movement without binding. He loves the material and has only good things to say about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same as the ones i purchased from wrangler.com .....","review":"I have been buying these for my husband for the past few years from wrangler.com - these are not the same im thinking they may have been seconds were cut HUGE my hubby is drowned by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruff fabric","review":"Overall good product however, the pocket material is ruff and gives me the chills everytime I put my hand in them.If you have dry skin like me you might not like these pants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pants","review":"These pants are the greatest things! My husband is a farmer, and is hard on his work pants. These last and last. They also have all the pockets he needs to carry his Leatherman, his flashlight, and a few other tools he uses regularly. They are also nice enough for a trip to town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected","review":"These are great pants! Love the extra pockets which is what I really wanted and is surprisingly hard to find anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get them while you can..","review":"These are great fitting, casual pants that take a days work easily. The cotton, rip-stop weave is light, tough and very comfortable. The design of the crotch is very roomy and has made these pants my favorites for summer motorcycle riding. It's a shame Riggs (Wrangler/ VF Jeanswear) stopped making them. A little pricy, but I've still got my first pair from 4 yrs ago. They are a little stiff when new, but one hot wash and they loosen right up. I do wash mine inside out because the darker colors tend to fade a bit. Cold with a good cold water detergent and all is good. They don't stain very easily thanks to a additive on the fabric. Not quite scotch-guard, but not a sponge like plain cotton.. Don't buy these, you may like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pants!","review":"First I would like to thank Amazon and all those who leave feedback on reviews.After reading the reviews, I decided to oder a pair.I am very pleased with how durable and the comfort is great.These pants are nothing like Dickies heavy work pants,all stiff and uncomfortable.The Riggs are so comffie,I have been wearing them since they have arrived.I chose to wear them over my favorite jeans.I know that I will get many years of wear.Like others say in their reviews,these pants are a little heavy because of the double material in the front and in the lineing of pockets.You can't beat the comfort and the durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good quality","review":"My husband loves these pants as they fit well and they have a rugged, sturdy quality. A deifinte must for anyone who works hard as they will take a beating. I just wash them regularly and they come out as good as new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pants!","review":"These are some awesome pants. I only wish they were available in navy blue. That is the color I have to wear at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"please more colors","review":"I have been wearing these pants for 6 months now and love them however I am required by my employer to wear a uniform. These pants qualify but I need black and or navy colors I hope wrangler can provide these colors in the near future. I do hvac work and cant imagine how I got along without these pants for so long. I simply love them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, fit well. thinking about purchasing another pair or two","review":"good quality. wear well. going to purchase a few more pairs. leather pocket protector for tape measure and other pockets are well placed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rugged work wear","review":"Heavy-gauge material, seems pretty durable. Ran true to size. Time will tell how they hold up, but they seem rugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"working pants","review":"Great fit. Some threads were loose, but not bad to deal with.Will be buying more soon. Not too thick but comfortable to wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Ordered the same size that I have ordered both on line and purchased direct from stores, these must have shrunk on the plane. Have spent $90.00 on freight for a product that is not measured at an industry standard"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality, durable","review":"I want pants to last, but look good. These are cargo pants on steroids. Functional, durable, look great. I may order another pair soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pants After a Few Washings","review":"When I first wore these they were extremely uncomfortable but after 3-4 washes they are very comfortable and still sturdy. At first I couldn't even use the pockets but now I can.So your first impression may be bad but wash them a few times and they are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat daddy","review":"These pants are very functional. The cargo pockets will actually hold stuff. These pants are almost biar proof and are excellent for busting through the bushes. They provide great comfort and are range of motion all in all no down side I have put these pant to the test and they pass with an A."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very durable","review":"I bought a pair of these pants and they didn't last two days before the crotch tore out of them. Seems like the only pants that last long are blue jeans anymore. Unless I am doing something wrong the crotch tear out is a major issue with all non-blue jean pants I buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes they are that good.","review":"I got these to replace my warnout carhearts and I have no plans of going back. The added features for the difference in price point make these Riggs are worth their wait on the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need to be aware of fit!","review":"I ordered the first pair of pants. Tried them on when I got them and they did not fit. I had read the reviews for these pants and they had said sizes we're odd so I ordered them a little large. The pants are very good quality and crafted well but it seemed that they would have fit a woman better than myself even at 2 sizes larger I could not button the pants and was swimming in the rest of the pant. All total I tried 2 pairs as to be fair neither fit I sent both back for refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the color shown","review":"These pants are green, and very dark compared to the picture... Otherwise they are okay > > > Buyer Beware!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, well-wearing and durable pants","review":"I'm a geek. I've always needed more pockets to carry tools or gadgets.These pants are made from a solid fabric; lighter than denim, heavier than 'chino' or average dress wear. After 4 washings / machine dry cycles - I don't notice any shrinkage.. but I wash cold, and dry gentle.They don't wrinkle as much as some fabrics - but they are NOT wrinkle-free.Fabric has a solid construction and drape, but is not constrictive.Another plus was the availability of large waist sizes.+1 - fit matches measurements+1 - large sizes available+1 - launders well+1 - durability+1/2 - styled well+1/2 - pockets!-1/2 - fabric is slightly coarse4.5 stars - rounded to 5...I'd definitely buy again, but I will try to hold out for a sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase will be better the second time","review":"OK, I'm a white collar guy who just wanted an alternative to jeans to play outside with my kids and then head to the store with my wife without changing. This was a completely blind purchase and these are perfect. Took them to the mountains and rode the sled in the snow and also horseback all day. They did not soak like jeans or get me cold. I live in the desert and can wear them in the warm weather. Very tough and better looking than any jeans. BUT pay heed to the reviews. Put your vanity aside and order an extra inch on the waist; they are tighter and less stretchy than your jeans. My second pair will be even better now that I know that.Cheers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very durable, but a little on the small side.","review":"I am not sure if it is a different cut, but a previous pair ordered in the same size fit much looser than these in the size I ordered. Otherwise they are great pants and super durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cargo Pants!","review":"Wrangler really did it right! Pants are sized properly ... matching the label. Very comfortable. Comes out of dryer wrinkle-free. Tons of pockets too. Have ordered 5 additional pairs in different colors. Durable and offers a nice appearance. A prompt and secure delivery was seen repeatedly. Buy with confidence.
