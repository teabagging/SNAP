During this same time period we started having problems with loose stools and poo that smelled extra-noxious.

I even tried another reviewer's idea of putting the food through the food processor with a bit of water, but the cat smelled it and still didn't want it.

They barely touch their bowls and would rather go hungry than eat it. I've been mixing it in with some wet food that I have so they'll acquire a taste for it. As many cat lovers know, Vans are very vocal. So they've been whining and crying about the food even with full dishes.

Unfortunately, my cat will not touch this stuff! In fact my other cat that does not have grain issues won't eat it either. I think some of it has to do with the fairly large, square shape of the kibble. It is almost like dog food. Other than that it is the taste. The only way I can get my cat to eat this food is to put it through the food processor to break up the large pieces and douse it with water to make it seem like wet food. (My cat has always eaten dry food so it is not a dry/wet issue). By the way, although this food says it is grain free, it does still have grain in its ingredients. This is really deceiving and I am not sure why they are able to label this food as grain free.

It's a cylinder with holes, filled with food and my cat rolls it in order to get food. While the toy is in a tray to prevent getting cat food everywhere in the house, that food makes a mess of little crumbles and gunk all over the tray and dispenser. It's never happened with other dry cat food (royal canin, science diet, orijen, etc).Also, my cat started passing huge stools since he's eating that food. Like twice as big as usually.

It was edited by the great Joseph Campbell and provides the best introduction to Jung's writings that I've come across. I always keep the volume handy, and each time I visit the various chapters I learn something new about human psychology, about the unconscious, about the shadow, about the complexities of the psyche and of human behavior itself. The volume is like a roadmap, a lonely planet guide that enables you to handle all the winds of misfortune that, without rhyme or reason, are guaranteed to hit you in life, all the grief, pain and sorrow that comprise the human experience.-Tom Maremaa, Author of the Forthcoming novel \\"Metal Heads\\" from Kunati Books in Spring 2009"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed this collection of essays","review":"This book was edited by mythologist master Joseph Campbell, and contains the excerpts from Jung's essential teachings and philosophies on mind, psychology and collective unconscious. I originally reviewed this book at a library, but enjoyed it so much, I had to purchase my own copy. Well worth the investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing beats the classics","review":"I recommend this book to clients interested in learning about Jungian thought. Just the introduction by Joseph Campbell is worth the skimpy price of admission and the depth and breath of Jung's ideas remain as powerful and intriguing today as they were when he first wrote more than 80 years ago. Concepts such as the Self, the collective unconscious, shadow, and introvert-extrovert remain great tools for self-awareness. Because it can be read in sections I often go back to it for reference and I find that every time time I do so I am rewarded with a new, deeper, understanding. Warning! You may have to use more than two neurons to digest this but the effort will be worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this","review":"This book is simply incredible.

However, I am a student. I hoped to get a book that would show me in some detail how these problems are solved. It didn't do that for even one. Not one. It did give the answer to some. It didn't even explain anything. It is what it says: a book of problems. Quite frankly, I don't think it's that hard to think of problems. The hard part is solving them.

My son would try and play with them like a normal toy, but the peices would just fall over like a domino affect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Games","review":"I expected a booklet where all the 2,3,4,5, etc. letter words are listed.It has some listings, but I used to have another booklet and I cannot find it anymore.I guess I should have read the description better, before I ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love Scrabble, get this book.","review":"\\"Everything Scrabble\\" lives up to its title.

It gives you a basic outline on improving your game. While the word lists themselves are slightly outdated, they are accurate for the most part. A word's acceptability depends upon which word source is used. The 2nd edition of The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary contained certain \\"offensive\\" terms such as \\"goy\\" (a non-Jewish person). These words were eliminated in the family friendly edition (3rd edition of The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary). The Official Word List (OWL)is the word list used in sanctioned tournaments of the National Scrabble Association. It contains words such as \\"goy\\". Everything Scrabble is the best \\"How-To\\" book on Scrabble that I've run across. I heartily recommend it to all beginning, mid-level, and starting tournament players."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmm","review":"I am not sure what to think about this movie.

To start off with the whole opening sceen is so unessasarily long. And that is how the movie progressed, unessasarily long pauses. Like I said in the title of this review I love Emile Hirsch, in fact he is the reason I bought this movie with out seeing it first, but this movie is just awful. I am a fan of movies that have an underlying plot of people coming to terms with their sexuality but this movie seems to just throw homosexual encounters in for the shock value. I would honestly and full heartedly recommend not seeing this movie unless you like really long draw out pauses, and I mean really long, and uncomfortable sceens that make your head hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding single-volume tool for deeper Bible study","review":"This book is a wonderful introduction to reading the Bible beyond the devotional level.

I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, textbook-lite","review":"Easy to read, decent layout, and informative in the area of hermeneutics.

This is not significant when reading a novel but when trying to read a weightier book it becomes a significant disadvantage. A table of contents provides the reader with the basic structure of the book which reveals how the author intends to present his/her ideas. When that framework (the table of contents) is absent it is impossible for the reader to see the big picture and hence how the material fits in the big picture. Until the Kindle version of this book includes a table of contents you would be better served to buy the print version!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Help? Hardly.","review":"I was required to read this book for my first year of Bible school and I did not get much out of it.There is a difference between books that are specifically written to HELP one interpret the Bible through suggestions, and books that TELL you how to interpret the Bible.I found this book left very little room for one to be able to make their own interpretation. It's merely an outlet for Fee/Stuart to portray the way \\"they\\" see things and to tell people they should see it the same way.

It was good as a text for exegesis and Hermeneutics. However, when I got to page 150 I was horrified to find that they made fun of one of my heroes St. Augustine for his interpretation of the good Samaritan. Look this guy wrote the great classic \\"City of God\\"! So what if his interpretation was a little weird. It lines up with scripture.Then there was another thing. The authors said that the Song of Songs was not an allegory of Christ and the Church. It darn well was to the early church fathers! I wanted to throw the book against the wall. However, since it was required reading, I would have had to walk over, pick it up and finish reading it any way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful","review":"I read this book for Bible school.

The Reformers practiced the same basic methods of Bible study that Fee is teaching in this book. The Reformers--Luther, Calvin, etc.--made themselves familiar with ancient culture and language as well as with the opinions of godly commentators before them. When the Reformation came to England the Bible Christians used was the Geneva Bible of 1599. It was the dominant Bible of English Protestants for many decades AFTER the KJV was published in 1611."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Shoud be taught in Sunday School!\\"","review":"This book presents the most practical and realistic way a student should pursue Bible Study.If more students of the Bible would latch on to these basic guidelines their lives would be richer for it.

This eminently readable book is good scholarship authored by two theologians in the evangelical tradition. The thrust of the book is spelled out in the title, \\"How to Read the Bible.\\" The authors do not insist on a particular interpretation, but show the reader HOW to go about discovering comtemporary meaning and application from these ancient documents and how to avoid faulty hermeneutics. I cannot recommend it too highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-Changing","review":"I read this book when i was 18. I am 33 now and can say that this book is foundational for the way i read, interpret, and understand scripture. It opened my eyes to reading it as it would have been read by its original audience. This is one of maybe 5 (if that) life-changing books i've ever read - pillars of my thinking. The basic premise is that the Bible cannot mean what it never meant. Thus, understanding the Bible's literary, historical & cultural context is critically important to applying & meditating on the Bible's message. It takes hard work to understand the original authors, and no one should ever shy away from this work who wishes to rightly know & live the Bible.If i could give this 100 stars, i would.

I even advised my professor of this and why I felt that this would be considered a stumbling block for growing someone's faith! There was clear evidence of it during interactive discussions within our on-line group. Be careful to read this with an open mind and ask a lot of questions to mature believers when you encounter the authors' opinions, because there are numerous examples of heresy in this book in my opinion. The most disappointing and unnerving thing is that it is required reading for study in entry level Christianity at a Christian university!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are less biased books out there","review":"I want to keep this short. I have a serious problem with this book because of their chapter on differing Bible translations on the market. These authors make no bones about their strong support for and their adoption of (they use this version all throughout their book) the most controversial bible out there: the TNIV which is a bible translation heavily influenced by feminism. They are also fiercely opposed to newer alternative versions that will not cater to cultural feminism such as the ESV, a version in which one can strongly sense their extreme hostility to it in their book. A vastly superior (and unbiased) book is \\"Grasping God's Word\\" by J. Scott Duvall and J. Daniel Hays. I hope this helps you.

I ended up disagreeing with a lot of this book. I'm somewhat bummed. The title is pretty pretentious but I was hoping that the authors would be on the right track at least, as a lot of Christians do not know what they are reading at times.But I digress, they had comparisons that were silly (comparing parables to jokes just irked me) and they took off on their own opinions with very little to back them up except a \\"hope\\" they were right. They gave little or no credit to great Christian minds of the past and disregarded a lot of scholarly work.I had to read it for my bible class at a university and I was disappointed.

Because in chapter 4 and 6 He pushes his theology on you in how he studies the Bible using Acts and 1 Corinthians as his examples. This is an issue that could be considered an conflict or a contradiction to HONEST Hermeneutics. Like He said in the book, everybody brings something to the table when they read the Bible, and He is no exception.It is good for basic bible study, but the flow is sometimes difficult because he doesn't have a polished style of communicating. If you are looking for an intro to Bible study this could work, and he does go into Hermeneutics to a degree, but there are other books out there that are more helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book gave me a greater love for the Bible.

Not only did it give a new perspective on how to read the Bible, but makes reading more enjoyable. It describes how to get the most out of the reading, with understanding of the times and circumstances that the bodies of work were written.

Secondly, the way he ends disk two is brilliant. At first I was a little upset that he chopped off the hardest part of the track, but after a few listens I saw the genius in it.

IF god was a dj, his name would be Sasha.What i always admire about Sasha and JD was that they always had their own style. They never ever sold out and play the big club anthems on their sets.

They are all engrossing, particularly the title story. Loved it so much I sent my daughter a copy and she loved reading it as well. Highly recommended to anyone and a NOT TO BE MISSED work for any Pushkin fan. As usual, one wishes one could read it in Russian and avoid the translation idiosyncracies, but that is life."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid introduction to Pushkin","review":"Pushkin is the Godfather of Russian literature. _The Captain's Daughter and other Other Stories_ is a decent representation of his writing style, but I found the stories much less interesting than his poetry. With that said, the title piece is by far the strongest of the collection. The story is full of high drama, love, intrigue and betrayal, as the main character struggles to maintain his sense of honor and dignity. It was a bit over the top for me, but no one writes about human emotion with the depth that Pushkin does. For that alone, _The Captain's Daughter_ is worth the read. Skip the other stories. In the final analysis, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master of Russian Literature","review":"Pushkin greatest renoun is based on his poetry.

It's definitely John Waters' most mainstream to date, yet manages to continue his legacy of wry humor, and in-your-face political statements without you even realising it. Ricki Lake was perfect as Tracy, and Divine the perfect mother!

The songs and production are actually a step up from their previous album. I have been a Witness fan since the late 1980s, and I have always admired their singing, their unique style, and the classy elegance of their music. Michael Brooks is a great songwriter. You can count on the lyrics to be scriptural. I'm glad Witness hasn't changed. Their music isn't for everybody, but it is definitely quality. Lisa Page Brooks is in a class all by herself!

This one isn't QUITE as good as the soloists aren't that wonderful (the ones doing solos in The Little Mermaid in particular are lacking) and the arrangements aren't as emotionally lifting, but it's by no means a bad album. I suspect part of the problem is that this was released so soon after the Disney Renaissance films came out, so there was less time to perfect arrangements and pick better soloists. Still, if you liked the previous album, or like orchestral/choral rearrangements and/or Disney music, give this a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great version of Disney Music...Eric Kunzel is fantastic artist.","review":"The music of Disney movies are always wonderful. Here is an excellent version of the 4 most emblematic: \\"The Lion King\\", \\"Aladdin\\" (my favorite), \\"The Little Mermaid\\" and the unforgettable \\"Beauty andthe Beast\\". Superb interpretation of the great Erich Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra is simply masterful, a really wonderful sound. An extraordinary recording. The interesting option to present these beautiful songs in coral version and the members of Indiana University Hoosiers are excellent. An ensemble and cohesion in the voices of magnificent quality.

There is some luck involved and some skill involved at answering questions about the princess movies. There is trivia (answering questions about princess movies), reading lines from the movies correctly, guessing # of items shown game, dancing, and many \\"which princes or princess movie does this belong to\\" games.

You earn blue ribbons by answering dog questions that can be from any Disney movie with dogs. There are 2 ways you can play family or expert(I think it's called). We've played the family and it's hard. And when you get an answer wrong it doesn't tell you the correct answer. It's a little frustrating for our 4 year old, but she does want to play and she knows to stay way from Sneaky Pete's square which makes you loose a ribbon or other squares you might loose a turn.

The girls from \\"Bandits\\" do a lovely cover, but it isn't an original song from the film.

This album has the basic acoustics, pleasant harmony vocals, and at times, eerie uprising \\"Oh-hs\\".This cd features great indie-rock talents, and the ability to calm the listener down, but I am a bit dissapointed some of the bands featured here barely play a chord, or hardly show off their talents. However this is made up for by the other bands. I guess your basic idea is that this Reindeer Section is a complete band within itself, which is cool with me, but still I was listening for some Looper in there, which I didn't get.Bottom line: The cd is great for those that enjoy soft music, and don't mind waiting a while for the good stuff. However, it may take a few times to listen to it, to get used to liking it. In my case, 2 times, but that's just me.

That's why I love the literature of the South. I've read all of Robert Inman's books recently -- they all have that great storytelling quality that all great Southern novels share. Old Dogs and Children is a wonderful, hopeful and heartbreaking book about the choices we make and the way they affect us and the people around is. It's about the importance of place -- and how leaving it or remaining in it is both a joy and a sacrifice. Bright Birdsong, like all the other characters in the novel, makes choices -- often with bad results, and sometimes with good ones. Robert Inman is one of those writers who, once you discover him, you read all his books voraciously, and are then angry at yourself for finishing them all so quickly.

However, I find myself really annoyed with Paige and Lucas in their self righteous attitudes. They seem so sure of their own righteousness that they are downright rude to almost everybody in the book. Paige's intense devotion to Savannah is not quite believable and I'm curious to see how this works out in the end. Paige's idea of compassion seems to be silence and ignoring them. Savannah has a right to know her own family, no matter what Paige thinks of them. Paige is rude to anybody who doesn't meet her ideas of right and wrong, and I can't quite get Lucas. Maybe it will become clearer in later books?

I love that the Women of the Otherworld series encompasses more than just one race of supernatural being. It started out with my personal favorite, werewolves. Then it branched off into witches as the focus moved to one of the supporting characters in the second werewolf installment. With the series full of different types of supernaturals (vampires, half demons, Celtic deities, shamans, etc.), it could go on almost indefinitely and I hope it does! The writing is smooth, the dialogue rings true, the plots are well worked, and I'm always satisfied when its over.

However, Mike Doughty has come back with two great albums (for the price of one). Skittish is the acoustic disc recorded in 96 and the songs are great, well-crafted and Mike's distinguished voice/lyrics are more present than ever.Rockity Roll is more of an elctric disc, with samples and drum machines. The whole album is amazing, \\"Ways and Means\\" \\"27 Jennifers\\" and \\"Ossining\\" are my favorite and I was psyched to see that he included \\"Move On\\" live from Bonnaroo!!

Nobody will ever surpass the Beatles, their music lives on. However, Magical Mystery Tour was something I can't imagine why they did it. I know the Beatles wanted control of their artistic ability especially after Brain Epstein's death. In Hard Day's Night, the Beatles were fun and amusing, in this film they were wierd. I know Beatle humor has always been off beat, but they were really off beat this time. The scene where the Aunt being scowled by her boyfriend in a stoned looking atmosphere was a nightmare. This was the Beatles' farse. The music was great, as all Beatle music was great, but the Beatles' really had no business making this film. They are too great to have done this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful, in an entertaining way","review":"Speaking as a true Beatle fan who, in my younger days, had a tough time acknowledging that everything the Beatles ever did wasn't perfect, I have to say this is one of the most painful things I've ever seen. But to its credit, you can't NOT watch it once it's on. You're just taken aback by how disjointed and bizarre it is.Seen as separate music videos, the songs all hold up. They're also slightly remixed from the way they eventually appeared on the corresponding album, so that's kinda neat.But did you ever think that the best performance of a song in a Beatles film would be performed by the Bonzo Dog Band? (Interesting that Bonzo Neil Innes would later play Ron Nasty in the Rutles, isn't it?)If you must have this, have somebody buy it for you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for a remaster","review":"The master used for this copy is pretty bad, and it can not be from an original print.

That's not the point. Watch the film with an open heart, enjoy the sillyness, enjoy the music, let the magic work on you. We all need a bit of colour in our lives, and this film provides a breath of fresh air, frees us from our normal hectic daily lives, and takes us into a different world where we can be children again, jumping and frolicking without a care in the world. In this context, the food dream and the strip show scene are out of place, which is why I give only 4 stars, but I nevertheless felt heartened and enlightened by the film. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM A BIG BEATLES FAN BUT.........","review":".......The movie sucks. It really has no point whatsoever, and I really think they were on drugs and experimenting wirth cocaine when they made this film. If you really watch this movie it has no point, and is nothing but a bunch of crappy stuff thrown together. But not that I dont love the Beatles. They are the best. The album \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" has some of their best music. But this movie isn't the best at all. \\"A Hard Day's Night\\" and \\"Help\\" have some sort of story to them, and are excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's their own fantastic imagination.","review":"We just think of the Beatles as one of the greatest musicians in the world, however almost every beatlemanias want them to be regarded as the real artists who did a wonderful reformation of the pop music world, and they actually influenced classical music fields so much. Like Elvis, they wanted to be movie stars also, but somewhat not successful, their films are just valuable to the collectors of any rarities. They have 5 movies, including magical mystery tour, a hard day's night, help, let it be, and a color cartoon-yellow submarine, but I think 4 except for this movie is not so good for those who love to listen to 60's. Magical Mystery Tour conveys us a kind of their real experimental way of music and spirit of creation, what creation? whatever... I mean we can see the very real faces of their thoughts and style of going thru 60's. In this aspect MMT is really worth watching. What's more you can taste their lovely, psychedelic songs there."},{"rating":"1","title":"For completists only","review":"Don't get me wrong - I love the Beatles more than anyone. My comments are more about the DVD than the movie itself (which is still pretty bad, but, they were wasted). The company who made this DVD did a terrible job.

The picture quality is dreadful, with so much dust from the film, that obviously no clean-up has even been attempted. The color is barely there, and certainly not with the spirit of the movie being vivid and bright. This is all due to a poor film print used for the DVD transfer, and no digital editing to restore color or remove glitches. The quality of this disc is no better than that of the video-tape version, which I also own. No Special features, and the previously mentioned problems amount to an overall disappointing DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Video Quality","review":"The DVD I ordered Beatles Magical Mystery Tour had very poor blurry video quality.

There is no reason, even for the hardest core Beatles fan to own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far out","review":"When this film first aired on television after Christmas in 1967, critics panned it for being incomprehensible gibberish. It certainly wasn't what the folks at home were used to for their holiday television. In hindsight, we can see \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" for what it is: a slightly sluggish but fanciful art film, filled with engaging music videos and bits of offbeat comedy. This film predates MTV by a good 13 years, and includes great Beatles recordings (I strongly recommend the \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" soundtrack album.) It remains today a great period piece, and a pleasant piece of surreal filmmaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best","review":"dont get me wrong I love the beatles but the movie was aliitle bit strange for my taste. plus the songs weret very good. the only songs I like were i am the walrus and the tile tune.the movie is best view a a cursoity.if you want a intro the the beatles movies rent yellow submarine or hard days night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, horrible DVD","review":"Well I'm a big fan of the movie, and I got it on DVD a couple years back.

At the end of the movie, when the reprise of the the title track is played It's original note is supposed to be E. but on the DVD, It's Eb! The picture is horrible, it's all grainy and washed out. I.E. In the Resturant scene, the spaghetti looks like lettuce and nachos. So all in all, you're better off getting the VHS. it has better picture and sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all satisfied!!!","review":"I was very dissatisfied with this purchase!!! We did not receive the item that was advertised (different release date that is known for bad quality). When I inquired about returning the item, they were very prompt in getting back to me. However, they would not send me the item that I ordered as an exchange because now the item is $30 more than when we put the order in. I told them that was not our fault - had they sent the one we ordered at the correct time, there wouldn't have been an issue. Makes me wonder if it was known that the price was going to rise??? They did work with me towards the steps for a refund but I will be sure not to order from them in the future. Again.....IT IS NOT OUR FAULT THAT THE PRICE CHANGED. I didn't feel that they understood that. Not very good customer service if you ask me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical? Not really.","review":"This release is horrible. It's just a straight copy from a VHS not a master tape. The sound quality is average and the picture quality is poor.

While I appreciate the Beatles' odd sense of humor, I could not appreciate whatever it was that they were attempting to do in this video. It's short, it's confusing, and it wasn't worth the price paid. My best recommendation here is to borrow it from a friend who has a copy first before making this choice. I know now that is what I should have done."},{"rating":"1","title":"The fool at the remaster controls","review":"The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour was a mess anyway, but this DVD does nothing to help its reputation.

But with all the flaws this DVD has, a decent version (as of 2011) has yet to be made available and so if you want to see \\"Fool on the hill\\", \\"I am the walrus\\" and \\"Your mother should know\\" in their full context, this is the only option available. I have it, but I wish I had waited for some better copy to come along (even if it never does)."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad quality, very disappointing","review":"It would have been nice if I had known how horrible the quality of the DVD was.

It's terrible...there's no plot. The music was alright; it seems like every movie they made Ringo seems to be the center of attention, (nothing wrong with that). George only has a couple of lines in the movie (I should say words), which is weird. There were a few slightly funny scenes in the movie. Like when John was with the little kid on the bus, & when the man was singing on stage with the stripper. The spaghetti scene was nasty. I wouldn't want to buy this movie; only if it's very cheap, just to have it for my up coming Beatles collection. If anyone really wants to see this moive; I'd get it at the library first.

But if I would be perfectly and 110% honest about this film, I will tell you I spent the $18.00 to purchase this to have and own ONE SONG & VIDEO: John Lennon's \\"I Am The Walrus.\\" To this day STILL a TOTAL CLASSIC !

I had seen MMT several years ago and knew it wasn't the highest quality image to begin with so I wasn't expecting it to be pristine. Unfortunately the quality of the image is worse than I expected. It is washed out, blurry in parts and almost unwatchable. It looks like a bad transfer from video tape where the video tape was a bad copy. The packaging looks like it was done on a color copier. The only positive aspect was the sound was good (not great) Luckily my daughter thinks anything made before 2000 is ancient so wasn't bothered by the image as long as the music was okay.All in all I wouldn't recommend this product. Hopefully this will be remastered and rereleased someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer BEWARE!","review":"As the old saying goes.....Buyer BEWARE! This is for the die-hard Beatles Fans ONLY.

The video quality is beyond awful. At times, the video is washed out and unwatchable. I only paid $8.00 for my copy. I would recommend not paying more than $2.00.

The quality is absolutely terrible. Less than ten minutes into the film, we went through the trouble of re-hooking up the VCR, because we were convinced that our old VHS tape -- the one I had wanted to upgrade from -- was better quality. We were right. By comparison, the muddy VHS tape was absolutely gorgeous. Save your money. This is clearly an unofficial bootleg, and shouldn't be sold at all as though it's legitimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"The VHS is/was great quality!","review":"I don't own this product, and from the reviews posted, I won't ever own it. I do, however, own the VHS version that was released in 1987. It was an official Apple release, and the quality is superb, both picture quality and sound quality. Fans please note that the songs that are in the movie have entirely different audio mixes than the mixes that appeared on the MMT album. So Magical Mystery Tour, Fool On the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and I Am The Walrus all have unique mixes on the soundtrack that you can't find anywhere else, and on the VHS tape these mixes sound really great in VHS Hi-Fi (gosh, remember that?) IMO, these mixes blow the \\"regular\\" mixes of these songs away.The tape is still easy to find and reasonably priced. Again, its quality is superb and I'm sure puts this DVD to shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this ??","review":"Let me say that I'm a Beatles' fan, owning all their offical released material and 2 bootlegs of Decca Sessions and Christmas Records.But this is simply impossible...\\"Hard Day's Night\\" was a fun and interesting peep into the Beatles's daily life, great script and acting.\\"Help\\" was a mediocre adventure movie, still with a nice plot and reasonable script.\\"Yellow Submarine\\" was just a cartoon.\\"Let It Be\\" was one of the greatest recording session film ever made.And this must be the greatest boo-boo the Beatles' ever made. Can't comprehend until today, why...they even had the nerve to release it ?? There is no plot, script is horrible and boring, the cut into the magicians' place was simply meaningless...The only thing worth watching is the \\"I Am The Walrus\\" song clip..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adding My Voice To The Chorus","review":"Have to agree with all the other comments about pirated copy. Good to have for historical value, but this is a washed out, low quality bootleg. The cover artwork is one step above old style computer pixelation and the label for the DVD is obviously semi-homemade.Unfortunately this is the only way to get this film (for the moment) as the general consensus regarding MMT is that it is a substandard product from the Beatles.Of course with the benefit of hindsight, its experimentation and sheer weirdness redeems it somewhat, I doubt we'll see any major remastering of this for some time.

I don't know who's to blame - the BBC, the Beatles themselves, or whoever they gave the job of making prints to , but I don't think there's any reason to think this DVD has been \\"pirated\\" - it's looked (and sounded) like this from the start."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Films of All Time!","review":"Seriously. I have just seen this film (I have loved listening to my parents' copy of the album, ever since I was young, and still do). I really think it should be on the standard lists of the worst films of all time. As such, it deserves to be watched and studied. The music is among the Beatles best, but only gives a huge contrast to the incredibly poor film. (Alright, I did enjoy the performance of \\"I am the Walrus\\", and also George's performance of \\"Blue Jay Way\\") There aren't enough actual jokes for me to consider this a comedy. Surely the Beatles were succesful enough at this point in their careers that they could have hired a writer to turn their incoherent improvisations into a coherent script (whoever wrote the liner notes to the album seemed to do a good job of this), a better director than Paul, and a better Director of Photography than Ringo!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible Bootlegged Copy","review":"I got my copy from raretshirts. I'm glad I have a copy on DVD. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the film. It's much like others have said. It is grainy, the color is washed out, and, in my opinion, it's just a transfer from a VHS copy.The description that you read about the film gives you the impression that the behind-the-scenes material and newsreels will be on the DVD. Not on this one!! Because of that, I was really disappointed. I probably would've given the DVD another star if those things were on there.In my opinion, if these are the only copies floating out there currently, then get one. But don't pay that much for it.

It was pretty bad camara work too. I didn't have as much fun as I did watching A Hard Days Night. The only part I actually kind of enjoyed and amused me was when George, magician George, said \\"a song\\" that was the only thing that amused me because it was so random, and since my humor is different it actually got a laugh from me.

Originally aired on BBC-TV in 1967. Although the film is not as strong in plot and continuity as the group's first two feature films it does have its highlights. The first is the scene where JOHN, dressed as a waiter, comes with a shovel in his hands to feed a mountain of spaghetti to a very obese woman [this scene was acutally based on a dream that JOHN had].

I've seen this movie on VHS many years ago and I have the Beatles Anthology DVD with scenes from the movie, so I know what the picture quality of the movie should be. This DVD feels like an amateur pirated copy. The picture is so bright and fuzzy it washes out details and color.I bought this movie for the wonderful visuals and the music of songs like\\"I am the Walrus\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\". This movie is full of wonderful oddities that are a joy to see but they are very hard to appreciate when the quality of the picture is so poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"historical value only, yet....","review":"I had seen this many years ago so I knew what to expect - if you don't know, don't expect something like \\"A Hard Days Night\\". This is a very eccentric sales pitch for their new album at the time \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". The credits list Ringo as the director of photography, and maybe it's true - but he's a better drummer and human being than either a director or photographer. Yet, there is much to appreciate in the historical content, and plenty to put a smile on the face of a fan. I was disappointed in the video quality, it was apparently taken from a well used and faded film. Plenty of scratches are visible, the colors are very faded, and scenes with the Beatles in white tuxes are terribly washed out. HOWEVER, if you already have everything else of theirs, you may yet enjoy some of this video. If nothing else, see where the band \\"Death Cab for Cutie\\" got their name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"The product I received was an obvious pirated copy. The cover was low quality, but more importantly, the DVD was very low quality. I think this was produced by someone filming the screen in a movie theater.

I was surprised to see this from Amazon, even though it came from a 3rd party vendor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Magical At All","review":"Hold off on buying this DVD in name only and wait for an authorized version not an obviously and poorly copied reproduction of a faded master tape. This is a waste of an otherwise entertaining and whimsical romp through the Beatles psychedelic stage in their musical career. However, the only real trippy thing about this is the LSD quality of the disc as if someone dropped some really bad acid on it while copying it.

However, I own a copy & would never trade it in.I'm a Beatles fan - & if I look at this not as a film but as a collection of music videos then it's well worth it - especially for \\"I am the Walrus\\".There's no screenwritting credits for this because there was no real script. Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr decided to fill a bus with interesting people - & film it - & wait for the magic to happen.The magic never happened in so far that a 'movie' didn't emerge - just a lot of disjointed imagery.But this is a must for a Beatles nut like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical Mystery Tour DVD should have been remastered","review":"I love the Beatles! And, I have this movie on VHS tape. I'm trying to slowly replace some of my favorite tapes with DVDs. I opened the DVD yesterday and went straight to \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" because I love seeing the Fab 4 in their white tails coming down that large staircase. Well, keep the VHS tape and don't bother to get the DVD; I could not see any of the faces of the Beatles or even of the crowd. The picture was so washed out - grainy - blurry - couldn't see their faces as I said - and had a slightly out-of-focus look.Would someone come out with a DVD that is really remastered???The Beatles - Magical Mystery Tour"},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS Superior to DVD","review":"The quality of the VHS release is far superior to the DVD available in 2009.

Listening to the entire audio is fun too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magical Mystery Tour","review":"Unfortunately both DVDs I received from Amazon of this movie had problems with sound at the end. Check yours! When they go into the tent, and George sings and plays, the words don't keep the same time as his mouth.

The two stars I have given this are merely for the music.I love The Beatles and everything they recorded or filmed, and it really pisses me off as to how Apple can allow this film to be remembered this way.Fans such as I know there is an original negative in existence, because we saw the virtually pristine footage of this film in the Beatles Anthology.Come on Apple, chop, chop, the fans deserve it..No actually the world deserves it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This dvd is not a good investment. It looks like it's been copied from a bad copy. I bought one of these and almost threw it away. I resisted the urge, but it's almost unwatchable, the picture is so distorted.The best course of action in acquiring Magical Mystery Tour is to find one of the VHS versions that are an actual Apple product.

The camera work is not great although there are some terrific special effects. The trac of \\"I am the walrus\\" is particularly fun to watch. The DVD does not have subtitles or captioning. Altogether, the movie is a an interesting psychedelic trip with the Fab Four, and a bus full of passengers, through the English Country Side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say what?","review":"This movie had one of the most confusing \\"plots\\" I have ever encountered. To understand most of what they were saying, I needed the booklet which came from my father's LP. Although I am probably one of the biggest Beatles fans out there, I found myself counting the minutes as I watched this film. For example, while the video for \\"Fool on the Hill\\" is playing, Paul is skipping along on every type of landscape except for a hill. I suppose that is self-explainatory; he's a fool, and who would expect a fool to be able to find a hill? This is one endeavor that the Beatles never should have undertaken, considering that their manager had recently passed away. I certainly hope that this was not his tribute, or they would seem to be degrading his image to the point of utter humiliation. Translation?: Don't see it. It stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck! How could the Beatles release this garbage?","review":"The ONLY good thing about \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" is the music! The Beatles were incapable of producing a poor soundtrack.

Well done? Did you even see the movie? Its all impromptu. The acting is all bad. In bloodvessels dream, the fat chick can't stop laughing, and when shes fighting with Ringo, she can't help but laugh. Oh, and the closeup of Paul's eyes in Fool on the Hill? Boring as hell! I'm the greatest Beatles fan of all time, but this was really bad. The only good part? The Walrus! And the music is good too.

The first is that you love the Beatles so much that anything they ever did, including bowel movements like this film, fascinate you.

Fast forward to the \\"tent scene,\\" watch it, and remove the DVD from your player. You're done. It is incredible that the Beatles, the greatest Rock act ever, are upstaged in their own movie.

The Magical Mystery Tour is horrible! There is no plot, no acting skills, and certainly no magic, mystery, or even a tour for that matter. It is complete nonsense! Most shows or movies from the 1960s were either goofy fun or weird but made a point, this is niether! I wouldn't even call it a Beatle movie. I would call it seperate footage of Ringo and Paul edited together with a couple of clips of John and George thrown in for kicks and giggles. I only give it one star because the theme song is catchy.The early Beatles were good but after this I can see why they never made it longer than the Monkees or other groups!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating; don't get tired of looking at it.","review":"We love this book.

No, Rather...","review":"These stories making up The Vampire Chronicles are not about vampires, really, as one might first perceive. The main characters, and really all of them, are vampires, yes, but there is a much, much deeper essence to the stories. These books are not about vampires, but about understanding of life, love, loss, and survival of mind. If you want to look at it like this, you could say that these stories are about regular human life, human strugle and human passion. The only differences are that the stories are dragged out over hundreds of years, and they contain the understandings of generations and generations, and feelings and understandings are magnified by thousands to attain the grove of vampire characteristics."},{"rating":"1","title":"what people think they know about vampires","review":"vampires are not like the one in the book, they are many things but not that.

Vampires live in tube slides and play houses, usually at toys-r-us. That is why your hair sticks up when you go in them. vampire victims have ornage shoes.

Rice raises some very interesting concepts from the mind of the vampire. My only gripe (and a friend feels the same way) is that Rice tends to ramble - padding out relatively meaningless stuff, or stuff that you've already gleaned the concept of after two lines. I found myself skipping paragraphs & pages, which was detrimental to the flow. With some judicious editing and condensing they would be worthy of 5 stars.

The ending seemed a bit unrealistic, with Abby getting a job in NYC before she even had a shred of fashion design experience under her belt. A final project in college doesn't mean squat in lieu of real experience. And when she finally flew to the Big Apple, what happened to all her stuff?

I think the author went on too long about the details of the clothes in the fashion show. This is great for those that love fashion, but it seemed to me that Julie Taylor just wanted to shove it in somewhere because it was an interest of hers .

The recording is professional and the orchestra is quite good. My only complaint is that I don't care for the stylistic changes effected by the arranger for some of the themes. The most notable example of this can be found in 'The Anvil of Crom' (theme from Conan the Barbarian) where the music is too fast, too crisp, and has a completely altered (and rather trite) ending that falls flat compared to Basil Poledouris' original composition for the film. But with that caveat aside, I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys fantasy adventure music who doesn't have the $$$ to buy each and every soundtrack album separately.WARNING: The sound effects tracks are UNBELIEVABLY LOUD.

Tom Johnston's energy and enthusiasm was contagious (although sometimes over the top). They did all the hits and a few lesser songs, \\"Without You\\" a particular highlight.

Watching the show gave me goose bumps at times as I thought back to those good ol' days when the band was my favorite in the early 70's.

Countless families could be spared the heartbreak and fracturing of relationships if the myth could be erradicated altogether. Dr. Loftus' extensive research is evident in her writings, but tends to be somewhat repetitive and clinical. Well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader beware","review":"Beware of this book. Loftus is not a trauma expert. If she were, she would acknowledge that normal memory and traumatic memory are different creatures; they work differently and involve different areas of the brain. As a fellow lawyer, I am disquieted by the one-sided, misguided, and truly heavy-handed application of information from the irrelevant fields of ordinary memory and eyewitness testimony. The capacity is too great to hurt people already hurt and to harm the causes of law, jurisprudence, and justice.Every lawyer must be skeptical about all evidence, and one must be on guard for therapeutic contamination. (Victims want to be secure in their memories, too. They don't want inept therapists misleading them.) Loftus is right to point out obvious dangers. This book, however, verges on zealotry in not factoring in the venerable body of reliable study on post-traumatic amnesias. One wonders why.

To my ear, I prefer the sound from the middle of row 6 in the Orchestra to SRO in the back of a very large auditorium. Specifically the Previn recording sounds muted. Aditionally, the pace of the Previn recording is often too slow. The Levine recording shows the brilliant clarity of a full digital which can be off putting for some, but in this performance is quite stunning. If I did not have Levine's recording to compare against, I would have happily given Previn's a 5 rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best recording","review":"While doing research for my Master's dissertation which was on Carmina Burana, I did a comparative study of several Carmina Burana recordings: this one in my opinion was among the worst. While the singing and orchestral playing is very solid, the tempos are largely too slow to capture the intensity of emotion expected by modern audiences of this peice, having heard it excerpted by so many Hollywood films.

It reminds a lot of the Smashing Pumpkins best tunes, when they made songs like \\"1979\\", with the voice of O'Neal sounding similar to Bono of U2. Unfortunately, \\"Say\\" is an oasis in the middle of the whole record. In fact, I can't understand how this guys can make such a wonderful song and then run out of ideas for the rest of the album, because the level goes down with the next two songs, to finally touch the ground with the rest of the cd, which is full of sad and bored songs with empty and sometimes ridiculous lyrics.

She motivated me to want to try this myself: tracking down my own collection of relatives, and leaving my children with a more developed sense of family - their family, our family.Her personal trials, errors, and successes, in the quest of family history, helped me believe I also could try my hand at this, and maybe it really is a do-able venture. Lois shows it can be as time-consuming and elaborate as I wish to make it. But, happily, it also can be as simple, direct, and informative as reality allows. It's all up to me.I look forward to providing my children, and other family members, with the information that gets discovered, and hope that they all will be blessed by the outcome. I'll let you know how it goes, after all, we're family; we're at least 50th cousins - maybe closer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply, a good honest book with hard to find information today.","review":"You (public,professional,et al) will not easily find the good true information available in this revelatory literature.

I left my house one day and forgot to shut it off, and came home to a house that smelled of burnt coffee to find a thin coating of sludge at the bottom of my coffeemaker. If I'd come home at all late that night it would have dried completely and possibly cracked the carafe, started a fire, or what I don't know - but I'm not willing to find out. The rest are design flaws but this is a serious safety flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst coffeemaker I have ever owned","review":"I bought the Farberware 10 cup programmable coffeemaker because of the unique color (cobalt blue). I soon discovered that there were many design flaws. First, the carafe handle is extremely uncomfortable. It is concave with sharp edges that cut into your hand when the pot is full. Second, the filter basket does not \\"snap\\" closed. After being pushed to the close position, it pops back out a little and you are never sure if it is really closed. Third, this coffeemaker claims to have an \\"auto shut-off\\" feature, but this feature works only when you have turned the coffemaker on using the Auto Program feature. If you switch the coffeemaker on manually, the auto shut-off does not function. Fourth, grounds spill over the filter. I would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone. Looking pretty in my kitchen is its only redeeming quality, and soon, it will look pretty in my trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not purchase","review":"the fart-box does not at all sound like the real thing. it is also hard to hear and did not work but for 4 tries- i would have returned but was not worth the hassle or the shipping and handling. save your money--please"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pissed off","review":"I am sorry I can not help you with your review , I have still have not received my order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"If you're looking for a fun, new and improved type whoopie cushion gag don't bother with this.

Great quick, easy read, kids!","review":"This book is not a popular book, but it brings across a good message and it is excellent for a nice and easy quick read. (I have read the book more than once.) It is about a girl named Caitlin who does not seem to do anything right when she is only trying to help.

Frank Foster does a good job of directing this orchestra, and they really swing in some parts -- but other parts are so lacking that calling it Basie is almost an embarassment. The piano player, for example, seems to not even be able to improvise a single line without screwing up. There were a few piano solos where I actually felt bad for the guy. I was embarassed for him because he sounded so bad. If you are looking for classic Basie, then get another Count Basie album. This is basically a decent jazz swing album with \\"Basie\\" tacked onto it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkably Unaffecting... dissapointing.","review":"Of all the incredible film compositions they could have recorded for this CD, the selection is mediocre stuff. The technical performance of the Cincinatti Pops is not in question; it's fine. Also, the music doesn't come together in any programatic way that makes you want to listen from beginning to end. The DTS 5.1 mix was equally unimpressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SURROUND SOUND - THIS IS PCM STEREO SOUND ONLY!","review":"This CD does not have a DTS 5.1 audio track, it's just PCM stereo sound (standard CD quality).

This is a spectacular collection of great music from some of the best movies made within the last 5 years.

I hope he will come out with many more this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mix","review":"All the Reich Kunzel and CPO movie albums are well done, this CD is no exception. As with some of the others, there is no thematic link between tracks - raucus, pulse pounding goodies followed by soft melodic material. If the selection was a little more consistent, it would get five stars. That said, you really can't go wrong with Kunzel and the CPO - their execution is generally flawless. Worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your woofers!","review":"Great album with an esoteric mix: from the the Navy Hymn(Chrimson Tide) to rich orchestrations (Braveheart and Gettysburg) it has something for everyone.If you have broad taste, you'll love this one but be warned- some of these tracks could turn older speakers into mush. Got a theater system with powered sub-woofer? Crank it and watch the windows pulsate with great sounds. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attention stereo SACD layer","review":"Nobody mentioned but this SACD disc has no stereo high definition layer, the only stereo program appears on the hybrid CD layer in order to accomodate the over 76 minute multi-channel surround program.,so if you have a SACD player that doesn t play multi channel layer like mine you can only play the standard CD version, I didn t knew that and also Telarc put this explenation afterwords with with a little sticker on the back of the jewel box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best...","review":"Although this toy looked cool, it didn't stay together and it wound up being just a pile of peices that rarely got played with."},{"rating":"1","title":"bike rack","review":"First of all, Amazon.com service was teriible with both packages arriving ripped, in poor condition, and the first with a used and incomplete rack which I returned.The rack is solidly built, but doesn't fit four bikes comfortably as advertised due to the handle bars.

Trevor Pinnock first embarked on recording the entire set. Pinnock's sound is pretty thin and his notes inegale a lot less crisp than Bill's. Bill's deep committment to and understanding of declamatory style is far better developed than Pinnock's but it sometimes makes a rather overplayed hand in his recordings. Their musical child, Christoph Rousset, here gives the afficianado another choice.What wealth! Who would have imagined in the age of Casadesus, Boulanger and Landowska that we would become so rich. Buy all three and have a piece of history on your music shelf. You cannot really go wrong with any one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer book","review":"If you've ever worked with a creative director, an accounting manager or anyone in the ad biz, you'll enjoy this book. A 31-year-old ad exec must win the hope chest account, solve a murder, and explore the challanges of management. Some very funny characters, including a gifted but gutter-mouthed Creative Director, a huckster who knows his business, and a vegetarian Kafka-reading Copywriter who romances the protagonist. The use of the whodunit genre gives Martin license to explore the strange world of advertising, the characters and the fascinating process of art against deadline. He touches on enough detail about the financial world without excess, and the believable, well-drawn and colorful dialogue has all the mercurial fury of Wall Street.

The reflective stripes look bizarre. They are made up of a yellow cloth with some type of plastic nonsense in the middle. They are practically worthless for high-visibility, night-time operations. Wearing these on the side of a moderately-lit road will get someone in trouble.Second, the safety labels.

We started out with a crib mattress and then converted it over with a twin mattress. It was very easily converted. We have had to take it apart a couple of times to move it and it is always a breeze to put together again. If any stains get on it I just clean them off with a magic eraser and it looks brand new. The bed is so sturdy and adorable for any little girls room. The little shelves hold her alarm clock, dolls and books to read at night. When her dad lays to read to her at night he puts the drawbridge down to hold his legs.

Last and the dumbest, some traffic is made for blocking your car only, believe me!!I suggest EA either fire your current AI programmers or hire them some psychiatrists.For those who still wanna buy this game after reading my comments, good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need for speed: Underground @ Bytesector.com","review":"Electronic Arts' bold new addition to the highly successful Need for Speed series takes a decidedly different approach to racing. Instead of driving fast and expensive super cars that most of us can only dream of affording, Need for Speed Underground puts you behind the wheel of affordable normal cars - and lets you modify it until it's a whip capable of beating those exotic super cars.

And, unfortunately, these three things bring the complete sim downihll and make it NOT worth purchasing.Even after the thousands of emails to EA about the loss of replays and cockpit view in the past Need For Speed titles, they still failed to ipmlement it in Underground. You can check futther reviews right here on Amazon to see the posts on previous titles about these very items missing. This title is missing such key parts of the sim that it will take a slow downfall in ratings until EA gets the act together.

This prompted me to replace them with a high quality aftermarket lug and thats how I began using these splinedrives. They also have an added benefit of security, since you need the splinedrive adaptor to use them with a lug wrench there's very little chance a thief will be able to take them off unless he has the adaptor. This is the other benefit of splinedrives... you really don't need to buy locking lug nuts.

It includes discussions about prices, poverty, wealth, and the overall reality of why the economic world works the way it does.I've always avoided economics-related stuff, because so much of it is so dry & boring & unintelligible. But this book really breaks it down beautifully.Especially enlightening is his well-justified description of how wealth builds in some places and why poverty festers in other places.

After a while I couldn't continue to motivate myself to finish it. There is nothing really new presented here....just basic economic theories. The most annoying part of the book is how redundant the author is. It takes him ten pages to make his point when it could have been done in one paragraph. I'm sure some people like drawn out stories to help \\"paint the picture\\", but I found it tedious in this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Informative But Dry","review":"The book does not sustain its promising beginning, turning into dry and flat explanations of economic theory. This book won't tell you anything you haven't already learned in Econ 101.The Undercover Economist seems targeted at ordinary people who may not know much about economics, and as such, it fails miserably. It fails to make its complex ideas easy to understand and fun to read. In that area, Freakonomics has done a much better job.This book is informative but fails to reach its intended audience.

At first read, there are spatters of interesting economic theories and ideas, but for the most part, it is Harford's half-narrative in favor of socialist policies. He uses economics to reinforce his socialist policies, however, his socialist policies are based on little, if any at all, documented evidence, and sometimes, are flat out lies completely. If you are interested in learning about economics, this is not the book for you. If however, you voted for Barack Obama, and enjoy socialism, this is the perfect book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed yet worthy","review":"Using humorous and applicable examples, Harford manages to bring some complex economic concepts down to a basic level of understanding, similar to Steven Landsburg's book The Armchair Economist. Landsburg's book is a more engaging read, and his writing more precise, but where Harford really shines out is that he manages to keep his book easy to read from page to page, while Landsburg has a tendency to get caught up in confusing technical language and jargon.If you're looking for a good source of some sound (and simple) economic explanation, Harford's book is a great place to start; it's clear enough and interesting enough that you're sure to find what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty, engaging and informative","review":"This is a fun book. Hartford treats his topic in a lighthearted way that keeps the reader engaged. I also appreciate his ability to take complex economic theories and make them easy to understand thru the use of clear examples.Sometimes, Hartford gets overly detailed. Those passages are a drag on the book. In addition, Hartford's discussion of rich/poor countries does not capture the incredibly complex systems that make up a national economy. The whole comparison of Cameroon and China is a bit too simplistic and his argument misses the mark.On the plus side, his explanation on the pricing of cappuccino is must reading....it'd be a great first lecture for an Econ 101 class!A highly enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The aspirator has no suction power and only irritated my son.

The writing is poor quality and therefore hard to read. It jumps around a lot and many conclusions made by Hepple/Matthews are totally unsubstantiated.

Available from AK Press. Ufologists should check this guy out as he is up to no good and his writings and interventions, including UFO Revelation, are all part of an elaborate disinformation and entrapment campaign organised by people far cleverer than this dupe.

No doubt the UFO bigwigs will look upon Matthews' book with horror, probably because he sails a little too close to the breeze and uncovers a little too much for their comfort.

I thought the device would have a network name and share the device so it could be mapped to as a network drive (\\\\\\\\server\\\\USB_HDD)....nope. All I'm able to do is stick a thumb drive in this device and read it which is something I can do WITHOUT this device! I have owned other TRENDnet equipment in the past and am very disappointed with this. I don't have a very strong understanding of networking but I feel that I should be able to set up a shared resource on my home network without having to take a two year course in the subject!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give a 0","review":"I would totally give a zero! I have been in the computer industry for 20 years and this product is one of the worse I have ever bought. I have never felt so ripped off. Supposedly if you format the drive fat 16 or fat 32 it will be writable. I don't see the point of even trying because the performance is also horrid. If you already have data on the drive that really isn't possible. The performance is nothing shy of horrid for reads so writes would have to be worse. The web menus have bad grammar, probably because the company is in Mexico. I will never buy anything made by TRENDnet.

It moves in a fast paced way though the different parts of Zack's life as he deals with sports, relationships, and the hate crime. I never found myself bored while reading and the first person point of view was very interesting to read. Zack was very brave and it was interesting to go on his adventures. The characters reacted in a very beleivible way and seemed very real.

From the potato famine and loss of his mother, to his love for the English landlord's daughter Rachel (Kate Mulgrew: of Star Trek Voyager),and subsequent flight to the shores of America. From poor to rich in America, but still longing for the freedom for his beloved Ireland. Also starring Linda Purl (The Exorcist), Nicholas Hammond (Sound of Music, Spiderman), David Soul (Starsky & Hutch), and Simon MacCorkindale. Very moving, interesting to watch Pierce Brosnan in the early days of his career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating Story -","review":"Very interesting story about the lives of the Irish people in Ireland and their progression into America. Series packed with famous and talented actors. Young (pre-Remington Steele) Pierce Brosnan is superb and true to his Irish origins. Brosnan changes from a young insolent horse-boy to a well respected businessman. Kate Mulgrew is also very good as his girlfriend and then wife. Their relation is genuine and lovable.

Besides their music and shows, their path of excess left behind drug abuse, car crashes, weddings to some Hollywood stars.... the typical rockstar lifestyle. The best probably, a bunch of very good songs that nowadays are anthems of rock and roll music.This compilation is a great album for neophytes in Motley Crue. It reviews all the eras of the band from early 80's to year 2000. It also includes HOOLIGANS HOLIDAY (with John Corabi on vocals) which does not appear in GREATEST HITS (1998).Summing up: a good album for lots of people (except for fans... who already have all these songs)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Monica in the making...","review":"I have the Italian release of this film. But I see Amazon only carries the Korean version. Same movie so guess I'll review it here. When Monica releases a movie I buy it. it's that simple. Now will I rate it 5 stars?...no, unless it deserves it. You really have to like Monica's work before diving into her pre-Malena career. The average watcher will not. La Riffa cannot be found with english subtitles...so another reason the average viewer wouldn't bother with this title. If you like Monica's films enough to look into getting this film then great. Some of Monica's early work is her best. La Riffa is a very early Monica film, nearly her first feature role. She has alot of screen time, she is very young, and addictive to watch.

The night at the Blue Note was the culmination of a reuniting of these masters for a 2 week tour of Japan. Listening, you feel like you're there. Oscar's technique is fantastic as ever, the ideas cascade contantly. The next night is also on CD, not a note is left out nor should be missed.

I really enjoyed the live performances and the behind the scenes stuff. I definitely agree with a lot of the reviewers out there, this DVD does tell you more about Edwin and does show his sense of humor. I really want to see him live sometime. The only disappointment I had is I wish there were more music videos on there, but all the other things that were on the DVD made up for that for the most part. Overall, an enjoyable DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Awesome","review":"The Acoustic Highway DVD is awesome. It really lets u behind the scenes and shows you what Edwin is all about. This DVD is a must-have for true Edwin fans. I would also definitely recommend it to anybody else because I don't see how u could watch this and not be an Edwin McCain fan. I don't think that they could have done any better on it. It gives you a chance to watch Edwin just hangin out and get to know his personality.

His voice, his stories and his hysterical sense of humor are something I can never get enough of and his \\"Mile Marker\\" DVD show real moments of the true Edwin, although it doesn't contain nearly as much music as the other, its still without a doubt worth the purchase.

I was hoping for a live concert, but was pleasantly surprized to get a glimpse of Edwin behind his music. Not only is he a great songwriter/singer, he is a great human being. His music had already won me over, but his humor seal the deal. This DVD is a great addition to my growing collection of all things Edwin."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a voice","review":"Mr McCain at his best. Not only do you get to hear this young man's awesome voice, you get to experience what it's like to see him live - from heartfelt songs to hilarious stories from the road.

If you only buy this dvd for \\"I'll be\\" song, do it.. but you won't find anything extra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complex, unorganized chapters and poor illustrations.","review":"This book is simply not worth your time to read it. The author tries to stuff the better part of 5000 years of history, religion, culture, politics, and architecture into one short paperback book. This makes for frustrating reading as you try to follow the narrative, especially since nothing in the entire book is explained. You're guaranteed not to learn a single thing. This book also fails to focus on anything, which results in a bland, monotonic narrative. The hand drawn illustrations look like a seven year old was hired as the art director, and they don't allow the reader to get a sense of the awesome proportions and grandeur of the buildings they so desperately seek to depict. Unless you already have a very, very strong backround in western architecture and history, and you have a considerable amount of time to kill, I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating look at a bygone era!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Ford Tramps.\\" It's a charming and inspiring look at America in the 1920's, written in a breezy and unpretentious style.

He told me about his cross-country adventures in a T touring car and about the book. Over eight years had past since that meeting, but I hadn't forgotten about that story. I finally got my hands on a copy. (Surprise! It ended up being an autographed copy.) The book is a quaint sketch of the USA in 1925, with plenty of Model T action.

That last sequence is particularly strange and stays away from the usual Playboy video idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wake-Up Call To All Nominal Chrisitans","review":"I found the account told by Mr. Garza to be accurate and compelling.

The author is a Christian \`missionary' who during the 1990s traveled throughout Central Asia & China and revealed that from time-to-time he thought that he had converted someone to Christianity. Virtually every time he entered a new city or country he started to give some informative tidbit about that area, but before he sort of concluded his remarks he started talking about some other topic; a very disjointed work. Sorry, but I just can't recommend this book - there is just nothing of (great/minor) substance to be learned regarding Islam from it; I recycled it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Read This","review":"I would ask anyone who wants to know about Islam to not read this book.

The title \\"A Developmental Analysis of Cuba's Health Care System Since 1959\\" is misleading. MacDonald does not explain the diffrent policies or programs that have been implemented by the Cuban goverment. This book focuses more on the Cuban people's attitude and less on the actual development of the Cuban Health System. This book was published in 1999 and yet has statistics from 1988 and 1990, it is outdated. If you are intrested in the Cuban Health System I recomend Dr. Carmelo Mesa-Lago."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Movie?

The worship is sooo good, I would have to say that one of my favorites from the cd is \\" It's the Blood\\", this song ministers to me in such a way that it brings tears to my eyes when I think about the Blood that Jesus shed for me and it wasn't that I was so good, but it was his love for me. Another song I love is \\"Touch Me Once Again\\" this song ministers to me as well. It is difficult to pick one song because the whole cd is wonderful.

This was a saint I could relate to! An ordinary working-class man who substituted his daily struggles with devotion and study. But when I started to read this book, I grew a bit dissapointed. Matt Talbot was Catholic, and the author of this book is Catholic, but the book seems to be written from a more generic Christian perspective (minimize discussion of Mary, etc), possibly in an attempt to be more \\"ecumenical\\".

The intricate details into each of the main characters, what motivates them, how they deal with everything from mild stress to the obvious strain of the situation at hand was mind-boggling. I found myself cringing with each crunching testicle (and I don't even have them). I found myself silently crying with each innocent life lost. I found myself gasping in horror at the pictures etched in my brain by the descriptive details the author gave (and the people on the plane next to me jumping when I did so).

Aside from that, this film is trite, cliched, and pandering to any audience that may concede to view it. I am glad I never paid to see this either in the theater or rental.

The family's move to a strange town, the divorced parents, the worship of a rock star -- all accompanied by vivid daydreams and, you have to admit it, lies to friends about the real situation -- all reflect the lives of young film-goers. Additionally, if you knew any of the \\"theater people\\" when you were in high school, you will recognize their portrayal in this movie as wholly accurate.An unexpected observation: The young rock star, whom Lola rescued when he was drunk, acted like a youthful, innocent Albert Spica (from another movie), stumbling around talking constantly, with non-sequitur statements and questions.

There is a movie each year about a zero becoming a superstar and it's just stupid. Like I put for Catch That Kid, it's not about pleasing the crowd anymore, it's complete and total publicity!

Take it from me, soon no one will go to the movies because of this helpless repitition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Too bad we can't rate this a zero.

I also don't see what the fuss about Lindsay is, she was a cute actor as a kid but she is terrible in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lindsay tells us her confessions! Great job Lindsay!!","review":"This is the 3rd movie that Lindsay has taken to the big screen. The first being The Parent Trap(1998) and Freaky Friday(2003) and now Confessions Of A Teenage Drama Queen(2004). I never seen this in theathers but got lucky one night when it was listed as a pay-per-view movie at a hotel and I just had to see it, seeing as I seen her other movies and that I would not live without seeing this movie. The plot is a little corney and the actors are good though. This movie follows Mary Cep (also known as Lola Cep) when she moves from New York City to New Jersey! She has also given up the hope of ever being famous because you can't get famous being in New Jersey! She goes to school just to know that people just hate her! She also gets the lead in the school play! This is a movie that you can sit back and relaz with the family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Upset","review":"At first when I saw the previews in the movie theater, I thought, OMG ( Oh my gosh!) I have 2 see this movie! It looked so cool. But, I never had any time 2 go and see it. So when it came out on DVD and VHS, I rented it. And boy was I glad it was only a rental. About 15 minutes through, I was like, this is soooooooo boring! I was very upset because the whole entire movie is just about a girl making this big fit about moving. She is a major baby and lies alot. She says her dad died, when he really didn't!!!!!!!!This was like Napoleon Dynomite. Just another stupid waste of time movie. Please, don't waste ur money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lizzie McGuire meets MK&A","review":"What can I say? When I was 12, I read the book and loved it. I leant it to my friends and they loved it. We were glad when we heard the movie came out. But we were dissapointed. What could have been an excellent movie was wreaked by the animated scenes, and the focus on the rock concert because she has a crush on the lead singer. Carla Santini was portrayed as being just a little mean when in the book she's much more.The book, had the movie been faithful to it, could have been as good as Mean Girls but right now it's just the Lizzie McGuire movie meets New York Minute, all played by Lindsay Lohan wearing feathers and a head scarf. I though that the girl who played Ella did a good job but Lindsay Lohan was just somehow out of sync when everything was going on. Hey, maybe I got so attached to the book that I just expected to much. But I recomend the book far more highly, if you're over 11. Happy viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"It sucked","review":"first of all-When I walked into the theater there was NO ONE only me, my mom, and my sister so that gave me second thoughts on how good the movie was. When the movie started I thought it was going to be a good movie because Linsday Lohan was in it- I was wrong the movie totally sucked. It had no plot and it wasn't that funny at all. Sorry, I know i'm the first to write a bad review but I think Freaky Friday was much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Awesome Film!!!","review":"I saw this movie about 5 years ago, and didn't like it too well. A few days ago, I saw it on tv and decided to give it a 2nd chance. I like it a lot better now, than when I saw it back in '04. Sexy beautiful Lindsay Lohan does an awesome job! She plays Mary \\"Lola\\" Stepp who is forced to move with her family to New Jersey. She makes friends with a girl named Ella, who loves the same band that Lola does, Sidarthur. They become really depressed when they find out that the band is breaking up, and try to go to their last concert. They get into a lot of crazy misadventures. I highly recommend CONFESSIONS OF A TEENAGE DRAMA QUEEN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It is dramatic...","review":"I went in with an open mind and sat through, hoping it would get better, but this is the ONLY movie I have ever seen where I have wanted to walk out of the theater. For maybe the only positive messages they have in the movie (follow your dreams and don't lie to your best friend) there are so many negative ones. Be catty to other girls, make it one of your top dreams to meet that famous person, do what feels right to you regardless of what it means to other people, give in to stereotypes about teen girls just do it more extremely than the other people and you'll be different, it IS all about you and everything you want will come true! Everything was taken to such an extreme in this movie (it is dramatic) and as a pretty laid back person, I couldn't deal with it. I can see how young girls would be attracted to this film, but I personally didn't like the pointless drama and self-involvement of the main character. I wish I had taken the title more seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good...","review":"After I saw this movie, I was so disappointed! This movie does not even make sense and does not have a real plot. I know Lola's suppose to be a drama queen, but it went over the line and the movie became cheesy. Lindsay Lohan's 'Mean Girls' was much better then this crappy film. I cannot believe anyone even liked it after seeing it! The events are just wack and don't even relate to each other whatsoever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In my opinion","review":"I saw this movie recently and and about 10 minutes into it I turned it off.

I rented this movie, hoping it would be as good, but this movie is bad. Lohan usually plays a likable character in her movies...but her character has a posh attitude that makes you not care what really happens to her. The whole movie seems surreal, and it gave me a headache. I had to stop watching the movie after 30 mins. There was no real plot, it was going in too many directions. I didnt care what happened to her character, but more concerned about the money I paid for the rental. ***I recommend \\"13 going on 30\\" (starring Jennifer Gardner), it is alot deeper, warmer and leaves you feeling it was worth your time watching it.***"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever","review":"Look, I love Lindsey Lohan and I have all of her other movies, but this one is crap. Run far far away. Besides a plot in which things never even mentioned swing out like they've been built up all along about which the director apparently expects you to go \\"awww\\" its just very 1 dimensional and not lindseys best preformance.

The dvd includes Lindsey's 'That girl' song. It's AWFUL AWFUL, from her terrible voice right down to her 'rapping' (HOW EMBARRASING!!!)5.) This junk wasn't even worth my rental money!!!! AVOID AT ALL COSTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah, Right","review":"For your information, I can stand-- and sometimes even like-- bad movies but this was definitley a bad movie and I definitley didn't like it. It was completley unrealistic for one. I mean, who lets their teens, go to a rock concert by themselves and meet a drunken rock star?!?! Anyway, it's completely unrealistic ( point #2) in the fact that Lola becomes such great friends with her idol. The movie had no storyline until Lola and Ella went to the unrealistic concert. Instead of the heroine Disney intended her to be, she came off as a spoiled, over-the-top highschooler. This movie does not help if Lohan wants to be more popular than Duff. Go see \\"Mean Girls\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I would consider myself a Lindsay Lohan fan. Its just amazing how bad this movie is. Please do not buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it get any more predictable?","review":"This was not a movie I was looking foward to see. Nothing from the previews looked appealing to me. I wasn't planning on going to see the movie until I got stuck bring my pre-teen sister and her friends to see it.It's basically about a girl who moves to New Jersey from NYC and hates it because she feels she can't become a big star in New Jersey. She also loves a rock band who is breaking up, and it is her mission to get to their final concert. These two things together make up the story of the movie.The problem with this movie was that it was so predictable. There wasn't a single scene in the movie where I thought \\"I didn't think that would happen.\\" If you see one of the Disney Movies that they have been coming out with lately geared towards pre-teen girls, you've seen them all.I think you could find something better to spend your $6.00 on instead of seeing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen- a total let down","review":"I was very excited to see this movie because of Lindsay Lohan's excellence in her other films. I think that they tried to make it kind of like Lizzie McGuirre with the little animated scenes. The movie did not really explain the plot. Lindsay meets a guy at her new school and than, in the next sceene she is like best friends with him. The movie also did not explain why she kept on lying. I mean, she lied to her new friend about her father. She said that her father was killed in a motor cycle accident when really her father and mother got divoriced. Overall, Lindsay's acting is good, but the movie does not explain anything and has a very weak plot. I am a Lindsay Lohan fan... but I am not a big fan of this movie. In my opinion, her other films are much, much better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"typical Lindsay Lohan flop","review":"the only reason i bought this movie was because the cover is cute. i TRIED to watch it with an open mind and TRIED to like it. after all, what's the point of owning a movie you don't even like?lindsay lohan's character is too over-the-top. i understand that she is SUPPOSED to be that way in the movie, as she is a DRAMA QUEEN. however, she does not pull it off well.there is a plot, i can give them that.but the movie was just very lame.please save yourself time and DON'T watch it!the ONLY lindsay movies worth watching are \\"Mean Girls\\" and \\"Parent Trap\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"da!!!!!!!!! its just for entertianment...","review":"I dont care what people say about the movie Im 8 years old. but it was good enough 4 me. so take a pill and chill!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 'confessions'.","review":"I love Lindsay Lohan in movies. I thought she did great here. I think this is a tad different than what I've seen her doing, but it was still enjoyable for me.

I would recommend this, especially if you like Lindsay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again...Lindsay Lohan did a great movie!!!","review":"This movie, as well, is better than the past one of Lindsay Lohan \\"Freaky Friday\\".

I enjoyed all of Lindsay Lohan's movies (The Parent Trap, Mean Girls, Freaky Friday) but this one is appalling. In my standards all of her films pass with flying colours (especially Mean Girls) butthis is just wrong. The movie follows like 3 different plots:1. Lohan moving away from home and trying to fit in2.High school3. Meeting a rock starI mean what was the point ot 3 plots in such a simple movie. In the high school plot it tries to follow one similar to Mean Girls but fails miserablly. The first hour is a waste but the second half is OK.

She doesn't quite fit in at her new school in a new town. When she hears tthat her favorite band is having one final concert, she is determined to be there, but is met by a wacky turn of events.I found Lola a terrible role model. That would be fine if it weren't that she is the hero. I sincerely hope that no young, inpressionable people view this movie. Lola is self centered and wants to stick out, but when you think about it she's really not so unique.The music was pretty good, but If you want to hear it, purchase the soundtrack, you don't have to suffer through the movie like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"This shoe is not good for narrow feet.","review":"I have a narrow foot and these were supposed to be narrow but weren't.

The joystick and pressure switch that surround it can be activated when in a case (not included), so it is good to use the lock switch which only allows brief activation of the device when pressure hits the on/off switch.Battery life exceeded expectations, too. And built-in Li-ion far superior to button batteries or AAA NiMH in comparable units.Only rub is this player only supports USB1.1, not USB2.0. Wish it had an SD card interface, too.

Every ten seconds the game becomes a pointless movie and you are either stuck watching or forced to skip thru which thank god is an option. Either way the momentum of play has been shattered, and your x button is worn out. What's worse is that none of the scenes contain critical info, they are just there for the \\"art\\" of it.. The save points? forget it, you better not die or youre all the way back to the prologue, A collosal waste of time.The graphics are blocky and colorless except for bleak bleak bleak brown and gray. Max is a really Unlikable character. He's boring and lame. Bullet time is good, but combined with the auto aim, it makes the game to easy. Killing becomes over simplified. Except for a few dynamic points for gun play, and an engine that allows you to kick a cardboard box or garbage can and slide them across a room nothing else really gets my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Graphics","review":"I noticed alot of the reviews left on here complain about choppyness. I do not see how you can grade a game just because your computer is to slow to run it. Rockstar Games has spent alot of time creating extremely detailed enviroments, where just about anything is a useable object. Cut scenes and cinematics have also been placed throughout the game to present an indepth and often funny story line. The textures and graphic designs are amazing, along with a few new weapon upgrades. Just like the first Max Payne, this game is VERY addicting and I strongly recommend those who appreciate extremely detailed enviroments to purchase this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"I have MP2 on my computer and, to tell you the truth, it's one of the best games I have.

The framerates are stunningly slow (turning 360 degrees takes 4-5 seconds), the mission load times are 20-30 seconds (what??), the bullet-time is no different from normal time (it's sepia toned - oh boy!), and the auto-save feature from the first version is missing (forcing you to stop and save your game every 1-2 minutes). In summary, this is the single worst sequel that Rockstar has ever produced, and after finishing it in under 3 days, i would barely recommend it for a rental, much less a purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max Payne is AWESOME. BUY THIS TODAY!!!","review":"Awesome sequel to a great game. BUY IT FOR CHRISTMAS!Bullet-time has a new spin that will amaze you. Graphics are truly awesome ( especially on Xbox ). Music and sound effects will emerse you into this game for hours. Don't beleive the nonsense about it being too short or easy. The cut scenes are shorter from the 1st one, so the action is less interupted and makes the game much smoother to play. PLese buy this game.

It is true that there is a new story and there are some new gun configurations but the gameplay and graphics were not improved at all. The whole bullet time thing is not enough of a reason to purchase a game. When I went to sell it back they wouldnt take it so i basically had to pay them to take this joke of a game. Waste of time and DVD discs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely disappointing port to the PS2","review":"The PC version of Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne managed to improve on the first game in some areas and was vastly enjoyable overall, however this Playstation 2 port of the game is severely disappointing. A noticibly terrible frame rate, blurry textures, missing sound effects, an even worse save system, and ridiculously long loading times plague what could have been a stellar game. The storyline, plot twists, and even the once mediocre graphic novel-esque cut scenes are the game's few saving graces, along with the run 'n gun bullet time action that was so enjoyable in the first game, but in the end Max Payne 2's flaws outweigh it's strengths. It's a shame more time wasn't taken to make Max Payne 2 something as memorable as the first game; I really wanted to like this game despite it's flaws, but they're just too much. All in all, Max Payne 2 is still worth a rental for fans who dug the original, but don't expect anything at all great from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on the PS2, but not great as the PC!","review":"The story is engrossing, I have to admit that I really like this game.

You can get 35 more levels on it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT (so far)","review":"I only played a demo of this game so I cant be an accurate judge, but what i played, I loved. The controls are very much the same fluid controls from the first so there isn't much of a breaking in period there. The graphics? can't improve much on perfection. They DID do good on improving that however (and they got rid on Max's stupid smirk). I looks fluid and stunning as before. The story however is just plain COOL. It's got that same back and forth film noir style and i played for only 5 mins and was already starting the to feel the pull. Plus, they added the bullet time combos, so instead of only diving, you got Max spinning with guns drawn firing a two different enemys and it looks INSANE. So get this game. What the hell, you deserve it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"I expected more from Rockstar, the company that brought us the incredible world of GTA. Max Payne 2 is defintely not GTA. The gameplay is awkward, the story is horribly written (the dialogue is so bad it makes you cringe), and the main difficulty in the game seems to lie with not getting so irritated with the game that you stop playing it. One of the few redeeming features is the bullet time mode, which is pretty cool. The humourous elements in the narrative can be entertaining as well, but it is ususally overshadowed by melodrama. Maybe if you could buy this game for $5 it would be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sequel","review":"This game is little to no improvement upon the first. There are practically no new moves that can be used in bullet time and the graphics are a poor quality. The story is weak and predicatable. Rent this game before buying or you will likely be regretting a $50 purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first","review":"If there was never a max payne and this came out. Everyone would have liked it better, but there is one so I hate it. The slow diving and slow bullet dodging are still there but have changed for the worse. Graphics are chucky and the textures are ugly. Sound is OK. Running around seems hard and I think the plot is just about the worst for any game ever made. Very short. still a fun game, but not for the $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst games I have ever played...","review":"This was one of the worst games I have ever played (it really doesn't even earn 1 star). Your movement is very (and I mean very) choppy and there are even more cut scenes than Metal Gear Solid 2. These cut away scenes are not a bad thing per say. They work well in the Metal Gear games and games like Dead to Rights where the scenes load quickly and keep the story moving. However, in this atrocity the slow story line combined with the slow \\"loading...\\" makes Max Payne very bad for the impatient gamer. To sum up this game, it's choppy. Your character's movement is choppy and the constant jumping to cut scenes is choppy. It's not a good game. I was really surprised seeing such a bad game from Rockstar. I would not recommend this game. Get Manhunt instead, it's a lot more fun and the character control is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"PS2 version sucks.","review":"This is a near perfect game. For the PC that is. The PS2 port is nothing short of a disaster. Graphics are scaled down, extremely slow frame rate, and load times that will make you want to rip out your hair. Worst of all, you won't be able to make use of mods for the PS2, like you can with the PC. Do yourself a favor and buy this for PC. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the real Fall of Max Payne","review":"MAx Payne 1 was amazing. Max Payne 2 is very choppy and game play is not the same. Bullet time and game play where much better in the first game and the story on this game is not interesting at all. You can also notice many flaws in the video game specially when it comes to the movies and it kinda makes you wonder whether the game was rushed or simply not completely finished. Part 1 is way better cause it didnt take so long to load and because people like me who have played the first part are use to the autosave and in this one you no longer have the option. Its not a bad game but the first game is better in every way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Payneful","review":"This game is pretty cool.But Not as cool as the first.The first addition has better graphics in all.but this one the audio isnt so great.Im a HUGE Max Payne fan.But the first had more action,lots more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Clean non-latex gloves","review":"Great product - gentle on the skin; don't know why it's not more widely available."},{"rating":"1","title":"gloves need to be thicker","review":"the gloves need to be thicker, after washing dishes a few times they have holes in them.

I am a natural blonde but my hair is kinda dark-blonde without exposure to the sun. With this color it just gets this light touch of sun-kissed and looks fresh and healthy. It does have no yellow tint at all and it doesn't fade out either! I am very very happy with it and use it by now for about a year. It looks very natural. Sometimes it has a slight grayisch touch in my tips right after coloring which is gone after the first wash and no one ever noticed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not lighten my dark blonde hair at all.","review":"I bought this with high hopes but it didn't lighten my hair at all.

Only a couple of the execises are scale based. There is one 5-note pattern in G major, and a couple of very basic sequences in box 1 of the minor pentatonic scale.If you just want to exercise your hands picking chromatic runs that have little or no practical application, that's what you get.I was hoping for exercises that would teach scales and modes while at the same time exercising and developing muscle memory and speed.As gifted a teacher as Danny Gill usually is, I was dissappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing like the movie, thank goodness","review":"Amazing, but not surprising that Hollywood would take a bona-fide satire and turn it into nostalgic mush. This book is rollicking fun and completely irreverent; a rarity. If you haven't seen the movie, skip it and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Purposely and completely unbelievable","review":"I have never read a book that was worse than the movie, this is the one. It is written in first person with appallingly bad spelling to represent Forrest's poor grammer and accent. It amazes me that any producer reading this book thought that it would be a good movie, thank goodness that the producer ommitted most of the book from the movie.

What a wonderful and clear presentation of Gods grace and the life that the believer can and should experience here on earth. This should be required reading for all pastors and teachers of the Gospel of Jesus and for all students in Bible college and seminary.

You would do better finding a book that teaches the meaning of scripture within their intended context.Yes, his point is well taken that the gospel is more that simply having your sins forgiven, but I haven't realistically found that to be a big problem among serious Christians in general. I guess the author sees it as a big problem because it took him so long to figure it out.These type of books have been around for years. They claim they have insight into the gospel that the church at large either hasn't seen, won't see, or can't see. The truth is, serious Christians have heard these things before but prefer books of gospel exposition that are more sound.There is a reason this is a small press (read self-published) job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense!","review":"God's word is written and it is final. There is no \\"rest of the Gospel\\" SIN is only spelled one way. Its comical how these distinguished authors come up with all of these theories on how to be a Christian when God gives you understanding of his word by way of the Holy Ghost. John 14:26Proverbs Chap 3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the Lord, and depart from evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guide for furthering your relationship with God.","review":"The book brings out the concepts in the new testament and explains them in a clear, concise, and detailed manner. It makes you re-evaluate what you need to be focusing on in order to further your relationship with God. This is a great book for the Christian who is saved and is wondering what the next steps are for spiritual growth. I am recommending this book to all of my friends and family - and it will be the next book to study in my small group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont Judge a book by its cover.","review":"I was actually sent this book back in 2001 from a friend of mine. I took a look at the cover title and I thought to myself \\"the rest of the gospel\\"? As Christian we're not supposed to ADD or TAKE away from any of the words, right? So I never read it...I actually through it away. Then several years later (2006) it was recommended to me again. Well, I was a little more mature(or ready) this time around and starting reading it. Man, this is the most profound circumstance of DONT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. I have learned more about my Union and Identity in Christ through this book, than all my years \\"knowing\\" Christ. Read this book and then start to \\"REST\\" in the gospel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Adult Study Group or Sunday School","review":"Our Church used this book in our adult Bible Study class. We found The Rest of the Gospel to be one of the best book-based studies we have ever used. We covered one chapter each week. Even with this extended approach, the group maintained a high level of interest throughout the study. The authors' ideas are all firmly founded in Holy Scripture. Contrary to what the title might infer to some, it is not about one of the \\"new\\" Gnostic gospels. It truly brings out the \\"Good News\\" meaning of the word Gospel. I highly recommend the book and believe it will enrich the lives of all who read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"Understanding and living the truths of this book will change your life.

This album from '95 perfectly embodies Jamal's economic style on a collection of Ellington classics. He does Skylark and a great original, too effectively showing his patient and technically mind-blowing style.

It's incredibly cheap and uncomfortable to hold as the edges are so sharp they almost cut my hand. In fact, the plastic mould must not have been made right because the edges had pieces sticking out of it, almost like it was laminated. I had to take scissors and trim the plastic off the edges and try to make it less sharp.I've also found for many of my bowls it doesn't scrape it out properly because it's too big and not rounded enough.I don't really get it, all the great reviews. Sure, it's only a few bucks, but I did expect something that was manufactured decently, and at the least, was comfortable to hold in my hand.I can't help but think this is a knockoff of the actual Ateco product, but who knows.

If the school on your degree is not \\"brand name\\", you're better off seeking advice from more optimistic and realistic books. Ms. Naficy's book is depressing and her perceptions are skewed.

The trouble I had with it was that the author seemed to be suggesting that the jobs were somehow desirable, when in fact, after reading the text and interviews, it seems a repellent line of work to get into. The long hours and the competitive and grueling nature of the interview process seem like turn-offs, and the work itself seems unfulfilling. The book would be useful to those who are convinced that they would want to work in consulting or banking, though after reading this book they may actually be dissuaded (as I was) from entering such a vile, corporate environment. I suppose the author is to be commended for writing this book, but I couldn't help thinking that it was a rather unchallenging book for her to write (given her background)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book for gaining understanding of I-banking","review":"The book covers many intricate details about banking and consulting.

Perlman is no Heifetz or Kriesler, but the fact that he played this when he was about my age must have brought back memories for him. He uses an extensive vibrato, and he dosen't fall into habits making it a little jumpy like he does for several other famous violin concertos.

There are not a lot of surprises or twists in the plot, but it is no less fun as a result of those absences. It is a fun read, and it is short enough for a plane trip, a couple hours on the beach, or just a short evening on the couch in front of the fireplace and radio.In short, if you like Predator (not the second movie, it [was bad]), and you wanted a bit more action, pick this up. You won't be disappointed. If you are looking for something that requires a little bit of thought, keep looking you haven't found it yet. But, like I said, great for a two-hour brain-break. Enjoy!Harkius"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talk about a fun novel!","review":"This is a book for people who enjoy action but also want a good story to go with it. Amazing follow up to the Predator movie. It gives you everything you want, aliens, cops, action, and a Jamacian Anti-tank gun! How muck more fun do you want. Although I was a little lost in the end about why the Predators came to NY in the first place.

I was looking for something to introduce them to opera without watching something for several hours.. The Telephone is only about 20 minutes long and is somewhat comedic so they were able to sit still and watch it while gaining a little appreciation for what an opera was. They were able to compare it to some of their stereotypes they had thought about opera, and see that it could be humorous and short also.

For starters Max Payne will put his foot straight up vercetti's ass. This game should be made into a movie it's just that great. It still has the great graphics and yeah the graphics are great sorry if you people can't get the d**k out of your eye to see that. And one of the greatest things ever the slow motion diving that every other game keeps copying off of but still won't be as great. People seriously i'm going to be dead straight with you this game is awesome! Now Max Payne 2 still has the same great dark and suspensefulness that it had in the first one. Don't get me wrong i know you've been hearing it's shorter than the first but still packs the same great punch!! It's 1 of the best games ever any REAL gamer would know that!!!

I absolutely loved it so much that before i even finished the game, I ordered this and the original online. They are all very fun and the storyline, while on the edge of cheesy sometimes, is very intriguing to say the lease. I got both Max Payne 1&2 for the low price of 14$ with shipping so it was totally worth it. Now I have the Trilogy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why doesn't Rockstar update with the times?","review":"The graphic quality has improved since the first one but that is not saying much. My least favorite part of the whole graphic quality of the game is, anytime you see a car, the windshield is not glass, instead it is a hard blue concrete. Also Payne's cutscenes in Graphic Novels is neat, but he talks in riddles the whole damn time! This is annoying. Gun battles are still fun, collision detection is still horrible. This could most likely be called Max Payne 1.5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it sounds.","review":"Max Payne is not a great game. It's all shooting, no fighting or dirving at all.

His low rich distinctive voice conveyed a range of emotions. I don't have any of the other CD's in the American series, but I loved the variety of themes on these recordings. Help Me, I Came To Believe and God's Gonna Cut You Down are three songs that show that he a deep faith in God. Rose In My Heart and Love's Been Good to Me are beautiful love songs. If You Could Read My Mind is another standout love song on here. I'm Free From The Chain Gang is another highlight. This is an excellent song about appreciating your freedom after getting out of prison. He really sings from the heart on this song. Like the 309 and Further Up On the Road are two beautiful songs about death and approaching the end of life. I loved listening to the final recordings of Johnny Cash. I wouldn't be surprised if producer Rick Rubin received a Grammy for his work on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why no .mp3 download of this ?","review":"Hey Amazon,It looks like all the other American Recordings are available as an .mp3 download.

Ravaged by the approach of death, Cash's voice is still powerful despite the loss of depth and range. His lyrics are, if anything, better than they've ever been; much of that is of course directly related to the decidedly spiritual bent his music took near the end of his life. Though many of the songs on this album fill me with a sorrowful hollowness while listening; afterwards, as the music and words fade away, I feel uplifted. I've been listening to Johnny Cash all my life, and it wasn't until he was gone that I realized how much his music, whether it was lively or foreboding, pleased me tremendously. I miss him, but I've still got him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cash's Best","review":"I have been a fan of Johnny Cash for over 40 years. I have heard, loved and been moved by many of his songs but never has an album moved me as emotionally as this one has. In spite of his health, in spite of his losing June, his voice is strong and his message is one that is powerful that we should all listed to. He has inspired me and has made me look at my own mortality differently. I thank him for that and he shall live forever in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a gem, it's a keeper. it's the best","review":"Johnny is a message of love and hope. It'd be impossible for anyone with a litle heart to not buy and love this cd. Mostly he speaks as a man facing his own death, it's amazing, really. In other songs he speaks like a wise man. He is a man the world misses not only those of his age.One of my favorite tracks on this record is \\"Rose of My Heart\\". \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\",\\" He called my name, \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" and \\"On the Evening Train\\" He is the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"American V: A Hundred Highways","review":"A very sad album.

Goodbye John . . . and Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the voice of old but still enjoyable.","review":"I like Johnny Cash and thought this CD was special considering it was his last.

I'm not going to lower it to the level of a \\"Formulaic production\\" either. Yes, some of the criticisms of the album are valid. There are some weak spots. There's nothing quite to the level of Hurt (from The Man Comes Around). But I dare you to listen to \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\" without getting a lump in your throat.I think it's a fitting ending. He sounds as if he knows that the end is near, and he is reluctantly accepting that.

My Dad loved him and that love is something we share, even though my Dad has been gone for years.I'm not a music critic, and I wouldn't presume to comment on the technical elements of the songs on this album, but I will say that there is no music being made today that approaches Johnny's ability to capture the heights and depths of the human experience. Even though his voice is often weaker than that which I remember from my youth as being something approaching the voice of God, there is still a power and grace within it that can not be matched or even approximated. If you know anything about Johnny Cash or have ever enjoyed any of his music, you won't regret buying this CD. It's not happy, dance-around stuff, but it is truly moving and great. All I can say is, \\"Thank God for Rick Rubin.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"if you're dyin' to here more from johnny...","review":"CHECK IT OUT!

Maybe his life simply caused him to ask for so much and in the catching up with who he wanted to be he had a lot of experiences, and learned more than most will in a lifetime. His music has always been about his experiences and those he witnessed, this album is no different. Something in his voice and the inflection of his words is different, there is peace, there is love, there is reverence. It will touch your soul if you let it - not to mention your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"thank you Johnny Cash","review":"My 21 year old daughter actually introduced me to this CD.

It bearly moved air and actually caused the system air to become slower out of the vents. This is a poor design and should only be considered as a way to move air outside of a ductwork system. Stay clear of this if you are looking for real air movement and understand the distinction with regards to CFM in a \\"real air\\" scenario. I assure you that disastifaction is guaranteed if you think this fan will supplement your AC or heating system.

From a software engineering standpoint, there are some serious questions about the code in this book. For example, in the section on Binary Trees, most of the traversal algorithms are implemented at the level of the BinaryNode component rather than in the Tree container class.

I was not new to programing at the start of my course, however I was new to OOP. This book does a horrible job of explaining the concept of OOP which, in my opinion, is difficult to grasp at first. The information in this book is very dense. Complex concepts are only given an explanation that is a page or two long (ex: Binary search trees). The examples aren't horrible, but they lack ample documentation. Now that I fully understand the concepts (thanks to the internet) this book makes an alright reference.

Don't turn to the code examples in this book to figure out what he's trying to say, because many times they are simply incorrect. In order to find the working code, you'll have to download it from his website. Weiss understands the material really well, but simply can't explain it.

In those six months, the original had to be shipped to Antec for replacement after about 3 months and the replacement had to be shipped back about 2 and a half months later. I'd say the quality of this product isn't what I'd expect out of Antec. Now I know this is a basic power supply and the machine that it's in doesn't have a high power draw (onboard video, only a hard drive, dvd drive, and motherboard are attached to this power supply).I'd suggest looking at another power supply to save yourself shipping fees and time in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work - dead on arrival","review":"Hard to say if I have bad luck, or if this is a bad product.

Never once got that snap-there is the right focus. Continually adjusting the focus.2) Bino's do not fit in the case while the Eye cups are fully extended. The ready to go position for me. Pretty much eliminates them for use on Birds. (Even without the eye cap/protectors on!)3) Case is cheap felt on the inside, In less then 1 hour had fuzzy's all over the lenses.4) Eye cap protector doesn't have a good spot to connect the strap. If you wanted to use the strap and hang them from your neck.I had to give 2 stars for the specs like waterproofing, lightweight ect. but #1 has to be at least ok/good optics. That's the whole Idea for a binocular?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great binoculars","review":"I gave this to my husband for Christmas for bird watching. It has excellent clarity and depth.

But for how cheap this wax was I could afford to wax it every week and I'd be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work very well","review":"Have used Toko and Swix products for many years without issue.

Tested on Big Bear in February 2010","review":"I hot waxed my Burton T6 with Swix CH8 wax as a base layer and CH4 for the top CH4 wax layer. It was tuff to scrape the wax off. I tested the T6 on Big Bear after a snowstorm in February 10. The board glided well all morning but by noon the base edges were dry. The following day I waxed the T6 with Hertel's Super Hot Sauce. The wax went on easy and scraped great. The next day I snowboarded all day long and the board handled and glided great. It was fast. After the day the base edges still had wax and the board was still as fast as in the morning. Swix is expensive and I didn't like the end results. Hertel is resonably priced and is a great wax. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good value and great website info!","review":"This was my first attempt at hot waxing skis and I'll have to say it was very easy. The instructions provided with the wax were simple and clear, and my snowboarder friend also showed me how. We ski casually about once per week in different snow conditions, and the wax seems to be lasting well after 3 weeks. I read all the reviews here before purchasing, and I believe it lives up to what others have said about a good all around wax for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"great wax!","review":"this is awesome wax, its better than any wax i've used, and you can't beat the price. 3/4 pound will last a long time if you use it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was skeptical, but it's good stuff","review":"I read a lot of glowing reviews about this wax and I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical. At the urging of a local board shop, I decided I'd give it a try. It's everything everyone said it'd be. I live in Ohio, and we board in A LOT of ice and this wax was not only fast and smooth, but lasted a good 3 full days of shredding. Other waxes started to leave my edges dry after one or two runs. I'm very pleased with this wax and will continue to use it from now on. Price wasn't bad either for the size of the brick."},{"rating":"2","title":"all temperature with small compromise","review":"I'm not sold on \\"all temperature\\" but haven't had opportunity to try this wax in extreme warm or cold yet. It works well in typical winter temperature ranges, I've skied this wax from teen's to low mid-30's Fahrenheit and it's done the job. I don't think it's as slick as temp specific Swix waxes, but the rest of my family can't tell the difference. No racers here, just recreational skiers and a retired instructor, so this will do. And regardless of \\"all temperature\\" the price just can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonable Price - Fast Skis","review":"I wax skis for a family of five and was tired of selecting from a variety of waxes like I used to do during my racing days. This wax is relatively soft, applies well with an iron, and scrapes off easily. At the mountain, everyone had \\"fast\\" skis\\". It's rewarding to see your whole family passing people who don't wax their skis while on a long traverse. Skis perform better as well. Like most waxes, it will last for a couple days of hard skiing before needing reapplication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good wax","review":"After reading the reviews, I thought I'd give this wax a try. My previous wax was a Dakine wax that came with my snowboard tuning kit. This wax performed very similarly to the Dakine wax. For the money, it's a very good deal.

This wax, however, has become my all-time favorite. Works great on my snowboard as well as the wife's and kids' skis. Haven't had a chance to give it a go in the rain yet, but if it has a similar performance as it does in the 10-35 degree range, I will be pleased. Surprisingly fast for an all-temp wax. Great price too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all condition wax.","review":"You could run around trying to collect five or six waxes for every condition and have to change them based upon the temp/snow, etc. -OR- you could but this wax and not worry about it. It works well enough. I have five skiers in the family so it is nice to not have to spend a ton of money on specialty waxes. My son even uses this for racing and says it is good enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do it all wax.","review":"I've run this wax on my skis now for 2 years. Always a performer.

Oddly coincident to his previous role as Bruce Lee in \\"Dragon - the Bruce Lee Story.\\" (Bruce Lee, as most know, was the victim of race prejudice throughout his entire life.) Since this is the story of a young Inuit's emotional relationships to his past and his present, how can the movie be said to star anyone BUT the individual who plays that character...in this case, JS Lee - an oriental/Asian non-white actor -- and he is great!

Yes? Well this book is one of those.As a professional software developer I never had much use for Que books - thick paper, too much white space, and big fonts. This book is no exception. I made the mistake of buying it on the strength of the reviews at Amazon but it lives up to the Que tradition of being a book full of basic information, most of which is available in the SQL server docs. Sure it has lots of examples but little that is very enlightening.I didn't get the impression here that this was a basic book but it is. It is going to be a disappointment to you if you, like me, already know SQL/DBMS programming but from another database product. If I was starting out then maybe I'd find it of use, but a one-stop answer to all you SQL Server problems it most definitely is not.

Ask Delta how many times they have purchases one for me. however and the feet that \\"dont come on it\\" are just rubber boots, so you will need feet if your not wanting the wabble of rubber bottoms, you can take off the rubber bottoms that are covers for the dual spikes which are great if you are in grass. But real life says you grab and go. which for me i dont want to polish off the dirt and such off the spikes. I put on flat feet that are more oblong and round and this is much better for my event weddings that we go inside and out side frequently.If you get the not included spreader that goes between the leggs it is easier to go up and down with a big camera on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahh......

Don't even waste your time or money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish","review":"l just have to agree with the other nay-sayers about this overly long mystery. After a very good start, the novel progressed into what l can only describe as a few \\"non-sub-plots\\", most of them tedious, boring and inconsequential. The prose also became sluggish, a chore to read, and most readers will be able to solve the main riddle far earlier than the folks from New Scotland Yard.In defense of Ms. Grimes, a friend of mine in the industry claims that any blame - as l just described - is primarily the fault of either the writer's Agent or editor. A good example would be the novel's references to \\"Santa Fe sunsets\\" and \\"Las Vegas\\" gambling when, the story occurring in England, the refernces should have been to \\"Alpine sunsets\\" and \\"French Riviera\\" gambling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best...","review":"I LOVE the Richard Jury series and always look forward to the usual cast of characters; you won't find much of most of them in this book. The Winds of Change did not have much pub time or comedic relief so there was really no time or place for the RJ gang. Also, the plot is not complicated and a bit of a stretch but I still recommend reading as fans will want to keep up with RJ personal updates and it is fine vacation type reading. Hoping the Black Cat will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"First introduction to Martha Grimes, very disappointed!","review":"I also found this book to be a chore to get through. This was the first Martha Grimes Novel I have ever read, and I hated it.. Not only was the subject dreary and predictable, it was so anticlimactic. I found it impossible to connect with any of the characters and thought the quotes and prose she used over and over again from other authors and novels superfluous, almost like she had a storage of favorite quotes saved up waiting to show her own aptitude of literature. I disliked this book so much after the final page and was so aggravated my first thought was to go review it as the waste of time I found it to be. I thought the writing lacked fluidity and the story line was grim and disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hack writing","review":"This is a very disappointing tome from one whose earlier works were so bright with descriptive prose and pinpoint characterization. Ms. Grimes has fallen into the hackneyed manner of most American writers and has allowed skimpy dialogue to develop plot and character. The book is a \\"quick read\\". The weighty subject matter of this volume is full of ideas just waiting break loose and emerge from murky depths, but this novel has all the murky depths of a well-kept California swimming pool. Ms. Grimes is capable of so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Winds of Change - Just Kept Changing","review":"It took until two thirds into the book before I became somewhat interested in the story. There seemed to be scenes and dialog that just didn't fit the storyline. It could possibly be that this was my first Richard Jury novel and being that I didn't start from book one I missed out on something. Still the story should have been enough to keep the pages turning...but it didn't.There were times in which I became immersed in the story but then again it lost me after a few pages. Not sure if I will try another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Rubbish!!","review":"For all Jane Austen fans out there, do not spend your money on this infantile attempt to recreate the world of Pride and Prejudice. The author uses no original ideas and even borrows the names of her characters from other novels/titles by Austen. Elizabeth Bennet Darcy is reduced to a simpering, watered down, whining social busy body who barely leaves the confines of Pemberley to develope more as a character. In fact if this were a play, it could be very convincely played as a single actor who experiences the complete book within her mind. \\"Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?\\" Not one character is of consequence within this book. If you must read this book, go to your local library and read it on someone else's dime."},{"rating":"2","title":"An impressive sequel","review":"October 27, 1999 -An impressive Jane Austen sequel. I loved this sequel to Pride and Prejudice. Pride and Prejudice is my favorite book and as always I want to know what happens after the book ends!!

I also enjoyed the story, everything that I had ever hoped would happen for Lizzy and Mr. Darcy happened and there was a very happy ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters from Pemberley the First Year","review":"This is a sweet book but no real suprises and everything turned out just perfect in the neat little boxes some might imagine that it would. The reading is easy and but the letters only come from Elizabeth and that can get a little slow at some points. There were no real challenges faced by the couple and for the reader use to escaping reality in these perfect worlds may still find this a bit much. All in all not the worst P&P sequel but far from the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Letters was very disappointing","review":"I have read most of the Austen spin-offs and found this to be the worst. While I appreciated the attempts to remain in the Jane Austen style, I felt that there were so many attempts to quote the previous novel and draw in characters from other novels that the plot was sadly lacking. I was anxiously awaiting this after the previous reviews, but was left shaking my head. I wondered if they had read the same book. I would suggest any other spins before this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"A lovely, gentle tale. Through the somewhat sketchy medium of letters, the author implies rather than narrates the story.

Jane Dawkins has done a superlative job of capturing the essence of Austen in her portrayal of Lizzy Darcy (nee Bennet). I would not hesitate to recommend it to all Austen fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waster your time!","review":"Although the writer says she is not Jane Austen, she uses Austen's vocabulary and expands on Austen's story line, completely stripping it of any interesting turns of events or any elements of surprise, shock, or true delight. The literary genius is missing. The letters are dull and monotonous. It is a real effort to turn the pages. You keep hoping for something more and you keep getting more of the same thing.If you have read all of Jane Austen's books and you wish to read similar literature, start with Anne Radcliffe (1764-1823) and you'll find yourself reading all of her books also. Radcliffe was a favorite of Austen's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BO-RING!","review":"Aargh, this book was painful. Basically, it takes plot points and character descriptions from Austen's other novels, and repackages them almost without modification into letters between Lizzie and Jane after their marriages. A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH -- try another spinoff; this is a waste of time","review":"This is not a good spinoff. I have read nearly every PnP spinoff I can get my hands on and this is the first that I've had a hard time finishing. The letter form of the novel just sucks (Austen abandoned it herself for a reason) and the author steals nearly every supporting character from either Persuasion or SnS and many lines from the BBC PnP script. After stealing everything from the other works, the author only needs to fill in a few lines here and there and does so with maximum suck. Try the books from Darcy's point of view (Fitzwilliam Darcy, Gentleman) or the dirty Mr. Darcy Takes a Wife. Or the some of the slightly sci-fi time-travel ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather insipid...but perfectly tolerable","review":"I cant say this book was very stimulating. I read this after reading Pamela Aidens trilogy (a much better read) on Fitzwilliam Darcy. Elizabeths letters to Jane and pleasant and what you would expect letters to family of that time to be - superficial and full of \\"I met so and so blah blah blah\\".

For those who long for more, this book does the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly boring. . .","review":"I wish now that I had followed the advice of the other reviewers. This was a quick read, but boring. Nothing of interest happens in the letters to Jane from Elizabeth. As a sequel, it would be better to read Bar Sinister or Presumption. The book could not stand up on its own as a literary work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful - I found myself wanting more!","review":"Jane Dawkins shares more than a given name with Jane Austin.

A thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miniscule Bit of Ivory","review":"Written very much in the [Jane] Austen style, but lacking any real storyline.

Well Done!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow someone else's!","review":"I purchased this book solely on the recommendation of the reviewers on Amazon- and was completely disappointed!! The author suggests that these letters are something Elizabeth Bennet would write- I disagree. Elizabeth's letters were so sugary sweet in reference to her new life, her new husband, etc, etc, that I couldn't help but wonder what she ever saw wrong with Darcy in the first place! I felt the writing style didn't match at all with Austen's work, and there was none of Elizabeth's wit and humor evident in these letters (not that I got through all of them- had to do take some insulin to cut the sugar shock). Please, borrow someone's copy or check it out from the library before you waste good money on this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read for Austenites","review":"I gave this novel four stars, not five, because I had to compare it to the grandeur of Pride and Prejudice--no sequel can be as wonderful. Any fan of Austen's works should take the time to read this, one of the better continuations of Austen's novels. I found it to be very accurate to Austen's style as well as appropriate to the time period.

The one thing I couldn't shake was seeing owl man as something that came out of Sin City -not sure why.Overall a \\"Good Time\\" movie and worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earth-3 Finally Gets Its Due","review":"This movie has been a long time coming; the alternate universe villains are, of course, from Earth-3, where Luthor is a good guy and the superbeings are the bad guys; I want to say it was a 1964 story. Of course, it's been updated for the modern audience, and does well in doing so.DC may not have its act together on the live-action stuff but their animated movies (and TV shows) are doing very well indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun, but flawed","review":"I had a tremendous amount of fun watching this last night. Like most of the people hear I grew up (in th 1970s and early 1980s) reading every comic book I could get my hands on. The Justice League was always a favorite. This movie ran along just fine with only a few minor flaws until the then. I won't spoil the absolute ending, but I found the end of the climactic battle to be extremely greazy, corny and cheezy. Surely, somebody did not know how to end this battle well.In short this is another outstanding release by Warner Bros Animation, and they are on one hell of a roll right now. I just wish the ending had been better.Also watch for the 11 minute Spectre short. It is intended as a proof of concept for a full-length Spectre feature, and it is pretty solid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Justice League at it's best.","review":"I enjoyed this one as well as the Batman/Superman Public Enemies dvds.

This movie was an amazing idea and I had high hopes for it, but I was let down. All I really gotta say is: William Baldwin as BATMAN?????? REALLY?????

The Justice League and Justice League Unlimited was an excellent culmination of fifteen years of continuity, which began with Batman: The Animated Series.Like all the other \\"replacements\\" to the original DCAU, it simply doesn't hold up. There was a magic with the animation and casting that has yet to be matched in these newer straight to video releases.Marvel's works aren't even a consideration, severaly lackluster. In this instance, DC is competing with itself. And these reboots stink.Perhaps Bruce Timm can't capture lighting in a bottle twice? Or perhaps he should resurrect the JLU cast and animation?

Not iTunes, not for the Mac. I would give more stars for the quality of the movie itself, but the fact that the Blu-Ray and its Digital Copy factor into the total cost of the Blu-Ray makes me think I might have been at a monetary disadvantage as a Mac user as compared to Windows users. This movie is available for purchase on iTunes and if I wanted to, I would have to pay more for what a Windows user is basically getting with their Blu-Ray. WB does allow Digital Copy downloads through iTunes for other movies, but not this. Why so selective?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crisis on SUCKAGE.","review":"A disgrace to Justice League, DC and more importantly Grant Morrison.This \\"Crisis\\" is just a'bunch of lame fight scenes that go on FOREVER. The entire runtime is literally ONE huge fight sequence; and instead of the awesome storyline by Grant Morrison (the reason I purchased this DVD), it's some boring, BORING \\"original\\" storyline.This is the worst thing I have ever seen in my entire life and will be the last time I ever watch an animated film by DC. The fact that this film somehow made 4+ Million makes me lose faith in humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I really have to hand it to DC Comics... this is a fantastic animated film and I enjoyed it immensly.

James Woods was perfect for the darkly appathetic Owlman, making me shiver during a few of his monologues.The story is sort of a \\"prequel\\" since it takes place while the League is just forming with it's core members, and the Watchtower satelite is under construction.I would recomend this for ages 10 and up due to it's dark and cynical overtones, as well as a hint of sexual inuendo."},{"rating":"2","title":"+Best so far","review":"I will keep this short for anyone who loved the JL series and watches anime.

I love Mark Harmon on NCIS,but somehow his voice just doesn't fit the character of Superman. Same with Batman & Lex-the voices just didn't do the characters justice. I loved the lithograph that was included-nice touch with that. My favorite character was the alternate Flash,called Johnny Quick-he definitely beats the Flash when it comes to being cocky!! Although I didn't like the voices all that much,I would recommend this movie for anyone who is a Justice League fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ice Lettuce","review":"Not a particularly good make of an interesting plotline. the animation is pretty primitive for the time and the acting is often wooden."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Justice League!","review":"I've missed the Justice League since the series went off. I still can't understand why that happened. I was very excited when I found out about this feature. I've watched \\"Crisis on Two Earths\\" twice now and I love it. The action is great. Although Batman's voice is different, I like his appearance. I'm not sure why they keep changing voice actors. Mark Harmon was better than expected. The story was well written and the violence and very mild profanity were appropriately in context. Bruce Timm is the master Engineer of the DC animated universe and has \\"done it again\\". I found myself cheering for the good guys - That's the kind of movie I like. If only they would let this crew do the live action films we wouldn't have such ridiculous efforts as \\"Superman Returns\\" and \\"Dark Knight\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - worst JL in decades. Lousy voice-over.","review":"I really wanted to like this edition to the JL universe. I just could not do it. The opening titles were the best part of the series. Since it's another earth, all the inhabitants organs are on opposite sides. But they are still right handed. Hmmmm.Idiotic plot holes. Why do the \\"evil\\" JL'ers have to sound like Godfather wanna-bees? Why is the mafia superman incredibly stupid? Why do nukes frighten them? The list can go on for pages.The voice-overs were just as bad. This is not what Superman and Bats are supposed to sound like. Half the voices sounded like an agent from \\"The Matrix.\\" No inflection, no emotion - poorly read. Were the sneers permanently painted on the evil JL'ers faces?Mark Harmon as superman? Awful. Don't quit NCIS.Chris Noth as Lex? Pathetic. He should stick to cop shows. Some of the worst monotone voice-over.William Baldwin as batman? Not even close. Does he even have a current job?Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Done","review":"I used Amazon to rent this and if you enjoy Justice League then it is worth the rental.

The dance style showed in the DVE is very old fashion and without any sexy element. Street Jazz, also called sexy Jazz or Power Jazz, is especially for girls to dance in night club or some vibrant stages to show charm and activate the dance atmosphere. Street Jazz should involve body wave and hip roll and other actions which require highly body flexibility. However, in this DVD, the dance is not in the category of Stree Jazz though it is kind of Street Dance. Now I am gonna sell it out as it can't be returned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I was very disappointed with this DVD. The moves are boring and corny, and the instructor did not really inspire me at all. Also the music was horrible.

(considering that the jason and chris didn't hit them all live this is a small gripe) the band is in excellent form, nailing the music perfectly. a great cd if you have the bands other material in stock, and want that last peace of closure on an awesome band. probably not the best intro to the band, but certainly a great closing chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"i tried.","review":"because of my love for FSF, i tried to like jon bunch. i really did. i even got the hide nothing cd and tried to like that too. but this cd showcases how crappy his voice is live. please stay in the studio where it is decent at best. also, it disappoints me that all the live songs are done by bunch, as he does absolutely no justice to the songs written by carraba and gleason.but although this singer doesn't compare to the previous 2, i give this cd a 2 not a 1 for what seems like an energetic live performance, judging by the crowd reaction on the live tracks. the band can still rock out, and they still hold their weight as excellent and creative musicians.don't buy this cd unless you absolutely love the band. if you really want to get a good feel for this band, stick to the pre-jon bunch era. i definitely recommend how to start a fire. that cd will blow your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"tin foil glued to thin, flimsy plastic.","review":"The seller is being very tricky in describing this as a \\"mirror\\". In actuality, it is reflective tape on flimsy plastic. It is about as reflective as aluminum foil, and only slightly more rigid.

He sort of uses best case scenario examples that aren't applicable to most investors' markets. This is one of those books the has several good ideas padded with pages and pages of fluff.

Almost all of his examples are about how the author invested in one beachfront community in CA. I live in Atlanta, GA and the real estate market is totally different here, therefore, I got very little useful advice from this book. This author recommends buying apartments/condos and holding on to them at least 30 years.

The wife is now dead, and the husband? Well it turns out that he (Luke Denison) is the father of her children. Perdita says she was tricked into getting into bed with him, he says he didn't know it was her, and the dead wife was apparently unaware of it all. The tension in the story is thus generated by Luke thinking that Perdita was the sort of girl who'd seduce her friend's husband, and by Perdita thinking that Luke somehow set her up to get the babies his wife was incapable of having. This is all overlaid by a goodly dose of heady passion fumes, making them strike sparks off one another until they get it all sorted out. And just who did set Perdita up?

OK, Mudvayne, GOOD BAND, bad choice. \\"World So Cold\\" is a great, beautiful song, and that's the problem...does a beautiful, melodic song belong on an album called \\"Headbanger's Ball\\"?

I can't even begin too start. Awesome tracks that go from bands like Hatebreed to Godsmack, from Cold to Devildriver and from Mudvayne to Cradle of Filth. It's as phenominal as the show.

I guess it's a fact of life that the Japanese can play rock and roll as well as any American can. And they've sure got that \\"kill or die\\" spirit! In WWII, Japanese pilots would shoot at American \\"rescuers\\" who tried to pick them up after shooting down their planes, forcing the enemy to kill them. I read that in a book (fiction) by James Michener, but I have the feeling that it's true. I can't tell you which are my favorite tracks, since I haven't listened to it for so long (I had to sell almost all of my music, and my guns, when I tried to escape from Los Auschwitz), but track number six is awesome, and the track that sounds as if it's straight from the fifties is wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite classic Cube, but pretty close...","review":"First, ignore the Amazon review -- the reviewer has no idea what he's talking about.Neither the beats nor lyrics sound dated. That aside, the early to mid 90s were pretty solid as far as hip hop goes, so I would have no objection if the album did sound from that era.Anyway, beats are very strong and lyrics are decent; maybe not Death Certificate or AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted good, but pretty solid (on a par with Lethal Injection/Predator and way better than, say, War And Peace, which was horrible). Cube for the new millenium. Get the album -- it's tight.PS: Child Support is not meant to be taken literally. Listen to the lyrics: He's not talking about refusing to support his biological children; he's calling all these young bucks claiming to be the gangsta rap kings his children (i.e. everything they spit originated with him and NWA). Geez...He's using metaphor -- apparently a concept lost on some people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't call it a comeback!","review":"It took me a few listens to really get into this album. I was expecting a whole lot based on some good reviews I had read in major magazines. I was expecting it to be more explicitly political and more explicitly critical of the rap industry and the whole \\"bling-bling, stripper-pole thing\\" that seems so prevalent in a lot of popular hip-hop these days. To be sure, this album is political and it is critical; it's just more subtle than I had anticipated. Nonetheless, the beats are hard, the hooks are sublime, and the ryhmes are classic Cube. Bottom line: If you have ever been a fan of Ice Cube, then you will like this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good cd","review":"after listening to plenty of samples and many of the songs...i can say this cd is honestly pretty good. it's pretty much the same classic ice cube i like. he definitely comes real in this cd. and tells it like it is. go to church is a great song. not perfect but close!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Album","review":"just needs some classics, seeing as the whole album gots dope beats, i think it needed some dope rhymes, maybe a dre beat, all im saying is if this is going 2 be his comeback album, or something thats gonna establish his profile, he needs 2 come back hard+correct& remember what life is or was as a black male in LA...............PERIOD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Odin's Raven!!!!","review":"Well, Ice sure had to wait a long time to put out this disc. I'm sure all those family movies and clothing ads were keeping him very very busy. Busy, that is, becoming the kind of person that he railed against on the classic \\"Amerikkka's Most Wanted\\" album. What's the matter, Cube? Too much money and you have nothing to complain about? Were you just mad at being poor? Or did \\"they\\" pay you so much you felt content enough to shut up?But onto 2006...Fearing that he was losing his loyal audience of white NWA fans, Ice Cube returned with \\"Laugh Now...\\" an epic work of lackluster proportions indeed. Although advance hype for the album had followers believing that this cd would be a return to form, instead it is a party album in the vein of his last two albums, bolstered only by a few political tracks. This album is a testament to the idea that rap is a young man's game, and Ice Cube has totally melted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far From Favorite","review":"With the exception of beats, this project is a total flop. In Cube's hay day, when being driven by foes, political views and social consciousness out played pollaseeds spittin and hood snitchin, Cube masterfully gave us enough to ride around all weekend with that one favorite Ice Cube CD on repeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Album Stinks","review":"I cant believe Cube put slop like this out. If you liked Death Cert, Predator, or Lethal Injection, RUN FROM THIS CD!!!! This album is pretty much a continuation of the nonsense on War and Peace, but not even as good! He can still rap a little, but the beats are so lame, its a crime. I am just dumbfounded how and why Cube put out this album. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"the Ice Melted","review":"back in the day Ice Cube was something else. Jerri Curl Era Ice cube was the baddest cat on the mic.but after going Hollywood&turning that scene out his music ain't been the same. after 95 Cube was never quite the same. this Album is ok,but it is about 7-8 years too late at trying to up-date his sound.Lil Jon&Scott Storch just bring dime a Dozen production. subject matter is hit&miss as well. Cube has long ago secured his place in Rap History long ago,but musically dude ain't brought it fully in years.i respect his all around game as a Artist,but Musically he is dropping tracks that compared to his hey day are 2nd&3rd rate tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cry now,do movies later....","review":"The end of an era has arrived for one of the best rappers of all-time.When you get 20 songs on a cd and only 3 or 4 are worth listening to it's pretty sad. The song with WC is the worst ever...and I was looking so forward to that track.And what about all the comic filler with Day-day? What's the point?Cube needs to get back with Sir Jinx,Crazy Toons or how about that NWA reunion album with Ren and Dre? I should have listened to former Lenchmob member Jdee when he told me that the man was all washed up...Bro O'Shea just focus on the movies from now on.I should have saved my nine bucks and brought some gas instead of this lackluster effort.Buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hott cd","review":"I thought this cd was pretty nice, just a few skippable tracks.

Let me just say that the wait was worth it. Cube brings back the real rap and teaches these youngsters how its done. His lyrics are on point and he has a real message to spred, I love the beats that he has to rap over.My only complaint is that I would have liked a few more West Coast producers to make the beats. I love the guest spots with Snoop and of coarse WC.I recommend this CD to any West Coast music fan or any fan of Ice Cube in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cube's gettin soft","review":"this CD was not what I was expecting, it did'nt seem like Cube at all maybe it's all the money that has made this guy so soft now.

The legislative privileges protected by our Constitution are rarely discussed in courts, but they represent some of the most fundamental requirements of democratic self-government. Spanning from modern bribery scandals to freedom of speech, the power of Congress to imprison ordinary citizens, and medieval conflicts between the King and Parliament, Democracy's Privileged Few is an excellently written account of how legislative privilege emerged in the British Constitution and survived (or evolved) in the U.S. Constitution.

I had been having problems with my shore power at the marina my boat is kept. It kept frying my battery chargers. I decided to shop around looking for good deals on solar panels. I found this panel and decided with the warranty (5 year limited warranty on workmanship and material, 20-year 80% power output warranty) it was the best deal for this size. The customer service was great. I took it out of the package as soon as it arrived and laid it down in the sun in my back yard. I got 21 volts and 1.4 amps which equals 29.4 watts. It is in a sturdy aluminum frame, not plastic, and looks great. I plan on buying more solar panels from CD Technologies, probably larger than this one. They have sizes from 1 to 175 watts. I would recommend this product to anyone looking to power a solar project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Solar Panel.","review":"The best 20 Watt solar Panel I have seen so far.

Not bad at all.This panel is very solid,excellent product.I shopped around for a good panel, and this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so happy","review":"So after purchasing this I found another one on eBay for cheaper and other came faster and with cords/plugs.

Interesting but dated sound, partly because it's an analoguerecording, re-engineered, and lacks the oomph of full DDD digital.The content itself? Not as skilled, emotive and deep as some of the later recordings of African musicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Dance","review":"If you like Acoustic Alchemy or the Rippingtons,this is much in the same vein. Telarc has certainley missed the boat by not promoting these artists. All tracks on this album are a joy to listen to.

It had helped me a lot in making a decision in buying this book. Thanks.As for the book, I just got it. I am in Hour 2 and so far, it has helped me soooo much. I am new to Flash and I think this will be a great book for all the people who are new like me.

However, on-line banking doesn't require Flash, so I had never developed with it. But now I want to write some web games, and this book gave me all of the groundwork I needed to start working in Flash.The learning curve for Flash's design tools was the toughest part for me, and the start of this book covers it perfectly. I understood the timeline, layers, keyframes, and all the rest through his clear explanations. The Flash interface is definitely unique, so the explanations made a lot of things clear that otherwise would not have been.The programming side of Flash seems to give many people trouble, but that was the easiest for me. Either way, his chapters about Actionscript are clear, simple but not simple-minded, and paced properly.On top of all that, he answers his e-mail promptly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something really wrong with the Kindle version of this book :(","review":"There is something really wrong with the Kindle version of this book.In the written examples, blocks of text are missing!!! So, you have paragraph 1,4,5 and 6, but what happened to paragraphs 2 and 3? This is very frustrating.Apart from the above issues, the book is very Janet and John (basic) so it is really for someone with absolutely no experience of Flash (or any other Macromedia software for that matter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to Flash 8","review":"I borrowed this book from the library but just popped on Amazon to purchase it. The criticism that this book tends to be repetitive is true. However, as a newbie on Flash (except running through some of the included tutorials that didn't necessarily give all the short-cuts, reasoning, etc...that I found in this book), I find the repetition helpful. In so many computer training books they throw the information out at you once and then, when you come across it again chapters later, you only vaguely remember it. I prefer not to waste my time looking things up. Anyway, I think Phillip Kerman must have extensive actual classwork time with real live students to have been able to come up with such a WORKING manual. I have on my desk about 10 different manuals for various programs that I borrowed from the library but this is the ONLY one that I really want to purchase because it has so much information in it (that I want to mark and tag and write in my own copy!!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Purchase","review":"After checking all the books about Macromedia Flash 8 and reading the reviews from the other buyers, I decided to buy this one. I'm very satisfied with the purchase. The subjects are very clearly explained and the tutorials given after each lesson are the best way to learn. Even though you could complete each lesson in 1 hour + or -, it is best to dedicate more time to practice each tutorial as many times as you need until you remember all the steps. The writing style is also very nice, sometimes with humor and the author keeps you interested and looking forwards to learn the next lesson. Very good choice !"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's soooo good!!! Two Thumbs Up.","review":"I've been struggling with Flash for over a month now.. I even hired a few tutors showing me the very simple task of importing photos into Flash.. Alas, I wish that I had this book much earlier so that I wouldn't have wasted all this money...

This edition is radically revised from the first edtion with Harner adding statistics and relevant material since the first edition. A nice reader about China for the economically and numerically-minded, but if this is your first book about China today, I would reccommend Gasster's \\"China's struggle to modernize\\" or Spence's \\"The search for modern China\\" or Schell and Shambaugh's recent \\"China Reader\\" as better alternatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"If you're looking for a great book to read at the beach or by the pool, I recommend this one.

I usually don't mind the LP noise because that's part of the package. In this case, however, I was very disappointed--angry, really--at the poor job of remastering the vinyl or orignial tapes to CD. For the first few tracks, I could barely hear the music above the clicks and hisses. It was only at about the two-thirds mark through the CD that the music was louder than the noise. Furthermore, I found that less than half of the music sounded even remotely like juju music--probably about a third. I really doubt that the earliest, middle-eastern sounding tracks(from what I could tell through the noise) had any role in the creation and evolution of juju.

This book is a must!","review":"As fun to read as it is accurate, packable and irreplaceable, The Hungry Traveler for Mexico is the right book for anyone who enjoys eatings as much as traveling. The book is as much an appetizer for travel as for dining; I wasn't sure whether I was salivating more over the descriptions of the food or the thought of being in a place where I could eat such things. Forget your Spanish-English dictionary (it doesn't have important food terms anyway), and tuck this delicious little culinary guide into your pocket. The pronunciation guide is extensive and exact, and Marita Adair not only knows food, she knows Mexico and she knows travelers. It's as if you've found a good friend to eat out with--she won't lead you astray. You'll eat well using this book, you'll learn the nuances of dining in Mexico, and you'll find the way to the heart of the country."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful tips","review":"This is a fabulous book.

The first thing that pops up in my mind is, why do they call the Seguin family by their titles rather than their names. One gets the impression that the writers think the names are \\"Don\\" Seguin and \\"Dona\\" Seguin. Hey, there, Don, what's for dinner? I wonder if they realize this.Next, the tamale recipe. It calls for masa harina, so I am guessing it is an adaptation of an old recipe. Why then, do they just call for \\"chili pods\\" instead of giving a quantity or weight, and defining whether they mean ancho (which they probably do), pasilla, guajillo or a combination of the three.If my comments are valid, this indicates that there is some very sloppy journalism at work here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but not great.","review":"Oscar is getting old and it is reflected in this CD.

Over the years, you can hear him stumbling through his notes a bit and some of the magic is gone.Perlman, well I've seen him at Symphony Hall in Boston and I expected better of him, too. On this CD he sounds like any other fiddle player, nothing spectacular. I just don't think they make a good match.Cut #7, Nightime is great. Oscat wrote it and the arrangement is terrific. I heard it in the movie Indecent Prooposal.This one is for Oscar collectors but if it is your first, go with his earlier stuff.Regards, Peter Benoit"},{"rating":"1","title":"How sad!","review":"Who is this schlemiel Alyn Shipton? This is the most pathetic recording I have ever purchased. Does the producer think his travails in producing this album justify its release? For the record, I was a friend of Oscar Peterson and I admire most of Itzhak Perlman's recordings. But this release is a limp travesty and TELARC executives Robert Woods and Elaine Martone should be ashamed for allowing this to be released. Following Oscar's stroke he could only use his right (and remarkable) right hand. Compare, if you will, \\"On the Trail\\" on Digital at Montreaux to understand the lack of fire on this recording or even Oscar's recording of \\"Makin Whoopee\\" in his duet with Grappelli. The truth is that even with Ray Brown, Herb Ellis and Grady Tate, Perlman cannot swing and Oscar is sadly without his left hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"It really is awful","review":"I bought this album thinking the usual -- two great artists -- masters of their instruments -- wonderful songs -- what could be more perfect? Unfortunately, this is one of the worst albums I have ever heard, a real collaboration from hell -- so bad that I cannot compare it to any other failed collaboration in music history. I agree that much of the blame lies with Perlman, who does not appear to understand the jazz idiom and showed up without jazz chops.

Wonderful if you love both classical music and jazz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much a snorefest.","review":"Very disappointing.Much of the blame lies with Perlman. It's not merely that he's clueless about jazz style; the bigger problem is that his playing is small-scaled, tentative, and charmless. Menuhin, for example, wasn't much more idiomatic when playing with Grapelli, but at least he sounded as though he was enjoying himself. Perlman's torpor affects the rest of the band, too - they all sound as though they're phoning it in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoy It!","review":"Carfully selected tunes showcase these two great professionals in a meeting of seperate worlds.

Boy, I wouldn't want this on my resume, but obviously Whoopi didn't care.That said, I disagree with people who say, \\"It's so bad it's good.\\" If that is true, you should be giving it one star. People who want bad movies are looking for one-star films.And people who think \\"poor Whoopi\\" should remember 1) She cashed the check, 2) She lives in a mansion, and 3) Stars are associated with the properties they are in, and that's part of the arrangement she knew about and has profited from, so it is fair to hold her accountable for junk like this. In doing this movie she was ripping off moviegoers, even if she didn't think so. This is a comment on soft-hearted reviewers, not the movie.Still, I got my money's worth in renting a wretched piece of Hollywood excrement on purpose to laugh at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What humiliation!","review":"I'm guessing Whoopie Goldberg's really embarrassed by this movie. I can really feel the same way, because this poor excuse of a movie absolutely FAILS. \\"Theodore Rex\\" is about a talking dinosaur who eats only cookies . . . COOKIES?! Did they have to make it all so kid-friendly?! Well, I guess so, since this film does look like it was targeted for people under the age of 6. Anyway, Theodore pairs up with Whoopie, who stars as a fearless detective, into finding out who's killing innocent dinosaurs here and there.Forget about the plot. Forget about the characters. In fact, forget about this entire movie. There's nothing good going here. Even the music goes to waste.

I didn't actually watch it until much more recently, though.It's relatively enjoyable to watch if your expectations are not too high-- mostly because the movie can't seem to decide what it is. It can't make up its mind if it's aimed at kids (which it seems marketed to?) or to adults (The themes are pretty mature and dark). The dinosaur characters' costumes and sets are really well done, and it's easy to see how this movie could be the most expensive straight-to-video film ever. I would have loved to have seen how it would have come out if it had been handled as a primarily more mature science fiction movie, in the same vein as the Anonymous Rex novels.

I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't watch all of it","review":"Its so hard to beat \\"The Ten Commandments\\"We watched about 30 minutes of this, pulled it out, dusted off Charlton Heston, popped some popcorn, and watched it to the end.Although we really like Ben Kingsley in most everything else, we will probably give this one away.I'm sure someone would appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The Ten Commandants was better. The acting and script didn't match for me, and just because I didn't like it doesn't mean I won't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This movie follows the text of the Bible fairly well. Most of the acting is decent, though some scenes look a bit stilted. I used this movie as part of class on Moses and I selected it based largely on its value in that arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie","review":"This was one of the best bible movies I have ever seen. If you love this bible story, but can hardly stand all the \\"pomp\\" of Charles Heston's, The 10 Commandments, you will delight in this movie. Good acting and special effects, and far more biblically accurate than any other movie I've seen on the Exodus. This movie has all the passion without all the \\"cheese\\" typically seen with many bible movies. If you enjoyed Jeremiah and Esther of the Bible Series, you will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moses","review":"I have only watched about 20 minutes of this presentation, so this may be a bit unfair. The acting is superb. Ben Kingsley is at the top of his game. I am teaching a Bible Study on Exodus, and this video does not even try on some points to be biblically correct. For example, Pharaoh's daughter retrieves Moses from the river and not Miriam his sister. This is just one example, and like I said, I have only watched 20 minutes of this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have used Miracle Gro for over 40 years and I certainly would recommend using it to anyone.I hope to continue using it for another 40 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful way to learn your geography","review":"The pieces on this puzzle line up to the provinces and states of North America. My 8-year old knows her geography really well, and the 5-year old is susprisingly good at it. The pieces in the outer edge of the puzzle interlock, but the inner ones do not (square states, for example)... so younger kids need help keeping pieces in place. A few of the larger pieces (e.g. Nunavut and Ontario) have warped a little too, making assembly even more tricky. I recommend this puzzle to adults too -- as an immigrant to the USA I had a tough time placing most of the states."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pieces","review":"Just opened this puzzle for Christmas and put it together with my son.

I read most of the reviews and thought it would be better than it is. It doesn't fit together very well like a puzzle should. I would definitely say that it's for older kids. It will sit in the closet for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent puzzle for learning","review":"Only frustrating thing is that some of the states are a bit small and they get knocked out of place easily. Other than that, it's an excellent, hands-on way for kids to learn some geography."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 problems","review":"Some comments pointed out that the puzzle pieces don't lie flat and don't stay together, I've found them both true.Pieces don't lie flat: not many, but enough to spoil the look of the completed puzzle.Pieces don't stay together: the problem is that too many pieces have straight edges. You basically place the pieces side by side, instead of interlocking them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pieces don't hold together","review":"I got this puzzle hoping to get some education play time with my kids - 3 and 8 year old. While the idea of this puzzle is wonderfull, the product itself not that much. The puzzle pieces look pretty durable but a big issue for us - they don't interlock together like regular puzzles. Instead, you just put them close. Manufacturer probably believed a kid would never bump into a puzzle or wiggle around. We pretty much end up always straightening up the pieces over and over and it's not much fun after all. But I do love the idea of learning about United States this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Great for candies...I bought a couple of those molds.they are not very resistant ,but perfect for chocolate molds .I recomend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"I used this mold to make items for a graduation cake for a Dental Hygiene cake.

I purchased the cd the moment it became available in '02 and it has been a staple in our Christmas music collection since then and will continue to be for years to come.

The Olympus C4000 is a real value that offers the opportunity for digital photographers to enjoy the performance and features of a high-end prosumer digital camera (like the Nikon CP4500 or the Canon G3) for hundreds of dollars less. I highly recommend this camera. In terms of \\"bang for your buck\\" the Olympus C4000 is in a class all by itself. So, if you've been waiting for the perfect digital camera at the right price, this camera may be as good as it is going to"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, authentic 'Hillbilly' country music for Christmas!","review":"Patty is a true country star, and keeps this album from getting too 'popish'. Even the traditional carols take on new life with fiddles, mandolins and banjos in support. The guest list is as long as a honky-tonk dance line, including Emmy Lou Harris, Trisha Yearwood and Ricky Skaggs to name a few. Best of all, several original songs give this collection some nice flavor, my favorites being 'Santa Train' and the title cut 'Bluegrass and White Snow'. So real, unlike too much country these days--I even heard the word 'yonder' in the lyrics somewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"This a very traditional Christmas CD with a bluegrass influence. I listened to it while I put up my Christmas tree. I love it! I recommend any Patty Loveless fans to buy this CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Greatest Christmas Bluegrass-Appalachian CD's","review":"I listen to this CD through out the year. Every song is out standing and brings out the pure mountain music drawn from inside of Patty Loveless. One of my favorites is the mandolin instrumentals, \\"Carol of the Bells.\\" I also love, \\"Bluegrass, White Snow\\" with back up vocals by Dolly and Ricky Skaggs. This CD is a must for fans of bluegrass/traditional music-a great way to celebrate Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"If you like mid-century (50's-60's) jazz and Brazilian pop jazz, you'll really enjoy this.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bad textbook to learn plant phys","review":"This is an introductory book, so I do not expect it to go in-depth in each area. There are many typos in this book though, like a lot of page numbers in the index are not correct. Also, the book goes in an odd order, and a lot of things explained later in the book wouldv'e made it easier to understand some of the earlier things easier. a lot of newer concepts are left out too, or vaguely mentioned, like electric currents in plants. My professor often has to use graphs and charts from other books because the ones from the book are too complicated or hard to understand, such as the Z-scheme, the Q cycle, and the PCR cycle to name a few. I would not recommend this book as an introductory textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reading","review":"You can understand the basic principles of this book, but that's about it.

Just got back from two days of skiing and as far as I can tell the wax is great. This wasn't the most difficult test as the snow was hardpack with some ice so no slush to plow through but the skis felt fast and the bottoms still look freshly waxed. Putting it on was a little more difficult than common paraffin based wax that (I think) melts at a lower temperature. I ironed it on outside on a chilly afternoon and it took longer for the iron to melt it and it was a little harder scraping it. However once I got it scraped and buffed it was smoooooth and hard. I did three sets of skis with less than one ounce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best All Temp Wax Around","review":"I first tried this wax last season and haven't found a reason to change it up since (other than using the Spring Solution throughout the spring and summer seasons at Mt. Hood). Not only does it help me fly past everyone else on the mountain, it also seems to last well. Although I tend to wax before each time I ride, I've also left this wax on for three day trips and I didn't have any issues (even on day 3).I'm also a fan of it being an all temperature wax as I know I'll get the same great performance no matter what the conditions are. I even had to start using it last August when I ran out of the Spring Solution and again, I wasn't at all disappointed in it's performance.I'd recommend this wax to any rider for great riding all year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting, from any point of view.","review":"I read this book that I borrowed from a friend 3 years ago.

The second season is still good, but the writers add more mystical stuff that ends up making the show seem a little too over the top during some moments that had me rolling my eyes.

Even if an earthquake was still to come, isn't it kinder for God to wait until the residents had time to find new homes and move out?

After some internal debate, my disgust with Aniston won over and so I have not watched this movie, nor will I.Aniston is a blight on humanity. She's a loser.

However, if you're indifferent to dogs or dislike them then this movie won't do much to change your mind. To me this was an annoying film for the most part about the most annoying dog ever. The movie plods along repetitiously with one irksome dog scene after another. I could only wonder why in the world would anyone keep such an annoying animal-- especially in the house. Not the worst movie in the world, but I would recommend spending your time with a film with a better story that is not about people who keep an animal in the house that is so destructive.

Why do they need to hear these things in a movie that's marketed as a \\"family movie\\"?I'm extremely disappointed in the movie. Fortunately, my daughter came to pick up the grandkids about half-way through the movie, so they weren't subjected to any other negative stuff. Yes, I *should* have just turned it off, but I kept hoping it would get better.If you're looking for a funny *family* movie for kids under 13, THIS ISN'T IT!

The author of the book, the script writer and the director must never have heard of the long running Animal Planet's \\"Me or the Dog\\". If they had they would not have presented such a misguided movie with regards to understanding and training an out-of-control dog. Which, incidentally, was suppose to be the central element to this story.(2.) I had this unsettling feeling though out the movie that I was not watching real ordinary people dealing with a dog and life but actors characterizing people in some contrived unrealistic life. I just saw actors. A well directed and acted movie should move you into another world and not make you feel like you're a director observing acting class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Sad","review":"This movie is fine until it decides to have a long, drawn out depressing ending. This movie was supposed to be a comedy or kids movie based on the trailer and my whole family and I were so upset after leaving the theater. We were not prepared for that. We all left crying. The whole theater was crying..grown men as well. It's true to life but I think what happens in the end didn't need to be so long and drawn out to the point to where you are bawling for the last 20 minutes or more. It would have been better if the trailer had not been so misleading. This is not really a comedy..it's more of a drama with a few comedic scenes. It is sad so be prepared. As long as you know what you are getting into, then maybe this movie is alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a family movie","review":"I was seriously disappointed ... and somewhat disturbed ... by this movie. The previews and descriptions make it out to be cute, funny, and romantic. It is NOT. It is one depressing or tragic situation after another for both human and dog in this story. It does not even seem to me to be a story about the dog as much as a story about a man who had to come to grips with the depressing reality that he will never fulfill his life's dreams. It might have been a good movie as a drama if it had been described as such. But since the expectations are set elsewhere it's hard to judge it according to its proper genre. And this is definitely NOT a kid's movie.

The subject, the dog, is a jerk with no redeeming feature whatsoever - at least none demonstrated by the film. This movie is nearly two hours long, spends about an hour and forty minutes demonstrating what a worthless turd he is, and then its final 15 minutes showing the family inexplicably decompensating as he - whom the family has heretofore always regarded as a pain - dies. (And good riddance, I say.) The tear-jerking doesn't work, because the dog has never been shown to have a single redeeming feature. In any other country in the world, this destructive, stupid, untrainable, unlovable animal would have been eaten about 30 minutes into the film.

And that is what's truly sad about this film.Why are all animal movies like this? You always know what's going to happen, why put yourself through it. The only reason I can see is if you need a good cry and haven't had the excuse for a long time.The filmmakers really do milk the crying/emotional aspect during the film's final moments, but while you're watching it, you don't care enough to complain.

How often can you watch a dog get in trouble? And, of course, since a dog's lifespan is about 20% of a human's, the end is predictable, and predictably maudlin.If you aren't already fond of Owen Wilson and Jennifer Aniston, this will probably not make you into a fan.

I knew it would be sad. But I also knew it would be funny, as Marley was quite the character.Generally, when books are made into movies, something gets lost in the translation from book to screen. That said, I didn't have high expectations. With a PG rating though, I thought it would be 'safe' enough to allow my 5 and 6 year old to watch Marley's antics. How wrong I was. We ended up turning it off about 20 minutes into the movie. The sexual innuendos aren't the kind that go over the kids' heads. They were pretty blatant, which was surprising given its PG rating. This should have been PG-13, no question.Later, when the kids were in bed, my husband and I gave it another shot. It was just 'ok'.

I always say \\"No, I heard it is kind of sad\\". Yellow Labs are special dogs, they are loving and intelligent. I am pretty sure the adult Marley in the movie was not a purebred lab, he had a brown topcoat and was lacking the classic blocky head of the breed. I am thinking a real yellow lab would not act like that. Enough about dogs. This movie was dumb, and the star was not the dog, they were Jennifer Aniston's breasts and man was it ever cold on the set.I viewed the cut scenes and they cut out the only scene that might have made you like the dog, along with scenes that developed the characters. FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a family film","review":"This isn't the fun dog movie it's advertised to be.

So the dog is supposed to be the center of the story, ok, but this dog is a totally boring generic yellow dog that's a typical untrained dog of irresponsible pet owners.

The kids only cared for the beginning and the tear jerking end. A total of 30 minutes perhaps. The dog was barely the focus of the movie and I do mean barely (if at all)...it was more about Wilson's life and his relationship with Aniston (far too realistic and dreary, much of the sexual content was unnecessary) and then finally their relationship to the dog. Pass on this movie...It seems that this movie made the majority of people feel bad after watching it. \\"Old Yeller\\" at least celebrated life and was life affirming, where this movie missed the mark.Personally, I think that if this movie is attempting to realistically show a family's arc within context of dog ownership then it failed terribly. Anyone who would allow a dog to be so wild will have little to no hope with their children. And what of the premise?? That having a miserable dog is ok because they were there while our lives were also miserable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERIBLE! AWFUL!","review":"I totaly hate this movie. I totaly LOVE the book.

There just isn't enough balance devoted to all the other parts of Marley to make enduring and ultimately bonding with him worthwhile.The family's character development is equally two dimensional. Wilson and Aniston did everything they way they were supposed to to recreate the character of the book, but this is a good example of a movie that should have taken some liberties.Overall, very dissatisfying movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE Disappointing","review":"This is the worst movie I ever seen in the last years. If you are a dog lover, please don't see it, you will die in the last 30 minutes watching die the dog.The worst part of being a dog owner is when the pet die so this movie ending (25 min) is about this part.By the way, the family and marriege story is very sad and pointless too, bad writeen.

I did NOT want to relive that experience through watching a movie that was advertised to be a COMEDY. It is NOT a comedy AT ALL. I don't like to put spoilers or ruin endings to movies in reviews, however I think it's important to warn people to NOT watch this movie unless they want to watch in detail a dog being euthanized.

But the movie is filled with very adult and disturbing themes that are not good for young viewers! Also upon the end of this film, almost every young child and several older ones as well, are left in tears of sadness and distress! That is not a component for a good movie in my opinion! If you are a dog lover this will distress and sadden you, if you are a small child this will bore you and break your heart and if you are a cold young adult who laughs in the face of death and thinks distructiveness is charming and amusing, then purchase this and it will be money well spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ALL GOOD","review":"i HAD HIGHER EXPECTATIONS, SOM WHAT IM A LIL DISAPPOINTED BUT I DONT HOLD NO VEIN FEELINGS, IT'S A COOL DVD.

Sony has remastered this collection, and although it is not bad remastering, it is noticeable. By that I mean where the instruments are more profound out of the left and right speakers, hence the voice of Cuco is lower with more monotone sound.The favorites are Por Una Mjuer Casada written by Felipe Valdez Leal and Se Me Hizo Facil, a beautiful song written by Agustin Lara.This collection is not his most passionate, but still a wonderful collection of a fine musician.

Corrects a number of misconceptions as to sentencing and the extent of capital punishment. Aspects of Chartism and the poor laws are well covered and there are fine case studies on sheep stealing, a Cornish radical and a \`crime-wave' in the town of Burwash. The coverage of the Swing riots is disappointing - the book makes many references to Swing, but I came away with no greater understanding of this subject.

Not to forget that then, and now, she is very pleasing to the eye.I bought her 'vinyl' then, her cassettes later and now her CD's and have yet to be disappointed with a single tune on any of the albums.Claire is likened to a 'Glass of Fine Wine'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Currents","review":"An excellent discussion of issues related to technology and its effect on culture. I found myself underlining things and writing in the margins. She is at her best when framing philosophical issues and making generalizations about the future of art and technology, a little weaker when addressing actual artists and their work. She uses Platonic and Aristotelian philosophy to explain two ways artists approach technology and yet the book is refreshingly free of tech or art jargon.

Just because it is not blues does not make it bad. The crux of the problem is that the non-blues songs presented here are just crummy music! Corey is an extremely talented person.

And the other four I felt it necessary to duck tape them for safety. I wrapped duck tape all the way around the kennel to hold the snap down handles in place. Years ago I bought one of these snap apart kennels, and it was sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble and store. This is the same maker but they have significantly cheapened the design.

Every few steps the doors would fly off altogether. Not open up, completely come off. One block before I reached my house, both carriers completely and irreperably came apart. I was absolutely terrified, and struggling in the middle of the street to somehow hold the pieces together with my hands, without doors of course, and keep my cats somehow contained within the pieces. My cats were both terrified and trying to escape. Since I had my hands full doing this, I couldn't get them to my apartment on my own, and had to pay a passerby fifteen dollars to help me carry one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mis-information","review":"I picked this book up and flipped open to a page where the author discusses health problems in retrievers. He compares the relatively healthy Flat-Coated Retriever to the Labrador, which has more health problems, and states correctly that the Labs have been bred with less care and attention to health concerns. HOWEVER, he states that the Labs and Flat-Coats are essentially the same dog except for the length of coat. This is absolutely not true. Although they originated similarly, both have been bred separately with the introduction of diverse breeds into their backgrounds. If the author has not bothered to research this, and makes incorrect statements based on his lack of research, how can I trust any information contained in the book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Training with hand signals","review":"I bought this book in anticipating that it would inform me on what was the standard hand signals used for training pups to sit, stay, come, etc.. as it stated on the back cover of the book. After reading the whole book, I asked myself where did I read about the hand signals? I then went to the back index to check if I missed it, to my dismay, it referenced one page that had one sentence on arm waving.. and that's all. If the author had given as much discussion and illustrations on knot tying as he did on hand signals I might have thought the book had some merit. Overall the book was written choppy, and disjointed and I disliked the writer's style of first person, informal.A would suggest you to forget this book and look into buying the book \\"Training Your Retriever\\" by James Lamb Free."},{"rating":"2","title":"superb, expedient","review":"A perfect new copy recieved of ed. 4.

I forced myself to read through the whole just to see how bad it would get - I wasn't disappointed. The storyline is interesting enough although a little predictable. I found Aleta SOmerset to be the most annoying romantic heroine I've come across in a long time. She comes across as spoilt, selfish, immature and incredibly feeble. Although she was described as being such in the beginning, her character just didn't develop at all. Jamie was little better - he also came across as selfish and to be honest not too bright. The ending was very rushed and tame.

Being an Oscar Peterson fan, I am bias, but this is not your typical 'jazz' holiday disc. Do not hesitate on buying this disc because you don't like jazz. My brother hates jazz but he loves this disc. The solos herein never deviate too far from the melody and a warm, mellow tone of Christmas by the fireside resonates in every song. To me, a blasting trumpet or searing guitar solo is never well suited for Christmas music. This disc sits in the background perfectly, sets a beautiful peaceful mood and pleases the senses.This is simply the most wonderful adult Christmas Eve album available, period. It is perfect for sipping an evening cocktail and sitting in the dark with nothing on but Christmas lights.

The book has moment of the old Phule series, but it has a great deal of flat, hackneyed prose that drains the characters of their previous vigor.Stop reading the Phule series until Asprin flies solo at the keyboard.If it still stinks, then we can wish Mr. Asprin well as he rides off into the sunset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted, thoroughly enjoyable science fiction adventure","review":"Phule Me Twice is the latest lighthearted, thoroughly enjoyable science fiction adventure from Robert Asprin.

But Captain Phule's own superior officer has a grudge against him, and plans to wreak havoc in the most backhanded and scheming manner possible - by sending in an incompetant with both the ability and authority to royally foul things up! A loopy and engaging ride featuring quixotic personalities, double-take situations, and one deceptively resourceful android. Also very highly recommended are the previous Phule adventures: Phule's Company, Phule's Paradise, and A Phule And His Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on you","review":"Well, count me among those who say Asprin didn't have anything to do with Phule me Twice, or book three.

I wouldn't compare ANY of the Phule series to the Myth series, as they only share mirth and light-heartedness. I felt this book gave a better look into the Omega Mob, and took a somewhat neccesary step back a little from being focused mearly on Phule. Although I do agree that some of the dialog and relations between Phule and Beeker were VERY out of place in this book, but more so near the end... Much like Peter J. Heck finished the book for him. But that said, I still read the book from cover to cover, and stayed reading, which in itself is a good review from me. If I lose interest, the book lands on a dusty shelf, never to be finished. I'd still recommend it for people who like the whole Omega Company, and aren't just reading to read about Captain Jester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing latest to an excellent series","review":"I was disappointed in the latest episode of the 'Phule's Company' saga. While the first volume was both wonderful fiction and good advice on managing people, the latest fell flat.The structure of the book is lacking. The taut tension absent. The humor banal.

This one? Hated it! Plot holes Chocolate Harry could have driven his \\"hawg\\" through abound (what happened to the kidnappers? after all the fuss about the casino in the beginning, why nothing more about it?). Characters that were funny and multi-dimensional in previous books became cartoons. (Poor Beeker's character gets ruined completely.) There was no flavor, no structure, no progression, and very, very little of the lighthearted humor that marked the first two books in the series. This one's getting dumped off for the library sale, and I don't think it's worth the fifty cents they'll ask for it.

In the mathematics chapter, there are 104 examples in the Math chapter alone; one REALLY COOL section shows 10 different font choices and their impact on the typesetting of a small page of mathematics.

If you're seeking a single source for improving your LaTeX documents (in ways you never imagined), this is your book.

He's written some really funny/sick sick stories in the past, but this was one worth leaving unpublished.Most of the stories in this book felt like they were 100 page stories cropped to 10. There were also no paradigm shifts in any of the stories that can make them so much fun.The highlight (if it can be called that) was a story about someone setting up an MMA (mixed martial arts) organization in Croatia.

My ends were still a bit dry, so I opted for this hair mask in hopes of replenishing my hair's natural moisture. I used it the first time and was disappointed.

This is a great disc, featuring up-to-date recordings of the songs we remember from the original video with Rick Moranis. Both leads (Hunter Foster and Kerry Butler) provide spectacular tracks - Kerry most notably for her part in 'Suddenly Seymour'. The rest of the cast makes for a great list of songs. The trio of girls blend smoothly for their renditions of 'Little Shop Of Horrors' and other tracks, and Michael-Leon Wooley makes a great Seymour II.If you've had the chance to see the show, you'll be happy to know that the energy from the live performance is captured on CD. If you haven't seen the show yet - go see it! It's terrific.

Never did I think I would change my firmly rooted concepts of my Lord and Savior but this has completely done so. Originally, I watched \\"The Gospel According to Matthew\\" and could not wrap my mind around Jesus smiling or laughing in some of the Gospel stories. I followed that up with the \\"Matthew\\" actor's (Bruce Marchiano) \\"In the Footsteps of Jesus\\" and was blessed with the actor's experiences during the filming.

The style is beautiful, the oil rubbed bronze is exactly what we were looking for and, for the most part, the faucet has held up well to heavy use and regular cleaning. While the faucet and levers still look as good as the day we bought them, the drain assembly finish started coming off within about nine months or so. Despite the fact that we never use harsh chemicals for cleaning, the drain, just beneath the stopper, also appears to actually be corroding.

Hulk takes on Thor and a comic favorite Wolverine. The Thor battle was great at first, but they made Thor look like a wimp when Hulk was in a rage. I would think that Thor would fare a little better seeing that he is a Norse God and has gone toe to toe with Superman. The Artwork is excellent! It would have been great to see Thor and Loki team up to send the Hulk back to earth instead of Hela.The Wolverine section was excellent! It almost put too much into the plot, but it was a good move to blend in some of Wolvie's old foes. It was cool to hear \\"OK, Bub, let's try that again.\\" and \\"Hulk smash little man!\\" they made sure to include. I could've done without the various flashbacks. It's the Hulk vs Wolverine, you really dont need any flashbacks. Great ending though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvel Animate Good!!!","review":"I continue to love the Marvel animated movies and I'm happy the success of the Marvel live action hasn't undercut the animate stuff. While the television shows can be doggy (Wolverine and the X-Men is so-so) the movies clearly guided by fans of the source material. In the case of Hulk Vs you get two great stories drawn from the comics. Not direct retelling, but instead stories inspired by the comics in real and meaningful ways. The clash between Wolverine and Hulk will please fans of both characters and the Thor/Hulk battle brings to mind Jack Kirby levels of Marvel magic. If you are fan, you will love it, if you are not a fan, you should try it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action Packed double feature!","review":"Two great short stories in one pack; great value for the money. Each story is different and separate; Fred Tatasciore as the Hulk is very good, as he was in each of the Avengers movies. The violence is much more graphic than your standard saturday-morning cartoon fare, especially Wolverine's. I would not recommend that one for anyone under 13, but the Thor story is ok down to 10 year-olds. I was especially impressed with the rendition of Thor and the Asgardians; good voice acting all around, and the drama was even to the point of being epic; it really had a good level of intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk vs All!!!","review":"I have limited words to say for this. If you are a fan of Marvel then you must get this!!! This is actually better than the hulk movies and definitely better than X-men the movies. You will see the Hulk and will also appreciate the beauties of other characters such as Thor (The god thunder)as you see them animated to life. Watch this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, not bad for what they are","review":"And what they are are basically 45 minutes of watching a moving comic book.I can't say I really preferred one over the other, to be honest, they were both decent ways to kill time while having nothing in particular lined up for afterwards.The only gripe is the animation; I know they're comic book characters and all, but the animation, in regards to the people, was bordering on atrocious; ghastly stuff there.Oh well, I guess I was spoiled by growing up in the golden age of comic book cartoons: the 90's; now THOSE were some choice cartoons right there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but sweet...","review":"As of this writing, I've only watched VS Wolverine. It starts off as a great battle between the 2, up to expectations definitely and the middle is interesting enough also. The only problem I have is the abrubt ending. The running time is a little over 35 minutes and they could have expanded the ending another 3-5 minutes. Watch through the credits and it may answer the question to the ending though. The characters are true to comic form and for me personally, it was nice how Deadpool was depicted, hope Ryan can deliver the same quality performance...Am expecting VS Thor to match this in entertainment value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thor episode is decent but Wolverine episode is shockingly grose!","review":"I enjoyed the Hulk vs. Thor episode. It was a little short on story and very predictable but the fight scenes were pretty good. A little too violent but nothing I thought that was totally over the top.The Wolverine episode was shockingly grotesque. Just like Thor the story was predicable and the episode was a little short on story. However, on the violence scale Hulk vs Thor was for preschoolers compared to this bad boy. If the amount of blood that was spilled in this episode was saved the blood bank would not be in need of any donors for weeks. It was just a grose feast of murder, blood, ripping arms off peoples bodies (while they're alive). I mean come on. It was disturbing. If this was live action instead of a cartoon it would have been pushing the NC-17 rating.Keep both these episodes away from small children!!! It says PG-13 and it means it.... for adults who enjoy gore fests you probably will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk Smashes Thor in Asgard and Wolverine has't got a chance!!!","review":"Wow! The Hulk looks way more hard in this than both of his theatrical releases! Great action on both but The Thor battle is clearly the best as he is forced to do battle in Hell!! You check out why! 4/5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing as usual","review":"Very poor plot. Not much of a story, but it is action pack.It's hard to believe that Wolverine did better against the Hulk than Thor did, when in truth Thor is Marvel's most powerful superhero. How many times did the Hulk took a licking from Thor in the comic book? And how many times did Thor killed him?Marvel is like WWE.

This animation is awesome, definitely get the bluray version. I loved, LOVED the Thor feature, maybe because it had some story and because I have always thought we get too little of him, especially in Asgard. Although both are short and do not have a ton of story you already knew this was about the match ups, and in that sense the fights are awesome. Whoever says this is ok for kids should have their kids taken into a relatives care, I am not sure even 13 is ok, maybe 15. I am not a fan of gore but do not mind it either but 13 seems still kinda young to me. Anyway this are a worthy addition to your collection and I am looking forward to this animations skills applied to a full feature and hopefully a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk Smash!","review":"Hulk Vs. has really good animation quality and seeing it in HD is really nice.

If you're looking for a more logical storyline that gives fair tributes to the highlighted characters involved, you probably are looking in the wrong place. The animation of these two films is pretty impressive and detailed, but the stories and logic behind it are faulty. I've never been a huge Marvel follower, but I do know that Thor is incredibly powerful and has been written as such. He was treated in the script with such disdain for his power and force of will. Whoever created these films either hates Thor or worships Hulk, or both. There's no way that Wolverine can inflict more damage on The Hulk than a God of thunder can, and anyone who argues otherwise is a blind Hulk fan. I like Hulk's character and find his power awesome, but the way Thor was handled in this film was rather pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hulk Vs. Thor is a great animated feature!","review":"Hulk Vs. Thor is a great animated feature. I like this video 45 minute feature that takes the Hulk to Asgard.

Wolverine was not as good. Wolverine battles the Incredible Hulk in Canada. Hulk Vs. Wolverine with apperances by Marvel characters like Deadpool, Lady Deathstrike, Sabertooth, and Omega Red.

This was the first, and to date the only, series featuring four women who find themselves living together in one house. The relationships between them is a joy to behold! It is even more valuable since Bea Arthur and Estelle Getty (The actors who played Dorothy and her mother, Sophia) have died. A very enjoyable program! Programs like this one aren't being produced anymore; and that is very sad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Love it!! Came on time, and as described. Golden Girls is a favorite for me, and now my collection is complete!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOLDEN, like all the others.","review":"Well, you already know what episodes are included in this DVD set. I love this set like all the others. It's funny, because the actors are excellent at their craft and the writers have written great material. With those two combinations, how could the show not be great. I intend to buy all of the seasons. I just wish that they would be available much sooner than every 7 or 8 months. Andy Griffth DVDs were available every 3 months. I collected all first 5 right away. I liked to have all the Golden Girls just as quickly, so that I may see the shows whenever I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Thinking Toy","review":"My daughter just turned 9 and had received a small Ello kit a few months prior in her Easter basket. I didn't really *get* it until she showed me the display at the toy store.I was pleasantly surprised by the price and bought her two sets for her birthday - a people set and the larger Ellopolis...she loves them.What I love is that this isn't a brainless toy associated with a movie, TV show or cartoon character. It requires thought and creativity. I appreciate that the pictures are \\"ideas\\" and not detailed plans. Legos are great - but how creative is it to buy a kit and build it precisely according to plan?There are small pieces but no more so than Legos. Hayley has a plastic bin that she works out of - larger enough to hold pieces she doesn't want to disassemble and parts she has yet to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Creative!","review":"My 7 yr old daughter received this for a gft and she just loves it. It's all about using your imaganaiton. There are no instructions. She has made so many things including a micraphone for the ello people to sing. I even love to play with her. The only drawbacks is you have to be carefull with the pieces since they are small. I also can see kids under 6 having some difficullty putinng the pieces together. All in all it's a great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellow leaves turn green","review":"Great product and very economical. I'm let hesitant to feed my plants fertilizer since this product is so affordable. I either put a tsp. in a 2-gallon bucket of water for roots or put it in a pump sprayer for the leaves.My neglected herbs were turning yellow, after I applied this, they turned green and healthy in just a few days.

By taking the view of culture the authors hit at the marrow of the Arthur Andersen debacle. Arthur Andersen created a phenomenal franchise in a sector that demands integrity as a precept. The cultural erosion of that precept inside our public accounting sector is a particularly chilling realization for an average 401k investor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. Instead of providing insights that others might use to understand how the culture of a firm can affect its success or failure, this book was mostly a long recitation of excerpts from news stories and other already public information. Did we really need another summary of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A total yawn","review":"I think it's a pity how one of the world's most esteemed brands was wrecked by greedy, unscrupulous people and uncaring managers who checked their values at the door (if they ever had them to check). I was actually looking forward to reading the inside story. But this book reads like a patchwork quilt of news articles and interviews that are in the public domain. If you've kept up with the business press you'll likely find little that is new. The publisher should have asked for more rather than rush this out to capitalize on the corporate scandals."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD really lifts your spirits","review":"I love the variety of heartfelt songs in this collection.

The album is very disappointing. No good flow, the track selection is poor and it doesnt get you moving at all. I recommend you better save your money for something else, even though it is from the past summer, Juniorjack/Kid Creme in the house is 5 times better than this album.It has become very difficult to get a good house compilation lately and the best names comtinue to surprise me with very poor albums. I would also recommend \\"el divino ibiza 03\\" and \\"saaed & palash - additive beats\\" if you still want to listen good house music."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Soul Heaven","review":"I usually will pick up anything by MAW, but after listening to this mess of a compilation, I was totally unimpressed. There are some good tracks like Kathy Brown's \\"Never Again\\" and Tracks 11, 17, and 18 on the 2nd disc, but overall I was very dissapointed. The third CD is slapped together with older tracks that have already been on several of their previous albums. I recommend \\"London to Ibiza\\" by Lil' Louis Vega or \\"Masterworks\\" is always a good staple of classic MAW. Album just seems to be pushing a hard post-nuyorican sound that is repetitive and not appealing enough to warrant buying the album, IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Honey, I've Shrunk Ludwig !!!","review":"This is arguably the most boring Beethoven Ninth ever committed to disc - and that is saying something as there are many 'shabby shockers' in the Derby. It is underpowered, underwhelming and short-winded. The soloists acquit themselves well, but they cannot offset the tedium of the first four movements. It actually miniaturises Beethoven far worse than period practice (say, Norrington) at its most pedantic.Really, a man's gotta know his limitations.

Almost every song doesn't sound like the original, which shows just how far Psychopathic went to put this together. But, they didn't do it alone. They had the mixing talents from underground icons, such as the Kottonmouth Kings, The Wolfpac, The FILTHEE Immigrants, Monoxide of Twiztid, Mike E. Clark, Kuma, DJ Clay, and Fritz the Cat to remake the music. I love most of the tracks, some I find are not even close to as good as the originals, but still a strong 2-CD album worth buying for any Juggalo ninja out there that may even feel skeptical about this album.

The acting is not great but the overall story and photography are beautiful. It's about a poor farming family of nine that set out from Missouri, in 1843, to go to Oregon Territory and start a new life.The perils they have along the way are well portrayed. This is based on a true story. What those children accomplished is nothing short of amazing.**** 4 Stars...Highly recommended family viewing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't 'get' what the picture promised","review":"The watch pictured is very pretty, so that is why I ordered it. That is not what I received. I received a watch with a band that can only be described as 'brightly multicolored'. It's not ivory, or bone, or beige.

Color, texture, all WRONG!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for La Mer","review":"La Mer is one of my favorite pieces; I've heard live performances by the SF Symphony and the LA Phil. The one on this disc is decent, but there's something about either the balance or the recording quality that seems to lose detail compared to other recordings. (This is especially noticeable in the second movement, where the highlights by the percussion section just don't penetrate.) If you're looking for a great recording of La Mer, I'd recommend the Boulez/Cleveland (ASIN B000001GM5)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hose too small!","review":"It appears to be a large hose, but when I got it, it was really small, wrong hose, does not fit."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Very few modules allow the DM to easily create a storyline, aid low level players with a helpful but limited non player character, make use of rangers and druids in wilderness foray, and a creepy dungeon crawl complete with an interesting boss.The town and temple require players to investigate not only what is happening, but where to sleep (in safety at least). The NPC is a powerful but old wizard who can add some comic effect if played well. Players are forced to make interesting alignment decisions (is a cursed or twisted priest of a good diety fair game to attack?). The wilderness requires guides or tracking skills. The dungeon is simple and there is actually a plan for rescuing people and destroying the entire dungeon.One of the best modules of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The view from under the tree....","review":"Judy Pascoe's writing drew me into the story of Simone and her unusual and uneasy family. The descriptions of the tree and the feelings it sent forth felt real and slightly unsettling. Simone, her siblings, her mother and even her neighbors each deal with death and what the tree is or isn't in varying ways. It makes one wonder-if a loved one stayed with us, in a tree, what could we/would we do to keep that tree? Wonderfully written-I look forward to future works by Ms. Pascoe."},{"rating":"1","title":"this book art boring","review":"What a great concept! What a lame book!I thought this was going to be a fun read. It starts off great, with the spirit of the deceased father hanging out in a tree- communicating to the family, but it just doesn't really go anywhere from there.It's all about the tree & what could be a fruitful (pun intended) plot point just falls dull.Coming of age? barely. Dealing with death? not in the interesting way it could have been. Lots of books out there to read? yes. Should this be one of them?

It's not just a collection of tunes but a statement. Dissolution, lust, forgiveness are on these recordings produced by the GREAT Huey Meaux with a supporting cast including Carl Perkins, most of the MGS and others. What they shoulda done is released this with the outtakes like Bear Family did with the box set back in the day. You get all the drunken chatter and insults, proclamations, threats and some interesting tunage as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best by a mile","review":"I think there were maybe two songs out of the 27 that I really thought were worth listening to.

It is redundant and full of information that anyone in the field should have figured out anyway: Gems of wisdom such as \\"Delineate a realistic agenda and time frame\\" for meetings.

The softness and stretchiness of the fabric is wonderful, especially for those first-thing-in-the-morning feedings when I'm engorged. The cross front is great, because it provides better support, even while lying on my side.

I have an hour glass figure and have had issues with finding small band but large cup when it comes to nursing bras. This is my second child and I wish I had known about these bras sooner.

Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most comfortabe nursing bra I've owned.","review":"I'm usually a 34 B, but I decided to go up a size, so I bought the white medium size bra. It works great! It's easy to use and really comfortable. I like that the band is a little longer because I don't like it when the band is right under my boobs. It's really uncomfortable. I also like that it's wireless and cotton with no padding. I've never been a push-up bra kind of girl and this bra is the opposite of a push-up. It doesn't have much support, but that's ok with me because I've got a smaller chest so I don't really need that much support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sizing unclear","review":"I bought the wrong size in this bra b/c the sizing info on this site was off.

I use this at night as a nursing bra (It covers the whole breast so when you get engorged it doesn't cut into you like some of the demi styles do). It also give some additional support unlike a lot of the night-time nursing bras do, which also helps keep the pads in place while you sleep (although I haven't found anything that works perfect yet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straps can't be adjusted enough","review":"The wide band at the base of the bra is nice and soft. I like the pull over sport bra style. However the cups really provide little to no support and when you are sitting the straps become so loose as to falL off your shouders, and you are very unsupported (brasless). It would be great if the straps could be adjusted more than the 3\\" inches that this current style offers.I use this as a night bra and continue looking for something with some support!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful quality but definite 80's vibe","review":"Ok, I was sucked in by the lure of a new soundtrack for spy capers. The Telarc studio story really should be read by any music appreciator. Look it up, it's a shame they are no longer active. I don't have good sound equipment, but this CD did sound great on what I had. Here's the caveat. The CD release date is 1988, and the music is very much a product of its time. Lots of electronic keyboards and I was really not expecting vocals.

I think your experience of this anime is different if you watch the original and then 2040 or watch 2040 then the original. Though some would disagree with me, I think 2040 is great standalone and does a good job of explaining the characters under a (semi) coherent plot line. I loved it, whether or not it was the first one I saw. Then a year later, I finally found the original and went in with high hopes. Never disappointed me, it had elements 2040 did not. Also, great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really connected with me","review":"This story never really connected with me. I couldn't get into it. It was not compelling.

As a confessed optimist, however, Tefs always leaves one with the spiritual support of hope, related with indomitable courage.For those who would seek wisdom about life's trials, this volume has much to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"There will be dragons ... but not in this book","review":"The dragons show up in the sequel, the 2 nd of the trilogy. I agree with the other reviewer, this is a 4.5 star book. I really, really like the premise of this book. The internet \\"grows up\\" into Mother who knows when a leaf falls in the forest and when a bird dies. But, the old adage, who shall guard the guardians ? When the guardians of Mother, the council, have a falling out, literally all hell breaks loose on this planet wide \\"garden of eden\\". For in this future possibility, not only did the people eat the apple of knowledge, they also ate the tree of everlasting life. But, just like the Garden of Eden, the people were cast out into the wilderness. Just a great story.

Like his other best efforts, it's the first of a series which unfortunately goes downhill in subsequent sequels. Fortunately this series doesn't deteriorate nearly as drastically as his Posleen/Bane Sidhe wars stories, for which he should truly hang his head and repent.Ringo sets up a high-tech world which is interesting on its own merits, lets us get to know the characters, then crashes civilization down into primitive survivalism. His handling of the transition works very well.The characters are well done, believable, and sympathetic. The story-line is engaging. I think this may be my favorite Ringo book (I don't give 5-star ratings lightly, and none of the books that follow this one are going to get one; I've already read them.)This book is a very well done, entertaining read and I do recommend it on its own merits.I also very much wish Ringo would put as much effort into finishing his series as he does into starting them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book rating","review":"I enjoyed the book and look forward to reading more in this series. I think John Ringo write a pretty good SF story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pity--it could have been good.","review":"Some interesting ideas unfortunately combined with failure to explore them or even consistently bear them in mind during world building and plot construction. Lumps of awkward exposition, especially near the beginning, are interwoven with a Mary Sue story written for adolescent males. Plenty of 2nd amendment propaganda, but no mention of the 13th, 15th or 19th amendments, which would actually have applied to the situation. Basic facts about the real world (which serves as history for the story-world) are conveniently forgotten or overlooked.If you are a militaristic fifteen year old boy, you'll probably like it. Otherwise, there are better ways to spend your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeech--You coulda done better!","review":"I've read other stuff by this author and liked it--especially the \\"March To...\\" series. But this was deadly. Deadly dull, deadly slow, deadly stupid. The heroes were almost too dumb to live--just couldn't figure stuff out even tho' it practically BIT them on the ass. The dialogue was stiff; the characters were 2-dimensional; there were several unneccessary scenes that slowed the action; BACK-story IN the story and missing explanations!

They both write \\"hard\\" military science fiction, and this one is no differerent. Except its not so much military science fiction as medievial military fiction. True, there exists high techonology, including AIs and genetic engineering, most of the action of this book takes place with swords and bows.

This book sticks in my mind like water filling an oddly shaped vase. That vase is my mind... and once filled, it is impossible to discharge.The subject matter is totally fascinating. The types of experiments allowed in 'those days' are outlawed today so the insight gained is even more valuable. The reader will be awe struck at the outcome of these experiments related to the \\"common man's\\" ability to inflict pain on other humans given certain conditions.

Umbrellas have a removable black backing,You will need a order a cold shoe and I would recommend a stroboframe clamp/shoe.

There are only two potential keepers: \\"Yours Love\\" and \\"Sad Songs and Waltzes.\\" But they're not even worth the price of a second-hand album.

Along with a good topo map, which Mr.de Hart recommends, this book has prepared me for every twist and turn I've hiked in NC; Pisgah NF, Uwharrie, Linville, Wilson Creek Wilderness Area, etc.It is also a great reference for letting me know which trails will suit my nephew (18yrs old) and my daughter (8yrs old). It's a great tool for planning hikes depending on what you want to see; take the route with the most waterfalls, highest waterfalls, best overlooks, most remote location, flora, campsites, etc.I've only gotten lost one time while using this comprehensive and detailed guide and that was due to a poorly marked spur and not the book. In fact, Mr.de Hart often mentions trails that are poorly marked so you can be on the lookout.Indispensable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good list of trails, poorly organized book","review":"While this book has a lot of trails in it, I find it to be so poorly organized that it is almost unusable. Instead of organizing by region (i.e. Western NC, Piedmont, Eastern, etc.) the author chose to organize by the type/owner of the trail. For instance, trails are grouped by whether they are a National Park trail, National Forest trail, County Trail, State trail. I would never think to look up a trail that way and it makes it hard to find trails in a specific area. When picking a trail, I think of the region I am going to and then I want to see a list of all the trails in the region. Only after narrowing down that way might I care about who is responsible for the trail, so as to figure out how well maintained the trail is, perhaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but......","review":"I like these sandals very much.

It's a walkthrough from the basics that only covers actual coding at the end. Though even then it's not very deep. That's not bad though since it really is an architectural level book.I do take the book to task on two accounts though. First it doesn't even mention Ajax, which is odd for a recent publication. And second it doesn't cover REST at all an only passingly mentions XML-RPC. The author says SOAP took over and is now the majority of the services going on over the web. When in reality the use of RSS and REST style XML protocols is, in terms of bandwidth, is crushing SOAP. Regardless, REST and Ajax are worth mentions here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pompous, pretentious, sometimes technically inaccurate..","review":"Pompous, pretentious, sometimes technically inaccurate.. these words come to mind when you read this book, and unfortunately every page you read just confirms it.Author made an attempt to write an objective \\"companion\\" book on SOA for everyone, and end up writing a book for noone but himself. It is too technical for non-technical people, too primitive and inaccurate for technical people, too opinionated to be objective, and too long and heavy for anyone to be a companion.How to put it better? It is a waste of a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, devoid of content","review":"I threw it in the garbage halfway through Chapter 8. That's when I realized I had read 288 pages and had barely learned a thing, was staring at yet another incomprehensible diagram, and probably could have learned more from a 20 page white paper. The book spends way to much time describing fairly straightforward concepts. Perhaps I should have kept plugging along. But if the book failed to engage me in the first 300 pages, it was unlikely to in the last 500."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a field research book and not practical","review":"This is a SOA introductory book on concepts, design and technology. It is long winded and repetitive. The content of the book is based on industry research and not the author's experience in SOA. In some parts of the book the author encourages forward thinking. At the same time, the author discourages excessive forward thinking and upfront design. If the SOA project is run like an agile project, many of the problems captured in this book won't be an issue. This book will confuse for those who are new to SOA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much theory","review":"I found reading this book boring after the first 6 chapters. What would have been more interesting is the author giving possible solutions (i.e. specific products) that could meet the specifications he laid out in each chapter. This book does not give specific real-world solutions that fit the descriptions and specifications that are described as constituting a Service-Oriented Architecture. After reading this book, I understand the architecture, but could not recommend any specific products that would fit the architecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbose, Mostly High Level Concepts","review":"This book might be best described as SOA for managers. Most of the book covers high level concepts. In some parts everything is presented as an abstraction, leaving the reader to wonder what the connection with the real world is.Even as a book focused on a high level overview this book doesn't work. This should have been a 300 page book. Who has time to put up with an extra 400 pages?If your interest is in actually implementing something, you'll need to go far beyond this book. I've given it 2 stars instead of 1 because I did learn a few things from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a really, really long survey of SOA standards","review":"If you want a book that covers most of the SOA standards in one place, this might be helpful. I think you could get that from Wikipedia. Lots regurgitation of SOA platitudes, not much value add. If you're looking to make the light go on about key SOA concepts, this isn't the book.

I am half way through the book and sometimes, I have second thoughts if I could of done a better choice, have I not been lured by the technological frenzy.Very well documented with an excellent graphic presentation the book excels in clarity. However there were one or two instances when I had the feeling that the text dilutes in extended categorization and repeating same simple concepts. But then again, SOA is becoming a vast field.

I am a veteran at SOA and wanted a book I could reference. It is long winded. For example, the author goes through 106 pages before he gets to the true definition of SOA on that page 106. This should be in the first 5 pages. The definition is good but why the heck did he have to confuse the novice reader with all that \\"contemporary\\" and \\"Primitive\\" SOA discussion. I cut through those pages fast but I bet a novice is going to be really confused reading this book. I would not recommend this to customers as some of the testimonials at the front suggest. I picked up a few ideas here and there. A two star is about right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Extremely well written mammoth of a guide on a very important subject matter. Highly recommended if you are looking for guidance and expert advice. Don't expect to feel like you'll be in control of your soa project after reading this, however.

But this book saves you a lot of research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Foundational Book on SOA","review":"This is a very helpful book for the practitioner in developing an understanding of the potential for SOA to increase organizational agility and the methodology by which an SOA project can be planned and delivered.

The only problem I had with the book were the so called \\"In Plain English\\" excerpts that were suppose to make concepts easier to understand - they don't, they only obscure the author's excellent technical explanations. So, skip the \\"In Plain English\\" excerpts and you will get a very good, and vendor neutral, explanation of SOA."},{"rating":"2","title":"styx II","review":"This album was my first taste of Styx. Ever since that time, I was hooked and a diehard fan. Styx used to play in Utah at a place called the Icehouse, before they really became famous. In Utah County, Lady became the top hit for several weeks while it remained unknown elsewhere around the country. From the organ solo on Little Fugue in G, to the youthful Earl of Roseland, Styx honed out a masterpiece. Curulewski was an incredible predecessor to Tommy Shaw and the team of DeYoung and Young, made up some of the most memorable lyrics on the album. It is a shame the present group doesn't do more from this original album. Even Dennis DeYoung (now solo), has forgotton the roots which made them famous. This is a must album if you can find it. I have an original LP version and still play it on the turntable and take myself back to the \\"Good old Days\\" playing sport with Davie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd from Great Musicians!","review":"2003 Last Tribe's album has alot of power for the metal heads that enjoyed the first album of this Swedish band lead by guitarist Magnus Karlsson ( Starbreaker, Midnight Sun ).

Yes, the Boston Symphony is very good. However, Ozawa's violin can only be described as ostentatious, and pretentious. It seems as if he is trying to make something new here. As if he is showing the listener how many small flourishes he can add to improve something that is already perfect. This is typically the case with other recordings I have heard of this piece. Sometimes, the result is playful and light, but in this case the result is something that grates on my nerves.I will not direct you to not purchase this.

Even for a rock and pop music fan friend, this speaker test CD gave hime the best deal he could ever have found.If the sound coming out of speakers is muddy or the instruments undifferentiated then you usually have a speaker problem. Amps tend to be far superior to speakers.The inspired playing of Joseph Silverstein leaves everyone for dead and only I Musici, Takako Nishizaki and the recent Janine Jenses CD comes close in purity of playing and sheer listening pleasure. None seem as brilliantly recorded as the Telarc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"This is still the finest Vivaldi \\"Four Seasons\\" recording on CD, from the many I have heard (and I own several).

I expected this series to shine on DVD!When I picked the first season set up, I rushed home, unwrapped it and threw the first DVD in my player. The picture quality was below average and the DVD freezed several times.I later learned through an article in Video Business magazine that the reason for the glitches are the double sided discs using the DVD 18 format. The plants producing these discs are running over capacity and it is a quality control issue. Several studios are acknowledging the problem and switching from DVD 18 to DVD 9 on certain DVD TV titles. These single sided discs have more durability. Warner Brothers recently switched producing the West Wing and Dukes of Hazzard from DVD 18 to DVD 9. Universal Studios had not commented. I'm hoping Universal Studios corrects this problem and reissues Miami Vice on the standard DVD 9 format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crockett and Tubbs the boys do it again","review":"What else can i say the best dynamic duo since batman and the boy wonder. its really kind of sad that it took the studios so long to release this but im glad they did i have waited too long for these seasons to be release, i was in college when this show first aired and it was like nothing i have ever seen before yeah there have been some ok cops shows in the history of television but never anything like miami vice the Armani cloths the cars the women the quest stars and of course the music this show packed it all in.miami vice was my friday night date nothing could pull me from this show on fridays night my girlfriend had to take second place to Sonny and Ricardo to all of my fellow miami vice fan lets keep the heat on the studios to release all of the rest of the seasons soon ok PALS........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture Quality of the DVD is awful","review":"I agree with the previous reviewers that Season 2 of Miami Vice was one of their strongest seasons, and I am enjoying the episodes. Still, there is no denying that these releases are of very very poor quality, resembling something you would expect from bootleg copies bought from the street. There are NO special features at all. The picture quality is a miserable transfer, heightened by the high quality DVD picture of a miserable transfer. This is a cheap quality production. I guess they spent all their money getting the music rights, and ran out of cash when it came to producing a clean picture, with extras. For die hard Miami Vice fans only. Hopefully someday we'll get a quality redo of this mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Series","review":"I really liked the series when it was running on television. Some of the clothing and topics may be dated, but you have to realize that this was in the mid '80's, and was seriously cutting edge when broadcast.I was greatly happy when the first season was released on DVD, and relived some favorite memories. I was a little disapointed in the transfer to digital, as there was no cleaning up of the print which is most obvious in the opening credits, with grainy shots, and I swear I saw a piece of dust moving on the lense. Anywhay I hope the next release addresses that issue, but even if not, I'm going to buy the series as their released. Gotta love the '80's!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Got the Miami Vice Blues!","review":"Miami Vice Season 2 is a great show, great episodes - BUT - The actual quality of the DVDs is terrible.

It did my heart good to re-watch these episodes and remember the awesome music, both Hammer's score as well as the rest of the well-chosen rock and pop songs in the background, the Daytona Spyder, the pastel color palette, the palm trees and Don Johnson....

Unfortunately, I found the book to be very poorly written. The characters spoke to each other as if they were reading out of a text book. The author obviously did a lot of research for this book, but wrote it all into the book in a stiltingly awkward way. The characters were all cardboard cutouts, and the plot ridiculously thin. It was written on a very childish level. The author tells you everything, rather than showing you. She assumes the reader has no previous knowledge of anything.

I started to ask myself if maybe it was just me, or if this book was seriously written so poorly?I'll give it the benefit of (2) stars because of concept. It was very creative, original, whimsical (sic?), and cute. It fell short in the areas of supporting plot, writing style, and challenge.In summary, I felt like it was a first attempt of a book by an inexperienced writer.

The quality of his music include various paces, some very soft and fragile while others stir the emotions with their fire and speed! They all have one quality in common.

I usually put my Zune media player in the larger rear well, and coins in the smaller front well. The bottom edge of the Zune fits snugly in the springy foam, and the rest of it stands upright and clear, so I can press the buttons and view the screen. I can easily adjust the angle of the Zune by pushing it around in the spongy holder (it stays wherever I put it), and then swiveling the foam thingy in the car's cup holder. Need to move it? Easy. Just pick it up and plop into another cup holder. Need to clean it? Just pick it up and wash it out. Need to get the coins out? Just pick it up and dump them into your hand, then put it back.

The keyboard on the base only works with the speakerphone-not exactly what I had in mind! So now I'm on the search for yet another phone with these feautes (minus the called ID which I don't use). Unfortunatley, I kept thinking I'd adjust to this phone and didn't return it promptly so now I think it's mine.

It does bring some of the scenes to life- especially those involving the family. However there is always the feeling that there has been too much left out. Imelda Staunton plays a rather too knowing Mother, while Gerry is portrayed as disturbed, rather than preoccupied with his animal friends. Some of the funniest parts in the book have had the humour distilled out of them. Overall, the film is a must-buy if,like me,you have loved the book for years and have been curious to see how it might look on screen. The languid pace of the film is also a welcome break from the usual Hollywood perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool Ruler Gone Cold","review":"I was really excited to open up this DVD, crank up the volume, and skank along with the one and only Gregory Isaacs. Unfortunately I was disappointed from the outset. The video quality is quite poor (along with camera-work and editing) and Gregory himself was a sad sight. A once handsome, confident, strapping figure, he is now reduced to a grey-haired, pot-bellied, teetering old shell of himself. What's equally disappointing is the obvious weakness of his once strong, silky voice. In fact, his songs often sound best when he turns his mike to the audience (which he does constantly throughout the show). Gregory has been such a wonderful part of the reggae world that it's heartbreaking to see what he's become. On the positive side, the song selection is excellent and the 5.1 audio really sounds great. If your a huge Isaacs fan you may want to fork over the cash to get this disc, otherwise take that same money and purchase one of his many, many classic cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic McCaffrey","review":"Killashandra takes a new character, subjects her to overwhelming odds and brings the character thru to being the epitomy of individuality.

I needed a CD player/radio AND wanted to be able to listen to my XM radio, so I gave this boombox a try. What a disappointment. The main problem is the background noise on the XM radio. The faint high-pitched hum only occurs when listening to the XML radio. The CD player and radio sound fine, however, CDs skip and sometimes hesitate to play. Removing the XM radio takes some practice. You snap the unit into the adapter, which is fine, but to remove it, you have to push on the radio until the unit slides forward. That was my experience.If you don't already own a Delphi XM radio, consider the Audiophase satellite radio Skybox with AM/FM/CD/MP3 player.

If you turn the volume UP ALL THE WAY, you get a little pop and crackle, thats it. sounds like the internal amps are blown. It does this with CD/FM/XM. Returned it to place of purchase, I've been waitting two weeks for a replacement to come in. During that time, I'm reading reviews and understanding why its taking so long.

I called delphi tech support and was told that since I am passed my one-year warranty, I am out of luck. They can do nothing for me. They told me it would be cheaper to buy a new one because to fix it would probably cost me about $80 an hour.

Then I borrowed the demo unit from the store, took it home and, it worked very well.So go figure this out? Apparently this technical problem is well known to Delphi.

Telarc was one of the first to exploit the new recording opportunities of the then new digital format in the 1980s and they succeeded early on in mastering full digital recording for orchestral works. For me, the Telarc recording provides an impressively engrossing three dimensional spatial sense and clarity that has always been missing in earlier analog recordings. Extraneous noise sources such as errant string squeal or paper shuffling no longer compete with tape hiss and, without being invasive or distracting, provide a more captivating snapshot into one of the performances of the now deceased Mr. Serkin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Serkin","review":"The LP of Serkin playing this same concerto was the first classical record I bought, back in 1966 or so. I loved his playing then, and love it now. These two recordings of the Emperor are bookends of his career more or less. Serkin was a great artist, but was also a hummer, which is distracting to some people (it doesn't bother me).The recording engineering is excellent and the sound has a great presence. I've always like Telarc's engineering, and think the engineers' names should be on the labels of all CDs so we can follow them and pick out the ones we like. Failing that, we go with the label name, which, as I say, I consider good in the case of Telarc.My only gripe is that the adagio is not quite as sweet as I've heard by some other artists and even by Serkin himself in the earlier LP recording. But this recording is well worth the money, and, if the Emperor is one of your favorites, I think you should add this one to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tonex brings the Word and the funk","review":"For those of you who already like Tonex, this CD is a must have.

Vocally, he is capable of Prince like workouts and pulls some neat production tricks in the studio under his 't-boy' alias. Most important is the message he communicates, a love for the Lord. Tonex gives you tunes like \\"Bout a Thing\\" that are so bouncy you cannot forget them and on the other side, a slow jam like \\"God Has Not 4got\\" that is just a beautiful ballad.

Again, if you're advanced, this is a good book to have it your collection of reference material."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY LITTLE PRACTICAL INFORMATION dealing with prediction","review":"It is obvious that the author spent a lot of time and effort in writing this book. It is about 245 pages long but the fonts are small so the book would be much thicker if it were printed in regular sized fonts. This book has two shortcomings listed below:1. No information to create the Arabic Astrology Charts! So this is not the book for the beginners2. Part III of the books from page 139 through page 224 is titled \\" Practical Illustrations\\". But only two out of five sample readings in it has some practical use, in my opinion. They are the interpretations for a prostitue and Watergate incident. I am skeptical when astrolgy tries to predict a country's or the world's events.In short, there is a lot of theoretical information but VERY LITTLE PRACTICAL INFORMATION dealing with prediction. You'll need another book to go with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not pelased with the sound quality","review":"While the features in this phone really grabbed my attention, I never realized how lousy analog phones sound. I have a 900mhz Sony cordless phone and I never really thought about whether it was digital or analog.

I orginally asked for that cd because of the song. But when I put the cd I couldn't stop listening to the songs...all of them were great.

Yet, I'm glad to see the digital master tapes finally made a CD of this great piece of Saint-Saens with the great orchestra and its great conductor. I remember also when Ormandy recorded for Victor the digital recording in 1979 of the Bartok-Concerto for Orchestra, which was first in it's kind-digital recordings. The Philadelphia Orchestra were also involved in the first stereo recordings under the baton of Stokowski in 1932.

Not their absolute best concerts appearences (Long Journey Home, again a combo CD and DVD of them in concert, is I think better) but no CJ fan will be disappointed by Margo, Michael and the rest of the Junkies in performance. The performances are from their tour promoting their \\"Open\\" album. The DVD in addition to Cowboy Junkies in concert has lots of extras including interviews with the band members and an acoustic performance with Mike and Margo Timmin.

If I had a dollar for every time I dropped it or knocked it off my desk I would own a retirement home in Palm Springs. This phone has never failed me despite the abuse it has been subject to. only now are the batteries beginning to die. I am looking to now replace and took some time to review other models currently available, however did not see any that came with an additional battery. The phone is extremely comfortable to wear, and I have never had any problems with the headset being fixed to the phone. This has actually been a benefit as I have caught the phone many times by the cord, saving a collision with the floor. Why Pay More for Less?

Some techno-thriller authors are starting to drag with their fifth novel. Not so with Gandt. Not overwhelmingly technical and includes some human interest, relationship twists. Plus, at the end of the book, the promise of more to come. Better than I expected!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Killing Sky is Gandt's Best Thriller","review":"With THE KILLING SKY, Gandt's military adventure series climbs to a new and edgier level. Set in the troubled land of Israel, this story grabs you at the very beginning. Just when you think you know where it's going, the author yanks the rug out from under you. Besides being filled with the usual action scenes, this latest novel portrays its characters in an especially believable and sympathetic style."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Just Found A New Author","review":"I received The Killing Sky as a gift and I must say that the book captivated me. The action is intense, and the characters well defined. The aerial descriptions are superb, and the \\"ground action\\" is very exciting as well. Upon completion of this book, I immediately read the remaining four books in the series. I understand a new installment is due out in the fall and I am anxiously awaiting its arrival. Bob Gandt is a wonderful writer with a good personal background of his subject matter. I highly recommend his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"I bought a pack of 3 as it was much cheaper than buying individually.

Well, suffice it to say I threw it out after a week.This moisturiser did nothing but fragrance my hair (it has a strong fragrance). I tried it as a leave-in, as well as a daily moisturiser. It probably worked better as a daily moisturiser, but it still didn't do much.After using this moisturiser, my hair felt coated and felt dry after a couple of hours. Not surprising, since two of the first few ingredients are silicones.I have used better moisturisers and leave-ins e.g. It's a 10, Skala.I will not be purchasing this ever again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate it","review":"I heard so much about this product that i would give it a try and after usein git for a month it doesnt do anything better for my hair at all . all it does is sit on top of my hair and it doesnt even moistureize it good either. this was a waste of money for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"No use","review":"I'm on my hair journey and trying to find a leave in which keeps my hair moist when blow dried with very low heat.

Even if you don't like the song (or the remix), it's a nice piece to have in your collection to impress the people who do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The search is over, WOW!!!","review":"One of the best collections ever! Thank you Mr. Liebrand for taking the time to put all of this wonderful songs together. Especially for including Patrick Cowley's remix of \\"I feel love\\", Moroder's disco-trance masterpiece. Patrick Cowley was able to perfect perfection by adding the high energy of his keyboards to the hypnotic rhythm creating the crowning jewel of all dance floors around the world! All the other songs are great, but I would have pay the money just for that one alone. Long life for all of them whom keep on bringing back those treasures from the past!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An all around solid performance","review":"This recording tends more toward the \\"gravitas\\" side than the sprightly among B minor recordings. It also tends to treat this as a chorale work first and an orchestral work second. Sound quality overall is pretty good. That said, as one of the earlier recordings, from one of the better period instruments orchestras, this is also somewhat a pacesetter among recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"One of the best kung fu movies I've bought, and received in excellent condition.

Instead of the mediocre warm-up band I was expecting, a highly entertaining, energetic and well-polished band -- \\"Seeking Homer\\" -- appeared on stage. I was quite pleasantly taken aback by their catchy tunes and great harmony, as well as their incredible guitarmanship and the inclusion of a harmonica in their muscial stylings. Unlike most bands, I found that their album doesn't do their live performances justice, but it is quite good, anyway. Keep an eye on this band, you WILL hear from them very soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant Approval","review":"I have been a fan of Star Wars for many years, and upon hearing about the Star Wars: Encyclopedia, I knew I had to have it. I had it only a day, and was amazed at all it had in it. I give it two thumbs up. It's that good. If you are a die-hard Star Wars fan this is a must have! This book is in-depth and full of information about things that I didn't even know exsisted in the Star Wars universe. It includes extremely detailed information, about ships, droids, planets, and every character you can think of. This book will tell about a characters life history, even if he only had one small appearence in a limited edition comic book. To make a long review short. BUY THIS BOOK! IT'S UNBELIEVABLE! And buy it from Amazon.com, because they have the best price I've seen yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kicks @$$","review":"This book is THE book on Star Wars. It tells almost everything you need to know about the Star Wars universe including all the aliens you see in the cantina and Jabbas palace(well almost all). The only thing that s***s about this book is that its kinda outdated. For example it did not have anything from the Han Solo trilogy,in which all three books were published way before this book was published surely the author could have included this. But the one that got me ticked off was they didnt include the seven dark Jedi's from Dark Forces 2 . I mean c'mon those guys were cool! But yet they were'nt included but yet the characters from the cartoons are. Other then that its the best Star Wars book written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous, the universe is incomplete without it.","review":"I commend Mr. Sansweet for tackling such a huge project. It is known by all that one book could never be the ultimate resource for the Star Wars Universe. Accept the book as it is, and you too will appereciate the work in it. Future authors will thank Stephen J Sansweet for he has unlocked the the door to this wonderful universe. I for one will love every minute of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect but still great!","review":"I noticed one mistake right away, one code used for telling where the info was from was SWHS i looked to see what it meant, but it was not there. My guess is it stands for Star Wars Holiday Special. This is the only one i found except for the cover, but who cares, i didn't notice it until i read other reviews. It had almost everything i looked up, some was to recent, but i didn't realize that. The pictures are great, i love seeing some of my favorite characters, from the novels, in color. oh, i have the Star Trek encyclopedia, this better. I've read at least 35 Star Wars books and i still didn't know half of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I thought this encyclopedia was a very well written and informative. Its easy to just look up a character, vehicle, droid, etc and read about it. HOwever, it needs to be updated, since, for example, Mara Jade is still Mara Jade and not MJ Skywalker. I'd also like to see Episode 1 characters in it, too. I hope Sansweet is able to update it, because I'll definitely buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was really good","review":"It was very good! I found it to be very informative. It covered almost everything from the largest to the smallest detail. However, it left off a little information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect source of information","review":"I got this book a few days ago and I think it is great. It is a perfect source of information for those who don't know very much about Star Wars or just aren't sure about something. This is the book I go to if I'm not sure about something. If for some reason you can't find what your looking for in this book the I would recomend one of the guides such as the guide to Planets and Moons, Vehicles and Vessels, Characters, Weapons and Technology, Droids or one of the versions to the Star Wars Universe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for amateur fans...","review":"This ia an overall good compilation of almost every star wars book, novel, movie, show, etc. It is very complete although the latest stuff is missing (but of course it was written before the new Star Wars Era).

For the amateur it is a very good reference guide, and for the hard core fans it is just a great addition to the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"star wars encyclopedia","review":"i found the content great especially for it being the original trilogy and comic books as well as the mini movies. it was also suprising that it was current up to the modified episodes of 4-6."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any Star Wars fan!","review":"It is probably the most comprehensive Star Wars reference available.

I have tried to find an entry in the Star wars universe that is not in that book and have failed...from the Dune Sea to a hyperdrive motivator to Kabe... this book has it all... If you are a Star Wars fan, this book will have it all, it will satisfy your thirst for knowledge and want for refrence...this, is the book...the sole powerhouse of complete information to the Star Wars universe."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame I paid $50 for this","review":"Normally Steve Sansweet's work is pretty damn good. This is not the norm. This book is a mass of contradictions. Nobody seems to have checked some of the info in here. He has people credited as living after they've been killed off, ships that have been destroyed listed as intact, and some just plain wrong facts. Great pictures, but it wasn't worth the money. If he wanted to do it right, wait, pick the books you want to put in there, then finish the book. He didn't. There's a whole lot of Black Fleet Crisis material missing when it's listed in the biblio. Also there's a lot of times when he cuts corners on entries. I hope if they do another, it's alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars Encyclopedia","review":"I was very disappointed with the condition of my purchase.

The binding is loose, cover almost torn from the inerds of the book. I'm giving this as a gift and didn't want to hassle returning it, but I will never buy from that particular seller again if I am aware of the exact seller being the same one.

My Lexmark 5400 is a multi-function printer/fax/scanner/copier. After trying to get the printer working for hours I called TRENDnet customer service. The tech was friendly and ran through the setup again in minutes. When that did not work she checked and found out my printer was not compatible.

Maybe the windows support is ok but the Macintosh support is _barely_ adequate. The manual is vapor so expect to do a lot of searches on their terrible homepage. I had to infer configuration information from other models to get it to work. It never detected the printer right, half of the options on the damn internal web config I could not find documentation for, the Bonjour/Rendezvous printing never worked, IPP didn't work, and although the product description says it supports these, the FAQ answer I found on the website says to use lpr/lpd. After a couple of hours and a very bad taste in my mouth, I returned it and got an Airport Express for $99. Worked within 5 minutes of plugging it in.

Calling the Tech Support did not resolve the matter. Returning to the seller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome print server","review":"The TE100-P21 is an awesome print server. It allowed me to connect an old HP Laserjet 2100M (using LPT port) and a Canon Pixma 4000 inkjet (USB) to a bunch of computers, some running Windows XP, some Linux (Centos 5.4), and one -- the critical one -- running Windows 98SE (virtual under VMWare). The only thing not working -- reported by others -- is that you can't get info on how much ink is left on the Canon. I can easily live without that to gain the flexibility.Some advice on setup:1. DO NOT, repeat, DO NOT use the quick start instructions. Instead get the instruction manual off the included CD.2. When adding a printer from one of your computers (whether Windows or Linux) use the IP address of the TE100 instead of its computer name.Don't expect all-in-one printers or scanners to work fully. Just use it as it was designed -- as a print server."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with Macintosh","review":"I spent several hours messing with this print server - what a waste.

The new one was more stable, but I could never get it to support bi-directional printing, so I was unable to see the printer color cartrige status (a requirement), and it didn't support the scanner for the same reason. Then it was so slow, I could have literally gotten out a typewriter and beat it to the punch. It went out to lunch for 5-10 minutes when I sent it a print job.

The audio is louder by far and easier to hear in a noisy environment, but the audio quality is not as crisp as the built in speakers. Lastly, the speakers require their own power source, so get two AAA batteries ready. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

And like his James Bond doppleganger Deveraux performs his job taking frequent breaks to \\"love the lovely ladies.\\"For my part the strength of this book isn't so much in when it's telling Deveraux's story (though that part of course is fun), it's more interesting with it's supposed B stories including the story of a prominent Russian defector and his family.If you only read one Leon Uris book you should probably read either Exodus or maybe even The Haj but this one is still fun and worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"kanamaham.","review":"the condition of the book is not the same as the seller had indicated.the seller should have been honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uris' best book.

Unlike many of Uris' other works, this book is crisply written, the story moves at a fast pace, the ending is climactic, and the characters are vivid. The protagonist, Andre Devereaux, is unforgettable.This is a novel essentially of the Cuban Missile Crisis. It also deals with postwar French foreign policy under De Gaulle (thinly disguised as \\"Le Croix\\" in the novel). The novel is told from the perspective of Devereaux, a French intelligence officer. Devereaux must deal with his knowledge of the Soviet activities in Cuba as well as Soviet penetration of the French government.This is a fine novel. Unlike many of Uris' other novels, it does not bog down, and the characters behave like real people. There are no idealized characters--each person is shown complete with flaws and foibles.

The episode was interesting, a little twist in the final court deliberations that might make you nervous if you follow this part of the L&O; franchise. I'm a L&OCI; fan myself. The guy on trial is a sleaze so that made it worth watching to see if he got his.

His fans are always willing to listen, but will Ray for one time be ready to listen to his fans?

It is not Ray Charles' unique sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Ray Charles Completists Only","review":"As my title says, this is an album for Ray Charles completists only... not for the casual fan and not even for the more than casual fan.I fall into the second category... more than just a casual fan, owning about 6 or 7 Ray Charles albums (and loving them all dearly), I fished this CD out of a bargain bin at the local drug store. That should have set off warning alarms, but I thought, \\"How could anything by Ray Charles be bad?\\"This stuff is bad. It's certainly a curious CD... Ray's vocals are fine, but they are drowning in a sea of what genuinely sounds like the soundtrack from an old Nintendo game. Hearing the synthesized blips and bleeps will make you nostalgic for the aura of an arcade hall, if you grew up during the right era.Honestly, I found it near impossible to listen to all the way through. Ray alone with his piano would have been brilliant. Ray stuck inside Mega Man 3 is just a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"To small for anything!

WRONG! The case is so tight, even putting 1 game in the case is an exercise in masochism. You can't get the game out. Yes it's a spiffy color blue, and yes it's small, but if it only holds one game, it's not really worth it. What I did was bought a slightly bigger GBA case for the same amount, and that works just as well. The older GBA case if I had an older one would only hold one game with the case, but because it's the smaller SP, it holds several."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE CASE","review":"This case is the best ever.

Suffice to say, unless you still have a dinasaur computer running xp still, this game will not run on Windows 7. (Game itself is pretty much crap, but does do a good job in a few places of just giving a feel for warhammer 40k artistically. Mainly the levels on assorted space craft, seeing the Marine gothic chapel shaped ships etc.) I knew that the game itself wasn't great going in, but was purchasing again as I'd played through on PS2 ages ago and wanted to replay some of the few scenic levels as well as introduce it to someone as an example of 40k aesthetics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shampoo has come!","review":"As with all of my manga, there are some characters that I like more than others, some that I outright despise, and others that tickle me everytime I read the books.

Shampoo, a Chinese Amazon, is wild--she has been hunting the Saotomes for months, ever since she bestowed the 'kiss of death' on Ranma-chan for beating her in a tournament. But when she catches up to the Saotomes, she is once again defeated by Ranma, only since he was a boy at the time, she gives him the kiss of marriage and declares her love!

I prefer the Romantic Period's music. However, since I love \\"big\\" music, it follows that any music composed for 2 & 3 pianos + orchestra appeals to my liking of \\"bigger/larger\\" art/music. I bought this CD (which is becoming difficult to find in 2013) because of the performers - Katia & Marielle Labeque. I've seen them live in Seattle, WA in the 1990's and think they are very talented pianists and the rapport between these 2 sisters on stage is very contagious. As for Mozart, these 2 piano concertos together with the opera \\"The Magic Flute\\" are probably 3 of my few favorite compositions among his extensive & illustrious musical output. I am a proud owner of this CD and recommend it to anybody who likes piano concertos with beautiful melodies, harmonies and orchestration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like the old days.","review":"I saw these sisters perform the Concerto for Two pianos live at the Kennedy Center with the National Philharmonic in 1990.

He is joined here by some other incredible artists/slide guitarists, such as Corey Harris, Alvin Hart, Sonny Landreth, Bob Margolin, and on. This is a hybrid multichannel CD, plays on SACD and CD players, the sound is amazing. EVERY tune on here is just beyond awesome. I couldn't possibly say enough good things about this music. If you are a blues fan, you would never regret this purchase.

The assembly was fairly easy. However, the plastic wheels have zero traction which makes it extremely difficult for her to ride. She's ended up pushing with her legs the majority of the time.

The first chapters cover a short history of Switzerland as well as the origins of the aerial war in Europe and then follows the main story with a wealth of first hand accounts. Bravery, luck and terror are interwooved in these stories of the old warriors and there are also many facts about the general picture of the internment in Switzerland. Probably the most enjoyable part of the book was that about the conditions of life that the US fliers experienced at Adelboden, Wengen and Davos and the many attempts they made to escape from there in order to rejoin their units.

The book is organized nicely and the end of chapter questions always relate to the chapter material.The section right before the questions also helps direct the student to the chapter section pertaining most to the question. It has helped me save time in looking up information! The only thing I would like would be a few more examples.

I would strongly discourage anyone from getting this awful DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan-Aging Gracefully","review":"Dylan concerts are famously uneven: Some are magical, some are dead, but this is one of the magical ones. Not only are the performances terrific with Dylan upbeat and engaging the audience, but he shows how a performer should age. Rather than try to recreate the youthful rock and rolling that existed when \\"Tombstone Blues\\" and \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\" were recorded, Dylan brings the tempo down and provides arrangements that are different but just as good as the originals. The best part is the music fits the man singing it, so instead of looking like a middle aged rocker clinging to youth, Dylan has recreated his music to age with him.Dylan's music has always been timeless, and it's wonderful to see he has the creativity and self-awareness to make himself timeless in the vein of BB King, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, and not a ridiculous looking Mick Jagger pretending he's still twenty-five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob At His Best","review":"Bob Dylan is without a doubt the best folk or rock musician ever. The MTV Unplugged is a showcase of some of his best work. Some of my Favorite selections are John Brown, Dignity, All Along The Watchtower, and Like A Rolling Stone. I truly believe that Bob Dylan influenced modern music more than any other person or group. This performance is essential for any music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bob Dylan's best concert DVDs","review":"Bob Dylan doesnt release a lot concert DVDs. So when one comes along, they have to appreciate it for its rarity and value.

Get this DVD right now even if you are a casual Bob Dylan listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob was so much younger then, tho he's rockin' better now.","review":"This DVD is made by MTV, and it's got weird lighting, that's of course, really cool. The songs are good, & Bob was young-ish, so buy it for sure, or you'll never own a Bob Dylan DVD. (He signed each disc himself (not really.)). It's all acoustic, even the upright bass player. He uses no elctric guitars, but it's still really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"The troubador tells a tale","review":"Dylan is of course the master of the political lyric. With this set of songs it takes one on a jouney back through time, to HIS roots. The selection of songs is outstanding. The throat catches on occassion with the truth in his word. The band meshes incredibly well with all players giving a more than credible performance. Despite the fact that organ and pedal are plugged, without them the performance would not have been as great.Stellar performance by the folk singer!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just before he got to be an Old Man","review":"This is a great lesson in how one generation sees another. Bob on Mtv is one more proof that he wasn't just a voice of us Baby Boomers, see how easily The Times They Are A'Changin fits NOW. Dig the way new phrasing of old material just plain rocks, like Desolation Row. Timelessness and the power of the music smacks you upside the head even when you're looking for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Concert DVD I have Seen","review":"Unfortunately, there is a scarcity of excellent content for the many electronic platforms currently available to those who appreciate music. I have only found 4 concert DVDs that capture the power of the artist. This DVD is one of them. The other 3 are: Crosby, Stills & Nash - The Acoustic Concert; Roy Orbison - Black & White Night; and James Taylor - Live at the Beacon Theatre. Fortunately, someone had the foresight to capture this 1995 concert recorded at Sony Studios. The colors, camera work, and lighting are the best I have seen on any concert DVD. The DVD looks amazing on a modern flat screen TV. The same goes for the excellent recording of the musicians. They will be watching this DVD 100 years from now assuming civilizaton does not destroy itself before that time arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dylan Unplugged","review":"This was a beyond awesome show. I've read alot of bad reviews, and you have to really be into Dylan's music and lyrics. Understanding his music is the key. I did research and found out that his best buddy is Tom Petty and the sun glasses Bob wears on stange are from a Roy Orbison gift when he passed on. I recommend this to anyone that is into Dylan's lyrics. Make sure it's played with a good sound system, very good acustic music. My favorite is \\"Dignity\\" Great show, Thank you Bob Dylan and I'll cya in Vegas. Not bad for a old man like me. I'd like to find a Petty acustic concert DVD, no luck yet.

Every song on here is brilliant, but you simply can't beat Born With a Tail, Teen Lampchop, B.O.U., and Van Vanishing. The musicianship is awesome too with my favorite drummer of all time matt cameron (soundgarden, pearl jam) pounding away and singing as well. John McBaine does a great job as well and Josh Homme (kyuss, queens of the stone age) stops by to sing and play bass on a couple of songs. Simply put this is a great album with brilliant music that to ignore would be robbing yourself of some of the best music to come out of the dismal late-90's music scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but not great","review":"This book is decent for the layperson trying to grasp the semiconductor process, but not great. Some of the examples and explanation make the topic easy to understand, but the chapters don't really flow and you are likely to get confused when the book delves into technical depth. The typos and errors are distracting and it's blatant that the book was rushed to publishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed","review":"I was not at all impressed with this book. I have found more information, with more clear illustrations and samples in books that are a fraction of the cost. The author makes several mistakes throughout this book regarding the fabrication of microchips. I did not find the book to be up to date as far as current standards and practices. I highly reccomend that anyone interested in this subject find a more current book. If a person is interested in fabrication techniques from 5 years ago, then this book will fit that need. If a person wants to be knowledgeable about current methods then avoid this book like the plague. I would get my money back if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content, very poor execution","review":"This book would be a fine introduction to semiconductor processing if it were not so poorly written. The scope and depth of the material is appropriate and informative. However, the book was published without sufficient editing or, apparently, any proofreading and the result is occasionally inaccurate, often grammatically incorrect, and comically redundant throughout (the author must have been paid by the page).

This is not screamo. Screamo is like From First to Last, Silverstein, The Used, A Static Lullaby and stuff along those lines. This is metalcore that teaters over the edge to melodic death at times. Nothing you haven't heard already really, but still a very good cd. Best tracks are: The Deepest Sleep, Sharks in your Mouth, and Like Nails to a Casket. Just had to correct the screamo thing so people wouldn't get the wrong impression."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly generic metalcore","review":"When asked in an interview what he seeks in a band, Metal Blade boss Brian Slagel said, \\"the most important thing is for bands to be different and not to sound like everybody else.\\" Indeed, his label houses some of metal's most influential acts - Bolt Thrower, Cannibal Corpse, King Diamond, The Red Chord. Why, then, this band is on Metal Blade is a headscratcher. Contemporary metalcore can't get more derivative than this, with the usual screamed verses, sung choruses, Swedish riffs, and guitar harmonies nicked from Iron Maiden. The guitarists turn a hot lick or two, but chops are meaningless in such dismal settings. This release reeks of the quick buck and should be avoided at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Killed the Prom Queen ~Music for the Recently Deceased~","review":"As the first notes of \\"\\"Shakes in Your Mouth\\"\\" and \\"\\"Say Goodbye\\"\\" wrong through my speakers, there's one band that comes to mind immediately: As I Lay Dying. These guys are performing a style of Gothenburg hardcore made famous over here in the States by As I Lay Dying. In fact, it would be tough to say that there is much of anything separating the two bands save the few thousand miles between Australia and America.Slow beatdown sections, fast paced Gothenburg riffs that sound eerily like In Flames/At The Gates b-sides and clean vocals that tie back to the aforementioned As I Lay Dying sum up what this band is about.

Well, there are bands of that style who make themselves unique and get more respect, but for each one of those, we have about 20 generic Caliban/As I Lay Dying/KsE clones that do nothing new. This CD has what your average metalcore CD has: rehashed melodeath-inspired riffs, average screaming/clean singing vocals, and don't forget the breakdowns. Overall, this CD, while it's not unlistenable, is rather mediocre at best and represents well that the metalcore sponge cannot absorb any more. If you don't care about originality and like the styles of the bands I mentioned earlier, then you might like this. However, if you're looking for metalcore that's, well, not boring, go for Parkway Drive, Misery Signals, Heaven Shall Burn, All That Remains, and Unearth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordered twice, and twice AMAZON sent me the wrong item...

In some cases thiscauses an area that was somewhat dimly lit in the original to become just plain black. This can be a problemfor indoor home-movie style video.

They are just glued to the belt and have no backing. From a distance they look ok, but up close they have the appearance of a rubber blob. This also ruled out any attempt to change the color to anything but cream. I don't think any die or paint would stick to these. The holster is similar.

Padme's belt is meant to be slung around the hips, so there is absolutely *no* chance it would fit an adult properly.It does, however, fit my 5 year old perfectly. Even then, it is incredibly poorly made. The holster is *barely* glued on and the materials are pretty cheap. The velcro is very weak and the belt comes undone easily.

All you get is a red plastic visor with 2 little lightbulbs. In fact, you see better at night without the goggles than with that green plastic covering your face. Our older child's vision was in fact impaired to the degree that he actually hit a tree while having this on - he's okay but we did have a little scare at the time.Oh, and one other thing - it's quite difficult for children to keep the visor on their face.

However, the shallow characters and hollow dialogue robbed the plot of its depth. With the dark themes and cold brutality of many of the characters, it was probably a good thing that they weren't developed further. At least when (almost) all the characters die, I didn't really know them enough to care. The ending was a bloodbath that didn't resolve many of the open ends of the plot. I assume that in the next book, more of the ends will be tied up, but I don't care enough about the story or the characters to read it. As a work of literature, the book is consistent with its title - Hope's End. As a story, it falls apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gruesome and unrewarding","review":"...The book has a number of problems in my view. The characters are 2-dimensional and the dialogue is stiff.

The level of bloodshed is stunning and could only appear reasonable if you spend most of your time playing action computer games. Others have praised the book for its ideas. I was not impressed with the author's creativity--William Blake as dictator for life is all well and good, but I did not find it convincing and Pol Pot's ideas are not uplifting.

I found Mr. Igoe to be an articulate and likable instructor that conveys a passion for playing.Unfortunately there is a lot to hate about the way it was produced. The editing is incredibly annoying. While he is talking to you they pace edits about every 30 seconds, they use orthogonal angles, constant zooms, black and white shots, aged film effects etc. All that does is serve to annoy and distract you from what is being said.

I don't think CvD quite gets into this music like many others, though. The playing is faultless and the recording wide-ranging BUT it is not as clear and detailed as it could have been. It was like listening to music through a fog, with the high frequencies typically veiled in the usual Telarc manner. Musically, I'm not too fond of the way he does the famous first movement melody. The 5/4 and March-like Scherzo movements come of the best here. The Scherzo's tempo is grand and bold rather than lightening fast like many others, which is OK. One can wallow in the bass drum parts. The finale is missing the necessary neuroses.The filler, the Polonaise from Eugene Onegin, is a peculiar, if not inappropriate, choice.

All in all, an album filled with ABBA curiousities that is definitely a must have for a die-hard ABBA fan or for someone who's into campy 70s pop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first album is not bad","review":"The album was never origianlly released in the U.S. The only difference from the original release is that the title track was available twice on the vinyl. First track in swedish, last track in english. Even though a bit silly some times, it is excellent commercial 70's music. But for somebody starting to listen to ABBA I would start with a later CD like \\"Super Trouper\\" or \\"Arrival\\". With this as their first album together, it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABBA in the Beginning","review":"If you love ABBA for ballads like \\"Name of the Game\\" or \\"Knowing Me Knowing You\\" or Pop gems like \\"Take a Chance On Me\\" DONT buy this CD - you will be shocked at how dull ABBA was in the beginning before they hit Eurovision gold with \\"Waterloo\\".Sometimes they sound like a bad Hootenanny act. Many of thier early recordings are folk-based. The melodies are great, but the lyrics are just terrible and amaturish. I reccomend searching for a used copy of the original 1976 \\"Greatest Hits\\" LP or the CD that was issued in the late 80's by Atlantic. It featured the best tracks from this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abba, Before the Rise","review":"\\"Ring Ring\\" is the first album that Abba ever recorded, and it shows an band that was just beginning to figure out how to write great pop songs. There are a couple of hits and a whole lot of misses included. The title track was their first hit single, and it started them on their meteoric rise to becoming one of the biggest bands in the world during the 1970s. The second song is \\"Another Town, Another Train,\\" which is nearly as good as \\"Ring Ring,\\" though not nearly as popular. From there, things are pretty mediocre. The typical Abba formula of great hooks and simple melodies is largely absent. Moreover, Benny and Bjorn (the male members) are the featured lead vocalists on about half of the tracks. As the band hit its stride later on, B&B (wisely) retreated to the vocal background and let Angelica and Anna strut their stuff.Overall, this is easily the worst of Abba's original albums. The band recorded plecnty of exellent music, but little of it is featured here."},{"rating":"1","title":"not too happy","review":"This toy we thought would be fun, It turned into a nightmare because the pieces when putting together would break.

Most will not be going into management but they do need to know how a manager will think, because each of them will have to deal with a manager very soon. I think this book conveys the material as well as any. Not to fluffy not too in-depth.Covers the usual \\"five functions of management\\" ( staffing, directing, controlling, planning, organizing) and adds chapter four on the topic of decision-making as well. aslo include a description of bureaucratic imperialism, which in my view is a key concept for those seeking a deeper level of ability to predict organizational behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"not effective fan","review":"This item does not work at all, for me a waste of money. it needs more enginering because where I play humidity is 40 to 60% average.

I've upgraded my Proto mask with a thermal lens only to find it is not 100% effective. With some sprinting and heavy panting, the lens fogs over. I wanted to try my luck at adding this turbine fan. The Product description states \\"With 2-speed operation, you'll never have to lose your focus again\\". This turbine does NOT come with 2 speeds, unless you consider off as a speed. And lose focus? Have you heard the thing? Probably not if you are looking here to buy. It needs some vibration dampening, since there is no variable speed, the motor runs at a high RPM and runs loud. Maybe I was unlucky and got a fan where the motor doesn't seat properly in the plastic housing, I don't know. I haven't yet had the pleasure of using this fan yet, I intend to this weekend.

What he fails to consider is that times have evolved and more scientific research is out there proving the naturality of homosexuality inherent in the Creator's natural work. As a rationalist and a believer I do not blindly follow what is written in the bible without actually looking and expereiencing what is truly out there- that Homosexual people are not aberrations or deviations from the natural order but are merely natural variatons of God's diverse created order. Those who want to believe deeply in their hearts the concept of \\"evil homosexual people\\" are those who fail to comprehend the most basic message of Christ's Gospel- unconditional love, acceptance and inclusion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best work published on the subject","review":"I have read widely on both sides of this debate and I can confidently and unequivocally say that Gagnon's work is the most extensive and thoroughly researched work in print. I believe that it is the definitive work on the subject of homosexuality and the Bible. This book should be on every pastor's bookshelf. Additionally, for anyone looking into the debate of homosexuality and the bible, one cannot ignore Gagnon's work.

When I saw this cornbread I just had to try it. The jalapeno flavor was almost non-existent, the bread a greyish color that baked very dense and heavy. Not like your run-of-the-mill cornbread, even those made gluten free or wheat based. This was a big disappointment but I gave it a 2nd try because the first time I used oil. The second try I used butter, but achieved the same results. Because I figured it was Hodgson's and it would be great, I ordered a case of 6 boxes. Four of them are now in a carton in the cellar awaiting a trip to the local Survival Center/Soup Kitchen. I just did not like the flavor, texture, appearance or indescribable after-taste. I am hoping that whomever tries the ones I am donating likes it."},{"rating":"1","title":"so sad about this one","review":"We loved the Hodgson Mill 9 grain and honey wheat breads but I hope I just got a bad box in the case of the Jalapeno Cornbread I ordered. There is so much baking powder and/or soda in this mix that it tastes like soap. No Jalapeno flavor. I'm going to add a can of corn, some mild cheddar and some jalapenos to the next box I open and hope that it improves; no one ate more than one bite of the first box I baked. I just can't justify giving more than one star to a mix you have to remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, Very Tasty","review":"I agree with others who say that the jalapeno flavor is not as strong as I would have liked but that's not a big deal to me, I hit most things with hot sauce anyway.

It was kind of hard to get into. The complications in the book were very unusual. It was also kind of jumpy. If you choose to read this book, you better have a very open mind and be able to understand what it is like to have a child. It tells a lot about the troubles and frustrations of not being able to have a kid. If I had a choice, I probably would not have finished this book. I like to read books that move faster than this one did. It gets slow in the middle, and the complications seem to be similar. This is not a book for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thriller with Hidden Agenda","review":"While The Clinic follows the pattern of many medical thrillers, patient seeking extraordinary help becomes trapped in villain's unethical experiment/treatment, Langello's focus seems to push a hidden agenda. I found the main character to be somewhat one dimensional and was deeply disturbed by what I perceived to be a strongly \\"pro-life\\" bias. The heroine seems to be being portrayed as deserving her current state of infertility as punishment for an abortion that she underwent years earlier. I felt that one reason she never came to life was due to the dislike that Langello had for her because of her earlier decision. The action was well done, but the characters were generally unsympathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, but.......","review":"I just finished this book and I am so mad about the ending!

It was one of the most gripping medical thrillers I have ever read. However, I absolutely hated the ending. I could not wait to find out what happens to the clinic, and what happens to Laura's baby but I was totally let down. The reason is: the author chooses not to tell you the answers.

It was simplified and, like another reviewer mentioned, all over the place. My professor did admit that it wasn't the best book out there for biopharmaceutics, but it was decent. It's simplified, so it will probably help you get started with your studies. You do want supplemental reading though if your professor isn't that great.

It is very easy for many to develop an us versus them mentally for those of us in the Christian faith. I found it refreshing to know a few things about them to pray specifically and also think of those listed more as people than their public persona. A book like this will become outdated very easily.

I used to play it again and again for some years, untill I found it unfear and returned back this vinyl to my auncle. The very sad end of this vinyl was that uncle's children put the hot tea-pot on it!!!!But anyway now I am grown up and own all ABBA original albums in CD and some cimpilation CD.

When Arrival hit the States in 1977, I was proud to see them turning up on juke boxes in places like the Pizza Hutt in Lebanon, Tennessee. Dancing Queen was the big hit, a song in which a young girl gets out for some innocent fun. ABBA was at the root of the disco-mania of the 1970s even if this fact is not generally recognized in America. Besides being the biggest act western Europe has ever seen, their music penetrated and had a liberalizing effect on the countries of the Soviet bloc. ABBA music is here to stay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Encountering an old friend","review":"There have been some exquisite works for large orchestra and chorus composed in the last century, works that compare favorably with the great requiems and oratorios of the past. Evidence: Britten's 'War Requiem', Adams' \\"Harmonium\\", Gorecki's Symphony #2, Lauridsen's 'Lux Aeternam'. Not the least among these is the breathtakingly beautiful Hindemith WHEN LILACS LAST IN DOORYARD BLOOM'D based on the poetry of Walt Whitman. This massive yet gentle work is given a definitive performance by Robert Shaw and his Atlanta forces with the incomparable Jan de Gaetani and the fine William Stone bringing all the lonely haunting beauty to Hindemith's score. It is with a bit of sadness to remember that both Shaw and de Gaetani are no longer with us, but that adds to the power of this elegant requiem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My wife gave me a Rolex, and I swapped it for this watch because I wanted an alarm and electronic features.

There are a couple of vile persons, believable enough for you to feel sorry for their near and dear ones; and several truly engaging others for whom you will feel pity and desperate hope.

Jimi, unfortunately, was caught on tape saying something..who knows what.. but his guitar was the message. There are snippets of electric guitar phrasing and technique here that are unrivalled anywhere by anyone in the last 50 years. Apart from classic guitar interpretation of the classics, Jimi translates magic through the stratocaster, which tingles the spine, and is virtually unreplicable.

This movie is really weird alot of it makes no sense. Latter on in the movie you see Hendrix interview about his life which it sounds like he is acting. At the end Jimi Hendrix comes on stage with Mitch Mitchell and Billy Cox to perform Foxy Lady, New Rising Sun(Hey Baby), and In From The Storm also Red House. On this DVD they just give you short clips of the Hendrix concert its really too bad because the rainbow bridge concert was lost. If your a Hendrix fan then dont waste your time on this crazy DVD. Like I said it has nothing to do with Hendrix. Im sorry if there are no voting buttons but I dont know how to make them. ENJOY!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT!","review":"Even the most fanatical Hendrix fan will recoil in horror soon into this film. The deceptive packaging makes it appear to be a concert film... highlighting pics of live footage not from the movie, listing songs which appear only as background tunes and the final insult... the DVD sound mix is a horrible mono wash of low fi. The relatively brief footage of live Hendrix does have some bright spots, but they are overshadowed by cuts to a movie scripted audience no one would care to see.

And none of these performances have been released in their entire. So don't be fooled by the line 125-minute, uncut performance. The sad truth is that only 30 minutes of the film features Hendrix performing. The other 95 minutes are boring hippie rubish wich no one wants to see. Worst thing is how, the way to short, Hendrix performance is compiled (people who own the live CD of the performance will know what I mean)Hear my train are coming, Vodoo Child and Purpel Haze are cut into a medly! . My advice don't buy this, buy the new released DVD-Hendrix Live at the Filmore East (available at Amazon) or see if you can get Jimi Plays Berkeley (unfortunately not available at the time)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great LOUD music, softly narrated","review":"Although the dynamics are impressive on this CD, I am constantly adjusting the volume to accommodate my toddler. The volume range of the instruments varies from soft to VERY VERY LOUD. The narrator tells a very amusing version of Peter and the Wolf, in that the Wolf gets taken to the Zoo. However, he has a very soft voice, so I constantly have to turn the volume up to hear his voice and then down so that the music is not overwhelming.

I used the rocks around the pond to hold down the net. We had some tent stakes, but we thought the rocks worked better, with less chance of tearing the net.I haven't had it very long, so I'm not sure if we'll be able to use the leaf blower to blow theleaves off the net, I'm hoping we will. If not, it should be easy to remove the net, shake it off and put it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"pond netting","review":"The product itself was decent. The netting I received did not fit the dimension as advertised, the dimension was very awkward (I can't describe its shape, it is like someone just cut itout without measuring).

Have a koi pond with lots of sharp rocks, and it's held up rather well. Will probably get this year and next out of it before it needs replacement - the rocks do take a toll, but it looks like it'll survive the winter and next season at least. I have to move the net out of the way rather frequently (daily in the summer) to clean the filters in my pond and the constant moving of the rocks on the net has caused it to break in a few places. Would get 5 starts if it held up a little bit better to that - but it's held up well enough that when it is past its useful life, I'll probably order another just like it.The herons sit on top of my fence and look down into the pond confused and have not attempted a fly-by since this was installed. Very good for that purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Multiple uses","review":"I strung this about 6' above my flower bed (between a porch and a fence) to keep the balls, frisbees and other 'accidentally' tossed items out of the flowers.

Based on a wonderful story by the master M.R.James. The plot itself is absoutely perfect, although the movie itself shows a low production budget (such as the hero fighting an obvious stuffed panther). In spite of that, the direction is fantastic. Whether or not the Demon should have been shown is a controversy, but I think it's better that it was even if it looks hokey."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best \\"classic\\" supernatural thrillers.","review":"With the possible exception of \\"The Haunting,\\" this is one of the finest supernatural films I've seen.

Made in England during the fifties it shows what you can do with the genre. Yeah, so what, they show the demon at the beginning of the film. It still beats today's slasher films with intelligence and wit. I watched it during a windy thunderstorm, the wind outside matched the Halloween Party scene in the movie as I watched. I seldom get the goose-bumps watching a movie on television, but I got them that night. Pretty good for a movie neary sixty years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"If they'd only gotten rid of the big rubber demon!","review":"This is one heck of a stylish, well-paced thriller. The story centers on a character loosely based on Aliester Crowley, a well-known thaumaturgist and devil-cult guru. To rebuff investigations into his legitimacy, he unleashes an ancient demonic curse as proof of his arcane powers.One is immediately struck by the startlingly effective cinematography--the pristine black and white textures, the gloom-filled night scenes, the sumptuous tones. The acting is remarkably natural for a piece from the 1950's, and the story is taught, well-crafted, and thoroughly engaging.I'm told that the studio insisted on having a \\"real\\" demon for the audience to see. What a shame. Without the rubbery, stiff-fingered demon, this film would have easily earned five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great 50's flick!","review":"like the blob, most 50's movies are corny and sci-fi-ish, this one is different! this actualy gave me the creeps, the demon is creepier than the movie it self!.

The story takes precedence over the implied gore, and the last scene is indeed intense. This is what is really lacking in many of todays movies, which tend to rely on technology. The writers actually understand the danger hidden in the old grimories, and Karswell states to his mother that his wealth is directly related to feeding the demon. And he is unable to control the power, which is the message of the movie. Good triumphes as the evil implodes. It is similar the to Manchurian Candidate in one respect, that the real story is in the innocuous details. This movie is well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Amazon for featuring one of the best.","review":"One of the best \\"creature features\\" ever made ranking up there with The Thing (1950). The Brits know how to make the black and white spook films like X The Unknown. The black and white is crisp but moody, the scary sounds crawl up your spine announcing the strange appearance of THE DEMON. And Dana Andrews' low skeptic dialogue is in great contrast to what's really out there! Thanks Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is What I call a Good Scare","review":"I have this film on tape and was espcially tickled to get it in DVD that included both the American and British versions of the film. There is nothing like a cold rainy night and bowl of popcorn and this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC of the HORROR genre","review":"Yep, this classic film is indeed worthy of all these posted positive reviews. However, regarding the much talked about matter of the actual demon's appearance, I will say this: The opening long-shot is chillingly effective but I feel that the closeup possibly should have been saved for the climactic scene only (regardless of the eventual advertising artwork). Terrific film - you can easily see where it has influenced so many great works that have followed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Suspense/Horror","review":"One of the most solid horror flicks, which walks the line of \\"is the Demon real, or just mind games?\\" quite well. The UK cut (Night of the Demon) is longer and superior, but it's nice to have both versions on this disk to compare and contrast. Solid performances make this a classic film that any horror fan who cares more about suspense than blood should enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent and Suspenseful; Terrific DVD Transfer","review":"Jacques Tourneur has a well-established reputation for his association with Val Lewton. After a mild hiatus, he's back with all of his vision and genius intact. Well-written and presented with moody, crisp cinematography, this DVD transfer is quite fine, a worthy addition to any horror film library. The demon itself might be a little cheesy, but it's a small issue amidst the other creative forces. This is a pioneering effort in the realm of demons and devil cults, and as such it stands up well to subsequent films, including \\"Rosemary's Baby\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\". I won't blab away the story. Most impressive, and highly recommended. Turn off the lights and enjoy the chills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curse of the Demon/Night of the Demon","review":"Got both, but only needed one, Curse of the Demon.

Very well done - a spooky, fun and scary masterpiece of atmospheric film-making by the master of the craft - plus I really dig that Demon! The movie is old so don't look for CG stuff, but they really don't make 'em like this anymore and I wish they did!I understand director Jacques Tournier was coerced by the studio into putting an actual monster into the movie - so, boo, I guess... but the truth is I'm glad it happened! I consider his towering puppet-monster to be one of the great creatures from any cinema age - elegantly designed, beautifully filmed and seamlessly integrated into the lurking, shadowy atmosphere that propels the rest of the film. Actually, the sort of waggling, gently flopping quality of the rubber giant only adds to it's terrible splendor. Tournier's magnificent Demon has what can only be called REAL CLASS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAYBE IT'S BEST NOT TO KNOW","review":"It even frightens the cynical. Dr. Holden doesn't believe until he almost crosses the line. Maybe it's best not to know, which, thankfully, doesn't invite a sequel. The demon invisible was more horrifying than the demon visible.

I removed the \\"Thank you\\" tags and replaced them with a more personal hang tag, and it was perfect. Nothing too expensive, simple, and went well with the overall flora of our wedding - which were also calla lilies and white roses.If you have the budget to buy much more expensive giveaways, do so.

So it will say, for instance, \\"look at the underlined word(s)\\" to determine whether a sentence is correct or incorrect.And then will include in the answer sheet, words that are not underlined. For instance \\"will [u]you[/u] see the vet again? is marked as inaccurate by them b/c \\"will\\" is not capitalized, but it's not underlined, so how would a child know they are supposed to include that, given they have been told to only look at the underlined words?I think it's poorly executed and would look for a different workbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasure To Read!","review":"Waldman has no equal when it comes to writing a novel of love, of hope, of life.

The picture above is accurate, unlike previous reviewers have mentioned.- The sound quality is alright, definitely not the best. It seems like there is no bass in the headphones.Cons:- The cord is really short. It's about 3 and 1/2 feet long. It's way too short for me to workout with. The belt loop clip is located halfway down the cord, which only gives you 1 and 1/2 feet from your belt to your ears to reach the cord.

All I got out of it was some indication that higher-impedence headphones probably would help me, but these particular headphones are so bad that I'm better off tolerating the hiss with my original earbuds.The sound with ReTraks is horrible, it feels like you are sitting in a metal oil drum. Also, there are no markings on the buds to tell you which channel is which. Finally the retraction mechanism is badly designed, snarls easily (it can take you an hour or two to figure out how to unsnarl if the cord jumps the internal track), and doesn't have many convenient ratchet points for holding a comfortable listening position."},{"rating":"1","title":"Single Camera video production","review":"The real lack with this text is simply that it was printed in 1982 and technology has moved on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rechargeable Battery?","review":"I couldn't find a lower star than 1 so I had to give it a one.Tried charging it up a few times but couldn't get more than 1/2 hour playback time.

It eliminates all the cramping and discomfort I suffered through trying to play games like Monster Hunter and Dissidia: Final Fantasy, which require high levels of dexterity. In my opinion, this grip is the best, lowest priced, lowest maintenance PSP grip on the market.The advertised \\"6-hour rechargeable battery\\" function is pretty much non-existent though. I don't notice that it extends my PSP's battery life at all. But I bought this knowing the battery was next to useless anyhow.

Too bad the 'rechargeable' part is a total lie. I hope I can get my money back. Save yours for something better. I just got this and could not have been more disappointed. If someone figures out how to charge it, can you tell me?EDIT: I found the charger input. It's not in the directions, nor is it marked, but it's there on the side.

Japanese is better.]).You get what you pay for with this; from the mellow songs played when Anju makes an appearance to the more upbeat and silly tunes when Karin is doing something silly......also for a new copy there is a lovely little cardboard cutout picture like that of the cover, but on a light blue background."},{"rating":"1","title":"shipping sucks","review":"I tried twice to receive this item - both times - the item arrived broken and I had to send it back.

Blessed be!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FULL OF GREAT SPELLS","review":"Great book full of easy spells. Very cheap price to pay. There's a spell for everyone: love, money, job success. Nothing evil.You won't be disappointed with this book. I wasted a lot of money on other books before I found this one. It has a good variety of spells you might be looking for.Some spells require few ingredients, others require a bit more, but all are easy to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a social history, but it's a wonderful book nonetheless","review":"Roy Porter's book covers the full breadth of London history, from Roman times to approximately 1990, with the Victoria era and the post-WWII era receiving particularly heavy emphasis. A more accurate title for the book would be 'London: A History,' because the social history component is a bit thin. Porter devotes more attention to the evolving political situation and to physical characteristics (streets, fortifications, famous buildings) than he does to social history.This is a wonderful introduction to London, and would be ideal for the visitor seeking a deeper appreciation of (what I regard as) the world's most fascinating city. One quibble: Porter should have been more self-restrained about his visceral hatred of Margaret Thatcher. Porter's rants about her are so over-the-top that he even blames her for the excesses of left-wing political correctness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be even better!","review":"More illustrations and above all more plentiful and better maps would have made Porter's superlative history of London an unqualified masterpiece. As such, it is still a bloody good book. The late Roy Porter was not only a brilliant historian, above all of the 18th century for which his enthusiasm is nearly overwhelming, but a writer of verve and wit far removed from much desiccated academism. It would be a fitting tribute for Harvard to bring out an expanded edition awash with bells and whistles. Let's hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book has everything...","review":"I actually bought this book at small gift shop for my first child, and I am so pleased to find it here for my second child. This book has pockets for extra keepsakes and a clear velum envelope for baby's first hair cut! There are plenty of spaces for pictures and lots of places to put information as your baby grows. What I like best about this baby book is the month-by-month record of the first year. There is a page for each month to place a picture of baby and write down a few notes of that particular month. There is also a page dedicated to the foot and hand prints, which our hospital was happy to complete for us. Finally, the baby book is kept securely closed with an elastic band to keep keepsakes snug. I would recommend this baby book to everyone that does not scrap book and just wants a safe place to store all those wonderful early memories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING !","review":"Despite the title, this book contains only ONE colour plate, and hardly any visual graphics depicting scenic techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid information, but geared to book authors","review":"As a firm believer in truth in marketing, I had mixed feelings about this book. The information it contains is excellent and helpful for authors looking to promote a book, but at the bottom of the front cover it says: \\"A step-by-step guide to promoting anything from books to businesses.\\" Sorry, that's not accurate. 75% of the book has to do with book promotion only. If you've got another kind of business, choose another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for general knowlegde of the A5M","review":"I bought this book to get a better understanding of the A5M Claude. I have read a few books on the A6M Zero and it had built up my curiosity around Mitsubishi's previous plane, the A5M.The book is great for reference material, lots of diagrams, pictures and operational data.

To teach little gils that this is the kind of man she should be looking for? A gang member wannabe? This doll is not appropriate for any girl to play with. If you are looking for any doll to set at least a decent example of how guys should behave, go get a Ken doll!I know, girls everywhere are probably playing with this doll as I speak, but why encourage them?

When I received, the entire top of the box was torn. It was almost like it was old and was falling apart. Nothing was taped shut.

I also use this for our little puppy. it's great for keeping her contained but still giving her freedom while she is being house broken. if you have more than 2 ferrets, I would recommend getting the larger pen. this one is good for one or two but anymore and it would be crowded. overall, it's a great product and shipped fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"the only thing that could be better about this is it could be bigger! but in all seriousness this is a great product. its not tooo heavy and only takes about 10 - 15 seconds to set it up. its definately tall enough so your ferrets cant get out. i might eventually buy another so i can connect the 2 together and have a huge playpen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sturdy flexible cage","review":"Sturdy and flexible...does whta it looks like it does.

My huge hamster and my smaller rats can squeeze through the bars really fast. My larger rat can climb up to the top and then climb down to get out.

I originally planned on getting a tandem (front-to-back) stroller, but when I test-drove it at the store it felt like a huge, long, heavy and clumsy tank (and that's without the kids in it!) There is no way I'd be able to maneuver the tandem stroller on the busy city streets.Then I tried this Aria Twin Side-By-Side stroller, and it felt so much better then the tandem - it was so light and easy to maneuver. So I purchased it, and I really like it.It says that the stroller is from 6-month-old and up, but I successfully use it with a newborn - the seat reclines almost fully, and the newborn lays in it and sleeps.This stroller fits through all standard doors and most supermarket isles. The basket is large and fits a lot of stuff. Walking in the city with my 2-year-old and newborn is pretty easy with this stroller.The only major downside of this stroller is that it doesn't hold a car seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you're looking for a small and compact case for your PSP, keep looking. The fit on this case is so tight that when you try to place the PSP inside, the aluminum edges will cut into the sides of the PSP and either severely scratch it or chip some of the plastic off.

DON'T GET THIS CASE, IT WILL SCRATH YOUR PSP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthy sequel for Hyperion","review":"The two first books were, in my opinion, masterpieces. This third book of the serie is, at best, an entertaining adventure. Gone are the well depicted, complex, credible characters, the historical fresque, the surprising inventions and descriptions that serve as the background for the plot.Three somewhat tame characters will undertake a journey through wich they meet different friends and foes. The action is somewhat entertaining but linear, the plot is unoriginal,the vilains unconvincing, the stereotypes abundant, the surprises nonexistent. The worst part of Endymion, however, is that you are led to read the fourth and last opus of the serie: The rise of Endymion wich is one of the worst piece of litterature I have read since I learned to.So read the Hyperion suite and stop there. The Endymion suite is NOT even remotely as good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion are both truly excellent books...indisputably classics of the genre. That being said, I cannot overstress my disappointment in the Endymion books. Simmons' weak, formulaic plotting and 2-dimensional characters showed me that he was just going through the motions on Endymion and Rise of Endymion. The tense, gothic quality which made the first 2 books so fresh and unique is completely absent. It is a mystery to me that the average review for this book is so high. There are some interesting concepts and Mr Simmons shows the occasional flash of his talent here and there, but I honestly wish I had stopped reading this series after the second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun adventure!!","review":"I am glad to see that there have been more positive reviews of this book. When I finished Fall of Hyperion and I looked for this book, the reviews were very negative.Personally, I liked the book a lot. It was a great adventure where your followed two distinct parties through a cat-and-mouse chase. Simmons' world of Hyperion is great, and he has not let us down in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Bummer","review":"I really loved the first two books, and pre-ordered this for my Kindle.. just arrived and I'm nearly done with it. Mostly because I can't stand reading the bulk of it and skim page after page of boring junk. This book totally lacks the great ideas that the first two had... ideas that always made you wonder, and look forward to how they unfold. ENDYMION not only lacks big ideas, it lacks any sense of suspense... u always either know whats going to happen, or what actually does happen leaves you thinking \\"well, that certainly was stupid\\".Skip this book...its junk filler from an author that can do great things, but seems to have pumped out a sequel to to cash in on prior excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the prequels","review":"I don't know why anyone who read the Hyperion series would be disappointed by either Endymion or The Fall of Endymion. While I felt the Hyperion series was the best hard science-fiction I have read since Foundation, Endymion upped the ante considerably with absolutely cannot-put-it-this-book-down plot hooks. The Archangel class ships are simply chilling, and Simmons is one of the best at making the science readable. The character development is stunning in both the carryovers from Hyperion and the newly introduced characters. Simmons is a musn't miss for anyone interested in a riveting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Hyperion","review":"Man. I read this and Rise of Endymion, assuming that the pair made a complete work, like the Hyperion pair... but I was wrong. These two books were not very good. These two felt forced, whereas the Hyperion books felt inspired. --You will probably not enjoy these two books as much as you did enjoy the Hyperion books. Sorry. I wanted to like them, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to Hyperion Standards","review":"I believe the first two books in this series to be among the best works of scifi ever written. In Hyperion, not only does the author createpaint a facinating vision of a new world, but also gives us characters whom we feel for deeply, all in a story filled with intrigue and excitiment. Lastly, the first two books are written in beautiful prose.Saddly, this work is not up to snuff. While it ties up many of the loose ends left at the end of the first books, it never grabs the reader in the same way. Nor does it create the same type of compeling world. If you loved Hyperion and had questions at the end that you wanted answered, than I suggest you read this. Just don't expect to spend weeks thinking about it like you did after reading Hyperion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor follow-up to great Science Fiction book","review":"Perhaps this book would have been much better if it didn't suffer so much by comparison to _Hyperion_/_The Fall of Hyperion_. Like the two previous books this actually tells one story when combined with its sequal, _The Rise of Endymion_. Rather than expand on the ideas in that book, Simmons goes off in a new direction contradicting the previous books and giving us a story far less compelling.Don't expect the questions remaining at the end of The Fall of Hyperion to be answered. Simmons wisely leaves the mysteries of the first book intact, but this new adventure is one long and frequently boring chase scene. The Catholic church's use of the crucifixes from _Hyperion_ is an interesting development, and Simmons' writing style is still good. But ultimately there just isn't much here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing","review":"The two most interesting aspects of Hyperion and the Fall of Hyperion- the time tombs and the Shrike are hardly mentioned. Simmons instead seems to be hung up on a commentary on the Catholic church. There is none is the insight of the previous books. I thought every character was flat, except possibly de Soya. Read only if you like the first two (who DIDN'T?) and want two read the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful extension of the universe of _Hyperion_","review":"I enjoyed _Endymion_ -- even more than _Hyperion_ -- in partbecause I was prepared for Simmons' approach of telling astory that takes two novels to complete, but mainly becausehe truly succeeds in making _Endymion_ a satisfying novelin its own right. Yes, it's an adventure story, and yes, inits way, it's a sequel. But I can't think of anyone who'sread _Hyperion_ not getting a chilly shiver at the firstrevelation of the \\"new\\" use of the cruciform; and, while thepolitical scene is not nearly as complex as _Hyperion_, thetantalizing hints of conspiracy help to make up for it. I'malready anxious for the release of _The Rise of Endymion_,and I strongly recommend any of the (thus far) three bookscovering the Hyperion universe to any sci-fi fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was a disappointment after Hyperion and The Fall of Hyperion. It started off okay, but then turned into a never-ending series of scenes where bad guys chase good guys from one planet to the next. Not much else ever happened. I felt like the author just wanted to show off the different worlds that he created. There were none of the complications to the plot that I had seen in the Hyperion books. The prophecy aspect of the story also didn't work for me. Aenea knows of some things that will happen, is fuzzy on others, but then, inconveniently enough, doesn't know what will happen on the planet of God's Grove. The logic of her foreknowledge was inconsistent and annoyed me. The characters were okay, but I also thought it odd that the real antagonist didn't appear until very close to the end. I listened to this as an audiobook and I had an interruption in my listening due to device difficulties, but even trying to take that into account, this book really didn't work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The low point of a brilliant series","review":"What a mess. The first two books told a great, and complete, story. To begin this one, however, is to open a new can of worms, and invest yourself in a new set of characters -- with only a few attachments to the ones you already grew to know.That's fine -- lord knows the Dune series batted me around for a few thousand years before letting it end. But this book is little more than a chase. Two ships, chasing each other. Two VERY SLOW SHIPS chasing each other. It's like watching glaciers play tag. And, in the end, all its done is set you up for book number four.This all comes with a caveat.... the fourth book is fabulous. So -- if you want to read the fourth book, which I encourage, you'll want to swallow this one beforehand, just for the plot details, or you'll be well lost. It's quite a penalty, really... but, I swear, the last book will make it worthwhile. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack!","review":"Simmons really dropped the ball on this one, and its follow up as well. Do yourself a huge favor and consider this series to be 2 books long and forget about Endymion and Rise of Endymion. More apt titles would have been The Dying Earth, parts 3 and 4...ha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I am shocked that the reviews I have read of this book rate it inferior to the Hyperion novels. I LOVED this book. It is a thoroughly engrossing novel and I couldn't put it down. A masterpiece of science fiction ranking right up there with the first books in both the Dune and Foundation series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endymion: The Hyperion world gets bigger","review":"Dan Simmons creates a new cast of characters and a new era of the human race in order to continue his Hyperion Saga. Once again his work is colorful, active, and filled with complex meanings.Because of the frequent references to events, places, and people from the previous books, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone not familiar with the Hyperion books, even though they are not really a trilogy.Just as in Hyperion, he has ended the first book right where it gets interesting, guarenteeing that his next book (Rise of Endymion) will sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty and useless...","review":"Ok, Dan Simmons is a good writer. Ok, he's got good ideas. But while reading this book, I couldn't help thinking that he's been stretching the strory he started in his first 2 excellent books far too much. The flow and pace are still mastered by Simmons, but this time there is no scenario whatsoever supporting his writing skills. We're driven from action scene to action scene in a boring stream of kitsch exotic postcards and boring dialogs. Even the Dreadful Inquisitors sound stupid and fake in Simmons's hand. Not to mention the shallowness of his main caracters... Even Rambo has more layers to his personality than poor Raul Endymion!A big deception is garanteed for those who loved Hyperion. So don't forget to put this volume in your \\"Index of Prohibited Books\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A serious letdown","review":"Simmons is a very good writer and the writing in this book is fairly good, but it definitely seems a step down from the Hyperion books. It could have used some more editing. It just seemed sloppy.The writing style, however, is the best part of the book. The characters seem rather flat and the plot is contrived. I would almost guess the Mr.Simmons was making it up as he went along. There's a lot of Deus-ex-Machina save-us-in-the-nick-of-time stuff, without a lot of explanation. This is the stuff of bad action movies. There is even a 'super-shrike' now that the shrike is apparently a good guy(kind of like the Terminator movies). I loved Hyperion and Fall of Hyperion is one of my favorite s-f books, but this was so bad I didn't even read the next one. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting from the very first page","review":"This book gripped me from the very first page, and it's no disappointment right up to the end. Plenty of action. It's not as bizarre as the earlier Hyperion books, but is more of an adventure/chase story."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pro written book without tru energy or vision","review":"I quite much liked the Hyperion story, but this book was a dissapointment. The main characters do not have much to offer, and as the plot starts to jump between plantes the novel turns into a clever adventure story. It is kind of all there, but it is not really interesting. You have heard it all before. I find the imagination easy going and in a way boring, and do not find the book comming true as a sf-vision in any way as the Hyperion story did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diminishing returns from a great series","review":"I waited a long time to read this sequel and was hugely disappointed by it.

There is a new heroine (future saviour Aenea), some new enemies and a few good friends (including faithful android A. Bettik and the Consul's resourceful spaceship.) What Endymion lacks in sophistication, it compensates for with some beautifully imagined planets and its sections that deal with the Pax, a tyrannical new star empire. Even though it is weaker than the other novels, this is still quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Advanced GMAT Preparation material.","review":"If you want a serious preparation, this book is the best in the market. I suggest you buy the Kaplan premier program first, do the practice tests and then feel the need for some advanced material and then look out for this one.The key is, after going through the initial preparation material say, Kaplan's Premier program for around 2/3 weeks, you will feel that something more is required to take you towards the advanced stage that can give you a boost, an edge, some extra climb in the GMAT score. Then comes this book. It requires 2 weeks of rigorous preparation time. The verbal section of this book (more so for Critical Reasoning and Sentence Correction) is simply superb.However, do not forget that the last 2 weeks of your preparation should be solely focussed with the OG and other OG supplements (e.g. Verbal OG etc).If I would not have had this book, my score would have been 20-40 points lower than my actual 700."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the \\"Holy Grail: that everyone claims it to be","review":"Apart from the brilliant name, there is nothing else in the book that's in the top leagues.This book has a lot of errors in the verbal section (trust me, I know what I'm talking about; I had a V51).

Our 3-year-old didn't like it at all. It is poorly designed. The rear wheels when in the trike position wobble around and make it very hard to peddle. We believe this is because the rear axle does not extend through the entire wheel shaft when in the trike position. Our 4 year old who peddles very well on other bikes and trikes could not ride it either. It was very frustrating as this was an item we were hoping would allow our 3 year old to ride around with his older brothers. We will be returning this item in order to get another ride on toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this cheaply made trike","review":"The wheels are made of a hard plastic that does not grip any surface, the body is made of a thin plastic that will surely break in no time, and the pedals have such a small turning circumference that spinning the pedals a bunch of times still isn't enough to get you anywhere.This was very frustrating for our 3-year old, and us, and will be returned ASAP. Save your money and DON'T BUY THIS!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Pedal","review":"Bought this for my son's second birthday. This looked liked a great bike from the box and description, but once it was put together it was too hard to pedal. Took it to a kids birthday party and even 7 years olds were having a hard time with it. We took it back and bought a classic radio flyer which turned out to be perfect. Be aware when purchaing this bike. Looks nice performs poorly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy NYC Mom","review":"I bought this bike thinking it would be a good starter for my toddler daughter to learn how to ride. It is simply to put up, but it is difficult for her to push the pedals. I was not happy with this merchandise. I think for my daughter to learn I will get the bike that I push with the handle and when she gets the hang off it take the handle off so she can do it on her own. I say to look around before you purchase this bike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't buy it again","review":"The pedals only turn one of the back wheels which actually make this fairly hard to pedal and the plastic wheels just spin on most surfaces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily tips over","review":"My 2 year old is rather short. Right away I knew this bike was way too big for her. It took a long time to put together but is not stable. The rears wheels do not fit properly and wobble. In the trike position she was constantly tipping it. There are way too many options on the market to waste on this bike. I'm now left searching for something she can use!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bike","review":"This is the best one I have found, My son is 2 and he is short, he can reach the pedals on this one because they are in the middle instead of at the front wheel, this also helps him with stopping. Assembly required but very easy, if you find it hard just remember that the back wheels are made for use a tricycle or a bike beacuse they can slide in and out when you unlock them, make sure when assembling the handle bars and front wheel that the plastic parts that require screws are in palce before tightening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intro to 3D graphics!","review":"This is a really good intro to the fundamentals of 3D graphics. The best thing about this book is that it is API-neutral, and so covers the material wihtout making specific references to API's. The material is explained very clearly and is easy to read. I would have liked some more guidance on actual implementation in code (e.g. using C to make it accessible to most readers, or using pseudo-code). Perhaps some canned demo programs would have been nice, to supplement the narrative.I also bought Hill's book on 3D graphics with OpenGL(2nd Edition), and find the two books work quite well together.I recommend Shirley's book as a first introduction to graphics theory >before< you start playing with an API!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the Kindle Version","review":"The Kindle version was very disappointing - the images were black and white and the index was useless since it had no links back to the referenced item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, but beware the reflection algorithm","review":"All and all I've been very pleased with this book, however, do not trust the reflection algorithm in the ray tracer chapter.

I teach myself lots of stuffs by reading books.This book is hard to follow. The author doesn't state the context clearly and his assumptions. As as result, you spend most of your time figuring out them rather than the materials. For this reason I give it two stars.I think this book assumes you have a strong math background. It presents you the formulas but doesn't try to explain why the formulas are so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring, written unclearly","review":"I vehemently dislike this textbook. The math is unclear or not well explained, and it makes Graphics seem like a stale, formulaic, and unattractive subject. Note, however, that I have only read the first several chapters. I don't plan on reading any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"highest recommendation","review":"As with Frederick Fennell's album of Holst and Handel, also recorded with the Cleveland Symphonic Winds (wind ensemble of the Cleveland symphony), this album includes material I performed in my musical youth in high-school and college-level bands and summer-program symphonies, notably Vaughn Williams' Sea Songs and Folksong Suites (yes, yes and the Sousa). So my ear is experienced, and I find no cut on this CD less than peerless, and with a great director and a great ensemble this is a very worthwhile album. The \\"Stars and Stripes\\" and Olympic-fanfare material is a smaller part of what is mostly truly profound music, and some otherwise hard-to-find work. Recording quality still outstanding even this many years on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true living legend!","review":"This concert is Glen in 2000, and still sings with the truest, clearest voice in music today.

It is a great resource for both beginner and veteran PHP developers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Newbies","review":"Here you have this 3 inch thick book chocked full of information just waiting to be digested. In the introduction, the authors tell the reader that,\\"This book will teach you how to create interactive websites from the simplest order form through to complex, secure e-commerce sites.\\" Well that is all good and fine, but what they leave out is the instructions on just how to accomplish that goal. What I mean to say is that they do not tell you where to place you files in order for the server to do its job. I think some basic instructions would have been great. I was not even able to get through the first exercise because the authors presumed that I knew what I was doing. Well that is why I purchased this book; to learn just where to put my files and how to get results.So, if you are like me and have not idea of nuts and bolts of php you might what to search else where for a book with more basic instruction. Atter that, then you might want to progress to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Documentation to Building an Active WebSite","review":"With the newest versions of PHP and MySQL, anyone thinking of building a database driven web site would have to think long and hard about building it using anything but PHP and MySQL. There are just three reasons for this: First the software is damn good. It's solid, fast, reliable and feature rich. Second, the software is basically free. Yes, you can buy support packages for it, but even if you do you are paying a lot less than for commercial packages. Third, the level of documentation that you can get for the software is as good as anything you can get for the commercial packages.This book is a good example of the latter. It is a specialized book oriented to building a database oriented web site using these two packages. It accomplishes this task exceedingly well. Limited to about a thousand pages, it's enough to get you through the first year or so of building your web site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hihgly Over-Rated !","review":"I bought this book primarily because of the impressive reviews. After struggling with the book for months, I now feel that others' reviews of the book were too generous. First of all, the book needs to be better organized.And the codes need to be thoroughly tested.The content is lean, compared to the volume of the book. I tried several other PHP tutorial books, but I have not yet found one which met my expectations. This is just my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Order","review":"This book was ordered for an evening class at a local college.

What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of _Attack of the Super Monsters_","review":"Read about this on the Bad Movie Website and just had to see it for myself. I don't know how much was lost in translation from the Japanese, but am well aware that most anime - like most of anything else - is mediocre. This is just south of mediocre.The DVD is a good copy, both visually and aurally. However, what it's copying may not have been worth the effort.It's worth viewing to see how multiple techniques - cell animation, stop-motion animation and live action with guys in rubber monster suits - were integrated, but otherwise give it a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attack of the bad movie","review":"I'm a big fan of giant monster movies and shows \\"Godzilla, Ultraman\\" and was very disappointed with this movie. Dinosaurs have survived for millions of years below the Earth's surface. They have become more intelligent than humans and have decided to take back the surface annihilating all humans in the process. The only thing that can stop them is a group of four super-powered teenagers \\"two of them look like old men in their 60's\\". The younger male and female can somehow combine themselves to become one cyborg being/vehicle called Gemini to fight the \\"terrifying\\" monsters. The movie is a mixture of live action, suitmation & animation. The animation is very crude, the rubber-suited monster are worse than what you see in Ultraman, and the live action is something out of the Thunderbirds. I believe the film was originally a tv show that a few of the episodes were combined to make this 83 minute movie, so there really isn't any satisfying conclusion to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"So absolutely terrible that you just MUST see it!","review":"I knew when I picked this title up that it was going to be BAD, i just wanted to see just how bad it could get. I never expected, however, the despairingly comic disaster that this movie is. What in the name of heck were these people thinking when they made this!? Anyhow, due to being just SO BAD that it defies belief, this video will always have a very special place in my movie collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic old-school TV","review":"Season 2, volume 1 of the original \\"Untouchables\\" is now out. Historically, this series is about as accurate as \\"The Flintstones,\\" but it's riveting crime melodrama nonetheless. (The original series is about 500 times better than the mediocre big-screen Brian De Palma 1980s film with the colorless Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness. The second 1990s TV series was also better than the movie, but this original series is the best.) It was, hands down, the most violent television series up to that time, and remains pretty strong even by modern standards. The first episode of season two features a young, pre-\\"Bewitched\\" Elizabeth Montgomery in an unforgettable performance as a moll named \\"Rusty Heller,\\" who gets the hots for Robert Stack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 2 Sadly SUCKS!","review":"I'm not crazy about how they are selling these Seasons in multiple volumes, but when they delete the segways it's enough for me to want a refund.

This black-and-white program shows the efforts of the Untouchables, a special squad of federal officers sent in to bust up bootlegging, kidnapping and murder by the mobsters who came to power during Prohibition. There's a lot of great talent in this program, amny actors who would be seen later in other popular TV shows in the 1960s. Elizabeth Montgomery made an appearance in one episode as a gangster's mistress. Also, this volume includes The Big Train, a two-part episode about a plot to free Capone while he was being moved from a federal prison in Atlanta to Alcatraz. This is the only episode I have seen so far which includes a disclaimer, stating that prison guards are not reall as corrupt as portrayed in the show.I have yet to be disappointed in The Untouchables!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertainment, mob-style.","review":"So relaxing. Bob Stack's emotionless Ness is calming even after the most hectic days.

I needed a holder that could be put higher up then the over the cabinet ones because my two big dogs would rub against anything low. Everything I seemed to find in the stores was for the bathroom and big. I love that it holds two towels which is a great for me! It stays put even with the use of a heavier weight towel. Does leave black marks if moved as the other reviewers said but it wipes of easily and honestly I don't plan on moving it much anyhow. I think if it scratches your fridge it's because your dragging it off instead of lifting. At first I was a bit worried because the round circles that are the magnets are way bigger in person than in the picture so I thought it might stick out like a sore thumb but it blends right in. I've actually gotten several compliments from friends and family who now want it for their kitchen!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well!","review":"This towel holder is great.

Very few star DJs can effectively incorporate their sound in a single disc and simulate the \\"journey\\" they take the crowd on in a club. Fabric 19 is a rare exception. Starting off with left-field, 80s-oriented electro, the early part of the mix moves quickly into 4/4 territory with pulsating tech house. There are some breathtaking builds and enormous basslines that perfectly captures the feel of Fabric's main room in the mid-2000s. The mix then takes another turn as he brings it down a notch, anticipating the oncoming dark minimal wave that was about to sweep over European clubland.The selection of tunes, the pace and the mixing are all top notch. This is one of the finest additions in the Fabric series and perhaps the best compliment I can give it is now more than 6 years later, this mix still sounds fresh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm Jacket & Fast Service","review":"I got this jacket around 5 days after ordering.

This notwithstanding, the theoretical components of the book are mostly still valid and have been built upon by Gilpin in further works. As a matter of historical record and of economic history, it makes fascinating reading and it is especially interesting to consider the author's speculation as to the future of American hegemony prior to the fall of the Soviet Union. Obviously many of the authors fears were ill-founded, but it is interesting to note how different it could have all been. Additionally, many of the examples used, primarily dealing with the economic ascendancy of Japan, could today almost be replaced with China. It will be interesting to see whether this time it is the end of US hegemony or whether history will repeat itself.Overall well worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wait until the dust settles","review":"Of course neo-conservatives and the pro-war left will chant at me that the world has changed since the US/UK entente acted bilaterally and did not approach the UN for a second resolution on Iraq.

When that happened it decided to remove the identical kickstand from my wife's bike and install it on my son's bike. When I turned over her bike to remove it, I saw that the kickstand on her bike (same product) was broken in the exact same place, but still somehow connected to the bike.

You can also extend your cord by buying an inexpensive coupler (female to female) that links the existing cord from your phone (yes, it does come out of the receiver part) to the new, long cord, which you then plug back into the receiver.I have one too and it's a nice-looking, inexpensive little phone that sounds nice too and has some good basic features.

It was a real chore getting through this work, mostly because the characters were so stereotypical and bland.By page 14, we figure out that Maggie, the main character, has no idea who attacked her, even though she positively identified her husband in court. And then, on for the rest of the novel, this is never again explored. I was expecting some self-inspection here, but instead the characters are flat and boring.I picked this book up hoping for something that would really get us into the mind of this woman, whose story could have been an interesting one. Instead, we get this uninspired story that fails to actually tell any kind of story.

It needs to be screwed to the FIXED part of the cabinet, and not to the door itself. So it won't fit a two-door cabinet, for instance. It is also too thick to fit on most drawers. Unfortunately this is not indicated anywhere on the box. And what's more the picture used on the box is very misleading because it looks like a two-door cabinet.We could not find a single place in our house where this would be useful --- complete waste of money for us.

Note that to be able to lock the cabinet the lazy susan door is held between a plastic \\"backstop\\" and a front lever. The backstop allows the lazy susan to open in only one direction, and (depending upon how it is installed), the backstop can block about two inches all the way around the circumference on the outside edge of the shelf. I had to remove anything along the outer edge of the top shelf for the door to be able to open. I installed this product on a lazy susan that is opened 5-10 times daily, and it lasted three months of careful usage before the lever snapped.Despite the drawbacks, rotary cabinets are a quick way to break a finger, and I was not able to find another product that fit the need.

We looked at some other options too, but they would require drilling into the front of the cabinet and trim and I don't want to do that. As it is, the last one just broke a week ago and I'm frustrated at cleaning up flour, etc. so everything sits in a tub on the table. If you don't mind replacing it often (order a few to start with-for $3 you can always sell them later if they don't get used), then this is a decent buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with my lazy susan","review":"I have about an inch and a half of space between my lazy susan and the adjacent bank of drawers. If I install this lock, the base of it will block one of the drawers from opening. It also means that I would have to drill into the formica trim on the cabinet. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with bi-fold doors.","review":"I bought this product to use on my large lazy susan bottom cabinet.

Don't buy unless you have a normal cabinet door."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for all lazy susan cabinets","review":"I was hopeful when I ordered these cabinet locks, as my daughter has been actively invading our corner cabinets lately, and our best deterrent previously has been a rubber band stretched between the cabinet knob and the knob of the nearest drawer...Hubby the engineer's analysis is that these latches will only work if your lazy susan cabinet doors are the old-fashioned type that are one solid piece. If you have the modern type that hinge in the middle these latches will not work. I'll be honest, after looking at the latches for quite a while I'm not sure that they would even work on the older style cabinets...Anyway, these aren't worth returning, because it would cost me more than they are worth to send them back. I guess I'm going back to rubber bands for a bit until I can track down a set of the magnetic-key style latches locally (I've been told they usually work.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a while...","review":"The locked worked well for a while although you have to push the tab in rather forcefully to allow the arm to swing.

The build quality is very poor. The whole assembly is made from very cheap and flimsy plastic, and considering that you'll be constantly putting pressure and twisting the mechanism to unlock, there is no doubt in my mind that it won't last long. Personally, I found the lock very hard to open. I often times found myself having to use two hands and fiddle with it just to unlock it. After about 5 tries I was frustrated and used enough force to pull the screws out of the cabinet. I just installed the Safety 1st Tot-Lok and it works great - I know they are a bit more expensive but I'd recommend it over this product any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy Item","review":"Works just fine.

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be such a cable on the market yet, but this charger/line in combo sure does the job I was looking for and keeps the iPod battery charged as a bonus. My Mini Cooper has the killer Harmon-Kardon sound package upgrade and my iPod sounds awesome with this cable running directly into the receiver. Only complaint is that it's a bit expensive for a line in cable (yeah I know, it's a charger too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A few problems...","review":"This looked like the perfect solution for using my iPod Video in my car for extended periods, however, this was not to be the case. The first problem I had was that (as a few other people have mentioned) the plug was too large to fit firmly into the iPod when it was in the case that I have for it. I could manage to get it in but only with some jiggling. The second problem I had was that the sound quality from this thing is awful. There is a substantial amount of buzzing and hissing caused by interference from the vehicle.

Now I have to go through the hassle of sending it back and eating the horribly high shipping costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"This ipod car charger is nearly perfect. The line out is the primary reason I bought this - it is very nice to simply leave the line out connected to the car and then quickly plug into the dock connector. The little extra assurance of monster cable quality is nice as well. The right angle \\"low profile\\" of this makes it very easy fit the ipod into various nooks in my car, and the connector has very good retention clips to keep it connected to the ipod. (sometimes I have trouble getting it off - don't try pulling until releasing the clips ;-)When connected to the line AND to power, I do get some electrical noise from the car. This is not the fault of the charger though, and can be solved with a ground loop isolator from radio shack. It doesn't bother me, as I'd rather only plug into power when I know I need to charge the ipod, and the noise is very faint.I'll likely buy another soon for my wifes car..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a year","review":"I bought this in April 2006. It worked fine until last month when the output started being finicky and putting out static until today it finally died. The headphone out works fine, so it's not the cable or my car.

And guess what? It charges my iPod. :) Seriously, I found this to work great. No electrical noise leaked into the audio signal, and it's wonderful to be able to use the line-level output. That's the main reason I chose this one.The other reason I chose this one is because supposedly it automatically turns on and off with the ignition. In my car, that doesn't happen ( a ~20 year old BMW), but I suspect this is a function of the car, not the charger. That is, whether the 12v outlet is switched or unswitched. It's a little inconvenient for me to have to unplug it each time I turn off the car (to avoid drawing down the battery), but the problem rests more with the car than this product.So, I happily recommend this product.

You will find it simply amazing! (At least I hope so. ;-)Merry Christmas! And enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Earthbound","review":"Pianist Kenny Barron is, as always, a delight, but what keeps this recording from being truly delightful is the rather earthbound violin playing of Regina Carter. Her previous release, Motor City Moments, was quite a bore, but I thought that might have been because of the fusion genre. Having heard her playing on this CD, however, I am less impressed than ever. There just seems to be no playfulness in her playing. Stephane Grapelli in his later years sounded much younger at heart than does the young Ms. Carter. Her tone also sounds heavy and thick.The sound quality is excellent. Others have praised this release; perhaps you will like it better than I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honey","review":"Sweet, exiting, true music; I cannot think about anything anymore, just feeling, happy................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rather get the superb \\"People Time\\" (with Stan Getz)","review":"This was on the list of Down Beat's Album of the Year, which surprised me somewhat but is probably a reflection of the fact that 2001 was not a year of splendid jazz records. As a fan of Kenny Barron buying this record (at a reduced price) did not require a second thought, but it is - of course - a far cry from Getz'/Barron's \\"People Time\\". Plus Carter's background accompaniment during some of Barron's solos is completely superfluous and cheapens the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Lab, Lousy Support","review":"As with most software, support is more important than the product. Todd Lammle put together a good product (as usual), but Sybex's poor support is enough reason to avoid this Trainer. The on-line license installation didn't work. The Sybex web site was no help at all. My e-mail was answered by a uselessly lengthy and cryptic response. Phone calls for the off-line license installation do not use a toll-free number. My wait time was over 70 minutes, and then I was cut off. There is no phone support in the evening, when most people would be home to make their installation. I'd suggest looking around for another product before buying any software from a company with such disregard for the customer's time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlock code is flawed","review":"I bought the CCNA version and it worked pretty well for me. I've waited over a month for the CCNP version to be released only to find that the unlock code was flawed from the start. I respect Sybex's protection of their product, but feel faulted after paying good money for a product that won't even let the customer use it. Why do we put up with this kind of nonsense. Sybex's support also offers a manual unlock by calling them direct, however their customer service is only open from 9:00 to 5:00 PST. I came home from work yesterday only to find that I must wait until morning to call their support personnel. My suggestion for all...don't waste your money ordering via overnight delivery, because you'll have to wait until they open anyway. I'd love to rate the product higher, but have no idea of its quality given the fact that it's currently \\"locked.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Very disappointed. All the bad coments below are true, although I think Todd Lammle tried to do a good work. You only have 33 very basic \\"chopped\\" commands in routing, no \\"show ip protocol\\", no \\"show ip ospf\\", etc. Someone knows if this is the most \\"advanced simulator\\" in the market?If this is it, better to buy second-hand equipments.I don't know how difficult it is to simulate a real environment . It is necessary to pay more, OK no problem, but overcoming the limitations (minimun 100 full-enabled IOS commands by device in any lab!!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless.","review":"I bought this with the Sybex CCNP books. First off, download the patch from the Sybex wesite to get the software working. From here, it's downhill. The 'labs' only allow you to perform their pre-prescribed labs with no room to try modifications of creation to the network.Even for the price asked you would be much better advised to pick up some second-hand kit off the Internet. More flexibility, better investment for your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect introduction","review":"This book gives you a perfect insight in the internationalisation process of a firm. The aspects you will meet during internationalisation of a firm are described, issues like Foreign Investment, market entry, joint ventures, strategies and culture etc.. On account of the many contributors it gives you a varied perspective of this field. The main authors in the field of International Business contributed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saints book for small children","review":"This is an enjoyable book written for young children at a second or third grade reading level. There are colorful pictures on every two pages that the younger children can look at.I agree with the information on this book on the cover jacket; \\"In this wise and gentle book a gifted storyteller recounts the legends of ten holy people...Ann Petry has told their heroic stories with dignity, capturing the flavor of their times and their spirits. Anne Rockwell's illustrations sparkle with life and loving humor.\\"The saints whose lives are illumined in this book are:Blaise ....... Catherine of Alexandria ....... Christopher ....... Francis of Assisi ....... Genesius ....... George ....... Joan of Arc ....... Martin DE Porres ....... Nicholas ....... Thomas More"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sue Fabisch's \\"Music 4 Mommies\\" Fantastic","review":"Being a mother of seven and grandmother of eight I totally relate with this C.D. I loved it so much I purchased two of Sue's first C.D. and look forward to her next C.D. in December. I am her number one fan after her family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after just a few months","review":"I purchased an entire set of Sensa-Trac shocks for my F-150 in March 2012. One of the rear shocks is now leaking and will have to be replaced just 10 months later. The heaviest item that I have hauled in my pick-up is a sofa bed. I never overload my truck and I am rather puzzled as to why the shock is now leaking. I realize that in any mass manufacturing process errors occur, but Monroe shocks I have installed in the past have lasted far longer than I had ever thought possible. I realize that Monroe has a warranty on material failure, but it is an hassle to go through the warranty process for a simple shock. I am rather disappointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I hate this shirt?","review":"Let me count the ways.Well, just one way, really.Those bra-friendly straps don't stay up no matter what.As a larger woman, I'm not crazy about sleeveless shirts, but I decided to try this. Between the extra-ordinarily low cut and the sleeves that just wouldn't stay up, I spent the whole evening adjusting my top. It was a fairly special occasion, and I was self-conscious all night. I wore it once, in July, and I just can't imagine being desperate enough to repeat the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Standard Deviants World Geography","review":"This DVD is so mind-numbingly stupid that it makes me angry every time I remember that I actually paid money for it. It gets one star only because Zero was not an option. I bought it for my then 11 year old son. It seems public schools no longer teach geography, and I believe it's a national disgrace that Americans are so ignorant about most of the planet. This DVD does nothing to overcome that ignorance. Yes it has lots of quick, MTV style, scene changes and effects. Yes it has upbeat(if moronic) teenage hosts. But its content is so general as to actually teach nothing. And its content is also factually incorrect - it seems unconscionable to me that the editors missed the fact that Mexico is part of North America. The DVD tells us that North America consists of the U.S. and Canada. I'll grant you that as a forty-something I'm biased against the style over substance tv format, but even my son found its lack of content a borderline fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"we use standard deviants as fun review and study material","review":"We understand others frustrations in their purchase of Standard Deviant...the company should have put \\"study and review\\" along with \\"learn\\" on their package. We'll never forget now (we learn from others mistakes) that Mexico etc... is in North America now will we! As for the jokes, some may be \\"over the heads\\" of 8 and under folks but so is Bugs Bunny and Dr. Seuss. We absolutely love and actually do learn from those corny guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Lifesaver","review":"I had recently accepted a new position in Atlanta and purchased Ms. Cauley's book. In no uncertain terms I found the book to be a life saver in terms of its volume and quality of information on relocating to Atlanta. I would strongly recommend that anyone considering a move to Atlanta or recently transferred there buy this book. It will pay for itself many many times over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a great recording but","review":"I cannot give an unbiased review of any recording of Respighi's \\"The Birds\\". It along with Brahms' Hungarian Dances and Mozart Horn Concertos remain in my earliest memories of music. I would ask for \\"The Birds\\" which was an incredibly long piece taking several 78's.So I buy it now with other pieces to fill a CD. It still is an excellent piece of music to introduce children to the world of concert music - what more fun can you have than instruments sounding like cuckoos, hens, doves ...The Pines of Rome and the Fountains of Rome require a somewhat older audience but is enjoyable by school ages.I would tend to classify this Respighi as \\"classical pops\\" e.g. the repetoire of the Boston Pops and the equivalent \\"summer light\\" orchestras. And this recording is merely satisfactory - an orchestra sliding by on their competence not giving their all for an inspired rendition.But the mix of three delightful classical lights on this album makes it worth picking up for sheer fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst baseball game EVER!","review":"Terrible, terrible, terrible--this game is worse than GBA baseball games made 5 or more years ago. Where to start? There's no season function (you can only play exhibition games, playoffs, World Series, or Home Run Derby), which is the mode everyone I know wants to play.The graphics look good until they go into motion--you've got to swing at a pitch before you can even tell where it's going, to say nothing of setting where you'll swing in the zone BEFORE the pitch is thrown.Throwing to bases is difficult, manual fielding's nearly impossible (the ball moves too fast for Superman to track it), and even their choices for \\"Legends\\" will leave you scratching your head (Devon White? Are you kidding?)Whoever designed this game has probably never played baseball, and has certainly never played it on any console at all. Even the Atari 2600 game had more oomph behind it. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my $20 back.","review":"This is the worst GBA game I have ever played. It has nothing going for it - yes the rosters are updated but every player looks the same (awful). Gameplay is jerky and the graphics are extremely poor. I couldn't even finish one inning before shutting it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Please, please just save your money. This is really bad, unless your idea of fun is no season mode, playing in one stadium that nobody knows or cares about, terrible graphics, and you cant even play on all the teams. If you buy this, you will instanly regret it as soon as you turn on your gameboy. And the gliches seem to never end, and the game crashes every inning. If you are a baseball fan looking for a treat, not buying this would be the best treat you could give yourself or others. In short, this game sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"BROAN RANGE HOOD 30-INCH","review":"This replaced an old G.E. range hood that the fan died inand the light switch was broken.It would have cost almost as much to replace just the fanand switch in the old one so I went with this.The fit and finish is nice and the color actually matches our stove better.The fan is a little on the noisy side but it gets the job done."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],O={key:0},H={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(i(!0),a(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(i(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",O,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const N=d(E,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-d3d8b765"]]),P=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/19.md","filePath":"guide/19.md"}'),j={name:"guide/19.md"},R=Object.assign(j,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{P as __pageData,R as default};
