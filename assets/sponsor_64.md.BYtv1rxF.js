As an aspiring nurse I was interested in the dynamics of this disease and how it affects its victims. This book not only narrates the first hand account of what life may be like for a person dealing with the chronic illnes of Lupus but also the psychological difficulties of alcoholism and manic depression. The use of various themes of setting provide insightful connections to Clarke's most intimate moments spent with her supportive family and the varying levels of illness intensity. This autobiography written to inspire others afflicted with Lupus is an easy, uncomplicated read, and is definitely an excellent reference to assisting others with any chronic illness. It is prophetic to the fact that a \\"good life\\" is possible despite disease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyrical and light, unobtrusively uplifting","review":"This feng shui music is designed to help improve your life through the energy released through music. Following the five element pattern of harmonious living , the Phoenix CD is associated with the element of fire.

She is assisted by Mr. Icchan, who is the \\"father\\" of Angelic Layer, unbeknownst to Suzuhara.This is pretty mediocre stuff from the great studio. Suzuhara is so naiive, she has no personality. The surrounding characters are equally annoying, especially Suzuhara's loud and obnoxious friend Tamayo. The only reason I keep watching is for the battle dolls, or \\"Angels,\\" which are cool.The best part of volume two is a voice actor interview with Kevin Corn (Satoko) and Monica Riahl (Tamayo).

Besides pushing every frequency range to the limits, they managed to actually cripple the songs with over 200 clipped samples on disc 1 and over 900 on disc 2. This happens when the sound levels go beyond the limits of the audio CD specifications and parts of the sound wave are \\"cut off\\" - or, in other words, the waveform literally flatlines and any sound at those points is simply lost. Even in the parts where clipping does not occur, the absurd raising of the sound levels results in some very uncomfortable listening. All instruments and vocals have had their volumes raised to the same high levels, resulting in a complete loss of the dynamics of the songs, with instruments that were originally very quiet now sounding as loud as everything else. Why can't these audio \\"engineers\\" go work in some other field more adequate to their abilities like dog walking or whatever, thus avoiding criminally maiming classic, essential music like this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it if you already have the older CDs","review":"If you happen to like the way recordings are \\"remastered\\" these days, rendering them loud messes of sound that obscure the subtleties of the music, then you'll love these remasters.

I also have the next five albums gathered in the three CD's set (\\"A Parcel of Steeleye Span\\"), which contain many brilliant songs too and are another \\"must have\\", but this collection, \\"Lark in the morning\\", should be, in my opinion, the absolute first priority for anybody discovering Steeleye Span.

My pair cuts poorly -- leaving a sharp, somewhat crushed nail edge.

For those who care, there is a large label on the bottom that reads \\"CHINA.\\" I thought perhaps that all baby nail clippers were the same, until I tried the Summer Infant \\"Dr Mom Nail Clipper Set\\" (I can't find it on Amazon, but one of the major big-box baby stores carries it).

Even on a bright sunny day the captured footage leaves a lot to be desired. The angle of view is tiny. The resolution is tiny and the frame rate is extremely low. If you are doing any activity that involves a lot of movement (why else would you buy this camera?) you will end up with a very jumpy and confusing video.This camera is promoted as a great bargain, but unfortunately in this case you get exactly what you paid for - a novelty store item that will end up collecting dust in the back of the same drawer that you dump your obsolete cell phones in.If you really want to get decent quality first person videos, you will have to shell out upwards of $100-$150 for an Oregon Scientific or Tachyon XC. If you try to do it on the cheap with this camera, you will still end up with an Oregon Scientific or Tachyon XC except it will cost you an extra $30 plush shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless is you have VISTA","review":"I bought one of these at a toys r us going out of business sale 3 or 4 years ago and thought it was a great cheap helmet cam.

You need an older windows OS for the hardware, not the software, to be compatible! I emailed Digital Blue, the cheap company that makes the camera, and they say the camera's are too old for them to care about developing a driver for them to work with Vista!

YUK! Very awkward also to pour the water into resevoir with out pouring it all over counter and into areas it should not go! The only good feature of this machine is thethe way you fill the cup!

Fiddled with it again and was able to manually brew it, or so I thought. Came back about 10 minutes later, it had power, but had made no coffee.

This new album may be too subtle and sophisticated for the average listner who was attracted to the uptempo power pop of this fine artist's earlier albums. Give this album a listen. These new songs could have easily been played uptempo with power chords emphasized in the chorus and that crowd would have been happy with another repeat. These songs are even more melodic than Crenshaw's great tunes of the past. They are just played midtempo. Instead of his usual power chords Crenshaw substitutes richer instrumentation in the album's production. I wish when artists grow in a positive new way fans could grow too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someday, some way, maybe another good work.","review":"I have long been a fan of Marshall Crenshaw. His early work is nearly flawless, and all of the early albums are worth having in your collection. I even made my own \\"best of\\" two-disc set (that's right, 160 minutes of what I call great tunes!), and, while playing it one day on the highway, got pulled over by some punk-rock looking people who heard it playing in my truck at the last stop light and wanted it for themselves. I agree that he's been virtually overlooked by people who might really like his work. Unfortunately, \\"What's In the Bag\\" is a let-down. The rhymes are elementary, the tunes are not catchy, and it just doesn't seem like his heart is in it here. Finally, reworking Prince and Bootsy tunes seems like acts of desperation. I'm not giving up; I like to pick up new works by my old rock n roll heroes, but this is one I have to pass.

For the price tag I was hoping to get my monies worth. It turned out that the product is not as good as ECTACO makes you believe. ECTACO claims that it can translate sentences. Clearly this is not the case; it only translates the words in the sentences from English to Spanish word to word as a result you get a sentence that doesn't make sense when translated into Spanish. It can't even translate the most basic sentences in English to a understandable form of Spanish. I was quite disappointed and I knew that after 2 days of using it was clearly not worth its hefty price tag.

They make too much noise which is very boring after some few of their attacks. It's not Punk, it's not New Wave, it's not Devo. Sorry my friends, you have failed. And then forget about the singer. He cannot sing at all, maybe that's why you can barely hear him at all. His screams are hidden behind the noise wall of the musicians.

This is a value, the disc come in a nice box with a several page book and the music remasters sound great. Music lovers don't get deals like this often, quality packaging and two discs full of timeless classics at a low price. I don't know what else to say because this music has been around longer than me, so I have no great insight. Those who are into Motown and classic R&B will certainly love this collection and anyone who loves music in general should give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't need this","review":"I spent $300.00 on Stax Box sets from the 90's.If I was gonna pick 50 songs I could do A whole lot better than this.None the less this is Stax & they are better than Motown.

Of note, everyone is nice in this movie. The conflict stems not from a \\"bad guy\\", and I really liked that. Not at all scary for a little kid, no violence, just a nice little story.

I also found this movie to be a refreshing view of twinship. I know I may be overly senstive, but I can't help but notice that most, no ALL, fictional twins are just copies of each other... speaking in unison etc. Tinkerbell and Periwinkle (while having lots in common) are not just clones... they're not even dressed alike! Its nice for my identical daughters to see a more individualized view of twins. I also love the scene where they learn they are born of the same laugh... the laugh is basically an egg splitting to create the two fairies, and I'm sure will be the reference point when our girls get curious about how they came to be twins! There's plenty of years ahead for science... for now, let the fairies explain everything!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old loves this movie","review":"Now that we've watched it 800 times, I can say I don't recoil every time my daughter asks to watch it again.

I especially liked that tinker belle had friends that were boys but they weren't pushing relationship stuff on them. This movie seems like one big romance story with most of the characters having \\"loves and crushes on cute guys\\" and Tink is asked if Terrance is her boyfriend. It felt more like a money maker than a story line with actual thought put into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"Brought this for my daughters birthday. Packing is awful, two of disc came in scratched because the are set one on top of the other. Story is not good for younger audience because of love story within it and the stoner fairy was not necessary at all. Very disappointed because of all of that but the animation was very good on a hi-def TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Saccharine of the Wings","review":"This is not the best of the Tink series (that would be the Great Fairy Rescue). The story in outline is sweet, but it's grounded by inflated melodrama and the really awful songs that are poured over every montage like syrup. Does every preteen singer sound the same, regardless of gender? The McClain sisters could have been manufactured in the Disney factory; there is nothing original, personal or distinctive about the songs or their performances: it's an assembly of pre-fab parts and it drags the movie down."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So Disney Fairies Movie","review":"First, my daughter who loves all things fairies (and princesses) watched the whole movie.

As a dad, I found it mildly entertaining.

My daughter (4) thought this was even better; a great story. They seem to get better with each one they make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute Movie, but DVD skips out of the box","review":"First off, my kids and I loved this movie. We now have all four Tink movies, and we will probably buy the next one as well. No violence, easy to relate to, beautiful imagery, and enough little things for both children and adults to enjoy.Unfortunately, the quality of the discs is sub-par. I can't speak for the Blu-Ray discs, as we don't actually own a blu-ray player, but the DVD skipped seven times right out of the box. Luckily, the digital copy is perfectly fine, and the skipping itself was slight instead of jarring. But for a brand new movie to do this is completely unacceptable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Story","review":"Who knew Tink had a twin sister?

Also if you are a fan of typical, overdone, fantasy stories you may also enjoy this.I found that I was bored of it by about halfway through, but I continued because I wanted to see what happened to the Demon Soul.After reading this book and the War of the Ancients series I can honestly say, I don't like Richard A. Knaak's writing. I know he is well respected author, but his style is just not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which came first, the chicken or the egg (aka the book or the WarCraft game)?","review":"Since I'm not a gamer, but know folk who think WarCraft is a great game, I decided to read Day of the Dragon to get a better understanding of WarCraft's themes (and to be able to understand conversations about the game's plot).I was pleasantly surprised.Day of the Dragon is an entertaining fantasy book, with interesting characters, a plot that makes \\"sense\\" (within the confines of the fantasy genre), and engaging action. Obviously, the game, prior to being programmed, needed a plot. I suspect the game came first, followed by the book (this is book 1 of 3, I believe). I wish I knew whether the detail in the book is reflected in the game and vice versa, but my sense from talking to gamers is that they really complement each other.The surprising thing was how entertaining the book is as a stand-alone story. I think even Jason Fox (rabid gamer from the FoxTrot comic strip) would agree."},{"rating":"2","title":"WarCraft: Day of the Dragon","review":"This has to be one of the best novels I've read in the long time. As far as fantasy novels go, it is easily the equal to The Hobbit and the DragonLance Series. Thats not surprising considering Knaak has written books for the DragonLance series. Warcraft: Day of the Dragon captures the World of Azeroth from the game but at the same time tells its own original story based on facts and details from the game. Although you do not have had to play the game before to understand it, it has a few minor details that only people who have played the game, or at least read the instruction manual, would understand. The plot is long and unwinding keeing you on the edge of your seat until the end. I am definitely lookinf forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another generic by Knaak","review":"Knaak is the most generic author of all-time. His characters are bland, and even though he's hand-fed the events that take place they still somehow manage to be less than exciting. He makes his own characters the stars of the tale when they didn't even exist in the real lore. Not only do they not belong there but they are some of the most boring and generic characters around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent History","review":"Excellent history of Dragons and a crucial epoch in Warcraft lore. Must reading for all Warcraft enthusiasts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Day of the Dragon","review":"\\"This sort of book is not an easy thing to write; trust me, I know (I wrote Diablo: Demonsbane). However, Richard Knaak has done an excellent job.\\"The story takes place shortly before the battle of Khaz Modan in the second game. A young wizard is sent out on a secret mission to free the Dragonqueen from the Orcs. However, he soon discovers that almost nothing is as it appears.\\"The book only suffers from two difficulties. The first is the lack of a map, which sometimes makes the background a bit hard to follow. The second is that in the opening chapters Knaak has far more exposition than action, revealing a great deal about the history of the world, but not advancing the plot in the process.\\"Once the exposition is over, however, the plot moves along quite quickly. The characters are engaging, and Knaak manages to bring the world to life.\\"Definitely worth reading; 4/5.\\"Robert B.

Often the workshop/discussion/critique group falls down or deteriorates due to a lack of trust and a lack of ways to approach texts.

You will find yourself relating to at least one character, I promise. Come along on a fanastical journey starring Himeno, a high school girl who wants to make a difference and help save the world by becoming Pretear.Not only is it a journey of strength and courage, but a journey of self discovery as well.

Wakeman, Howe, Squire & White are mainly window dressing for the highly enlightened, inspiring, mercurial Jon Anderson. I've seen Yes at least a half dozen times from '75 on. This represents the band at a nadir; perhaps they're just too old and creaky to blast off like they used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"delayed until August","review":"According to Image Entertainment, who is producing this DVD, the release has been delayed *again* to August 9th."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bull****","review":"Great show, but if they keep delaying they deserve poor reviews. There is no legitimate reason to wait until less than a week before the already delayed release date to announce yet another delay. This is very very poor irresponsible management."},{"rating":"1","title":"I will wait, too....","review":"Since it's taking so long, and we have NO CLUE how they are editing this DVD, I have canceled the pre-order I've had for many, many months and will wait to read the \\"fan\\" reviews....then I'll decide whether to order or not...better to wait and be safe then get stuck with some cheesy DVD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please...Release..Release..","review":"I like YES so much.I have many YES dvd's like..Symphonic Live, Q.P.R Vol1,2, House of YESYes speaks, Yes years, Yes AcousticKeys to Ascension...And I have been waiting this dvd since 2004.But, still no release date announced...For more, they changed release date 2~3 times.In my opinion, release date is a kind of promise to YES fans.So, I give 1 star for this dvd.For sure, I will buy this dvd and give stars again.Please..Release.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass This Up and Order the DVD!","review":"This is a great concert! I saw it aired back in 2004 when it was first recorded. So I was excited to see that it was available for download. Unfortunately, this file they're selling for $9.99 only contains the first half of the show! As the file is ending you can even hear the announcer telling the crowd that there will be a 15 minute intermission before the next set...What a letdown. There's a really cool part of this concert where the band does more acoustic versions of Owner of a Lonely Heart and Roundabout, and they're not included in this download. So do yourself a favor and order the DVD. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YeS! If you know what I mean...","review":"Finally a great video with the full classic line-up that we all love. The set list is nothing short of spectacular if you like a good show this is it. I think all the people that saw them live agree. A good followup to yessymphonic, In an objective world this would be a major hit. In real world let's hope so! It's about time!So buy more and give them to your friends and spread the joy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES- Songs From Tsongas","review":"I watched this concert on PBS.... an abbreviated version and now have it on dvd and it is fantastic.I saw them twice on this tour. I'm somewhat bious being big fan of YES, but this concert is outstanding. These guys are incredible musicians and we are lucky they are still playing. They play at intense levels at every perfomance and this is no exception. I don't doubt they will fine tune it for the dvd....but I won't complain....just enjoy it that much more!!!!! Enjoy it while you can... you will not be dissapointed..... and it could be thier last dvd with Wakeman. An increbible band!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WANT SOME GOOSE BUMPS?","review":"I saw YES live back in the early 70's everytime they came to Philly. No band ever topped them except Pink Floyd when they played \\"Eclipse - A Piece For Assorted Lunatics\\"(Dark Side of the Moon, before it was released, 4 channel sound, crowd under 5000). Well this show brings back the quality of those first shows. While I always thought \\"Yessongs\\" was pretty good(and some of ABWH), most of their live stuff was never quite as good as I thought it could be. Maybe it's the combination of sight,sound and new technology(the surround sound is great). Well, all I can say is this one is worth the money. They may look older but \\"And You And I\\" was good for a few goosebumps again."},{"rating":"2","title":"why pre-order???","review":"2004 concert, delayed to April 05, then June 05, sarcastically to Jan 2010???

Besides Anderson being mixed way to high (which can be annoying - always looked at his voice as another instrument - to be blended in with everything else) - the rest of the mix is very mushy. One of those 'you can hear everything - but you can't hear anything' mixes. Drums almost non-existant.The performance is good. But if you want a really great sounding live performance of YES - the live at Montreaux DVD is it. Other than the fact that the for the first half of the show the camera never focuses on Squire (weird) the sound is almost flawless. The drums sound particularly good in Montreaux - and overall, it's all good - way better than Tsongas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Support Yes","review":"Hey all. This DVD will be great, no matter the delay. When your done listening to it head on over towww.yesfans.comand talk about it and all other things Yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds good from where I'M sitting....4.5 stars","review":"After reading many of the Amazon reviews for Songs From Tsongas, I was prepared for the worst, particularily with the audio...by the time I was finished watching it, my main question was \\"what are these people THINKING?!\\" The DTS Surround mix is superb on my home system, so I have no idea or explanation why other folks are having audio issues. The setlist pretty much covers Yes' entire career (although the Drama period was once again overlooked), dating all the way back to the pre-Steve Howe days. Diehard fans will appreciate some of the song selections, and should be pleased with the inclusion of the long-requested \\"Mind Drive\\". The performance isn't as furious as shows from the days of yore, but nevertheless the band is locked into a solid, comfortable groove with some occasional musical fireworks. Add the nice visuals & stage design, and you arguably have one of the strongest live Yes video releases to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Jon Anderson Show","review":"The mix here is disgraceful: Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman are kept on a tight leash so as not to compete with Jon's vocals. It was the ultimate tease to have this set list presented to any one weaned on Yes from the \\"Yes Album\\" to \\"Going For The One\\".Every time you think they are going to explode into some kind of cathartic jam, you strain to hear Steve and Rick. Jon Anderson destroyed this band a number of times thinking that these musicians were back-up to his vocals.Do yourself a favor and buy the \\"YesSongs\\" DVD. When they play the intro to \\"Close To The Edge\\", you will know why you became a Yes fan so many years ago: 5 exceptional musicians sharing the stage to explode into orbit. This latest fiasco is a one man show, dressed up like Yes.I hope Steve and Rick got sizable checks for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Sound Man's Fault","review":"After reading some of these reviews about the bad audio on this dvd, please note that the tracks recorded live from the show are then re-mixed and mastered in a studio. Therefore, the studio producer and or the band itself is really to blame. After listening to a clip on the band's website, I tend to agree with your complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it (like all others)","review":"I think this book is another one of Spring Song's excellent book. It demonstrates family relations (how Erica relates to her Mom). I think that any young person should read this book.

Gave it to a friend who was building a house, and now it seems a bit dated and cumbersome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psycho-Drama of building","review":"Unlike most others, I disliked this book. I tried to get through it twice, separated by a few years, but I give up.I'd hoped that this would offer fresh insights to building, but it was simply a painful replay of the psycho-drama involved: who's going to take the risks, who's going to \\"win\\" in what is presented as a zero-sum game.No wonder so many people end up hating their builders, and no wonder builders approach customers with distrust!I'm a serial renovator and will soon be building from the ground up. I'd suggest that there IS another approach - it's called teamwork. Do the research and make the effort upfront and find a builder you can work with and trust. Keep them running a tight budget with multiple bids but be respectful of their risk too! It's possible to create an environment in which everyone wins: on projects this significant, it's worth working to create it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have enjoyed all the other Tracy Kidder books I've read (Among Schoolchildren, Old Friends, Home Town, My Detachment, Mountains Beyond Mountains), so it was with a heavy heart that I bailed out on this one after 70 pages. Kidder does a good job in some respects (particularly with his character sketches), but I just couldn't get behind the story. After a period in which I've been reading book after book dealing with serious and wrenching issues -- anti-intellectualism in America, child abuse, destructive religious zealotry, etc. -- I just couldn't see the drama in waiting to see whether a yuppie couple gets the window treatments they want on their huge, custom-built house in the country. Maybe it's just me, or my current mood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth skimming, not reading","review":"From the very beginning, it is clear that the house project is a project doomed to difficulty--the builders were breaking ground without having a clear design, a price point, and a contract.What I took away from this book was the absolute necessity of having *EVERYTHING* in writing. If Bill (the architect) had provided completed drawings early in the process, the estimating would have been more accurate, there would have been fewer confrontations, and some of the change orders could have happened before the building started, meaning when it's still cheap and easy to make changes. Of course, that would have taken away from the drama of the story.Any project manager would have cringed all the way through this book--it was bound to be a train wreck from the very beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'd rather have a root canal","review":"This is obviously well written, but oh, what a bore! I HATE having to deal with contractors in real life. I don't want to read about the trials and tribulations of building a house.

Unless you know exactly what you're looking for, you will be very unlikely to find anything in this rambling 900 plus page doorstop. I was doing research for a script I'm working on. Well the book's index is arranged alphabetically. Almost completely useless.Want to know about specific folklore? Forget it. Unless you know the title of the book, movie or person, you're screwed.There are much better ways to learn about Vampires.

And once you know that, you don't need this book at all.Waste of money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource Bad Editing","review":"I found this book to be a definitive resource into all things relating to vampires. It's definitely worth the price. However, I feel extremely bad for the author himself, who holds a PhD and obviously is well educated on the subject matter contained in this book; the editing is horrific and the publisher should be ashamed that they've treated this author's scholarly work with such disrespect. I teach, and in preparing my lectures, I read the book cover to cover, finding over one thousand major editing errors; not just spelling, but grammatical and reference errors, that any editor should have caught and corrected before the publishing of this work. It's appalling and the author's reputation marred by it, as this is a scholarly text."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most informative book ever for vampire fans","review":"The Vampire Book: Encyclopedia of the Undead is the most informative and well planned book on the subject ever written.

This book gives you enough information so you can navigate around and generally get the answer you are looking for without a lot of hunting.

Mr. Hill in this book, removes a lot of the mystery behind the technology of the ufos reported in the past. He takes each aspect of the characteristics of these flying craft and provides a thorough scientific analysis/breakdown of what is seen or reported. You needn't have a great knowledge of math in order to follow the explanations he provides and he acknowledges that many readers don't. Then, he provides a Summary and Conclusions that wraps it all up. With the technology laid out as Mr. Hill as done in this book, we shouldn't be that far off from creating this technology ourselves - it's all there! We should all be grateful to Mr. Hill's daughter for making sure that this work was published after his death - Mr. Hill would be proud, as we are grateful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent analysis","review":"Written by a former NASA scientist and published posthumously, this book is full of technical information. The author takes what data exists and forms hypotheses that fit the data instead of trying to cram data to fit a specfic hypothesis. I had physics in college some years ago, but a few chapters did manage to get over my head, the aerodynamics. However if you have a basic understanding of algebra you can follow the equations, and if not they are not neccessary to enjoy the book - but will add to your understanding of it.He does get into a discussion of quantum particles and I honestly don't know if that sections is dated now or not, it was written in the 70's to 80's and I do not know how much that field has changed since then. Even if that sections is indeed dated, it would not detract from the book.I expect this book to become dog eared shortly, it will be reread at least one more time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the TOP 3 Books in this Genre! Read the reviews...","review":"The text book on UFOs; how they work, the research and investigation and scientific analysis is all discussed.Alien Rapture by Steiger is the covert agenda delivered in a page turning fiction format. Alien Agenda by the best selling author of 'Crossfire', Jim Marrs is the history and current state of UFOlogy.I've read over 150 books on UFOlogy and am considered somewhat of an expert. These three books are a MUST BUY for anyone interested in the subject. This book by Dr. Hill only got published because his wonderful daughter had the foresight to get his manuscript to a publisher after he died. He was a NASA scientist for 30 years and investigated UFO sightings and contact. He was forbidding to talk about his work. NASA denies that they or anyone investigated UFOs at NASA.

The music compiled on this disc alone is enough reason to purchase it. It serves as a good introduction to traditional Chinese music, and each piece is stunning. However, those who sometimes find it difficult to wind-down at the end of the day enough for bed will find this album to be a must-have! The peaceful compositions have a lulling effect and put me to sleep easily, even though I normally cannot fall asleep to music.

So much of this novel is sexual, but the writing completely takes over and makes me think. My favorite story is \\"The Wedding of Tom and Tom\\" by Keith Banner. Yes, it is about two retarded men who cannot get enough of each other sexually, but they also love each other, and they end up teaching other people about love as well.

Readers who are patient enough to pursue the issue are referred to my remarks on vol.1-no point in boring readers with repetition. One positive remark: the CD includes the few little pieces composed by Julian Scriabin, the composer's son. It IS interesting to hear these little pieces, and this appears to be their only recording. Believe me, after having been stung by vol.I, this was the ONLY reason I bought the disc!Those seeking a really excellent recording of these pieces should investigate Maria Lettberg's 8-CD set of the piano music on Capriccio--definitely worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential birdwatching reading","review":"For any active birdwatcher who goes beyond their backyard this volume is essential reading. Connor writes in a lively, entertaining, but also very educational style. Chapter on optics will be very helpful for beginners, but probably best are his chapters on various bird groups where individual species can be difficult to learn (I especially like the chapters on warblers, hawks, and shorebirds). Out of the multitude of birdwatching books available there are few, if any, that fill quite the same intermediate niche as this volume does so well.

The only tune worth anything is \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" and even that got overplayed to death by commercial radio.I'm telling you, if you want to discover true hippie music, check out Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Grateful Dead or Bon Jovi.

I'm really happy to see both \\"Bleecker Street\\" and \\"Sparrow\\" from their debut finally on a collection. Both are great. A handful of songs are live, but most are the originals, and all sound good. If this 2-disc set is not in your budget, I would surely go with the 20 track \\"Best of\\".

Simply because S&G are on tour. So if you want a good S&G hits album, buy the one with the 2 guys walking on the beach at dusk. If you want an average live recording album, buy the one from last year. And if you want some really good material, then get The Columbia Studio Recordings 1964-1970 [BOX SET].

I think he's maybe the most popular writer of Conan tales next to REH, but that's something else entirely. I typically find Jordan's writings of Conan rather diluted and perhaps too heavy on magic and socery. Nothing against socery, it belongs in Conan novels, but the way Jordan does it reminds me of cheesy '80s made-for-television sci-fi shlock, with green lighting and smoke effects. I think you can make a strong case that the cavalry leader pursuing Conan and the bandits somewhat steals the show in this novel, at least that's the feeling I remember walking away with after finishing this book a few months ago. Despite the terrible cover art, this is a solid piece of story telling with a fast pace and high action uncharacteristic of Robert Jordan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but slight","review":"Of all the eighties Conan writers, Jordan has the most fun with the character and approaches Howard's style the closest.

The characters are true to form and realistic. I feel that the author accurately conveys the nature of the Conan character and that the supporting characters are equally flushed out. The story was exciting and quick paced. For those into action and steel, this book is a must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Conan the great","review":"This is an awesome book of the conan series and was actually the very first one that I read.I'd also have to say that Robert Jordan does compare very well with Robert E.

No vocal aerobics here, just a really good sexy raw sound that I have not heard lately with other artists! She proves that not only can she do upbeat songs like her great single Surrender, but also some really beautiful ballad songs which she is known for in her Italian and Spanish songs! Just love Everyday is a Monday!I highly recommend this album and think she has a very promising future ahead of her in the English market!! Hope that a tour results from this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but song selection needs to be better","review":"Initially heard of Laura Pausini singing with Michael Buble.

Laura stick to Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Debut","review":"At her previously released Italian albums Laura Pausini had 3-4 tracks that were melodic and memorable, the rest of songs was not distinguishable from mainstream of mass-produced pop. Arguably, her best album for today is \\"Ritorno da te: the best of Laura Pausini\\", a compilation of her better songs. Her english debut is very disappointing. Why would anyone buy another Ceiline Dion styled artist in the music market already saturated with Ceiline Dion alikes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"whoa! to be her english debut, it is terrific!","review":"whoa again!she's italian but i can't hear her accent, she sings really really goodi don't know why i haven't heard about her, she's really new for me but she has 7 albums and has sold 20 million copies around the world!!every song is nice for me, but my favorites are \\"i need love\\"(that will be the second single), \\"do i dare\\", \\"surrender\\"(a truly hit in Canada), \\"if that's love\\", \\"love comes from the inside\\", \\"every little thing you do\\", \\"i do to be\\", \\"without you\\", \\"it's not goodbye\\" and \\"everyday is a monday\\", whoa! i think almost the entire album i like!people this is a very talented girl with a terrific voice, don't doubt to buy this album, highly recommended! 100%i'm sure you will love her"},{"rating":"1","title":"Italian Celine Dion not cut out for the American Audience","review":"Pausini had a voice of her own until now. She sounds so much like Celine Dion, its depressing. I hope she retires in English because she just doesn't do it. This recording only sold a meager 45,000 copies. Not that she has no talent, but the lyrics are weak and forgettable. There are no bright moments, and this cd is overall boring. Tres boring! No wonder only 45,000 people bought it.

I give this album 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Celine! Here comes Laura!","review":"I heard the current single \\"Surrender\\" on MTV and fell instantly in love with Laura's voice.This album is a collection of both beautiful ballads such as the gorgeous \\"Without You\\" and \\"It's Not Goodbye\\" and uptempo numbers like \\"Surrender\\" and \\"Love Comes from the Inside\\".Laura's voice is both emotional and strong and can definitely be compared to the likes of Celine Dion and Lara Fabian.I doubt it will get much attention from Radio One listeners in the UK but if I were Laura, I'd take this as a compliment!Lets hope that my faith in the UK public is restored and that they \\"Surrender\\" to Laura's beautiful voice and first English language album ASAP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY PLEASANT CROSSOVER ALBUM!","review":"The first English release by this huge European star is a pleasant listen!

The reason I purchased these glue sticks was I got to thinking one day while paying bills about all the envelopes I lick during the year. Did you ever really consider where those envelopes have been stored, how old they are or what germs might be on them? We wash our hands to try and keep them germ free yet we lick some envelope that has God knows what on it.

Putting package labels was a breeze. The glue stick lasts a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal for those school projects!","review":"These glue sticks are great. You just swipe it on the paper you are trying to glue and then stick it onto the other sheet. I like that you can coat the entire side of the paper and make sure that it all stays glued down with no curling corners. It works on paper, poster board, foam boards, basically paper of all types.We had to glue about a dozen magazine ads into a school project once and these just worked great. They are non-toxic and easy to use with no mess. The glue goes onto the project and not onto you or the furniture. They also dry clear and makes the project look clean and neat!Simple, inexpensive and they work! Just what you need!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck up","review":"Glue stick is as advertised. Seals envelope flap with one swipe with absent/minimal glue on fingers or leaking around envelope flap. More economical than smaller stick. Highly recommend large glue stick for home or office use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two gals and they're guitars","review":"Long before she became an award winning singer, Carly and her sister Lucy were a duo named the Simon sisters. Folk was they're genre and children's songs were they're bread and butter. They both sing great and played their guitars well. Nothing extraordinary, it's like I said in the title it's two gals and they're guitars and thats it, no bells and whistles, no drums nothing fancy it's simple Simon.The disc has a large selection of songs to listen to and it's mastered well so that nothing sounds out of place or distorted. For Carly's fans out there it's an easy enough recommendation, but it's nothing that will knock your socks off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't care for this","review":"I thought this documentary would show more on the Clyde Mcphatter, it was like a skip through, and I didn't realize how dated the interviews were too.

A must-have in any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"If \\"Hillbilly\\" is a positive for you instead of a dismissive term, you should like it.","review":"One of the best written albums of the 1980's. Song after song can grip you, if you know small towns. Earle seemed to be trying too hard in his early years and then went Hollywood after this album hit. This one defines him, not \\"Copperhead Road.\\" He just wrote very well and accurately on this one. Good strong riffs, well produced, and soulful. All the elements I need for a 5 star rating. This album is comparable to Lucinda Williams's \\"Car Wheels...\\" in that it has a unifying theme, is dead-on to the theme, and has great performances. If \\"Hillbilly\\" is a positive for you instead of a dismissive term, you should like it. \\"Nothin ever happens around my home town and I aint the kind to just hang around...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Still haven't gotten this one? What are you waiting for??","review":"I've grown up listening to Steve Earle. I own all of his albums and \\"Guitar Town\\" ranks up there with \\"Transcendental Blues\\" as my favorite recordings of his. I guess there has to be some nostalgia attached to that, but it just sounds so good. If you've only been listening to his stuff for the last four albums, you may have trouble believing that this is the same guy. Back then, he was a lot slicker sounding with a stronger electric sound and a more rollicking-rockabilly style. Nothing wrong with that. Every tune on \\"Guitar Town\\" is a classic (and yes, I love \\"Little Rock and Roller\\") that has only managed to get better with time. Do yourself a huge favor and go pick this one up. Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Reissue","review":"This unprecedented MCA country reissue restates with authority the earth-shattering importance of Steve Earle's Dylanesque masterpiece, 'Guitar Town.' Exerting continuing influence on generations of burgeoning songwriters, this long-awaited singer-songwriter masterpiece has been reissued in orginal warm analog sound, containing a live version of Bruce Springsteen's \\"State Trooper\\" (featuring E-Street Band member Gary Tallent in the listening audience,) more photos from the original downtown session in 1986, and most importantly, insightful liner notes penned by Earle himself which take the listener on a guided tour through the genesis of a cornerstone of what was the most exciting, daring (did someone say best) period in post-Hank Williams Nashville country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country with a little rock: good lyrics and nice sound.","review":"Either heard the title track on the radio or connected to ITunes--I liked the tone of the guitar.

The dimensions of the book only allow 1/72nd scale drawings so the asymmetry of the C.202 wing does not show up well. The port wing is about 5% longer than the starboard. The colors in the profiles are given only in Italian (ex: Grigio Azzuro Chiaro); a table of translations would have been nice. A brief summary of Italian markings would have been helpful; the cowling script \\"4 F. Baracca\\", which appears on both survivors, is a 4 Stormo marking, not a personal marking.But this is picking nits.

This piece begins with a few strikes of metallic percussion which serve to prepare & to tone dramatically. After that, the music is simultaneously dark & spiritual. Most early contrapuntal composers had the problem of being directed in their music by where the notes could go; Josquin told the notes what he wanted them to do, & they did it. The way he sets up melodic directions, expectations, follow-through & reaction here is wonderful. Of all the great work he did in his life, it's fair to call this his most monumental piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"was a wonderful gazebo","review":"We loved it.

Case in point, many of the stories contained in the book derive from the period prior to Loori's zen training thirty years earlier . The message: If you want to dance with life, avoid becoming a \\"zen master\\" -- bad for the soul , and deeply damaging to any kind of authentic artistic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just a read through, but a journey.","review":"I must say that this book spoke to me on a very deep level. I read a couple of lines from it while browsing and was stopped cold. In those few words Mr Loori had summed up much of what my life was about. This touched me so profoundly that I knew the book was for me, tears actually began to well in my eyes. One does not merely read this book, one enters it, as a practice, as a journey, one of great personal discovery. In a section titled \\"Jeweled Mirror\\" the author covers feedback groups and how to view art, not from the standpoint of criticism, but from the feelings evoked. He has a photograph and instruction for quieting the mind and viewing the image in a specific way. It is an amazing exercise! This book opens ones eyes to more than creative possibilities, but to deep personal insights as well. You cannot enter it and leave unchanged, unless you are already a Buddha."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spirituality and creativity","review":"The Zen of Creativity is not only an artist's guide to enhance your creativity. It is also a journey into the Zen philosophy with the guidance of a great master.

One released a most beautiful and inspiring album called \\"Disconnect\\" in 1999. This is the other group.Despite the above being clear after less than 20 seconds of listening, one decided to persevere with this 6 track EP out of curiousity. After the 4th track, one could bear it no longer and gave up. Out of tune vocals, incessant guitars and a completely homogeneous background to the point where it was difficult to tell one track from the next. The experience was only comparable to sitting in a small space with poor acoustics and a great deal of background noise (eg. a crowded bar on a busy evening) listening to a live band.This group is not to be hated with either political or religious zeal. However, they are completely bereft of any musical talent and the knowledge that such a work could be brought into existence is, frankly, depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love the color.

I like it though. It isn't that bad. In fact it's probably nice music when you're trying to cook dinner or just sitting out. I have to say, the most beautiful track is Chaka Khan's \\"Beatutiful\\" I know Christina Aguilera's version, I'm sure everyone's heard it, but I will go head to head with anyone who says that CA's version is better. Chaka Khan sang this song like it was written for her and she sang it like she was the only one who had the authority to sing it. And there's also a lot of nice little gems like, \\"I Like the Way You Move,\\" and \\"At Last.\\" Come on people, it's not like you're reviewing classsical jazz, this is Smooth Jazz staple and plenty of people obviously like it.

Well, if that's true, I am not sure that makes him necessarily \\"musical.\\" All I can tell you is that his \\"bleating\\" and \\"whining\\" kazoo-like tenor sax is sure to annoy anyone with a real ear for music. This album is accurately named since it does take your breath away and prevent the listener from taking a mental breath with the musician. His \\"improvisations\\" nearly all identical in texture and pattern are perfectly suited to the grocery stores, dental offices and shopping malls his tunes are mostly heard, since you can only take this music in little doses. I will say that he does wisely choose first class arrangers and back up musicians to accompany him, but that screechy sax the glamourous Kenny plays is nothing more than ego, vanity and hype. How this delicate looking character with his abrasive instrument became popular is beyond all logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painkillers Should Be Included.","review":"Well with the likes of Barbra Streisand, Gladys Knight and David Sanborn this should be a good album right??

Rather, his music continues to be that omnipresent, insipid barrage of musical yuppieness that has found its way into Weather Channel forecasts, gas-guzzling SUV's, Starbucks, and of course, the dentist office.It is obvious that the musicians he collaborated with here were in it for the money, as Mr. G. has been for the last 20 years.

Kenny G is a horrible saxophonist, and all he plays are simplistic lines that people can wrap their heads around easily. If you want to listen to a great saxophonist, listen to Kenny Garret.

I recently began the nutisystem program and although the food is good, I crave homecooking once and awhile and this helps keep me on track.I have read ALOT of diet books over the years and this made points about needing varied tastes, textures and varieties to keep a dieter satisfied - -I don't think I have ever seen that emphasiized prior to this book. The recipes are slightly out of date as to the use of sweetners and a few other things, but nothing that can't be altered and all the dishes I have tried are good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not for me","review":"Buy the book and make your own recipes, do not order the program.

As a matter of fact, I have not seen the fantastic insights in Sacred Sex ANYWHERE else, and I've read plenty of books on the subject. If someone actually took the time to read the book in its entirety, they would find that the focus of Dr. Gardner's argument is that for true Oneness to occur inside the bedroom, it MUST occur outside the bedroom first. Even more, they must understand the depth of the spiritual oneness in the act of making love that God built into the system. It's new. It's right. Read it. Apply it. It will change your marriage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sex Is HOLY,Its More About ONENESS Than About ORGASM","review":"Sex IS HOLY. Its for MARRIED persons ONLY. A form of worship to God. He is present when you express your love to your mate. It's about your oneness with God and your love for God. You are loving God like God loves you unconditionally when you obey Him. Sex between a husband and wife is expressing that love. Outside of marriage sex is a sin that seperates you from God. Sin is DEATH. When you love God, you love what God loves and HATES what God Hates. God Hates SIN of any kind. Fornication and adultery is sex outside of the marriage covenant. Both are sins that says I choose to seperate myself from God and DIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that bad","review":"this book can not satisfy you ..you must go to the text books to understand..but give you an idea about the topics neaded for DAT"},{"rating":"1","title":"flowers","review":"when i got the plants half the leaves were broken . i emailed the company and the returned my money even though they really didn't have to because the plants are still alive .there honest ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued by Adobe","review":"Effective November 15, 2003, Adobe will no longer distribute LiveMotion 2.0.

I recommend this whole-heartedly, with contempt or ill-intention, to ANYONE who enjoys great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Country isn't a sufficient label","review":"I love how the dark humor, eerie, country/folk presented in this cd lurks! Blanche reminds me of entertainment that would have come about during the Great Depression, had the Coen brothers needed a soundtrack.I copied this from their website www.blanchemusic.com:In Blanche, the band resembles a dolled-up meeting of the Stepford Wives and a Lawrence Welk gospel special. Live, the band kind of lulls the audience into their dark, awkward world, and gradually builds intensity toward a frenetic finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best of times, worst of times","review":"Like a Dickens novel, this album contains a couple of really great tunes, ala \\"Who's to Say\\" or \\"Jack on Fire\\". But there are some real stinkers as well, \\"The Hopeless Waltz\\" among them. At times, Blanche creates serenity out of chaos, but all too often their attempt at bridling disharmony results in a lot of white noise. If you're a fan of Blanche, then you might try this CD.

It's like put putting wheels on an extension ladder, or giving a fish a bike!When used \\"correctly\\", it holds my full size men's hybrid bike by wedging between the tire and the middle of the spokes.

I realize that it would stay upright if I didn't hit it. But a bike standing in a rack ought to be able to withstand a gentle nudge without falling over.I've examined these several times to make sure I've assembled them correctly - I think it's just a faulty design. The wheels help get the whole thing rolling, and once they slide just a bit after tapping the bike, the bike is history.Maybe the folks who like these racks are just less clumsy than I am. Well - that's almost certainly true. But still, these are too prone to allowing my bikes to fall.Soon headed for the dumpster..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Hold a Mountain Bike","review":"Bought this to store my chrome mountain bike.

Maybe I should keep it in my carpeted living room!So, I thought, maybe I should take the wheels off? Then it just tips right over.Oh, and when it does manage to stay up (2 minutes, max)... the stand puts pressure on the spokes of the wheel. This is a terribly bad design. Don't waste your money. Look elsewhere..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my garage","review":"Excellent if seemingly a bit pricey. It works like a charm. Because it's adjustable to fit various widths of tires, it manages to stand the bike perfectly. And the rollers really are more than just a hype. Moving the bikes around (I bought 2) is effortless and helpful - they tuck into small areas. No more marring paint by leaning the bikes against the lawn mower. I'll probably buy another couple of them for the other bikes cluttering up my garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistency Counts","review":"Just saw these guys live last night when they opened for Louis XIV and Hot Hot Heat. I hadn't heard of them and I really wasn't breaking my neck to get to the club early enough to catch their set because I rarely find the opening act to be as good as the headliner. Well I did end up making it to the show in time to catch their performance and boy was I surprised! They actually sounded good! Now don't get me wrong. This is not the most incredible band I've ever heard.They sound kind of like Hot Hot Heat, but without the keyboard and effects. Nothing to special or unique. But what they do, they do it well. They are very energetic and their songs are irresistably catchy. Dancing Song, Charlie The Russian, and Modern Trance were a few of the stand outs for me, but there really weren't any songs that they played that I absolutely didn't like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good band, pretty good cd","review":"WSC has a pretty good base here in DC. Opening for groups at the 9:30 Club and taking the stage at the Black Cat, they've continued to increase their exposure- which eventually led me to them. I was happy when they put out the cd, because while I tend to enjoy less well-known bands, I dont want them to remain obscure for my benefit.The group is pretty damn good. So's their cd. In addition to their music, they've got a pretty funny vibe, as they poke fun in their songs and at their concerts. I'd suggest you put up the money for the cd, even if you're just curious about them.Oh, and the 5 stars is just cause they're from DC and I've seen them a ton of times. The cd is probably really a 4.."},{"rating":"2","title":"This band is amazing.","review":"I just caught them live last night. They blew me away. Their energy is unstoppable, their music is innovative and catchy, without being poppy whatsoever. Clever lyrics as well.

This is by far the best vocal trance CD ever made. My favorites are Walking in the Sky, Open Your Eyes, Stay, Chemistry and I see you right through you.If you like trance that is not just pure repetitive boring beats, you must have Intuition.This collaboration between DJ Encore and Engelina is perfection. Too bad, there's no news on whether they are making another album or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing","review":"After hearing Walking in the Sky and I See Right Through to You on the radio a while ago, I decided that I should try out the full album Intuition just to see what they're like. Needless to say, this entire CD is just absolutely awesome. It's got the album version of the big hit Walking in the Sky (the radio and album versions differ greatly in this case), along with the other hit I See Right Through To You. For the songs that aren't so widely played on the radio, I was pleasantly suprised. I truly enjoyed all but 2 of the non-radio songs on the CD. The songs on this CD have some really awesome beats, and everything just seems to flow together perfectly. This CD just makes you want to get up and dance. It's one of those CDs that you can listen to over and over again and still enjoy. I absolutely can not get enough of this CD, and my best guess is that if you are remotely interested in the genre of dance music, you will love this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL HITS FROM BEGINNING TO END!!","review":"Super CD in every way.

Engelina has an angelic voice and mixes PERFECTLY with the background. The beats are great!

One of my best buys ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel Good Album of the Year","review":"Intuition not only will make you want to dance, it will make you fall in love, sing the words, and turn up that volume. From beautiful slow songs with Engelina's angelic voice to encore's hot dance techno/trance mixes that make you want to get up and jam...you defintly can find yourself making a connection with this album. My personal favorites are chemistry, youve got a way, out there and open your eyes. Let the music be apart of you with Engelina's gourgeous voice...and Andreas B. Henneth's (encore)tite beats!"},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 SONG!!!!!!","review":"I See Right Through To You is the best song i've ever heard! Geez, its soooo good! I cant even tell you how good it is! Walking in the sky and high on life are great too, but my favorite is definetly I See Right Through To You! It so good that i cant even explain it in words! Engelina has THE prettest voice, and DJ Encore mixes the BEST music! Just listen to it. You think the same after that! I wish i could rate it 100 stars, but i know that i cant do that. Oh Well! Youll listen to this all day long! You should also check out Lasgo if you like this CD too. My favorite song of hers: 1. Alone, 2. Something, 3.Surrender. There really funky and are very fast. And you shold also see Darude's song Sandstorm. Theres no volcals in it, but it is SUPER fast and VERY great at parties or just dancing around to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Music","review":"This CD is awesome!

This wonderful tale is not in that class, but if you're looking for a terrific read, look into this prime example of an amusing and surprising thriller. Just think, the book has the following elements for your excitement: spies, bratty young movie stars, exotic men and women, illicit drugs, sex, trains, planes, airports, foreign locales in the exciting far east, and plot puzzlers that will keep you guessing.

It had too much going on and was written in hard to understand words. I had to keep refering to the dictionary. I am by no means illiterate. I have a BA degree with a minor in English.

In terms of listening expierence, I would listen to this CD at a very LOW volume, perferably on mute.

Katharine Graham was alive and wealthy during the most exciting half of American history, and she shares her view from the front row with the reader. Graham didn't just experience the Kennedy asassination--she flew to the White House that evening, and rode around in LBJ's golf cart a few weeks later. She knows the skewed views her upbringing afforded her and she addresses that issue right away, with what can only be described as self-effacing humour. Her frankness about husband Phil Graham is admirable--if she held anything back in this book the reader can surmise the truth from her descriptions of their general relationship. This account has the quotations and exhaustive research of a text book, and you will not find a more charming guide. If only fiction could be as action-packed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great personal and pro. perspective into the life of KG.","review":"This book had huge impact on breast-fed Republican ideals I've had(I am now aligned with the Independant Party) in understanding a legitimate, passionate liberal working in the media. A rich trip down memory lane when Katherine tackles the 60's, 70's to current times. If you like bio's, you will really like this one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacks warmth, but the facts alone make an amazing story.","review":"Most of us baby-boomers have felt that our mothers could have done extraordinary things if only they'd not been so completely repressed and shoved down by the male-dominated culture of the 50's and 60's. Katharine Graham proves us right with her Cinderella story of being thrust into a leadership position completely unprepared and lacking in confidence. She rose to every occaision, mostly by sheer will and tenacity, and has become one of the most successful publishers and business people in the twentieth century. I'd have liked to hear more about the toll this took on her children's lives, but the choice to omit that portion of the story was obviously carefully and thoughtfully made. This book completely deserves the Pulitzer prize it earned Ms. Graham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lacking in self confidence","review":"I enjoyed this book, but it almost seemed that Katharine was never happy with what she had in the beginning and lacked in self confidence. I think that towards the end though, her confidence did as well as her style. My teacher purchased this book for me because he thought I might enjoy it and that it presented a good lesson to learn. It did. I recommend this book to teenagers like myself to show that women can do anything!Melody"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn Up the Letters & Tell Your Story","review":"This book is huge. The highlights of K. Graham's life do seem interesting but there are too many insignificant stories in between. Because the author decides to include ALL the details of life, both personal and professional (as well as the personal and professional of those Graham is close to, the book drones on and on.) I found too much name dropping. Another main complaint is that it is written with so many documents quoted. Each page is a letter to/from Graham or someone else. There is so little story and so much \\"he said\\" \\"she said\\". I would have liked it better if she just burned up the letters and told her story. She was involved in interesting times, but let's face it, she was on the perifery. No book needs to be this long!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whitewash","review":".. a whitewash by one of the most ruthless power-brokers in the history of American publishing. One reviewer suggested that Mz Graham might be a good role model for girls. Really? I can't help but be reminded of \\"The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie\\" in which General Franco is held out as the same. She was never interested in a free press and said as much in a speech at Langley in 1988. And if there was ever any doubt, consider her suppression of the biography authored by Deborah Davis (as difficult to find as another under-the-radar portrait of a demagogue, \\"L. Ron Hubbard: Messiah or Madman?\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising, unexpected, revealing, and comforting.","review":"I did not know that I would find out about how Jews coming from Europe became a part of this country. I did not expect to read about antisemitism and its evolution during the 20th century. Then, the description of her childhood and her becoming-a-woman years, it is so real,like the lack of awareness of her own strengths and worth. Later, her transformation into a wife, so different from what we live now that some people (see other reviews) think it never existed. And finally, the ugly duckling became a swan. She lived, she loved, she worked, she made mistakes and recovered, she had friends and she was a mother. A good, full life. If she could, we can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story; Badly Edited","review":"While I enjoyed the details of Katherine Graham's life and work history, I regularly was reminded of the nearly absent editorial assistance that is cried out for in the text. However, even though the cliches and flawed writing intruded objectionably, the narrative is still engrossing at times, especially Watergate and the newspaper strike. Recommended (but should NOT have been given the Pulizer Prize)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written,inspirational, women's lib, & political history","review":"Mrs. Graham's autobigography reads like a novel.It's hard to put down. For anyone who hasmarvelled at her strength and wondered howshe managed, she gives the answer: guts.Inspirational for anyone facing tough cicumstances to know thatfeelings of inadequacy don't count, actions do.The role of women changed dramatically during herlife and this book cronicles those changes well.Her honesty is touching.Her stories of polictical intrigue provideinsight into the political process and this bookhighlights the turning point in our relationshipwith our leaders.

I would have thought that a professional journalist would have been able to write a \\"personal history\\" with less whining."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tediously long whitewash of a biased public life","review":"Kay Graham's prose style is acceptable enough, but shegoes on much much too long about her life, exceeding 600pages handily. It's tedious! Some of the episodes inacquiring different papers or in her marital life just aren'tworthy of such detailed remembrance.She is, understandably, silent on her paper's shameful record oftacking to one political party under her ownership, althoughshe seems willing to excoriate her dead husband, who can'tdefend himself, for some of the editorial decisions that HEmade. Like all autobiographies, this one is meant to make the writer look like a paragon. I'm not buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapointment from a great woman.","review":"While this book is interesting, it is also slightly artificial. Other female meditators, like Frida Kahl an Anne Truitt, have been far more successful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been titled: The Life of a Corporate Cheerleader","review":"From what I understand in the news you won't see read by Peter Jennings or his ilk, this woman made a career of ruining a formerly liberal paper, crushing the printing press union and setting the tone for the hiring across picket lines that permeated throughout the eighties and nineties (see air traffic controllers and Ronald Reagan), and remained close buddies with those of dubious morality in government with the likes of Henry Kissinger (Pol Pot's pal), of which she should have been exposing as the war criminals they were. - If this is a story about how wealthy white women can rise to power in journalism using the same underhanded tactics and corporate interests as wealthy white men, well then I guess she deserves the credit of those wanting us to continue consuming with our heads held firmly in the sand. \\"What a woman\\"? Indeed. It goes to show there is equality in preserving inequality after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best and most enjoyable I have ever read","review":"As an ardent reader of autobiographies, I found Katherine Graham, A Personal History, one of the best and most enjoyable I have ever read. As a member of the media, her insights into this period of American history absolutely fascinating. Her frankness, especially with her personal life, was key to the greatness of this book. Loved it. AE"},{"rating":"1","title":"An editor's nightmare","review":"Katharine Graham would have been well served by an editor willing to cut 300+ pages from this wordy autobiography. It has a disconcertingly whiny tone throughout, from Graham's airing her deeply-held resentments toward her mother (at age 70!) to her husband's mistreatment of her, although she admits to have been something of a doormat during the marriage. Most disturbing, however, is Graham's gradual revelation of her lack of involvement in the Post's editorial or business success--all while wringing her hands over her lack of business savvy. And this won the Pulitzer Prize?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An author who is more interesting than her book","review":"I looked forward to reading this because I thought Katharine Graham has led an interesting live. The reviews were outstanding. After reading the book, I am of the opinion that the reviewers reviewed Katherine Graham's life, not her book. If ever a good editor was needed, it was during the first third of this book. I ended up where I began - interesting life. Can't wait for the biography. Ms. Graham did not bring herself to life. I could never picture her in her house or at the dinner table. I felt she kept us at something more than arm's length. And while she shared some very personal events, I never felt the emotional impact"},{"rating":"2","title":"Right in the middle of Washington D.C.

The book includes many minor details about unimportant events. Her repetitive declarations about the paper's impartiality get annoying pretty quickly.If you want to read about an important, powerful woman, go read Margaret Thatcher's Downing Street Years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Papa, Phil and Post - A Real Title","review":"Katherine took this venue to mention every person she ever met for fear they read the book and didn't see their name. It made me laugh. I felt like I was reading a loose version of a history book and not really about a woman, mother, wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly well written and moving true story","review":"Once I made it through the first 75 pages of this book, I was absolutely hooked on every word Graham said. I starting reading some time in the morning and read almost nonstop until I finished the next day. Incredible information and personal insight into both the Washington Post and Graham herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best memoir i ever read","review":"If you want a great life, then read this book !If the book's length is daunting, then think of it as, say, 2 books. Savor Ms Kay Graham's book all the way through. Would that i could take her out to a nice, fun lunch after reading this fine book. You may feel the same way. I have never found a memoir altogether as loving, detailed, intelligent, and full of refreshingly blunt & helpful insights & lessons--full of interesting people & stories. There are good laughs in here for you to enjoy: You will not enjoy these elsewhere.Let us be grateful Kay Graham wrote this book. If you ask me, she is 1 of America's greatest women.This good lady hit some especially tough challenges. I will be incredibly grateful if i handle same with such skill as she summoned from herself & her people.Enjoy a printed-on-paper old-tech copy: It is unabridged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I listened to this audio version for an upcoming book discussion. Somehow it just didn't work for me. Based upon all the wonderful remembrances and comments about Graham, I expected a fascinating, insightful story about one woman's journey from sheltered childhood, through a difficult loss and on into a rewarding, powerful role at the Post. I just didn't get it--it must be me. I found this shortened tape version to be a 'poor little rich girl's' tale of woes--some of which sounded like a lot of stiff-jawed whining. I still think there is much to be admired in Graham's eventual rise to a powerful position, but she just didn't tell me about it in a way I could relate to. And, rather than telling me about the political, Washington background behind some of those difficult decisions (Watergate, Pentagon papers), Graham summed those decisions up in a helpless sounding nutshell. Perhaps this was because I heard the abridged version?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book for kids over 5.","review":"The book is about a boy who moves from Vermont because his parents have divorced. In his new town he doesn't have any friends, until he sees a street that begins on P Street that is invisible to almost everyone but him. The people who live on this street are very nice. At the beginning the book was a little boring, but when you got to the middle it started getting exciting and I could not put it down. Towards the end, the book was exciting and a little sad. The ending was happy and sad at the same time, depending upon who you are thinking about. My favorite part of the book was when there was a party in Pineapple Place and August gave strange gifts to each person living in Pineapple Place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strange gift","review":"I received this book from an uncle at my Bat Mitzvah in 1983. I couldn't understand why he gave it to me. Then I read it and understood. This book is fabulous. When I became a teacher, this book was always the first \\"read-aloud\\" book of the year. No matter how old they were, they could never get enough of it! I even had kids writing stories of their own based on this book, taking the characters to new places! It is one of the best books about friendship that I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Judge this book by its cover - and the story is delightful too","review":"This is another great recommendation from Carole Joy Seid. What would I do without her???It's difficult to find a book with a main character is a BOY, but here you have a gem! August is a boy of fine qualities while dealing with the difficult circumstances of his parents divorce and a move to another city.August is a boy you would like to have as a neighbor, and a friend to your own children.

It is packed full of New Western History ideals. Despite its topical form, the book still allows for a firm grasp of the chronology.

My 5-year-old kicked at it the whole trip and just before we got home, he said he didn't like them, pulled on the top of it and the stitching to the laces that hold it to the headrest just ripped right out.I would not buy these again.We have some gray, fabric seat protectors that we purchased at Wal-mart a couple of years ago, made by Fisher Price, but cannot find those anymore.

His songs are engaging and leave you wanting more. His style of writing is so unique among the current song writers, that it's refreshing to get an honest, down to eath song with every track. I can listen to his music over and over and always hear something new each time. This third album, I hope, is just one more in a long line to come.

I've always been a sucker for romantic tunes, and Paisley describes love in such a vivid way in his music, that even people who aren't in love know what it's like to know that special someone. My boyfriend kids me all the time, because he says that Brad must have been spying on us when he wrote, \\"she lost all track of time and burnt the cake,\\" cuz I can never really do anything the way it should be done. But I've been with my boyfriend now for 3 years so I must be doing all the wrong things in all the right ways :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Listening","review":"This album is a very good collection of songs, sung by a very talented young man. Especially worth hearing is track #9, Whiskey Lullaby, in which Brad is joined by Alison Krauss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have","review":"Like many others, Brad Paisley was my crossover artist to country music. When my friend started playing Little Moments in her car one day, I was officially hooked. The difference between Paisley and most other artists is that the majority of his songs on the album are better than just average. It's not like the rest of the songs are there to fill space...they mean something. There are the moving songs like Somebody Knows You Now and Whiskey Lullaby, the humorous songs such as Famous People and That's Love, and with songs like Farther Along and Is It Raining at your House that round off the album with a bit of classic country, it's easy to feel as though you've made a great purchase. This really is a must-have album for country fans and a must-try for any other music lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Brad Paisley!","review":"This album is a real treasure to listen to over, and over again! The music is real with songs that reflect true, deep feelings. There is also plenty of humor mixed in, as Mr. Paisley often does with his music. The man has amazing talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this mud is worth your money...........","review":"well this being brad's 3rd album, (and best so far) is well worth any penny you could pay for any album out there. not only is brad more talented than any one person should be, this album is filled with his county/jazz style that will rock anyone, especially musicians in every field, and his lyrics range from serious to funny. so it is well rounded for music lovers. and of course his duet with the wonderful allison krauss on \\"whisky lullabye\\" is mind-blowing. a needed album for everyone to have.p.s. his new album \\"time well wasted\\" is also a needed album in everyones collection.a brad fan and fellow musician, rossy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah For Bold Women","review":"The work Rivka Solomon put into this book is amazing.

The style is very rambling and much of the book is a tirade against those who don't believe in astrology. There is not much of substance here for the astrologer. The book could have used a good editor. Much is repetitious. Many \\"facts\\" are inaccurate (such as saying that Morinus was a Catholic Bishop or that with the Sun in Aquarius, the Full Moon will be in Libra). The book is mildly interesting since Sydney Omarr played a role in popularizing astrology in the last century. His comments on number symbolism appeared inaccurate and did not describe the people I tried applying them to. It's light and quick reading. If you're interested, it's probably best to borrow this from the library.

I've painted professionally in the past and know how time consuming it is to edge. It has some pros and cons, but generally, I don't believe this item is worth it. It definitely will save time in edging. However, it doesn't make the cut at between the ceiling and the wall. It will paint 1/8\\" on the ceiling or trim, because of how the bristles are designed. There is no real way around this. If you don't mind having an even cut edge on your ceiling, then this product may be fine for you. However, after using it on (3) bedrooms, (2) bathrooms, and a hallway, it's not worth it. I just had to go back the old fashion way with a paintbrush. Just buy a good quality chisel-edge paintbrush (Purdy) and practice a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"You buy a mess","review":"It's a good idea in theory - the wheels guide the painting pad along the edge. But in reality, the bristles at the edge smears the ceiling all the time, the wheels also pick up paint and smear the ceiling. And it doesn't work on the wall trims since the wheels can't get a grip on the narrow trim. You pay to test this theory, and end up with a big mess. I went back to masking tapes after I tried, and I had the extra work to clean up the ceiling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This works amazing -- for the first 10 feet or so... then it gets covered in paint and makes you wish you had used tape.

When I got home, firt I had to break into the package. Does the company think someone is going to \\"tamper\\" with a fancy paintbrush? After I destroyed the packaging to get the product out I attempted to do as the instructions said. Luckily I had read them before destroying the package to remove the product. The problem started immediately when I raised the guides as the instructions had said to do, floated the pad in a layer of paint, and then tried to remove the edger with the pad still intact. The pad kept coming off and stuck to the paint in the tray. The the handle kept turning when I didn't want it to. This product is terrible! It ended up costing me more time than saving. Ended up using just a standard edger which did a much better job. Do not waste your money on this piece of junk. Great idea, bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever seen a painter use one of these? Me neither.","review":"There is a reason pro painters never use these things....they do not preform as well as a good brush. Think about it, if a painter could save and hour per room by using this tool, don't you think he would have a whole box full? These things are for people with no idea what they are doing and are satisfied with a mediocre paint job. You are probably going to paint a lot more rooms in your life time, so do yourself a favor, buy a really good chisel edged angled brush and make yourself learn how to cut in. It's not that hard and then you won't waste any more money on these cheap gimmicks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Binned after 5 Mins.","review":"I will stick to the time old method with paint brush.Had the product sent from the States to my address in England and whether or not they thought they could send a duff one it certainly worked.Flimsy...Wobbly are just 2 things to describe the poor quality item.Never again will I order from abroad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!","review":"Never tape again!This little gadget is such an amazing time-saver. I will never again paint without it. I bought it as the last minute, a total impulse buy and I saved myself hours of heartache and work by giving in to that impulse.Once you load it with paint - carefully so as to not get paint on the wheels - you can just glide it across the wall, creating a smooth, clean edge either between wall and ceiling or around trim.Note - it probably works best with a smooth ceiling, if you have textured or popcorn I think you won't get such a clean line. But if you have a smooth ceiling or trim to work with, it'll be great. I just painted the ceilings and trim white and then did the edging in the wall color after the white dried. I honestly shudder to think of how much time it would have taken to either tape or to edge by hand. Cannot praise this highly enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great tool for trim work","review":"I'm working on painting an old house right now that has lots of trim work (flat base molding, window, door jams etc.) This is a great tool for getting things painted quickly.

This afternoon, I just finished painting three rooms with the Shur-Line. It was so much better using this. I don't hate painting anymore! I only give the product 4 stars because the paint pads break down a little too quickly on our knockdown texture wall. If you're painting any sort of texture, buy the extra paint pads, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE careful","review":"If you're going to use this thing, get the \\"Shur Line Pro\\" with the retractable guides. The model with just the wheels is GOING TO PUT PAINT where you don't want it eventually, no matter how careful you are. The model with the guides works, but you still have to be careful using it (don't forget to retract the guides when you are loading paint on the pad, etc). If you are patient and careful, with the pro model, it can be a great time saver..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shur-Line Edger","review":"This is the worst gadget on the market for painting the so called \\"perfect edge\\".

But the quality is horrible. You have to have an iron-steady arm to hold the thing tight so it doesn't mess up the ceiling or door trims. The painting is streaky, you have to carefully use roller on top of it to smooth the texture (while at the same time trying not to get too close to the ceiling). And it could get messy applying paint to this thing - you can easily get paint all over it.And it doesn't work on the baseboard lines since the wheels can't hold on to it.So bottom line, use it if you desperately want to avoid taping no matter what.

After playing with it for about an hour I got it to work and understand to use it.

You can't upload the maps only the tacks. The reason I bought it was to upload the maps. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & buggy","review":"This topo map software was a severe disappointment. . Opening files slow even on a newer iMac running OS 10.5. It takes over 3 minutes to open a file with a saved route and zoom in to the most detailed level. Scrolling across a map is painfully slow.The software crashes frequently when trying to use features such as marking a route or calculating an elevation profile along a route.In addition, the road information is very inaccurate.

And you will if you ever buy a new computer, and everybody buys a new computer occasionally.The maps are operating system-specific. On course, operating systems change from time to time (Vista, XP, Windows 7 etc).So your maps won't load on your new computer. Nat Geo has a website that purports to tell you how to manage the problem, but the instructions are very poor. If you email them for support, they just spit back to you canned stuff from the website. When you ask them for a live person to talk to, they give you a telephone number, but when you call the number you just get a recording sending you back to the email system.And I'm reasonably computer savvy.It's really disgraceful, and not at al what I would expect for a reputable company or a pretty pricey product. If you buy this product, you need to accept that it becomes useless when you replace your computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"not intuitive to use, roads not accurately placed","review":"I am a professional geologist and use maps everyday. This product disappointed me in several respects:1. Moving around on the maps and zooming in and out is not at all intuitive. Google maps is much easier.2. Printing only gives limited options and paper sizes.3. Recent roads and trails, plotted in magenta, are often out of place and/or inaccurately plotted. In many cases, the topo maps have a a better position of the road/trail. For example, the magenta-version of the Iditarod trail, in the vicinity of Rainy Pass, takes off willy-nilly across the hills; its position on the original topo maps, where plotted, appears to be correct.4. Exporting the maps to a jpg fill is also limited.In short, although this product does provide, after a fashion, most of the topo maps for Alaska, it is definitly NOT a first class product. I would have expected something better, but I suppose this is a dumbed-down consumer version of the maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for creating cycing routes & elevation profiles","review":"I returned this software after discovering that routes must be hand drawn on a map which makes it impossible to stay on roads, and precludes long routes due to the need to zoom out beyond the view that would include most roads.

Dropping curling/flat irons has never been a problem in the past -- nothing has ever broken -- but with this FHI the metal panels have broken away & they just dangle by the cords that heat them. This happened about half a year after buying, but I've been able to manage by sliding the panels back in place & holding the flat iron carefully so they didn't slip out again. But finally, after 1.5 yrs, one of the cords that keep the panel dangling has split. I'm hoping this time around I won't drop the iron.

The album itself is alright. I've never really been a fan of live albums. To me, live albums are nothing but second rate versions of the songs from actual albums, but I really did dig the few unreleased tracks. When it comes to the DVD, my only real complaint is that the concert footage was too short. The \\"making of\\" The Taste of Ink and Buried Myself Alive are also just okay. They are short and fun, but don't really add anything other than a few behind the scenes shots (set to like a music montage instead of actual interviews).

The whole map is laminated and at the points where the map folds there's a break in the map so only the clear plastic lamination folds. I thought it was kind of weird at first to have breaks in the map like that, but then I realized that this way would keep roads/towns on the creases from becoming hard to read over time, and I think that's pretty clever. The front of the map has central MD and DE, the back has the panhandle and some city insets. The map isn't terribly huge, so there's not really much detail beyond the main roads, but since that's what I wanted I'm ok with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap strap clips","review":"Nice bag (in fact I bought it because I have had another one for many years) but the strap's clips are garbage.

That being said, I think it was an interesting and rather intriguing concept but slowed and lagged after 45 minutes. The first half is very good especially how the town is introduced to us and how the director shows the intrigue build when we see the notebook with the dates of when people died. But after that is seems to lose itself and the climax was rather flat considering the build up leading to it. I expected something on the same level as the Lottery. I also thought that the son had a stronger moral and ethical streak in him than the father, whom I thought was being kind of selfish.

This one works for me as advertised. I would give five stars but for a few clunky idiosyncracies that have always been present in GoLive.

A finely engineered production of easy listening, bluesy music conveying deep, emotional messages on the value of children and how the court system often mishandles these innocent bundles of humanity. The music and voice production is smooth, convincing and a joy to the ears. Even more convincing are the deep-felt, thought-provoking lyrics by Craig Deanto, an individual who lives the experience he expresses in each song, including the concluding track in which he personally conveys his message and hope. This is a moving production that warrants repeated play on the air and in the heart of all who really care about the children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Think Twice","review":"I strongly do not recommend this instrument to any potential buyer. I had a new clarinet student who was given this clarinet by her parents who were not experienced clarinet buyers. When my student recieved this clarinet it could not be peiced together. The corks were in need of considerable sanding. Also It was very difficult to keep the clarinet in tune. Even a beginning player should have had an easier time with it. Those parents looking for a cheap instrument for their new music student should think twice and buy something with more quality. A child who posseses this instrument can become easily discouraged and will want to give up because they think playing it is too difficult. A decent beginners clairinet will quickly help. Ask a reputable dealer for suggetions. It will make a world of difference to your child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christian recording artist's take on life","review":"Singer/songwriter Carolyn Arends shows her versatility by authoring this book, and a fine first effort it is. Similar ground has been covered before by others (Philip Yancey, John Fischer, etc.) but Carolyn writes from the perspective of her own life experiences. Questions and doubts are part of any honest Christian's life, and Arends shares honestly about the uncertainties and fears in her own life, as an artist, wife, and mother. She shows much promise as an author, and it will be interesting to see her growth in this area over the years (although I'm afraid I'll have to pass on her next book, since it is geared toward pregnant women!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm heading to the feed store to buy my chicks...","review":"Just moved to a two-acre home in Alaska, and the dirt yard reminded me of the old folks -- and their chickens -- back home.

But could I really do it: Raise my own little flock in North Pole, Alaska, where it's dry dry dry and the temperatures can dip to -50 and stay there in the winter?The answer is yes, and thank goodness for this book and for those who reviewed it before me. I now have enough information to know how to talk to poultry folk in their lingo, what questions to ask, how to build a proper coop, which breeds are better for eggs and which for fryers, what to do about vermin and predators...

I have found this book to be the least helpful of the four \\"Raising Chickens\\" books I have recently read.We just got started raising Chickens on 5/1/2002 and were complete beginners with no prior knowledge of what we were doing. I purchased a few books and borrowed a few from the library. I am glad I borrowed this one instead of buying it. Unlike the others I have read, there is almost no detail included in this text. While the reading is somewhat entertaining, I found very little useful information in it. Most of this book contains very general information at best. A much better reference for beginners is \\"Storey's Guide to Raising Chickens.\\" It is significantly more complete and yet still an easy read. I would not recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little outdated","review":"It states in the book to have the temp. in a still air incubator at 102 degrees.

Islamic slavery begain with Mohammed and continued until the 1900\\"sfor 200 years after slavery had been abolished in the west. Saudi Arabia did not abolish slavery until 1964, Kuwait did not abolish slavery until 1968. Slavery is Islamic as daily prayers. Robert Segal documents the fact that 11 million Black Africans were kidnapped from their homes and sold into slavery in the Ummayad, Abassid and Ottoman empires. The general practice was to castrate the males and press them into military service. No Muslim can object to slavery as it was fully endorsed by Mohammed and it become the military modus operandi of the successors to Mohammed who successfully used slavery soldier in their campaigs of conquest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must Historical Book","review":"Very well and detailed written ,this book gives you an insight on the enslaved Muslims in America then no other Book that I have read so far.It gives you an insight on the situation in Africa (Political and economical )at the time when slavery started and contiued.Reasons why their own country man where selling each other tribal conflicts and religious differences.It is not a book that is written like a tale it will most likely take you some time to finish reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"African Muslims and the Struggle for Freedom","review":"This book has brought tears to my eyes as well as joy. This book should be read by all people especially those with African descent. We must honor their struggle for freedom. When we honor them we bring honor to ourselves.

Diouf and all those who seek wisdom and knowledge for the sake of freedom, Justice and world peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The strength of truth...","review":"I have researched this area, at least the Americas side of the equation, and published a chapter in another work that dealt with many of the themes so well developed and presented here. Diouf has completed the circle. She demonstrates convincingly that the source areas and other determining factors of the slave trade resulted in significant numbers of Muslims entering the Americas. The impact still resounds today. If you're wondering why Islam is viewed as militancy in this nation of ours, Diouf presents good background that should convince the most doubtful that its origins required it. I am thankful that she had the resources and the intelligence to present cogent arguments about who came here, why, and it is only for us to complete the scenario by acknowledging that Muslims in America are heirs to a great and vital history of resistance to oppression."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but I have one problem","review":"I would have given this book five stars if it wasn't for the strong opinion the author had about another excellent book on the subject. Diouf says in this book that \\"(Dis)Forming the American Canon\\" by Ronald Judy is filled with deconstructionist jargon. The other thing which bothered me about this book was the fact that she failed to mention that Judy's book contains perhaps the best translation and analysis of Ben Ali's \\"Diary\\" even though it's not a full translation.I found the information regarding muslim slave revolts and the muslim legacy most interesting. The discussion about how traces of muslim/arabic culture have been preserved in the african-american culture (many times unknowingly) through poetry and music is particularly interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat frustrating...","review":"You were born on a spaceship traveling between two galaxies.

I wanted to wait a few years before writing a review to see if it could withstand the test of time! She's used it several times, for family camping trips and summer camp overnight campouts (they sleep on tarps on the ground, so not even in tents) and it has kept her snug and warm every time! It is thick, so even sleeping on the ground she is comfortable. I wash it after almost every time she uses it and the filling stays in place. No lumpiness!She is tall for her age (approx. 52\\") and just used it again last week and she still fits in it. I was afraid she would be sticking out the top! I will be sad when she is finally too big for it and I have to replace it.

The VF0060 was on Black Friday sale for dirt-cheap so I decided to give it a try. Many reviewers across the net mentioned difficulties with installation of the VF0060 and that also has been my experience. I even tried a driver downloaded directly from Creative's support website, but that didn't work either. What a waste of time, and what a totally weird product!The VF0060 shall go back to its vendor and I'm using again my old trusty VF0050.To whom it may concern: the computer I tried to install the VF0060 runs on Athlon 64 3400+ with Windows XP SP2 plus all updates and lots of RAM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who designs this crap?","review":"(...) the dumb thing doesn't even have built in audio?

They are Christian punk, but I like them anyway. This album, however, is not their best. I am not much of a fan of Spike, their first singer. The only good album with him is Mud Angels. Even that one isn't great. The greatest album they made is Cashists, Fascists and Other Fungis. This is one of my favorite punk albums of all time. Their guitar player took over vocals as Spike left the band.

He talks about the women he slept with, the property he destroyed, the macho fights he had, and his many times going to jail. Hello, people... take away the \\"I care about animals\\" act, and this guy is obviously just a sociopath who can't get along with anyone or do anything successful in his life. Don't waste your money. A friend gave me this book because he couldn't believe it wasn't fiction about a social reject who found a disturbed nitch for himself. It would be great fiction as character development, but this autobiography just demonstrates an author who's obviously in love with himself and goes to extreme (but sad) lengths to prove it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Animal Rights Wacko on the Warpath","review":"This man is nothing but a terrorist.

How many people still use anything besides their MP3 player to play music anymore. I even offered to buy a digital version of the songs I like best to put on my MP3 player but he is so paranoid that people are going to steal his music that he won't even allow that. All I want to do is play the songs on my MP3 player. They don't do me any good sitting in their cases collecting dust. He got his money.

That Concert was STYX, supporting their Grand Illusion Album, and they didn't even play every song on that album back then. On this DVD, not only do they play Every Song from both albums, in order; but they sound Every Bit as good as on the album!! I am also a Professional Guitarist and Singer, and have been for nearly 37 years; so I am Very Critical, and I know if something sounds a bit \\"off\\". This Concert is among THE BEST I've ever seen and heard....AWESOME!! If you're a Styx Fan, this DVD is a MUST-OWN!!

When I saw this was coming out I pre-ordered it, and I was totally blown away! Some thirty years ago I was into all the progressive rock bands, and I was trying to like Styx because their songs on Crystal Ball were so good, except for the annoying vocal timbre of their lead singer Dennis DeYoung. Grand Illusion changed that, and, thanks to Tommy Shaw, Styx became one of my favorite bands. This line-up is terrific. I can't believe Tommy Shaw still looks and sounds so good. Lawrence Gowan is incredible. Todd Sucherman? One of the best drummers in the world! Of course we're all happy Chuck Panozzo made it through the HIV thing, but Ricky Phillips is a REAL bass player. JY Young shows you how rock guitar should be played, (not so technical but with the right sound and attitude. Same with Tommy Shaw. The production on this DVD is great! The bonus material is great! There's a reason almost everyone is giving this product 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Without Dennis it isn't Styx","review":"Sorry, yes, I know, the music rocks..... fine.But without Dennis DeYoung it isn't Styx.

It is just a semblance of what was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Money","review":"The current version of Styx is just a glorified Styx cover band. JY and Shaw hate DeYoung so much, and yet they have guts to sing the songs that DeYoung composed night after night, tour after tour. They are in for the love of money. They recently removed DeYoung from the history section of Styx's official Web page! Without DeYoung, there would be no Styx.

Todd Sucherman on drums is what Styx needed for so many years.The bass work of Ricky Phillips was very strong.Why bring Chuck Pannazo on for 1 song. Let him go.Cons: Lawrence Gowan sucks as a replacement for Dennis DeYoung.While DeYoung's voice soared, Gowan's voice is harsh and he can not hold a tune. While he tries hard to mimic DeYoung he falls far short. His voice is bothersome and weak.That being said, this is a good concert video. These 2 albums back to back was great.Now, how about doing more of these full album tours and videos.GET DENNIS DEYOUNG BACK.

They should stop trying to do the songs that featured him. He is an irreplaceable presence in their music. Tommy Shaw still retains his greatness but without the Dennis DeYoung/Tommy Shaw collaboration this band is way past their prime. I never really enjoyed the songs featuring Jame Young but they do those songs justice in this rendition.If you're a Tommy Shaw fan, this is worthwhile.If you're a James Young fan, this is a must buyIf you are a Styx or Dennis DeYoung fan, don't even bother.

They played both albums back to back. They rock! They don't just stand there and play...they PERFORM! They are audience friendly, high energy, musical perfectionists who really try to put on a show for the fans!!! Every member contributes their all. Tommy Shaw & JY are more awesome than ever! Gowan is an awesome keyboardist and does some DDY vocals. Those 3 are the \\"showmen\\". Todd, the drummer, is so hard working and Ricky Phillips also adds his talent to the guitar mix. Chuck Panozzo brings nostalgia and his rock ability. The sound was just like the original and it is a great chance to see some awesome songs not performed in their regular shows. Well worth every penny.

But this recording is very different, every phrase is carefully executed dynamics are tightly followed and he really lets the atmosphere of these charming works shine through. Don't get me wrong this is probably one of hamelins finer technical displays and a glance at the terribly unfriendly scores will show as much but he seems to finally have tapped into a tonal refinement that matches his rhythmic accuracy. Not entirely unlike prime michelangeli. Also very very good recorded sound. This truely is one of the finest piano albums I have ever heard. Also watch out for some Schumann from hamelin which will be his next release. Fantasy in C, symphonic etudes and a grand sonata.

I would strongly reccomend this for anyone learning how to sew or just taking up machine quilting. The instruction manuel is clear and concise and the sewing machine could not be easier to use.

Just pop the thread cartridge in and the sewing machine magically threads your neadle for you. You don't even have to worry about pulling up the bobbin thread, just start sewing. It does everything for you. I highly reccomend this machine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I had to write this in reply to another reviewer's problem winding a bobbin. I thought I had to hold the thread too, until I figured out that the bobbin winding cover and the bobbin winding spool pin only seem like they are all the way open, and in place. They actually open farther, and then the bobbins wind up perfectly.This sewing machine is beautiful in person, runs very quietly, and can do so many different stitches! I have had no problems at all, and threading it is fun and easy - just follow the instructions :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this machine","review":"I received this sewing machine for Christmas 2004. The first time I used it it did great. Came back the next day to finish sewing a dress and the bobbin thread kept getting tangled. Managed to finally finish that dress and moved onto the next dress. I had to change thread color and the automatic threader stopped working, the bobbin would not wind properly. It was only winding at the top of the bobbin and not evenly throughout the bobbin. I pulled the manual back out and re-read the instructions and started over from scratch and continued with the same problems. Finally got to sewing again and the needle position keeps moving so it does not sew in a straight line. The stitches are also loose with the tension setting on 5. I adjusted the tension up and down and the thread stayed the same.I'm returning this sewing machine and will be getting a new machine and it will not be another Brother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...buy a singer!!","review":"I was initially impressed when I first bought this machine. It was fairly simple to use. After a few months the computerized part of the machine shorted out (my sissors touched the needle when I was clipping a thread), which has made the machine now useless. I called Brothers NOT tollfree support line,and was on hold for a half hour. The 'lady' I spoke too was definately not helpful(or courteous), I can take the machine 200 miles away to their 'authorized service center' otherwise they can't help me. So basically I now have a $300 paperweight. After dealing with the support center, and with their sub-par product, I will never buy another brother anything.

I have been sewing for over 30 years and have never had so much frustation as I have experienced with this machine. The tension does not stay in place and the bobbin winder has been repaired and still does not work properly. I doubt that it ever will. And now the automatice threader does not work because all the mechanism fell out of the bottom of the machine. I agree with comments made that the manual is full of errors as well and this is a shame because you have to keep going back to it to try to make things work on this machine. Buyer beware....

If this appeals to you then by all means read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning~ Book Contains Triggers","review":"Not only is this book poorly written, (as if by a teenaged boy who can't watch enough b-rated horror movies), but it is also full of violence against women that triggers on misogyny.

This book and his \\"4% Universe\\" can actually give you a decent understanding of cosmology and the link to particle physics without the burden of having to know mathematics! 4% Universe would be a nice history introduction to a physics or astronomy student, but is not the place for finding actual technical data. The Invisible Century is also a very good high-level description of how modern science and scentific theory evolved from earlier scientific and pre-scientific thinking and analysis. The Einstein and Freud stories are discussed in parallel and you will be able to see how the combination of mathematical prediction and reproducible experiments distinguished the field of modern physics from psychoanalysis. This is also seen in the 4% Universe, as cosmology evolves from \\"just talk\\" to math and experiment-based science."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best biography of George Armstrong Custer ever written","review":"Wert's biography of the flamboyant soldier, who has becomemore of a symbol in the 20th Century than a genuine person,is highly objective, addressing both the positive aspectsof Custer's personality and career and also the negativeside. In examining the numerous controversies and chargeswhich surround the memory of George Custer, Wert carefullypresents the evidence pro and con and renders a judiciousconclusion. The book is balanced between Custer's earlycareer with its extraordinary successes during the CivilWar and his life after the end of that war, when he wasfaced by challenges worse than those of a Virginiabattlefield. Through strong, unembellished prose, Wertbuilds a well-rounded portrait of a soldier and a man,neither without flaw nor yet the caricature that he hasbecome in recent decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!!","review":"This is a great book, plenty of info on custer.

There are some upbeat songs and some soul stirring songs as well on this album. The upbeat song that I like best is Do Right. The song that most stirs my soul is Even When.

The road that can be measured is not the endless road.\\"This is not merely a poor translation but a complete miss of the first line of \\"Tao Te Ching\\", which I read in original Chinese. No where in the original version is there any connotations of \\"death\\" or \\"life\\". Hoff has cribbed his translation so that it becomes a sort of mystical Judeo-Christian experience text, which is a complete treason of the original book.The lines that follow are even more atrocious: \\"From nothing, the infinite universe began. From no number, the countless things appeared. From no name, their limitless sources will be known.\\" Does this remind you of, gasp, Genesis?As a reader of Chinese I can safely advise you to give this a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable, but powerful!","review":"This is a nice piece of speaker. It fits nicely on LCD screen of a laptop. You won't believe the sounds that it produced. Amazing! I would say you can hear the sound as far as 100ft away. It really work well if you need to do a presentation in a big classroom that requires louder sound. It also comes with a pouch that you can store the device if not in use. Connection is simple. Just plug it to any usb port or use its external battery pack. AC adapter is an optional accessory which is somewhat disappointed consider the price it is selling for. Overall, I think this is a good investment if you need to produce louder sound when using a laptop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product.

I wanted something that would solve this problem without taking up more space.Pros: This speaker system really works and I can hear my GPS voice directions even when the radio is on. It was well worth the few extra dollars.Cons: I'm being picky. Only things I don't like is the way the speakers clip on the top of the notebook. It is a strong clip and they will not come off but it is difficult to flip the clip around to put it on. It takes two hands. The only other thing is the storage bag. It is two small and difficult to get everything back in for storage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much better than your laptop's internal speakers","review":"I purchased this item on sale for $54 and I STILL RETURNED IT. I read the reviews carefully before purchasing, however, I was very disappointed with the sound quality. I used the speakers to listen to acoustic guitar recordings on my laptop -- primarily treble-rich music. When I listened to the guitar music with the speakers attached, the sound quality was almost identical to that from the laptop internal speakers alone (i.e., there was no difference). I tried the speakers on two different laptops -- An apple Macbook purchased in 2006 and a Dell Inspiron purchased in 2004. Both of these laptops come with internal speakers that rival the sound of the TravelSound 500 speakers. I imagine that for other types of music (e.g., rock or pop) that have a wider spectrum of tone, the speakers would make more of a difference, however, I would not recommend these speakers unless you have an older laptop with really bad internal speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have the money to spend THESE ARE WELL WORTH IT","review":"These speakers are incredible. I've had them for at least two years, played them hours upon hours, dropped them many times and they still sound fantastic!!!!!! These speakers are small, lightweight, yet they are very clear and have an amazing range from lows to highs, and comes with a subwoofer output for those extra vibrating reality-making lows. Let me tell you, as a musician with an extremely particular choosiness for sound, these speakers are incredible. Loud for their size too. I specifically came on here to review them because of how impressed I am with them. I am glad to have found a product that is well made. In durability, sound, and overall quality.

I bought the Travelsound 500 laptop speakers...they sounded just like what I was looking for. Problem is that after a day or so they just stopped working. The speakers just slowly died. Great sound at first, then I noticed thatthe sound kept getting lower and lower. I tried them one 2 laptops, and 2 desktops---same thing. I tried online help, Creative's help---all for nothing. I've had problems now with the 5.1 speakers which honestly were probably the best of the worst--lasted about 2 years--I don't play my music that loud to blow my speakers either), two Muvos, and now this. I said before I'd never buy from Creative again, but I guess I was a little too forgiving. No more...if I could give these speakers a zero rating I would....DO NOT BUY!!!

Just a fast way to get to the ISO 1000 speed when you are taking pictures of fast moving objects. It is a little slow if you take many pictures in a row. Otherwise I like it.

It has a fantastic zoom; it takes great photos at night; it is easy to readjust to different lighting situations although the auto feature usually picks the right exposure. I have some really beautiful photos taken with this camera. The optical image stabilization zoom works really well and I have stunning photos of flowers that I saw in the tropics. I even got wonderful action shots without changing the setting from auto to action. The battery life is long although I bought a few more.My only criticism is that it's a bit bulky and I am challenged to find just the right way to carry it. I have some concern about the screen getting scratched when I throw it into my bag. So far, no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for the price.","review":"I've had the Sony DSC H5 for about 2 months now. It replaced my 4 year old Fuji Fine Pix S602Z which had 3.1MP and a 6X optical zoom. Boy, what a difference 4 years make. I'm an amateur and this Sony takes great photos. The 3 inch LCD is awesome and one of the reasons I bought the Sony. I used to use the view finder on my Fuji (which had a 1.7 inch LCD) all the time and now mostly use the LCD on the Sony. The flash on this camera is fantastic! Perhaps a bit too powerful at times but that is easily fixed with a photo editing program. My Fuji used 4 AA batteries and I've had several sets with a recharger for years. The Sony uses 2 AA's and the only complaint I have so far is that the flash eats them up quickly. The Sony battery charger included with the camera is very slow and the first charge took almost 7 hours for two batteries. I recommend buying several sets of rechargeable batteries and a fast recharger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible camera! Expect 30-50 terrible pix per battery life.","review":"Two comments on this miserable camera.-- Battery life is unbelievably short! Not more than 50 shot with lithium or NiMH batteries - and about 32 with Duracell.-- Shutter lag is 2 seconds or more under any circumstances, guaranteeing that just about any shot is missed. You'd think that the shutter lag at least improves clarity with stellar autofocus, but that that is not the case; you'll get blurry shots of your kid's butts running out of frame.Also, low light timed exposure shots are extremely grainy.

Very disappointing.An electronic problem causes a complete freezing-up right after the shutter button is pushed, resulting in a blank black viewer. After it finally releases from the freeze, no picture has been taken.Repair work costs more than to replace camera, of course. I will think twice before buying Sony camera again.As a photographer, I have owned many different cameras.

Macro images are unbelievable with this camera.The 3\\" display is just awesome. Protect your investment, would recommend a \\"High\\" quality screen protector.

I reviewed Sony based on the feedback from other customers and on actual performance. The snaps in some modes were amazing (forgive my layman approach, for I am not a PRO), but overall I felt it was rather overprized. The ergonomics - average. The CCD imager defect does exist. Controls can be confusing for first-timers. The viewfinder is awkwardly modeled....Overall, not the kind of product we know Sony for.

This is nice because if you have times that you don't use it, it won't restrict the duct's regular air flow. Be sure to face it in the correct direction. I installed it centered in a square duct near the end of the supply that later branches off supplying air to a register down stairs and another one up stairs.

The moves are funky and pretty demanding when they've built to a full routine, and Abdul is really professional and smooth in her delivery. Her dancers were also very good. They could even follow her directions, which were totally useless. She'd say we're doing a step left, step right and it would turn out to be a complex combination of steps, turns, dips, arm movements, you name it. But the workout is fun and before you know it you're doing the toning exercises and cooling down. It's one of my favorites now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too advanced","review":"If you are a dancer you may find this fun, but if you just want a good workout, this is not for you. The moves are too advanced, and you have to spend time learning the moves before you are able to get any significant aerobic benefit from them. Not to mention you need a lot of space to do the routine.For a good workout, you might want to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"workout","review":"I have not found a work out tape of katy Smiths that I like. i do like the Yoga one from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't break down the steps","review":"Paula is a great dancer, but she does not spend enough time breaking down the dance steps on her DVD. I eventually got frustrated and quit, so I never got a workout. I'm a Personal Trainer and Group Fitness Instructor and have been doing aerobics for years but this workout is not for the average exerciser. If you are into dance and pick up dance step very quickly this may be okay for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuing, editing, & insets make choreography easy to learn","review":"Paula makes intermediate dance steps accessible to the beginner dancer! This tape is very much like taking a beginning to intermediate jazz/funk class. With gradual increases up to tempo, corner-of-the screen insets showing Paula from the back so you can \\"follow along\\" (as most wallflowers tend to do in their first couple of classes), and excellent camera shots, the beginner is given ample opportunity to pick up on her funky moves. The choreography does require a bit of sliding around, which is hard in my carpeted apartment, but it is still very do-able.The toning section is great, but requires some rewinding for the beginner, since most of Paula's instructions on how to do the stretch correctly were dubbed over the dancers already doing the stretch.Great for a beginner (with rhthym) who wants to learn classy jazz/funk, or for the advanced student who has taken some time away from dance and wants to get back into the groove!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent workout but.....","review":"This is not one of my favorite workouts because, frankly, Paula Abdul drives me nuts. But it is a fairly intense work out and the stretching section at the end is excellent. I really like her two assistants. I would hire either one of them as personal trainers. I rarely do this one anymore as I have newer ones I prefer. But out of my 15 or so videos, this is still in my top 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broke a sweat and had fun!","review":"So Paula isn't the most peppy instructor but she's an awsome choreographer. Yes, the moves are NOT for beginners but if you have a little dance experience, some patience and you relax and let go you will notice the steps flow together easily. The warm up was great and it has authentic dancer toning (plies) and stretching! If you also watch the background dancers they are not only eye candy but they are individuals who give you ideas on how to spice up and vary the routine a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardio Dance not too cardio","review":"I am a former dancer and I thought this video would be high energy with fun and easy steps to get the heart rate up. Boy was I wrong! Its got 3 small combinations in it that are semi easy to follow, with one big routine in the end. There was no warm-up or cool down, which should be required when working your muscles. In addition, you need a lot of space to work in, so you average living room probably won't work.I sweat a little, but never got even close to a high heart rate or losing my breath. I would not recommend this to anyone who is looking for real cardio. If you have dance experience and are looking for something to do, maybe this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging moves!","review":"Even though there's a lot of complaints on here about the complexity of the dance steps, I had them down at least part way on the first try, and after a few more attempts I had it right. Paula tells you, if you don't get it, rewind a little and look again - nobody ever gets an aerobics workout memorized on the first try (and wouldn't it be boring if we did?).The warm-up is a set of simple dance moves, and a few stretches (calves, hamstrings, quads). Then you get into 3 sets of learning dance moves, and finally put it all together at the end. While it might not be the biggest heart rate jump in the world, it's a fun workout and you do sweat a bit. The cool down is simple dance-related movements, and then you move on to lower body toning. The toning part is actually very good - it focuses on plies, lunges, and squats, and is pretty tough! Then you have a good stretch at the end, and there's the tape. I enjoyed it - it's a nice fun workout to do on a lazy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"I've been a fan of Paula Abdul for a long time. I really looked forward to this routine, and I LOVE to dance (and have had a fair amount of dance instruction). Not only did I not get a great workout, it just really wasn't that fun and was difficult to follow at times. It seemed a bit Richard Simmonsy (no offense, Richard!) in the quality. I get a better workout from just bopping to a CD. But the stretching at the end is of high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain Fun!","review":"This workout was really fun. It was a nice change from hardcore workouts like kickboxing or weightlifting. I am pretty literate in the dance department, but even I did find it a bit of a challenge to learn the moves at first. Most workout tapes start with one move and keep adding on as you get the first move. Paula does go FAST. I would not recommed this to someone just starting to workout. But, the dancing is interesting and you don't really feel like you are exercising. This is a great video for a change up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Beginners","review":"This tape is not for beginners who are starting a weight loss program. Although all of Paula's moves are dance moves, I did not think they were easy to pick up. It is a great tape for people who are really in good physical shape. The background was great, Paula and her dancers were great, and the music was great, but it is not a good tape for those who have finally gain the energy, willpower, and courage to loss weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners!","review":"Although this viedo got my heart rate up in no time, there was almost no explaination of the dance steps she was doing and the filming wasn't clear enough to really tell what they were doing either. I can tell it will take a long time before I figure this one out."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to follow if you are not coordinated","review":"great for teens that are good at dance but I found it difficult to follow and did not get a good workout"},{"rating":"1","title":"challenging","review":"This has some great steps or dances IF you are a dance major or something. I have been dancing for many years and still find this quite challenging to learn the steps. The intention of the video was to be applauded but it is still very complicated to learn as a person just trying to workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for novices!","review":"I bought this video knowing that I don't have natural dance talent but thinking I could just follow along and enjoy the exercise. But, I couldn't follow her first step and even where she does have instructions, they aren't very helpful if you don't already know dance steps.For the experienced dancer, or someone with natural talent, this is probably a fun video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"Different strokes for different folks. I found this workout tape to be extremely frustrating because it's seems to be more interested in looking cool than giving a good workout. I thought the steps were very difficult to master (and I tried, oh, how I tried!), and Paula's background dancers were too annoying to warrant rewinding the tape to see how the \\"follow me\\" Paula did the footwork. The only things saving this tape from a completely rotten tomato are the lower body firming segment at the end and the aforementioned \\"follow me\\" Paula, a window in the lower corner of the screen in which Paula does the steps as though you're dancing a row behind her. They should have kept that window up a little longer through each dance sequence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very short workout","review":"This is ok. The music is alright. The best thing about the workout is the ten minutes of leg toning at the end. The moves are cute but once you learn them the workout becomes monotonous and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad instructor","review":"I've been doing aerobic-dance classes for four years now and I thought I'll give this routine a try. She SUCKS as a fitness and dance instructor. I do not doubt her ability as a dancer but as far as teaching goes she better quit!! The toning part was ok but the rest of the routine was the worse I've done. She does not count, does not give proper instruction on the steps, moves in very fast tempo too soon. Do not buy, waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Workout Isn't Hard Enough","review":"As a trained dancer, I wanted something fun and dance oriented, yet something to help be burn calories and sweat my butt off! Well, the routine was fun, but the workout itself wasn't as nearly as challenging as I had hoped. I definitely didn't burn the calories that I had anticipated. If you are a beginner, this would be a great workout. If you are intermediate/advanced like myself, skip it and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't do it","review":"Okay so I think if a certain routine on a DVD requires the person buying it to have a specific item (let's say hand weights or a floor mat), that would be clearly advertised, right? Nope. I bought this because I always loved Paula Abdul's dance routines from the 80's and thought it would be fun. I put the DVD in only to be told I had to do the workouts on a hard floor. Um wow, could you not have mentioned that somewhere in the description? I have carpet in my den which is the only room with a TV that I can work out in. The moves don't work on carpet and you also need more room to move around (something else that's not mentioned) than what I had. Since I didn't actually get through this workout, I can't rate it on that per se, but I was disappointed that I wasted money for something I can't even do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless for beginners!","review":"It's useles for beginners. It does not show step by step. Even when I slowed down the speed of the DVD, I still could not follow her dancing. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult, slightly rewarding","review":"The moves in this are great, but I did this with several fairly coordinated family members and it was very difficult. I never have managed to master it. She makes a passing attempt at teaching you the moves, but a couple of times she actually completely skips teaching you the move and just does it at the speed of light and expects you to get it (the \\"charleston\\" is an example of this.) It was freggin sadistic. I'd rather have an impossibly difficult video with good moves than an unbearably easy video, however, so it gets two stars. If you pick up stuff fast and easily, this would probably be a good investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What fun, I'm on the bed staring at the cieling","review":"I did this video a long while ago and havn't attempted to look at it again. The moves go by quickly and are impossible to catch. The rewind button was not meant for this kind of usage. After a while, I just crawled on my bed and stared at the cieling because even watching them dance wasn't fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Ridiculous","review":"If you can actually get the moves in this DVD down, you have a good workout in store for you. If you have little dance experience and won't know what Paula's talking about when she tells you to do a \\"bus-stop\\" as if it's something you do everyday, you may be in for a disapointment. Although Paula's cues are perfectly timed and this can be fun once you get it down, she never breaks any of the moves down, or explains how to do them properly. It can get very frustrating if you're a beginner, or have little dance experience. I love workout DVDs and have been using them for years and this, in my opinion, was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Each time I do this workout, I'm very satisfied. Cardio-wise, it's a medium--it's not super hard core like Billy Blanks workouts, for example, but it's a nice steady cardio. The dance moves are a bit challenging at first, but once you pick them up, you can concentrate on refining them. Each move starts out slow (and once you've picked it up you can work on style and really \\"getting\\" the move,) and then speeds up.I must admit that I find Paula great in this tape. Given that she's in the entertainment news quite a bit lately for her... eccentricities, I was a bit apprehensive but she is just awesome. She's light and bubbly, and sassy when she needs to be.All in all--this was exactly what I was looking for--a cardio dance workout that is actually cardio, and dance, and a workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counting anyone??","review":"Okay I'll give Paula props she's an amazing dancer and a really good choreographer but whew she stinks as a teacher! I danced for about five years and even taught a few classes ( though granted not in this style) and I can't imagine teaching any student any routine without counting/calling out the beat for them at least the first time. Paula rarely counts and rarely calls moves. I'm having fun but I must admit I am pretty frustrated, the first time I didn't even get through the DVD. If you are not really good at dance don't bother, if however you're studying to be a Lakers girl, well here ya go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not like her other dance video","review":"I don't know how anyone can get the routine down unless these moves are something you learn prior. It is nevy taxy and complicated and not broken down well. I liked her first video... but this one doesn't compare. It also mentions that it needs to be done on a non carpeted area.. in a large area. Not ideal for a home workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware - For Professional dancers only!","review":"I am a big fan of Paula Abdul's previous workout, \\"Get up and Dance.\\" I've been doing it on and off for 10 years now, so when I saw this second one (which I never new existed) I became very excited and ordered it. I thought it would be as great as the first one! My hobby is dancing. I've done paid gigs - and I'm a good dancer.DETAILS:I DO NOT RECOMMEND Cardio Dance, - especially not for beginners! Paula is very UNCLEAR in this DVD. She confuses ME and I have experience. SHE JUST DOES NOT CUE properly.It is odd - at times Paula begins to cue but then for some reason she somehow drops it mid sentence.She does NOT explain or break down the dance steps - and they are COMPLICATED steps. In fact, what she calls a \\"step\\" in this video is a SERIES of about 10 or more complicated (and unexplained) MOVES.My recommendation is: If you like to dance buy her older dance workout (see my reviews) and skip this one. God bless! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paula is not a teacher","review":"I gave this two stars because I like the stretching cool-down segment.The problem is that Paula is not a teacher. She is a dancer and choreographer who is used to working with people who know dance terminology and pick up steps quickly. This is not me. I have done quite a few aerobic dance workouts and pick up the steps in those pretty well,so I know I am not completely dancing impaired, but I just couldn't get this. There is not enough explanation of the steps and transitions. I got frustrated and spent much time talking to the screen, \\"I didn't get that. I can't do that. Whatever Paula.\\" I spent a lot of time just stepping side to side, waiting for something I could do. I wound up making up my own workout and only doing the cool down on this DVD.I was hoping for a fun workout and was disappointed. Paula is just not an instructor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch the workout time fly by.","review":"So the moves are a little complicated and intimidating at first, but that's only at first. When I first tried this DVD I had to pause and rewind, but I still got an awesome workout. The second time around, it was no problem.This DVD is fun, feels quick, and gives you a dance routine that makes you feel like you can actually dance :)) it's pretty much only cardio, with a lower body toning at the end, which is somewhat challenging, I suppose...although I never feel it the next day.For a much longer, and more intense dance workout (with all sorts of toning, try Paula's other DVD, which is also fun...although I think I like the moves in Cardio dance better)."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd have to be a professioanal dancer to keep up!!!!","review":"I would love to be able to dance like Paula, but not a chance without a class to learn what all her technical terms mean. If you have some dance experience (apart from when you were a little kid) and are very fit - this is a great workout for you. If you are looking for a DVD to help you get into shape - you better find something else - this is way too advanced. She goes through the moves too fast and you don't have time to learn them before she moves on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely impossible!!","review":"i tried this video a while ago and i remember that i was falling all over myself trying to keep up with her! she would show you a difficult move 3 times then expect you to know what you are doing! i was so frustrated i didn't even bother finishing the tape. if you are already a dancer and understand how to learn moves quickly this would be a good workout for you, otherwise don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much instruction - and boring dance steps","review":"This DVD is only for really coordinated people who are already familiar with most of the dance steps. Paula seems to be more interested in showing her dancing skill than to instruct you on how to do it. Even if you put this tape in pause, it is still very hard to follow the steps. The DVD could easily be a VHS videotape for it does not take any advantage of the different tracks and all of the extra features that DVD offer. This is a waste of money and there is nothing innovative or special about the moves demonstrated by Paula Abdul. Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN and CHALLENGING!!","review":"If you're a fan of Paula Abdul, as I am, you should love this video. She is a blast to work out with, and the girl can dance like crazy!!! I like this video because it's somewhat challenging to learn the moves. That keeps it interesting. You focus on learning the routine, and before you know it, an hour has passed. And once you do have it mastered, you feel proud like you have really accomplished something. I give it four stars only because you do need ALOT of space to do this routine, and running into furniture gets a little old, but other than that, its a blast!! The moves are broken down slowly and then move faster and then to tempo. There is a box showing her from behind and that makes it ALOT easier to learn. Just be patient and you'll get it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not instructional","review":"Unless you're an experienced dancer, I wouldn't recommend this video. there aren't any explanations. it's just following dance moves you're expected to already know"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson in co-ordination","review":"If you're looking for a hard cardio workout, this is not the DVD you want. If you're looking for some inexpensive dance lessons that will improve your dexterity and co-ordination and teach you some funky moves, this is the dvd for you. It's a fun dvd. I advise doing the step sections separately a few times before doing the dvd all the way through. I tried going all the way through the first time and got discouraged, but I continued anyway. It can be very daunting at first. The stretching and toning section is good but more commentary on what is coming next is needed from Paula so it is easier to follow. I was looking for a harder workout physically, but I'm happy with the dvd as it gives me a hard workout in co-ordination. I found I'm not as co-ordinated as I thought I was. I recommend it if you're not looking for a hard workout but want some light and fun exercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paula Abdul - Cardio Dance","review":"Maybe I'm old-fashioned because I don't enjoy step class, cycle training, or cardio kickboxing but this video reflects the kind of dancey aerobic classes I love. The choreography is jazzy, the steps are hard enough that you're concentrating on doing them right instead of how tired you are, and it's a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cardio Dance...","review":"I mastered \\"Get Up And Dance\\" and I loved it! I was looking for a new challenge and I found it with this DVD. I really like the warm up, it is not your basic stretching ect. It's fun and I almost feel like I am dancing in her video!The problem that I have with this video is that I think you need to have more room than your average living room. Not to mention that Paula and her dancers can move so easily b/c they are on a tile floor and my living room carpet makes it harder to feel like you are doing the moves the right way.All around I think that this video gives me a good workout and after I finish it I feel good, and I had fun. In fact the first few times I did it I was laughing at myslef b/c it was fun, not frustrating! I would say get \\"Get Up and Dance\\" first and if you like Paula's style then go for Cardio Dance."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst I've ever done","review":"This video is not easy to follow. I had trouble getting the steps down and I've done aerobics and dance for years. When I did get the steps down, it barely got my heart rate up. I wasted time and money while exhausting my patience. To top it all off, instead of being motivating, Paula Abdul is annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"it is very fun!","review":"I really enjoy this tape, it is lots of fun and works all your muscles groups as well. I think I enjoy it and keep coming back to it because this is one of the very few tapes out there that you can actually see that the instructor(Paula) is really having a blast at doing it and that, in a sense, motivates me to relax and have fun--but keep everything tight at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy as 1, 2, 3!","review":"This is an excellent exercise tape...it takes you step by step and gives you different views to make picking the steps up pretty easy. Once you get the feel for it, you won't want to stop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of complicated dance moves.","review":"I bought this video for both the cardio workout and the dance. The cover said that she slowly teaches the dance steps. This is an exageration. She flies through the moves, and expects you to catch on or rewind. It will take a lot of patience to rewind that many times and still get any workout. It says Intermediate Level which I wanted in the intensity of the workout, but the moves are advanced. I would recommend looking for something else unless you are really an experiences dancer or have done lots of dance videos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive!","review":"This is yet another great release from Tooth and Nail records. The first 6 tracks are super and the others aren't bad either. Can't wait for their sophomore effort!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Terrible.","review":"The tunes are not so bad. It's the lyrics that kill me. I can't listen to this album because they make my ears hurt. The words are cliched, sad, and fail to be the pretentious emo poetry that they aspire to me. Phrases like, \\"The coldest heart can be brought life when it's thrown into the fire of goodbyes,\\" could very well be a parody of the genre. Yet it's belted out with all sincerity. It touches on all the stereotypical keywords and fails to make sense. Wake up, wannabe scene kids! This is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this book","review":"This book is so fantastic and my daughter and I read it in one day.

I had just graduated High School and would start college in the fall. After listening to the entire disc I realized there was something missing in my life. REGGAE MUSIC. Despite what you may hear Sublime is a true reggae band. You know an album is good when yours is frequently stolen/borrowed. I have worn out one disc and had two others stolen. Even my gansgsta rap friends like Sublime. Their music is more than just reggae with influences by groups like Beastie Boys, Descendants, Half Pint, Born Jamericans, and of course Bob Marley. This is a must have for Sublime fans and a great introductory record as well. I only wish that Brad were alive to see how much his music has affected people in a positive way.

Brad had a great gift with not only lyrics but amazing vocals. This CD especially shows sublime had true musical talent and wasn't imitating anyone like most rock bands are today. Every song on here is good and each song shows how many different kinds of music sublime could combine into one CD, rock/rap/punk/reggae/ska.

If you like Sublime, or even if you've never heard them before, you should like this CD. This is a very meaningfull CD and is an excellent pick. I would reccomend this CD to anyone. It has excellent lyrics and powerfull music. Brad's awsome voice is just the beginning of this phenomenal CD and I think it is one of Sublime's best.

I heard \\"What I Got\\" repeatedly on the radio. I thought, \\"Hey, this song's okay.\\" But then it annoyed me after about the 40th time.I ended up buying the CD after hearing \\"Santeria\\". Yes, Sublime is punk, ska, rap, toasting, but Brad adds this wonderful (um, Sublime) voice, at times menacing street threats; then suddenly switches into a crooner, like someone from the Rat Pack or something; still singing about shooting up or blowing someone away, but in a smooth, suave Martini kinda way.Heck, I think I'll pick this as my favorite album of the 90s, even if \\"Side 1\\" is better than the second half (especially \\"Same in the End\\" and \\"April 29, 1992\\").Buy this album, then get their other stuff.

I like to sit back and listen to Robbin The Hood or the Sublime Accoustic album because those show how much of a genius Bradley was. but the self-titled album just isn't my favorite. if you want a Sublime CD get any of the other five. they are all great. just skip on this one. well peace out"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As It Looks","review":"This album at your first glance looks like a masterpiece, but after yoou listen tio the entire album, you may think differently. \\"Wrong Way\\", \\"Santeria\\", \\"What I Got\\", and \\"April 29, 1992\\" are good songs but most of the other fourteen songs are their failed attempts at punk rock.

To Freedom; that cd is one of the very best cds that i own, but i really think this one is overrated. It does have some good songs, but for the most part, they just arent that great. the good ones are Garden Grove, What I Got, and even that one is not the best in the world, Wrong Way, Santeria, April 29th, and Seed. Those are pretty much the only ones i listen to when i put the CD in. please dont get me wrong and think i am some ignorant person who \\"doesnt know sublime at all.\\" i LOVe the band, but i just dont think this cd is all its cut out to be. If you want an EXCELLENT cd, go buy 40 oz. With the exception of maybe 3 or 4 songs, that entire cd is excellent. skip this one because they play pretty much every good song on the radio like once a day."},{"rating":"1","title":"The band Sublime is not a classic and neither is this CD","review":"What kind of garbage is this? The beats sound like they are copied off of other ska bands like No Doubt, Sugar Ray and others. Eventhough Sublime came before Limp Bizkit and Sugar Ray, I would rather buy Sugar Ray than this Jamaican beats ripoff. The lead singer died of cocaine overdose in 1996 and that shows that Jamaican/ska bands like Sublime can be gone in a blink of an eye. Sublime tries to rap in Bob Marley style beats, but it fails miserably. The lead singer sounds like he sung in a styrofoam cup. Everbody thinks this band is a classic while it lasted, but this CD is just a headache for the ears. They think they're so cool, they rap about the LA riots in 1992. Big deal. I know Sublime had released four CD's before this last CD, but all of their albums are just cardboard. This bands' last CD is not a classic at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"como se dice....retarded?","review":"wholy crap this albem is tottaly rad!!!the lierics are defiantly awesome and the raggay music gets me dancin'!just kidding. this album sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A really really good album","review":"OK I know you read my rating of the cd and then my title is that it is a really really good album. But I think that the average rating of this cd should only be a 4 1/2. It is really good, but What I Got was given a bit too much radio and MtV play. Thats not to say that the song is bad. My favorites are Wrong Way, Same in the End, April 29, 1992, Santeria, Seed, Ballad of Johnny Butt, Caress Me Down, and the last song on the CD, although I cant think of its name now.But this CD, its not the greatest but it sure is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A PURE GEM!

Little did I know I would become the biggest Sublime fan in the world. This is the most unique mixture of musical styles I've ever heard. From the rappy \\"Garden Grove\\", Ska \\"Wrong Way\\", to the guitar infused \\"Same in the End\\", this cd has it all. My personal favorite is \\"Pawn Shop\\" although it is very hard to pick one. A great Cd to start if you're new to the band and work your way backwards to some of the earlier music."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll love this","review":"No matter what type of music you listen to,you WILL like this.Trust me.This is one of the only CD's I can listen to over and over and not get tired of.Some of the best tracks would have to be \\"What I got\\",\\"Seed\\",\\"Santeria\\",and \\"Wrong Way\\" are the best tracks on the cd.There's a serious point in all the songs,but the it's so inresting and catchy,you don't even notice.You'll love it so just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Sublime Album","review":"In my opinion, Sublime is one of the greatest bands of the '90s and this is their best album. From beginning to end, this is an album to play and chill to. The lyrics, the drums, the guitars, everything on this album is great. Some of the songs on this album are masterpieces that are so good that I will probably listen to them when I am 90 years old and in a nursing home. This album really is that good. If you are just a fan of music, then you need to pick up this album.My 3 Favorite Tracks:JailhouseCaress Me DownApril 29, 1992"},{"rating":"2","title":"just what i ordered","review":"This record was delivered quickly and was unopened and played perfectly. it was just what I ordered."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Album of the 90s","review":"This was not just an album. It invited you into Sublime's world and it was amazing. I would have to say I enjoy every track on this CD, which was not true for their debut or second album. Don't get me wrong, 40 oz. to Freedom was amazing and Robbin' the Hood had a few good songs on it, but this album just rocks from 1 to 17. The variety is a big plus, too. They can do reggae, punk, ska, rock, and pretty much whatever they want. Very soulful and very charismatic music. They're by far my favorite band now because I finally found out all the great songs they had that weren't \\"singles.\\" If you like this, I encourage you to get Everything Under the Sun. There are some dope tracks on there as well.Simply the best, better than all the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime belongs on Vinyl","review":"I had just gotten my turntable reconditioned when the Sublime self-titled album came to my house. Both records that come with it are 180 grams; they feel real solid. And when I put that baby on the turntable, it sounded so beautiful. Sublime truly belongs on vinyl; CDs and MP3 don't do them justice at all. If you're a true Sublime fan, get this album immediately. The photographs used on the record sleeves are really cool to have, and any it's definitely something any fan will appreciate. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Many different styles to like","review":"Sublime performs a vast array of beatiful styles in this album and that is what makes it great. In \\"Paddled Out\\" the band shows hardcore yet in \\"Caress Me Down\\" the group shows some mellow funk, in \\"Garden Grove\\" and \\"What I Got\\" Sublime shows alot of reggae, and in \\"April 29 1992\\" They show some nice alternative. This album deserves every award that it has received and more. I stongly recommend this album to any kind of rock music lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime is the best ever.","review":"I wish that Brad didn't die so that Sublime could still be group together.

Of course, it comes out in all of them too. The CD has everything for today's modern rock, alternative listener. Tracks 1-6, 16, and 17 are especially great. BUY IT! RIP Bradley."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great c.d, but not Sublime's best effort.","review":"I've had this c.d for about 4 years now and have loved it ever since the day i bought it. My favorites include \\"Wrong Way,\\" \\"Santeria,\\" \\"Same in the End\\" and \\"Caress Me Down.\\" This was my favorite c.d for a period of time, and I listened to it non-stop. The only reason I gave it 4 stars rather than 5 is bc I bought 40 oz. a while ago and that is the best cd in the world. If you are just starting to get into Sublime, this is the cd to get. If you like this one, please buy 40 oz. to Freedom, that is my favorite cd ever, but u have to like Sublime to like 40. Also, if you like the cd check out Long Beach Dub Allstars \\"Right Back.\\" The remaining members of Sublime, (Bud and Eric) put together a new band and theyre great. In conclusion, buy this cd if you are an amateur Sublime fan, or just like some of the popular songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime's best","review":"I love this group. They are one of my favorite bands of the 90s because of their unique sound that merges reggae dub and punk rock. The first song I heard from Sublime was \\"What I Got\\" when I was 13 years old. Now I am 16 and I finally got the money to buy this album. And there are SO many good songs on it that really represent the band in a good manner. Too bad their singer died before the album came out. The guy's a musical genius. And the new guy Sublime's got singing for them is not as good.Favorite Tracks: \\"Garden Grove,\\" \\"What I Got,\\" \\"Wrong Way,\\" \\"April 29, 1992 (Miami),\\" \\"Santeria,\\" \\"Seed,\\" \\"Jailhouse,\\" \\"Pawn Shop,\\" \\"Burritos,\\" \\"Get Ready,\\" \\"Caress Me Down,\\" \\"What I Got (Reprise),\\" \\"Doin' Time.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This product was a great Quality.

Have we been listening to the same CDs? 'Sublime' and '40oz to Freedom' are two albums that I never, ever get tired of. I've had to buy both CDs numerous times, because they get too worn out and scratched up to play every couple of years. I can listen to these CDs over and over and they just don't get old. As with everything, it's certainly a matter of personal opinion, but I just don't understand how anyone could be less than captivated by this music. I know that I was hooked from the first time I heard it (and if you're not, something is probably wrong with you)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone could own this cd and smile","review":"No matter who you are, or what type of music you listen to this cd is great.

All in one good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc","review":"I found this CD at Goodwill tucked away in the corner amongst several greatest hits CD's by the likes of Tom Petty and others. I can't believe someone gave this away, maybe it was for the explicit lyric sticker on the case. I've always liked Sublime, at least what I heard on the radio so I was intrigued. I popped it in the player on the way home and was blown away. Every song that I'd ever heard from Sublime up to that point was on that disc. I was sure it had to be a greatest hits CD but I was wrong. Every song is great and the use of unique sounds like trombones and other brass is way cool. for a $1.95 it was the best deal I've scored in a while. It's on permanent rotation in my player at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I can be a little biased because I'm an obcessed Sublime fan. I listen to Sublime at least five days a week. This is one of the three real Sublime albums out there (as in not a compilation) This album has to be the most professionally produced, and comercial of the three. I would recomed it to any type of music lover because this is just great music. Once you buy this one you will have to have 40 oz to freedom and Robbin the Hood. What's more to be said? Just buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I got this to give as a Christmas gift, but when I opened the package the case was cracked in two places!

However, compared to the rest of sublime's work, this album is pretty weak. A lot of the songs aren't very good at all (Wrong Way, April 29, 1992, Paddle Out) and a few are just ok. It does have it's bright spots though (What I Got, Santeria, Doin Time). If you've never heard sublime before, or maybe just one or two songs, this is probably the album you want to get. It's the most pop-friendly. But if you see something interesting there and like it, you have to get 40oz to Freedom to really see what sublime was capable of."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rules","review":"This cd was a great cd when i bought it, but it gets old very quickly if you listen to it a lot. I would recomend buying the entire sumblime collection if your are into their music. The rest of sublimes music is just as good, if not better than this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"much more than What I Got","review":"All the songs are great on here with the exception of What I Got and Doin' Time. those two songs are very average and contain the some of the worst lyrics on the disc. but the rest of the album makes up for these songs. especially Burritos, Garden Grove, Wrong Way, Same In The End, Santeria, Seed, Caress Me Down, Pawn Shop, Ballad Of Johnny Butt, Paddle Out, Under My Voodoo, and to a lesser extent but still good, April 29,1992, Jailhouse, and Get Ready. this is a great album but my favorite is 40 Oz.

I read the other reviews but felt optimistic. It came today and every negative word is true. It was packaged horribly, the ball is too big for the wickets, the wickets randomly pop open, and the balls don't fully inflate into their fabric skin making them wrinkly and unable to roll straight.Its redemptive value lies in the fact that you can use 4 poles per wicket to make the set work, but that only gives you 6 wickets instead of the usual nine.

But even into the late 19th century it was not a majority Muslim, until a series of ethnic-cleansing campaigns aimed at Buddhists, Hindus, Christians and Chinese suceeded in making it so.This book is basically a history of Islamic Indonesia and does'nt offer much to those interested in the great diversity of the country or of its rich and ancient history.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"This was a terrible book, one of the worst I have read in years. I would have quit, but it was all I had taken with me on my trip to Indonesia.The problem is that Geller almost never presents an arc of history. There is very little cause and effect, or discussion of broad themes that explain the change over time in Indonesia. Geller is trying to tell the history of an enormous nation, covering several centuries. Given such scope, we need big picture thinking and discussion. Instead, we get isolated facts and events, with no analysis at all of how they effected the larger sweep of history. The book reads like a series of unrelated facts.On top of it all, the prose is dry and uninteresting.I bought this book on a recommendation from Lonely Planet. I should have known better.

The 2600i rattles around in there...I have to put old fabric in there to position and cushion it. The sewing machine still floats to one side making it awkward to carry since it is side heavy.Overall- it is a Hard Case to store your sewing machine. The inside plastic Cards that are suppose to cover the latch rivets fall out and are useless.I have not seen anything better on Amazon so I am keeping it... but it is nothing t get excited about.If Brother actually came out with a custom case that held my sewing machine - like the SC6000 does (which comes with it fro free) I would leave this case in a minute.

The fact that it is a \\"universal\\" carrying case means that it is much larger than needed to accomodate the sewing machine I bought. This is because it is intended to also accomodate a serger, which is a larger machine.

It is crappy! Don't be fooled by the \\"Universal\\" phrase of this product. I have a Brother sewing machine so i bought this item. When i got it, i placed my sewing machine and it rattles around inside the case. I don't see what is so \\"Universal\\" about this. There is too much room inside and my machine tips over to its sides when i lift to carry the case. It's terrible!!! I'd give NO star but i don't have that choice on the selection. I wanted to return it but it's not worth the shipping charge that will show up on my refund due to Amazon's policies.

I would try a different one, like maybe the one SInger makes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal product","review":"I ordered the case to protect my wife's new machine but was disappointed in the quality and design. Inside the top of the box where the handle mounts, the metal strap was rusted. My concern was a few years from now carrying the machine by the handle of this case and having the handle fall off destroying the sewing machine when it hits the floor. If this manufacturer uses cheap metal that rusts, they may also use cheap plastic which becomes brittle. This caused me to evaluate the fasteners on the side. I would have preferred to see rivets here securely connecting the side latches fully through the case. We don't want a latch to fail causing the machine to fall out the bottom of the case. This storage box may be cost affective for the manufacture to assemble but do you want to spend your hard earned money on a nice sewing machine only to see it destroyed after falling out of this storage box? I may be critical on the quality of this box but I'm also an automotive engineer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Case","review":"This case fits my Brother XL2230 perfectly with just enough space left over for my scissors and a box of thread.

It's a wonderful history of the Vanderbilt family, although not too heavily involved. I found that the family tree charts were loads of help while reading the book ... with such a large family it would be easy to forget who's who.The pictures are exquisite, they bring the Vanderbilts and their fabulous homes to life. There are 291 illustrations, 92 of them are in full color.I bought this book on a visit to George Vanderbilt's Biltmore Estate in the mountains of North Carolina.

How he made, by borrowing a hundred dollars from his mother while on their farm on Staten Island, a fortune that ended at his grave on Staten Island is a tale worthy of outlandish fiction worthy of a few years of Soap Opera episodes. The story is filled with back stabbing Business deals, a man more concerned with the future of his money than his family, gold digging hoes, and how this fabulous fortune vanished in 3 generations of the wildest most wasteful spending one could imagine.

The songs are current and the judges are quite realistic - for example, if you mess up the end of a song, they respond with that type of comment - they love it when you're good, tell you that you're horrible when you are, etc.Better than Karaoke Revolution.It's school vacation week and my younger 9 year old daughter and 3 friends have been playing it for hours.We brought it to our ski house and 10 kids played it in competition with eachother.

There is not a lot of text, but it covers the necessary topics. I was impressed with Chapter 14, Maintaining Windows Vista.

Author Robert Sarmast (a Los Angeles based independent researcher and mythologist) combines 50 physical details from Plato's famous narrative with facts about the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus to persuasively pinpoint the legendary land and capital city of Atlantean culture. Point-by-point observations and black-and-white illustrations provocatively drive home the hypothesis in this superb and iconoclastic account that is recommended reading for anyone curious about the saga of Atlantis. Also very highly recommended is the associated website www.DiscoveryofAtlantis.com where dedicated Atlantis enthusiasts will find Robert Sarmast's full-color maps, 3D models, animation files, and Atlantean research updates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial imagination repackaged","review":"Yet another book twisting imagination with presumably commercial intent.

It should be suggested that it is not so much knowledge that is presented, but a huge body of information left to the reader to interpret its implication. However, I am always reminded by the scope limited by the pages; one probably should look to encyclopedias for insights, and Guinness for information. In most of the cases, it is a survey of informations, misconceptions are noted, and brief explanation is supplied for item demanding so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romertopf 3-Quart Clay Baker","review":"This product arrived poorly packed and broken.

Just soak the romertopf 30 minutes and put the chicken (and/or whatever) in the oven (preheated or not) at 400 degrees or so and it's going to be great in an hour or so (just take the top off for the last few minutes to brown the skin). You can pour some liquid into the bottom to keep everything moist (we like strong ale) but it isn't necessary. If you like roast chicken then your kitchen shouldn't be without this wonder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pot to have","review":"I just ordered a second one of these pots since Reco won't make them any more from what I've read. The replacements will have glazed bottom and I don't want that. My favorite dish for this pot is Ratatouille from \\"Clay Cookery\\" by the Editors of Consumer guide. I think it's a bit too small for a 3.5 pound chicken. I bought another Romertopf for that (No. 140).

I love the item--the size is just right and I love the cooking results. That's why I want to replace it with the exact same thing. Thankfully, the very same item is still being made. However, I have ordered this item twice from Amazon, and each time the roaster was completely broken when it arrived. Either the item was broken between the supplier and Amazon or the packaging between Amazon and me was inadequate for this clay baker.

And so I'm here to say I too received this broken due to seemingly poor packing. There was not much buffering. But there's an indication that this item is cheaply made because it was packed somewhat tightly with not much room to bounce, buffered by cardboard from the other half which didn't break, and yet the lid still broke, The box was also fine. The bottom half, on the inside of the clay, had some sort of black rectangular smudge in it, it was light, but still noticeable. Made it seem dirty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Came broken","review":"The Romertopf 3- quart Clay Baker came broken, it was packed terribly, there is no way it could have arrived unbroken.

It is filled with excellent thoughts relating to Christian music, being an overall musician, and being a Christian. The thing that I enjoyed the most was the recognition that Christian musicians need to be trained, prepared, and open to where the worship leads, but also should not use the worship stage as a garage band jumpoff for self-promotion.

I wanted to like this book, hoping that at least if there had to be a prequel written it would actually be good, but it felt like I was reading a bad parody of the original series. Or maybe an alternate universe variation. Zelazny did the bickering family with the initially clueless protagonist already, and he did it 10 times better. If you liked Zelazny's Amber books, you'll be disappointed, or at the very least, bored. If you haven't read Zelazny's Amber books, I suggest you skip this book and read them instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 pages but nothing new","review":"I agree with many other reviewers that the style is uninspired, but Zelazny was a---perhaps *the*---master stylist of science fiction. So I'm willing to cut Betancourt a break there.But the book is boring. Unlike the original Amber novels, there are absolutely no surprises. Anything we learn, see, or discover is already obvious to anyone who has read the original series. No discoveries, no character development, no nothing.And couldn't the publisher afford a proofreader? The edition I read is riddled with typographic errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dung of Amber","review":"Not only does this book mock the late Roger Zelazny's imagination, but it goes too far in mocking any legitimate author that has ever put in the hard work and dedication it takes to create a serious novel. Mr. Betancourt obviously lacks the talent, intelligence and just plain honest work when it comes to writing. This extremely thin, lackluster attempt is bad enough to set the art of writing back one hundred years. I have never, ever been so disappointed in a book in my entire life. There is no plot, no characters, no atmosphere, and no discernible conflict. What else could possibly go wrong? Oh, much, much more! Not only does Mr. Betancourt completely fail to bring anything new or interesting to the table, but he manages to get things from Zelazny's world totally wrong! There are better writers out there in high school, every high school in the entire world!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The last thing Zelazny would ever want","review":"Just to prevent people from being misled by the positive comments ofthe readers here, and by the editorial review, this book is not in any way approved by Zelazny, despite what the cover says.Zelazny was very strongly opposed to this book ever being written and time and time again stated that he didn't want anyone writing any books for Amber. It wasn't until after his death that they felt they could do this becuase he was no longer around to complain.I find that vulgarly offensive to his memory and feel that anyone who buys this book is insulting Zelazny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going from bad to awful.","review":"The WRITING STYLE of these books would have killed even a much better plot and much more interesting characters. This is simply bad prose, clumsily written and ineptly edited. Stilted language and unimaginative settings make the flat, unengaging characters and the meandering story line even worse than they could have been. The 2nd book out of three is somewhat better than the first one and gave me hope that Betancourt was finally learning how to write. It even encouraged me to reread the original two Amber series. But Betancourt's third book was a disaster! It was difficult to finish. The language was even more stilted than in the first book, while the story and the characters lost any depth and luster they seemed to start developing in the second book. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A 11 year old could have done better","review":"Betancourt dosn't even bother to follow the workings of Amber's universe, it is like ignoring gravity, or writing a Star Wars novel with Star Trek transporters.Did Betancourt even read the original series? or did he just have someone outline them for him? A few days of research and reading would have made this more than a cheap way to rip off Amber fans for some money.My advice, Run far away from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dung of Amber","review":"This book stunk. There are only about a million or so psuedo-medieval fantasy stories out there that are more interesting, more creative and more intelligently written than this [weak] excuse for a book. John, here is some advice: Most of your readers are not 12 years old! They would enjoy a moderately fleshed-out character or two in a space of 300 pages! You showed absolutely NO work or ambition in the copping of a few ideas of Zelazny's while not even making an effort to bring a conflict or plot to life. This is an insult to readers and writers alike and should have been mailed back stamped \\"REJECTED\\" by the editor. Anyone who has ever enjoyed a S.F. or fantasy novel will find nothing new here.

I just returned from a 10 day vacation, and it is already falling apart. The plastic moisture barrier is just placed inside, not stitched-in, so it just gets in the way when getting into and out of the wallet.

Rick Steves has dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!","review":"This is the worst money belt. One of the zippers broke within 6 days of use.

I purchased this item for my recent trip to Europe after reading Rick Steves best of Europe in which he mentions getting a money belt. While we were in Paris I put both mine and my boyfriends passports in the belt along with ALL of our cash. Well...we went on one of those private at night tours that he recommends in the book and we got in and out of the car several times. Well the clasp came undone and the money belt slid right off. If it were not for the driver bringing it to my attention the trip could have been a major disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good money belt","review":"I used this money belt in a recent Mediterranean cruise we took. Temperatures were extremely warm and the belt didn't make the temperature unbearable. The belt is made so even the largest person can use it. I go 250lb and I had a lot of belt left. The belt goes on and off quickly featuring and interlocking plastic connector. The belt features a plastic insert which helps keep the contents dry from perspiration; however my plastic insert bent and refuses to come back into shape. I am thinking a warm iron would do it though. The zippered pockets, of which there are two, seamed to be a bit of an over-kill. I seemed to constantly be opening the wrong one. One zipper would be sufficient but it wasn't a big deal. The other features that can't be over-looked is that it is extremely light weight and is washable. If you are looking for an inexpensive money belt that does the job, this one is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice at First","review":"The great thing about this money belt is that it is designed to hold a passport in addition to credit cards and cash. The problem is, being made of silk, it wears very easily with frequent use. I would suggest finding an item designed like this but made of a more durable fabric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for traveling","review":"I got this for a trip to Peru and wore it the whole time to keep my passport, credit cards and cash reserves in. It was very comfortable and light, even when I was working up a sweat while hiking. The silk makes it so it doesn't become clammy against your skin. As others have mentions, the waist strap is excessively long, so if you are an average sized person, you will have to cut off the extra so it will fit comfortably without the end dangling out."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN Europe","review":"We used this product while in Europe for our passports and extra money. It was great and lightweight. The only issue is that our passports are not bendible and were stiff like a hardcover textbook. So, we had to make sure that we wore loose shirts so that the pouch won't show through and look obvious. Otherwise, it was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right","review":"My husband wore this on our trip to Europe and it held all four of our passports, our IDs, our credit cards, and a significant amount of money. I could not tell that he was wearing it under his clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Silk, But not worh the money","review":"My mistake was that I believed in Rick Steve's name.This money belt seems to be decently made. However, I found one major flaw in this product. The idea is to keep your money, credit card, passport and other items hidden and protected. Yes, it will hide it and keep it prtected. But not when you get soaked or when you sweat. This nice silk money belt lacks the moisture barrier. So, what you have in the money belt will get soaked by rain or your sweat. So, get yourself a ziploc bag and then use this item.There are other products are just as good or better than this product for much less money. You can get one locally at bed, bath & beyond."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buckle is worthless","review":"I just tried mine on. The little plastic buckle will not hold. The part of the buckle that is supposed to lock is nothing but a folded piece of plastic which is supposed to act like a spring and lock into the mating piece. The mating piece is so poorly made that it just doesn't lock. A money belt that will not lock aroud the waist isn't really a money belt at all. One star is an over rating. Buy this one only if you want to carry your money belt in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for wearing on hot days","review":"I used this product during a trip to India. The belt provided is too long. I had to have the excess belt rolled up and this made it rather uncomfortable. The bigger issue however is that there is a plastic liner but it is not sealed so this is not an ideal product for hot days - many of which I encountered in India. Having the belt so close to your body means that sweat will get on the product. I thought the plastic liner would protect the money and passport copies I had place in it but was surprised to find that since the liner is not sealed (ie, zip lock or some other enclosure) excessive sweat will get inside the liner. After a few days of finding soaked money and copies, I stopped using the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"daylight","review":"I purchased this from Amazon.

The silk was nice, but in order to make this water/sweat proof they needed to add a layer of nylon behind it. That layer of plastic makes a nice sweaty spot (and I'm not really a sweaty person, either.)In addition, it never seems to stay in one place. It's always hiking up or shifting around to the side. I've tried behind the back, under the belly, on the side, etc. and it never quite seems to be happy with where it is.I think I'll stick with my slightly less secure, but significantly more comfortableEagle Creek Travel Gear Neck Pouchinstead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"I tried this on a recent trip to Italy but gave up after a few days. Maybe I just don't know how to use it correctly but I don't see how this would be useful at all. The pockets were so small that they were really hard to get things in and out of. Not sure if it's supposed to go tucked down inside your pants? if so, it did not stay very well, kept riding up and sticking out the top, so was way more visible than a wallet would have been. Very difficult to quickly access anything when you need it, I was always fumbling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.","review":"Comfortable. Worked well. Washed well. I wore it in Rome and Naples. That said, I bought it after reading Steves' cautions about Italy, but never saw or felt any danger there, to myself or my purse. Well, it's hard to prove a negative. Maybe if I hadn't worn it, I would've wished I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and comfortable","review":"Safe, secure, non-bulky. After you have it on for just a little while you will forget it is even there. There are no stiff or rough edges on it and the zipper pulls are small. If you're a little bigger person, dont worry...one size fits all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"Firstly, the delivery on this product was fairly quick. Secondly, I just used it for a week in Italy and I love it. As a woman, I was concerned about how it would sit on my tummy, but since I wore skirts and dresses, I wore my Spanx in which the money belt fit nicely between the two layers. At some points, I forgot that I had it on, but I knew that it couldn't have gone anywhere because of the Spanx. I will say that the belt does get a little sweaty (or a lot, depending on the activity of the day), so make sure that your documents and passport are within a plastic baggy before placing in the money belt. Also, note that the strap is a bit long, but prior to traveling, I adjusted it accordingly and cut off the excess strap (and sewed it onto itself to prevent any fraying - not sure it even frays, but I wanted to plan ahead).In summary, I definitely recommend this product for anyone who wants the safety of knowing their important documents are protected while traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"As people have mentioned, the plastic can get a little bent up but I was just careful to keep flattening it when I stored it away. Other than that, it was comfortable and it didn't make you look bulky. I cut the strap as advised here and had no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silky and sleek","review":"Very comfortable material and so sleek you may forget you are wearing it. I wore it for 17 days straight and most of the time forgot I had it on. The zippers are placed so that you can open a pocket without having to look to see which one you are using. Credit cards easy to get to - plenty of room for passports (I carried two) and lots of cash and other documents. Strap is extremely long - will fit any person I have ever seen. Only complaint - after a couple of weeks hiking in 100 degree heat the plastic liner did stick closed - but that was also great to keep the sweat out of my documentation - so I don't know if it was that bad. Love that fact that I took out the plastic liner and threw it in the washer. Ready for my next trip with my pouch!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Late Shipment","review":"I can't speak to the quality of the product. But I needed it rushed for my trip out of the country.

It spent the whole time in my backpack. I traveled to London, Paris, around Germany, Vienna, Prague, and in Morroco. Not once did I feel the need for security to use this money belt. For women, I think that as long as you take a good purse you will be fine. I took a purse that could be across my body and then it had all zippered compartments and a flap that went over the compartments on the front and velcroed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of No Use","review":"I tried wearing the thing once.

Cheaper than cheap in quality, the plastic clasp (to hold the darn thing together around your waist obviously!) broke the first time I used it on our recent 2-week retirement trip to Europe. Not just came loose dropping the money belt into my shorts, but was absolutely unfixable/useless after that. And the quality of the rest of this cheapo belt is nothing to write home about either (cheap zippers, etc.). Paid $25 for this junk in August--now it's $12.95!Rick Steves New Silk Money Belt. Tres angry indeed. Too late to return. Disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-Secure Security","review":"Despite claims in the product description, the plastic buckle on the strap of this money belt is of poor quality and easily comes apart leaving the money belt loose under your clothes.

It was a bit uncomfortable if you put a lot of money in it. But it did its job."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have never bought it","review":"First off, I have to say that money belts are just not for me. I felt awkward wearing it.The strap is too long, but I adjusted it, cut the \\"tail\\" off, and pinned the end with a safety pin to keep everything in place. But the damn thing just won't stay put. I wanted it to my little secret bellow the belt, but it kept riding up to my belly. When it has too much money in it, or just a passport, it makes me look lumpy. So the point of having a money belt is negated, because everyone can see that I'm wearing one!I ended up just putting my extra cash in a hidden pocket on the inside of my jacket.Sorry Rick Steves. I still love the show though."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"We love Rick Steves books. The best investment for traveling. We thought his travel products would be just as great... We bought two money belts, one for each my husband and myself. The elastic is long which allows you to cut it to fit. My husband cut his to fit his 34\\" waist. The buckle/ clasp broke the first time he wore it! Because I had options for carrying my belongings, he replaced the broken buckle with the buckle from the unused second belt. It broke as well! He ended up rigging the thing up with a lanyard from his convention name badge. This make-shift solution held up for the remainder of our three week trip. On the positive side, the silk was comfortable and the compartments were perfect for travel documents and money. Just replace the buckle and it is a pretty good product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This belt was exactly what I needed. When worn, you'll hardly notice it. I'm a female who wore skinny jeans while I was using the money belt and it easily fit inside my jeans, right below my waist. Other times when I was less worried, I would simply wear it around my waist - and you visually couldn't even tell that it was there. If you sweat, the silk does get wet, but the lining on the inside prevents any of the documents/money from getting wet. Also, once the silk gets wet, when you take it off, the silk dries very quickly. And yes, the waistband is very long, but you can simply cut to your liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"too fragile","review":"On the surface it seemed a good idea, however the clasp is *very* fragile and broke after the first day.Not recommended as there are much sturdier ones out there"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Steves Silk Money Belt","review":"Bought one for my trip to Asia last week and it does exactly what it's supposed to. Has one large pocket for money/passport, and two smaller pockets in front of the large pocket for credit cards, ID, etc. It is very light so it fits easily around your waist. Like other people said, the strap is very long, it seems that they made it large enough to fit a person with the waist of 50\\". It's not that big of a problem though, I just tucked it into my pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for passport!","review":"The product was basically what I wanted - an under the clothes money belt and secure place for cash and a passport. The product has several pockets, presumably for cash and a passport and other important documents. However, the pockets are too small for a passport. So, it really only has one usable pocket. The size of my US passport has not changed in the past 20 years, so obviously the design of the product is flawed."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for Italy","review":"This money belt is fairly comfortable to wear if you are a woman. It certainly detracts all the pickpockets. I was able to have my euros and a copy of my passport with me at all times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Money Belt","review":"This is worry free product.

Instead of one large pocket and one credit card pocket in front, the pocket is stitched down the middle. This means that cash will not fit in the front pocket and has to go in the back with larger items such as a passport and any other important papers.I ordered and expected the exact one pictured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Money Belt!","review":"Bought this for a recent trip to New Orleans due to pickpockets/muggings in the French Quarter. Very soft and lightweight silk. The strap is stretchy, so when you set it to your size, it doesn't dig in. The strap is very long, so it could be worn by people of many sizes. If you're a smaller person, you may have to alter the strap so it doesn't hang down. You do sweat wearing it, but it dries out fast. The plastic sleeve insert kept my money completely dry, and the belt was undetectable under my pants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moderate usefulness","review":"This is a good product if you're traveling to a place with high crime and are not very aware of your surroundings. I'm a little paranoid when traveling though. I assume everyone is a criminal waiting to rob so I'm always aware of what's going on around me. I used this thing for a few days during a month of travel in Europe then it spent the remaining 3 1/2 weeks in the bottom of my bag. With the use of ATMs and credit cards, there is no need to carry large sums of cash. My passport was secured in my camera bag, which never left my side, so no worry of losing that.Build quality on the item is pretty good however for those people looking to buy it. Embarrassment factor is extremely high when you get fined for having improper tickets on the European train system and you have to reach into your money belt for extra cash to pay the fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just repeating what other have said...","review":"Highly recommended.

I heard about how travelers were prime targets of pick pockets and I wanted some protection. I placed my passport and large cash denominations in the money belt. I didn't get anything stolen. But wearing the belt gave me piece of mind so that I could actually enjoy myself. I still recommend carrying a wallet with you and putting a day's worth of cash in it. Then you won't have to reach into your money belt and give away your secret. Also, if you get mugged, hopefully they'll be satisfied with the wallet and leave you alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Actually this could be a little more perfect if they supplied a sweat barrier. I put some plastic in mine to stop the sweat, so it worked.. But, this is a great product. Some people talk about the extra length belt being an issue, and it is, sorta.. some people cut the extra off, after they know about how much they need, but the extra did not bother me, so I just left it one.. Worked as good as I have hoped. Actually better.. I had never worn one.. I expected it to be a hassle.. It was not. I did not even notice it until it was time to use the bathroom or get undressed at night, and even then, it was not a real problem.. so, I can recommend this as being a great product for you to buy and use...

It held my 2 ID cards, my bank card, my passport, plane ticket and all money I had on me that I wasn't going to use that day and you couldn't tell I was wearing it. This money belt is super comfortable and will fit just about anyone. The belt is stretchy and easily adjustable. I love how it's made out of silk and not stiff uncomfortable nylon like other brands.

Also, pictures of subjects farther away than 28\\" came out dark and/or washed out as well. The color saturation is overwhelming, and I just couldn't take it.

The size of the camera is also nice: not small enough to get lost and not too large as to be bulky. The optical zoom (or physical zoom) is great and can be enhanced by the digital zoom. Overall, a fine value and a fine product. Recommended.The prices are even lower than when I purchased this a year ago. Grab one today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks for nothing...","review":"I loved this camera for the length of the warranty. The day it expired, so did the camera. I'd put the batteries in and it would turn on, then immediately shut off. Kodak suggested I buy their brand of batteries. I did, and it still didn't work. Useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"This is my 2nd Easy Share Camera. I would still be using the 1st(2 years old) but the zoom button came off. Kodak changed the design of the zoom button, making it smaller and stronger, so I purchased this updated model. These cameras are so easy to use, with great picture quality. Their software is also easy to use to enhance your prints, crop them etc. The recovery time for flashes is instant unlike other, more expensive, cameras my friends have."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"Simple, easy to operate tough, perfect for trips, kids and the price is right.

Makes it easy to load your pictures on the EasyShare web-site to share with family and friends. Only 4 MP, but our photos are very clear and good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Starter","review":"This is a nice camera if you are just getting into the whole digital camera game. It won't do everything you want, but it is an inexpensive way to get started to see if you wish to continue in the digital point and shoot game. Yes, I agree, it does go throught batteries fairly quick, but if you buy yourself some rechargeable batteries, so what. This does very good for everyday and vacation photos.This is not necessarily for someone who has been taking digi-photos for a while, but for someone who wants a decent camera at a decent price. It may not be the best camera out there, but it is a long way from the worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK point and shoot","review":"I bought this to take to Germany and it did pretty good. I wouldn't get this one if you are wanting to do action photos though. The only other weakness is the zoom but for the price you can't beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine","review":"This camera is fine, picture wise. But it eats batteries WAY too fast. We constantly have to change them, and it won't work w/ rechargeable ones.

I will not buy Kodak again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a steal","review":"I got this from J&R Music world for like $80. I've taken some fabulous photos with this thing. This is actually my second.

My one complaint is that it eats batteries like crazy... make sure you have rechargeables."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wrong Battery included in package...BEWARE","review":"For the most part this is a fine digital camera. I purchased one via amazon for my wife 6 months ago, and my daughter asked for one for her birthday. We are very happy with this and it does everything we would like it to.ONE WARNING - the directions of this camera make it clear that one MUST use LITHIUM batteries, yet Kodak includes within the box a free pair of ALKALINE batteries. Trying to use these incorrect batteries causes the photo lens cover to freeze up...remain closed after only a brief use. For those unaware, it takes the frustration of getting ahold of the invoie and contacting Kodak about the problem.Do yourself a favor...should you want to buy this camera..and it is a good one...also purchase LITHIUM batteries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"kodak easy share c330 4mp digital camera with 3x optical zoom","review":"great camera with memory card lots of photos. loss of battery power the only negative"},{"rating":"2","title":"The kids love it!","review":"We have three teenage kids. They wanted to take pictures all the time with \\"dad's\\" camera. So we got them each a C330. These cameras are easy to use and they get great looking pictures. They find sharing their pictures on line via the Kodak easy share site a lot of fun and it's easy. I only have to buy one kind of memory card, and the downloading software is very easy to use on the computer. Now the kids can capture us for a change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I've had this camera for awhile but if your trying to take pictures of your kids you are going to hate this. The shutter speed is so sloww that you will almost always miss the shot you want to take. Not to mention if anyone slightly moves ...the picture ends up blurry. I used rechargable energizer batteries.. this ends up quite an expense ... i just wish you could plug it in or dock it somehow to charge it. extremely frustrating. It gets worse n worse over time... probably won't last you more than 2 years at the MOST. if you forget your SD card for any reason... you can only store 6 photos on it's internal memory. I would never buy any EasyShare every again. My sister had a different model and that died on her not long after she bought it also. If you are looking for suggestions... Look for a Nikon coolpix or Casio Exilim... they have some very good affordable options as well as some more extreme options. Don't waste your money guys..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Great","review":"I bought this camera a little over a month ago after selling my previous Canon Powershot A80. Compared to the Canon, this camera is terrible. It takes mediocre pictures that are usually washed out and the white balance is just flat out bad. I sincerely wish I did not sell my last camera, as it was in such good condition. I do plan to get rid of this camera, and buy a new one... Fast.If you are looking for a good, compact camera, Canon, Sony Cybershots, and Fujis are good choices. Kodaks just don't come through with good pictures, at all.The battery life is also terrible. I used rechargable batteries, and they still only lasted about an hour and I was only able to take a few pictures with then having to delete most of them.This camera is not worth the money at all, I suggest that anyone who is looking at this camera keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Camera","review":"This camera is small and durable! 4.0 MP is just perfect.

I took couple dozen pictures with this and returned it immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been reading the other reviews of this camera and honestly I don't know where all the praise is coming from. When you view photos on the computer it is very misleading because they look fine. Once they are developed you will notice that the pictures come out blurry and the color is off. Some colors are so bright it just doesn't look right. Secondly, the developed photo covers a smaller area than the computer photo. For me I think the picture is centered until it is developed and I notice someone's head is cut off or something. Again, it looked fine on the computer. Red-eye galore, and the date stamp is huge and a distraction to the picture. Needless to say, I am disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH!!","review":"OK, MY MOM AND DAD JUST bought this camera.

Although as well written, the story was much darker. The main character is evil itself and the notion of evil. I would rather read something a little more light-hearted. All of the characters seem to lose whatever goodness they posessed in the first book and give in to the 'chaos' taking hold of their world. Ms. Hoyt could have taken a totally different direction with the fantasy and explored the more positive aspects of the fairy realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOF'FEET CREAM","review":"I PURCHASED THIS CREAM, AND I LOVE IT.

(Of the many things that were wrong with Tim Burton's version, perhaps the most jarring was the decision to made the headless horseman a real person, when in the book it is clear it is a prank to scare Ichabod Crane out of the village). Unfortunately, the fact that this is a faithful version does not necessarily mean that it is an interesting film to watch. In fact, it is pretty dull. The unknown actor portraying Crane doesn't help a lot, either. (Other actors in the movie are more appealing). Still, if you have read the original story, you might be interested to watch this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good depiction!","review":"I enjoyed The Legend of Sleepy Hollow when it came out on Hallmark in 1999, and wondered why they never ran it again.

Bach on his own merits. The symphonies are quirky, dramatic, sometimes even a bit bizarre, and yet balanced; the cello concerti have that quality of galant-mixed-with-disquiet that pops up often in the works of C.P.E.

But as a dog history nerd, this book is not the best. The larger version is \\"The Encyclopedia of the Dog\\" by Bruce Fogle and also has not correct information, saying that the Labrador Retriever comes from England!!!! That is not correct, and is even more false than saying it came from Labrador, Canada (it came from Nova Scotia). There are also some other problems with it. The condensed version (this book) is just a worse version, being smaller with not as many breeds, and the best ones picked out (like the Dingo, which has an intersting history). All the history sections of the breeds mainly talk about where the dog came from, not the dogs it descended from like the larger version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greyhound Ignorance!","review":"The Greyhound information is way off base in this publication! I have owned greyhounds for over 11 years and can tell you that Fogle does not know this breed.

I have a small business and have over 50,000 copies on each of my two HP 1200 laserJet printers. The copies are crisp and clean. When it gets to the end, you you can remove the cartridge and gently rock it back and forth a few times to get another 30-40 copies. You can do this twice, mayyybbee three times maximum.

Many of the lines are so close it's just TOO obvious. eg 1) p8 AMGTW: \\"I make myself the catch.\\" p69 HTDYW 1: \\"I'm the catch here not you...\\" eg 2) p48 AMGTW: If a girl ever blocks advancing the relationship by saying \\"No let's just be friends,\\" say, \\"No, I have lots of friends.

I was also already engaged to be married and didn't \\"need\\" it. But after I and a few friends around the office paged through it, we agreed he had many rational ideas and strategies for men still \\"in the market\\" for such things. Personally, I think dating a much younger woman---certainly someone in their 20's---would try my patience, and ultimately become a bore. But for those so inclined, these strategies probably, on balance, are helpful.It sure does draw double-takes from purveyers of my library collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise...not a rip-off.","review":"Let's face it, you've got to have your BS meter on in this genre. To my pleasant surprise, this one passes.Why do many of the most important parts of life come without an instruction manual? If you are like me and lack the natural gift for understanding, meeting, and courting women...this book is the best how-many-ever dollars you'll spend this year.This is the kind of book I really like: practical, plain-spoken, well-organized, and with the personality of the author shining through. Did I mention funny?The book does not seem one of those written by a professional writer or entrepreneur looking for a hot subject to ride. Steele appears to have lived this stuff, has a talent for it...and has the smarts, gumption, and training (as a psychotherapist) to package what he knows for our benefit.

If you're a 38 year old divorced woman, you might want to skip this book if you have thin skin.The author has a caustic, politically incorrect wit that spares no one, even the targeted reader. I laughed out loud.Plenty of very realistic advice on dating the percentage of younger women, that will enjoy older men.Preaches decent ethics too. Nobody needs to get hurt.The only reservation is the book is from late 1980's. Revised or not, It's a tad out of date."},{"rating":"2","title":"The truth is told","review":"R. Don Steeles book, How to Date Young Women is a step-by-step approach to deliver real results in dating. I found it very entertaining and enlightening. I know in my own experience I have made many of the false assumptions he describes that most of us poor smuck's try on women that just don't work! Society has trained us to be at a disadvantage with women. Finally the truth is told. In a very short time after reading his book and applying his ideas several women have profoundly increased their interest with just a few of his techniques. It's amazing to see and feel the control you have over a relationship if you know what to do. Don tells it like it is!

Why else would someone young want someone older. Young women want to have sex with hot guys in their age group not middle-aged geesers who are desperate (unless they have lots of (money)).

This book hits a home run! Don gives you no-frills advice on how to change your life to date and mate with the women you really want to be with. From how to dress and what car drive to where to meet them and maintaining the right attitude, it's all covered in this brutally honest book. But this work isn't just applicable to older men. Younger men who want to make themselves more attractive to the opposite sex can also use the techniques. It shows you what women want and how to become it so that they will want you. I was very naive about women when I purchased the book, but Don set me straight. I was stunned by some of Don's revelations, but must admit in retrospect that he was right on. Buy the book, learn the techniques, apply them, and change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Info, Written Like A Child ...","review":"Seems rather pathetic on the surface, but is a great wake up call to the middle aged man.This book is full of great information on how to bed young girls when you are 'over the hill'. It gets to the heart of the female mind, and defines specific paths you need to take to accomplish a goal. Over all it is a very direct book on how to get laid, and how to use your age to your benefit in the dating scene.My negative about the book is the constantly pervasive tone reminding grown readers of how emotionally stunted the writer is. End-to-end it reads as if you were being coached by a 16 year old football player while seated in a dim, squalid locker room. The entire style of writing isn't much better than a zitty high schooler can muster. So keep that in mind as you push the 'purchase' button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Insight and Information","review":"This book provides some excellent albeit dated advise on dating younger women and on getting a sagging lifestyle back into fighting trim. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"more body language/right attitude nonsense","review":"My God but this book was hard to read due to bad editing and writing. However, the basic message SEEMS to come thru.I think the basic premise of this book is that an older man can get a younger woman without looks or money, which is utter and total nonsense. Sure, there may be a few young women looking for the father figure they never had when growing up. But we all know that they are few and far between.Does any man really believe this books ideas? How many times have we men seen another man come into or start making money and then all of a sudden become the focus of many womens attention where he was was absolutely ignored before?It would be interesting to secretly witness Mr. Steeles dealings with these young women.

Don Steele). Before purchasing any of White/Steele's books, check out his interview in the Jan. 6, 2000 online issue of LA New Times magazine. Steele's How to Date Young Women series downplays a fundamental truth many relationship authorities of both sexes agree on: women marry and mate for power and resources. White/Steele took SIX weeks to ask out the woman who is his current wife. Plus he steers readers towards lesser-attractive women. Writing and editing are surprisingly crude, his limited number of observations are constantly repeated. This stuff might've worked when Carter was President, too many more-modern works available here at Amazon.com. Do check out White's interview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor book, but the spam is even worse!","review":"The book is mediocre at best. Wasn't even worth finishing.In my defense, I bought it during a nasty divorce. Call it a moment of stupidity on my part.When I got it, the orders were probably being filled by the author himself since it is self published.I say that because that is the only reason that explains how I ended up on his email list.Unfortunately, I have never been able to get off of it. It has been over 8 years now if I remember correctly.Requesting removal doesn't work. Only seems to prod him on to send more.Blocking him doesn't work because every few months, he changes email addresses and/or servers.If you want to get spammed to death by this clown for years to come, having him tell you how smart he is and has it all figured out, go ahead and get it. You have been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"crude but true","review":"The first time I read this book the information provided was provocative and I couldn't put the book down until I had read it cover to cover.

Now my only regret is that I didn't know about this book 10 years ago when I first became single again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book in the Dating Genre","review":"Although the title of this book suggests that it has a limited target audience, the appeal is much broader. For any man who wants to improve his dating skills, not just those who are over 35 and interested in very young women, this is the best book on the market. I have read about 10 other self-help books on this topic and this is by far the best. The only competitor that even comes close is Louis and Copeland's \\"How to Succeed with Women.\\"One of the characteristics of this book that sets it apart from all others is the lucid explanation of motivation and gender differences. Steele's explanation of What Women Want is based on a solid understanding of evolutionary psychology and sociobiology. I haven't seen this level of psychological sophistication in any other How-to-date book.If you are a recently divorced man who is reentering the dating scene, buy this book. It will change your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING ELSE LIKE IT!","review":"Completely unlike any other book on the subject. Brash, funny, and above all, HONEST.

Don Steele tells it like it really is","review":"This book opened my eyes both to the unspoken rules and issues in the game of love, as well as to what it means to be a man with the right attitude required to succeed with young women, or any women.The book is written from Don's experience and is a clear, step by step, how-to manual for anyone interested in transforming himself into someone desirable and datable to younger women.Also extremely enjoyable, funny, and entertaining to read. A book to be read over and over like the bible until the various points of wisdom sink in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative yet nuanced","review":"HTDYW has illumined moments concerning the male/female dynamic. While poorly written for the inexperienced man there are benefits within. I would caution the reader that Steeles MO is successfull only with women who are inexperienced and lack dynamic self. Very attractive, bright women do not respond to the narcissistic manipulation which his tecnigues employ. Steele is quite jaded and bitter as well...if you assume his view your natural trust in women will be forever changed (and) your paranoid reflex engaged. This book has a pack mentality ,is really for Men uncomfortable with designing their own lives. Steele is NOT the worthy mans guru, by and large, his effort is self serving.

Don't get fooled by the \\"Adventuring\\" in the title, unless your idea of adventure is to hop by plane from lodge to lodge at $200 or $300 a night. More importantly, except for the park entrance fees, this book doesn't list any price at all (I got them from two other, excellent, travel guides). Comments on cheaper accomodations are few and disenchanted. The maps are equally few and over-simplified (the roads don't even appear!...) Finally, I looked at the chapters about the other countries and it certainly didn't change my opinion about this book.

I hunted around, and yes, these are the cheapest axel sockets you can get - in every sense of the word. They are not true - 30mm may be 31mm, 29mm may be 27mm. Their manufacture uses a stamp method that resulted in at least two of the sockets not even being centered. Astro Pneumatic has been unavailable to even discuss replacing the two off-center sockets (they are so close to the thin wall they are unquestionably going to fail). I was able to R&R the steering hub, but I will dump these at the first opportunity - I don't see how you could ever really depend on them - and they will most likely fail when you need them the most.

The socket fit the nut perfectly with no play. I used to go to a local auto store and get a 4 socket axle nut set on the tool loan program. This socket set may not be your most used tool set but at this price it is convenient to have on hand instead of getting a loaner. I'm very happy with this set and wished I had purchased it sooner.

Yes, I'm sure that they would do that, rather than return what would have remained back to the company of origin.I was then advised that the 3 lb. set could be resent right away, but the 5 lb. set would take longer; I agreed, asking that they be sent \\"two-day\\".

I was already familiar with Shepard's plays and prose, and had seen him perform in most of his films. He is one of the great American writers, with a brilliant use of language and characterization. This film paints an equally gifted portrait of Shepard that, like his writing, leaves one with questions regarding the nature of existence and, specific to the film, the nature of being a writer and actor. There are some very amusing anecdotes (Shepard's fear of flying), excerpts from Shepard reading his prose, and interviews that give a glimpse into the mind of the writer. This is a documentary, and one with an artful eye toward its subject matter. Even if you know very little about Shepard, you'll enjoy the film for it's own artistic insight, humor, and visuals."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad expiration date","review":"I purchased it on Amazon in Dec 2012.

After playing it I realized it was a gospel CD. I decided to give it to my sister who is a youth director at her church ages 12-16. I gave her the CD and the teenagers enjoyed the CD on a bus ride to church camp. They felt they could relate instead of singing with the tune the \\"traditional\\" Amazing Grace. It's a CD in which teenagers enjoy due to the beats and tempo. It's gospel with the R&B twist that they enjoy. When you see 12-16 year olds playing the music and singing to Restoration, I Surrender All, and Going over Yonder. Even a young soloist singing Center of my Joy. I just want to say it's which all generations and ages can enjoy. It's great when new artist can go back to his gospel roots and produce an entertaining and inspirational CD. This CD has scratches due to how often it it played and borrowed by our youth.

I really think that Ruben Studdard has a future in gospel music.I was surprised by the reviews saying there wasn't one enjoyable track on the album. Because of all the R&B; Hip/Hop gospel out there we have lost our appreciation for more traditional songs. You know the kind where you can understand the lyrics! The title track is wonderful and I had tell myself to take it off repeat. Other great tracks are Restoration, Don't Give Up, his rendition of Goin Up Yonder, Running Back to You and his original tune with Fred Hammond. The only reason why I didn't give the album five stars is because I think Ruben has not really shown us his maximum potential vocally. I wish people who can't sing and are not in his shoes would give this man a break and allow him time to develop his craft. Buy the cd. You will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Root of Ruben","review":"Ruben sounds incredibly comfortable within the Gospel genre. He voice radiates far more on this album than his previous offering. However, the composition on a few of the selections is a little too Pop for my taste in gospel.

Nonetheless, this is an uplifting album to be enjoyed by anyone still interested in good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bringing it Home","review":"When I was a kid, my grandmother used to take me to the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem in an attempt to instill the spirit in me.

Many years have passed since then, but good gospel music always brings me right back to those days when praise was the word.Ruben's got it, that's for sure. This collection is inspiring and powerful. I love \\"Restoration\\" the most but all the tracks move me and take me right back to Harlem.Props to Ruben for taking this musical risk. So the CD isn't a top seller on the secular charts, but he's at the top of the heap on the Gospel charts, breaking sales records that have stood for seven years. Ruben's had a lot of struggles this year and I hope that this CD will give him strength and fortitude to carry on.We are going to be hearing a lot from him, I reckon.

What they don't dig are leaks and blow-up attachments/gizmos that quickly hang limply over the edges and get in their way of play.

I did figure it out about half way through without really trying, though, but it didn't take anything away from the excitement! The only other negative to the story is that I live in Alaska and I don't think the author really got the point across of just HOW cold it can get here in the winter. Negative temperatures for a month or more! Good book and the best fictional account of the Last Great Race I have read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this won awards","review":"Info about the race was interesting, but as a mystery, it was clunky and labored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Murder on the Iditarod Trail","review":"With my love of Alaska, this book fit the bill. The Iditarod Race has began and soon a few of the contestants are being picked off one by one. Some are liked and some are wounded enough to have to stop their participation in the race. Alex Jensen begins his job during the continuation of the race to find out who is the killer. One of the racers, Jess Arnold, begins to warm Alex's heart on her brief stops during the race. Alex fears for Jess' welfare as he investigates each of the racers. How can he find the killer before Jess and the other mushers are hurt or killed? The book contains a map of the race which helps the reader to locate the position of the racers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The only redeeming feature here is the detailed description of the Iditarod race. That admittedly interesting aspect must be what made this book an award-winner, for I sure can't see any other reasons. The plot is predictable (even laughable), the characters cardboard, the dialogue wooden, the \\"romance\\" sophomoric, and the detective does very little actual detecting. My journey through Sue Henry's work ends here at the first checkpoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"small changes big results","review":"I did not find anything new in this book which I had not read on internet.

Nothing that my doctor hasn't told me a million times! I looked Ellie up by name because I have seen her on TV and think she makes healthy delicious food and I want to start eating right. I am trying to figure out if I am a moron for not recognizing that this was NOT a cookbook or maybe for thinking that Ellie only writes cookbooks, but in any event this book it not for me.

I am only into week three and I have already lost 9 pounds, mainly due to journaling what I eat--that makes me stop and think before I just eat \\"any old thing\\" because I have to write it down! I've tried a couple of recipes from the book also, and they are great. Thanks to Ellie's \\"Usually/Sometimes/Rarely\\" food guide, you don't feel deprived like you when you're officially on a \\"diet.\\" I think that is what is making this approach so successful for me--I feel like I have choices in what I eat (and I do!). I am going to purchase all the other books Ellie has written, and I watch and record her program on Food Network and the Cooking Channel.

For example, week two is about understanding hunger. It also provides a section on \\"action\\" which takes the reader through the exercise phase.

I'd seen Ellie's show on the Food Network a couple of times then stopped watching because the stuff she makes is still fattening if you're trying to stay in shape. Sure it has healthy fats, blah, blah, but that doesn't keep you in shape. I'd be a bit forgiving if the stuff actually tasted great, but it's mediocre at best. The book is no different.

Ellie Krieger just doesn't get it. There was not one useful tip in this book if you've ever before owned a diet book at all. I've seen her show a few times and feel that she doesn't get it there either. She's supposedly making healthy food, but doesn't give nutritionals for it. And she says everything is \\"gorgeous\\" or beautiful--it's nauseating. Yesterday she was making some peach french toast bake thing and had just mixed egg and milk and vanilla and was gushing with this fake face about how great it smelled. How does raw egg smell good?!? Come on. Let's be serious. There are so many better chefs (wait, she's not a chef) and even nutritionists out there who clearly live this life. Ellie is not one of them and it is reflected in her work across the board.

To make small changes in your lifestyle instead of trying to make an unattainable commitment.

Yes, it's true that some sections seem simple and unnecessary, but I think that is going to be the case for anyone, based on their background.

Moreover, it doesn't flake or form a hard crust, and has a firm hold considering how light it applies.I fill in my eyebrows with a pen first, and then brush in the mousse -- I'm happy to report the mousse does not remove any of the brow pencil. It helps my brows stay in place all day, without looking like I smeared AquaNet or Dep on my face (which other products do).

The highlight of the album is the heart-wrenching song, \\"When You Come Back\\" from the Sundance -winning film, AMANDLA! but I can't really say there's a clunker on the album.

Not even an insane Op Ivy that wants to get all of their merchandise should buy this album! it's ridiculous! terrible! don't bother even paying a penny for it.

These songs just dont understand what's so great about OpIvy.Most of the songs covered here are from a cd called \\"Energy\\". OpIvy songs are supposed to be fast.

Covering the whole thing over-produced and such ruins the whole feeling the original band had which made it so special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite OpIvy, yet still good","review":"If you buy this CD thinking it will be another OpIvy CD then you may be dissapointed. If you like Operation Ivy you should check this out, but don't expect it to be just like them. Take it as what it is; other bands doing Operation Ivy songs. Like others have said, I think Bad Town should have been done differently. It just doesn't work when done with a rap group. Yelling In My Ear was done weird, but it's still good.

The only song that even comes close is \\"Freeze Up\\". Reel Big Fish fans will like \\"Unity\\" but most songs were changed so much that they're unrecognizable. Especially \\"Bad Town\\", the best song Op Iv ever came out with is totally screwed over and turned into hip-hop format. It's even bad hip-hop.

The sound quality appears to be mono, as if someone placed the recorder in front of a bad amp in Jabanoski's bathroom. The lyrics are simple and Bill's simply trying too hard to write songs.

I Wish You were Beautiful\\" sound of Buffett's even though you don't hear it much any more.When I got this CD, I wondered why I hadn't heard of this guy before. I guess it's because I'm from Utah and singers like Jabanoski and Buffett aren't really popular around here in Mormon country. This Cd is Buffett when he used to be great! Roadkill Bill Jabanoski doesn't sound like Buffett or try to but he's got all the fun that Buffett used to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key West Party? Key West Waste of Money.","review":"What a really aweful disc. As a devoted Parrothead, I understand that Bill Jabanoski has a loyal cult following, but this disc is just terrible. Apparently, Bill records in his living room, as the sound quality is fair at best. As for his flat singing, monotonous melodies, and lifeless voice, he's much better suited for his other job as a writer. I'd rather listen to a collection of Keith Richards' acapella show tunes than have to sit through this one again. I'm sure Bill's self-absorbed lyrics sound very important to him, but as I listened to this disc (and believe me that was a task after the first few songs) I kept picturing a guy who fancies himself cast from the Jimmy Buffett mold, but without anywhere near the talent. Bill, just because you live in Key West, that doesn't make you a songwriter. I can honestly say this is one of the worst CD's I have ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as it gets........","review":"This is just a horrible cd.

Its like listening to Buffett twenty years ago before he lost all his talent and we found out what a jerk he is. You never stop laughing or just having fun listening to it. I know The Green Parrot and Lobsters From Outer Space are what everybody talks about and there both very very fun and funny but my favorites are This Magic Night and Conch Dreams. Its all just great fun and anyone who can't enjoy this Cd just doesn't have a sense of humor or fun at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing of the Guard","review":"As hard as it is for an old Parrothead like myself to admit, the mantle really has been passed from Buffett to Jabanoski. Listening to this CD and comparing it to Buffett's \\"License to Chill\\" is like comparing a great smorgasbord to Buffett's Hamburger Helper. I'm happy though that at least the mantle of Key West music has been passed to a guy like Jabanoski who is as committed a humanitarian as he is committed to his career. This CD and Liz O'Connor's \\"Legacy of Love\\" are both excellent, although I think Jabanoski's \\"Beach Bum Bottleg\\" is even better than this one, and that's saying alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not As Great As \\"Florence Martus\\" (What is?), But Great Fun","review":"No, you can't compare this CD to Jabanoski's dark Absolute Masterpiece \\"Florence Martus,\\" but this retrospective of the fun, wildly humorous side of him is still great fun. As anyone who's ever seen him live knows, he can \\"switch gears\\" (as he calls it) on you faster than anyone I've ever seen. You're laughing uncontrollably one minute when he's plays \\"Lobsters From Outer Space\\" or \\"Never Again Until Tonight\\" or \\"Green Parrot,\\" and then wanting to almost cry at our inhumanity when he plays songs like \\"The Real Enemy\\" or \\"The Hanging of Calico Jack.\\" The mix of the dark and fun sides is brilliant, but I still think it was a good idea for his record company to release this retrospective of all his fun Key West songs. Sometimes you just want to have fun and laugh With what you're listening to, especially in these dark times, and this CD is fun all the way from first note to last. A truly great songwriter and performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"ISLAND OF DREAMS\\" Is The Better Cd","review":"I really enjoyed this Cd. The songs and Jabanoski's performances are top notch and songs like \\"THE GREEN PARROT\\" and \\"LOBSTERS FROM OUTER SPACE\\" are amazingly hilarious.Though because its a \\"Greatest Party Hits\\" of sorts and some of these recordings go back as far as 1990, when I guess they didn't have all that great recording equipment down in Key West, about four or five of the oldest tracks aren't recorded very well. It doesn't stop you from enjoying the songs like \\"NEVER AGAIN UNTIL TONIGHT\\" but Jabanoski's record company really should have done a better job of cleaning these up before they re-released them.Jabanoski's new Cd, \\"KEY WEST, FLORIDA. ISLAND OF DREAMS\\" is far better. The songs and performances are just as good if not better and the recording on that Cd is perfect. Buy that one first, but I still recommend this Cd because it is a whole lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection!","review":"Great collection! My wife knows what a crazily Parrotheaded guy I am and love that tropical sound and Key West and since I own every Buffett CD, she bought me this one and Liz O'Connor's \\"LOL, Recorded Live In Key West.\\" for Christmas. Five big stars to both of them. Great songwriting, singing, storytelling and musicianship. Now I want to buy the rest of this guys fun stuff to.

He may be a great guy and a true key-west local, but he is not a singer. This cd is by far the worst I've ever purchased. There is some guy talking about something (not really sure what) and every now and then he strums a gituar. No beat, no melody, no nothing. There are a few songs he attempts to sing on but he sounds like a constapated sam kennison sitting on the \\"throne\\". Any one giving this 5 stars must be doing so out of sarcasim, (or they are related to him.)I like Jimmy Buffet songs and was looking for something along those lines only differant.

(It's important to realize that these books are sequels to the film, not the Phillip K. Dick Book \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\") I got the feeling that Jeter's intention of his first sequel was to provide closure to what happened after the events of the film and would create new adventures in the Blade Runner future. Instead, in \\"Replicant Night\\", he goes right back to Los Angeles 2019 and revisits scenes that were done in the film.

It jumps from a scene being filmed to the action and back again. In the end you see the same cast as the original movie doing pretty much the same stuff as before.I found the book to be tedious as he retold old scenes from the movie and wove them into the new plot.

Ridley Scott did a masterful job making Dick's disjointed writing into a classic dark and dystopian science fiction film. Replicant Night ignobly retires the concept by forcing where it should never have gone. Based on the film and not Dick. Noir becomes gris. Pure drek. Nothing original. No real story. So plodding I had to stop about half way through. I can't tell you how it ends because the author simply made it so I could not care less.

The hero was not really well developed and the heroine was a bit one dimensional. The relationship between the two lacked heat and I couldn't really see why he loved her. He was also the only human man she had any major interaction with and I guess I felt like I do about people who marry the first boy they date right out of high school. \\"Don't buy the first horse you look at!\\" The plot was pretty predictable.

Again, if you are using this as an actual sauce injector then chances are you won't be removing the stopped 10 times per use and it won't be an issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I gave this 2 stars for the new Owner Mode. You have to manage the team's finances, which is fun.What I don't like about the game is that it's too easy at the Rookie level, but too difficult at the Pro level. The defensive backs must be able to run a 1.1 40 and jump 20 feet in the air because of the ridiculous interceptions I've seen in this game.The graphics aren't an improvement over prior years of Madden.

A player 30 yards away suddenly apepars from nowhere, intercepts and runs down feild while my frozen character sits there to watch. Some of the big teams (Raiders) aren't even being accounted for, i mean hello, has Madden never heard of Jerry Rice? THe graphics stink the gameplay stinks and the control stinks if there was a 1/10 star, i would've picked it, the only reason it deserves anything is because it's so exciting when you get a touchdown without being magically intercepted you almost faint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely vital perspective","review":"Finally...it is about time someone wrote about breastfeeding in a way that attempts to support black women especially.

All of my old ones are in use by grandkids, nephews, and others. The Leopard system is the best one yet. I was forced to use a Windows computer at work which really sucked.

Even though some may argue that you can get a laptop with the same specs for $200 cheaper, what you are giving up is the best OS around, which is what really makes Apple computers a level above the competitors. Also, as a college student to whom wireless connectivity is a big deal, the Mac couldn't make it easier. I am connected as soon as I power up, while my friends with their Windows PCs are fumbling trying to find the network.

Keyboard becomes completely unresponsive seemingly randomly and without any warning. Solution: see 1.3. Lots of Tiger-compatible programs are NOT supported by Leopard.4. The main interface design is ludicrous (e.g. transparent menu bar, semi-transparent 3D(!!?) shelf-like dock at which you have to peer hard to see which apps are running). A prime example of ruining something good while trying to make it better.5. Case material is a magnet for dust (mine is black, so it's obvious).6.

The game has some great scenic graphics and is fun for any who enjoy puzzles one can sink their teeth into. This is a great XBOX title and I strongly endorse it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Page Turner","review":"I read the reviews about this game and expected an experience similar to the Myst series. The graphics are beautiful throughout this game and the voice acting is as good as it can be with the material provided; however, it falls short in too many other areas for it to be called \\"fun.\\" The storyline is somewhat intriquing, but definitely not a page turner. The characters are lifeless and uninteresting. Even the main character, Kate Walker, is a bore. The \\"puzzles\\" throughout the game are mindless and, for the most part, lack logic. You might be better off reading a good mystery novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"This game is boring.

I bought the game assuming (foolishly, as it turns out) the console software would offer backward compatibility. For some original xbox games (see [...]), it is. For most, it is not.The sequel, Syberia 2, DOES play on the 360 with the latest console software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I thought this game was slow and boring. The controls were ackward and movement was difficult. The scenery was detailed, but I spent more time looking around than actually doing anything. I can't really say what was specifically lacking.

My favorite parts were the DITS machine, and all of the aliens, because I'm a sci-fi type of person. Not only this book, but the whole series is great for children to read. Each book makes you wonder what will happen in the next.

The boys love it!! And although the assembly instructions were a little on the vague side, my husband was able to put it together relatively easily in about a half an hour. We purchased this mainly for our 3 year old - who has been interested in drums ever since he started watching The Fresh Beat Band - but our 9 year old also gets use out of it. Honestly, even my husband uses it! It's perfectly sized for our 3 year old. And even though we knew it would be on the small side for our older boy (age recommendations are 3-8), he's still able to have a lot of fun with it and doesn't have much of a problem sitting at it. It's a great set to learn on and sounds authentic!! EXCELLENT quality for the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves his drum kit","review":"The drum kit was represented well in the description.

It is well built with quality materials. The instructions for assembly aren't fantastic, but I was able to get it put together in about 45 minutes. I would recommend this set for children ages five to ten. Any younger and they could get hurt with moving parts, and any older they would most likely need a full sized drum set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive and does the job well","review":"I used this to replace what I believed to be the original ball joints on a 77 Dodge W200 with a Dana 44. It made the job relatively easy. I don't anticipate using this tool very often but I think it would hold up pretty well under regular use. I am not sure what other vehicles can be done with this kit but I think Astro sells adapter kits for other vehicles. If the bulk of your work is ball joints on many different models of cars, perhaps you should consider the $600 Snap-on tool (which appears to be more versatile and durable). But if you do ball joints infrequently, this kit is a good bang for the buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Christmas?!","review":"Leann Rimes has a pretty voice, but she sure murdered, and then decapitated, \\"White Christmas.\\" I'll stick to Bing Crosby's version, thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catterwalling","review":"I heard Rockin' Around the Christmas tree and thought I would like what a wonderful Christmas.

Of course some of the names of the birds have changed over the years, but that is only a minor problem. I ordered from Copperfish Books and I was very well pleased by their service.

Maybe because the authors run a surf school, they didn't want to give away all the good information that you pay a lot more for when you sign up for their school. This book was like a big advertisement for the surf school with extra tips about matching your bikini and toenail polish to your board. I appreciated the part about doing your part to keep the oceans clean, but that was the meatiest part of the book. I purchased two books for beginning female surfers at the same time. The other one was fabulous and I refer to it as a reference constantly. This one is more useful as a beach read on a flat day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Surfing Book for Ladies!","review":"This book is not only informative and helpful, but it is a great read!

Instead, several mind games do. Jasmine wishes to take the Diamond by force, but Lief knows better. As they figure out the last puzzle just as their time is gone, they are given permission to take the diamond. But the Guardian had switched the diamond for a different one.

The songs weren't up to the usual quality of the albums and CDs I own from this band. After reading the reviews online and then receiving it, I've decided that I will listen more carefully next time to the tracks. They need better song writing. They may be great musical artists but the song selections were marginal at best for most of this one. Little Feat has been one of my favorite bands thruout the years, but this doesn't make the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feat Miss a Beat With Chinese Work Songs","review":"I've been a Feat fan since Let It Roll, and have watched them evolve over the last 11 years - adding Shaun Murphy as their lead vocalist, and continuing to break new ground with exciting original music. One thing I always noticed about Little Feat's music: it was always penned by someone in the band. Not so anymore.On Chinese Work Songs, three of the tunes were written from outside the band. Good tunes, but distinctly lacking Little Feat's song-writing influence.A handful of songs on Chinese Work Songs are pretty good tunes, but unlike Under The Radar, Let It Roll, Shake Me Up, and Representing the Mambo - all CD's with no B-side material - I find myself skipping past certain tunes on Work Songs in order to get to the standout tunes: the songs written by Bill, Paul, Fred and Shaun.I hope the Feat's next release goes back to what has worked for them for so long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Time Rockin' from Little Feat !","review":"With the demise of the Greatful Dead, this album should propel Little Feat to the title of The Best Rock 'n' Roll Band.

The group really kicks back to the \\"Dixie Chicken\\" days with \\"Just Another Sunday\\". Without realizing it, I found myself in my car with the windows down, stereo cranked to max while cruisin' down the highway. My vote for Best Cut on the disk.The title cut is a wonderful blend that is stamped \\"Made By Little Feat\\". Top quality al the way through. \\"Eula\\" was very reminiscent of \\"Fat man in a Bathtub\\". I could almost see Lowell George in the background.My old live Little Feat tape is long since worn out.

Olivia Newton-John's track, \\"Magic\\" is taken through the dance club paces with this re-working by the artist Richie. Too bad Richie can't sing very well though. The production of the various versions is very good, with the highlight being the Warren Rigg mix. Produced in 1998, the mixes sound a bit dated compared to today's club fare. Olivia should take heed and record a dance version herself. For die-hard Olivia fans only. Due to the poor vocal performance of Richie, it's almost impossible to program into a dj mix without laughing. For a better dance remake of \\"Magic\\", check out Project Olivia's version on Pride Records from Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-way there.","review":"There are some good points made in this book, but the the authors own personal preferences are very dated and opinionated.

Good stuff, but the packaging needs improvement as there were a few pieces that were dented or squashed out-of-shape. These were corrected with some TLC (be sure to wear leather gloves).

I stumbled upon theses strips, and they are AMAZING. To anyone who says they're messy, what the heck were you doing? Rubbing them all over your face? They were SO easy to use, and pretty clean except for a tiny bit that got on my cheek, which was easily wiped away by the finishing wipes. They were just as good, if not better than the wax that I got professionally. Now, I won't have to be self conscious about my lip, and won't have to ride public transportation to an expensive hair salon to get it done (Oh, the life of a broke college student). I highly recommended these!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work and very messy","review":"I tried these wax strips- they didn't remove hair, just left sticky waxy stuff all over my skin.

It's not exactly prevalent in even the worst computer you could buy since the start of this decade. The author literally states that you should \\"consider using a Word Processor because some computers can't handle 2400dpi which takes around 5MB of memory.\\" This was written when Photoshop had come out with layers and transparency tools(which have been around for ages now).That being said, it's a fast read, and totally necessary for anyone interested in(and the author makes it certainly clear that this is what the book was for) the study of ID's, and document forgery history.

As the staging of the play progresses, Otto's thoughts often drift in the past and he recalls his times as a promising young poet in Berlin, his studies in Zurich and his frequent meetings with a group of Dadaist artists. He also remembers the early atrocities of the Nazi regime when, so he believes, he betrayed his family and his people. A beautiful first novel in the same vein as Isaac Singer, Saul Bellow or W.G. Sebald."},{"rating":"1","title":"much ado about nothing","review":"noone in our reading group will admit to recommending this book. needless to say we didn't like it and don't understand the great reviews it received. the characters are uninteresting, the plot unconvincing and the novel does not tie together. true, the gimmicks in the directing of the play are cute, but it doesn't make for a good literary event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurry Up And Buy This Album!","review":"If you love blues-rock this would be great addition to your collection!!Wonderful Album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not really a train trip","review":"I bought this thinking it would be a train trip thru Alaska, which it is, in part.

I haven't purchased one of his CDs in a long time since he went to playing progressive jazz way out in left field. This CD is so great I can't turn the stereo up loud enough to get inside it. He's playing the way we knew him to play when he was on top. He gets down & dirty & funky. He's got a great horn section & some super vocalists & guests musicians. I love every track on it. If you're an R&B/Jazz organ fan, you've got to get this CD for your collection. You'll love it! I guarantee it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz, blues and R &B make a great mix on this CD","review":"Jimmy Smith has been coaxing soulful tunes out of the Hammond B3 organ for so long that he has truly become the standard against which others are judged. It has been a long time since I have enjoyed one of his albums, or cd's as much as this.Original compositions such as \\"Dot Com Blues,\\" \\"8 Counts For Rita,\\" and \\"Tuition Blues\\" are truly excellent, and his arrangement of \\"C C Rider\\" is truly something to experience. Smith's rendition of Ellington's \\"Mood Indigo\\" is also something not to be missed!The addition of B.B. King on guitar and vocals for \\"Three O'Clock Blues\\" makes for a collaboration which is only out done by \\"I Just Wanna Make Love to You\\" featuring an all star line-up including Etta James leading the vocals and Dr. John on electric piano. A nicely conceived and executed CD, that has a traditional blues feel and you won't get tired of hearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Studded Performance!","review":"Jimmy Smith has taken his B4 organ to a new level on this CD. Following today's trendy and successful \\"friends\\" CD's, Smith has assembled Etta James, Taj Mahal, Keb Mo, B.B. King, Dr. John and the Texacali horns for a top-notch session of Blues, Jazz and R&B. While Smith's organ is front and center on every tune, the success of this CD rests in large measure to the guest stars that accompany Smith on the various tracks. That fact, is especially evident when Smith's band goes it alone such as on the Duke Ellington number, \\"Mood Indigo\\" and Smith's own, \\"Tuition Blues\\" which are both somewhat somber and lackluster. Overall, the CD is a step in the right direction for Smith. High points include, Taj's \\"Strut\\" and Keb Mo's \\"Over & Over\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz? Blues? It Just Works!","review":"I saw Jimmy Smith at his Jazz Supper Club in the mid-70s. This brought back many memories. But he still carries his own sound. Highly recommended.

If you don't own any Jimmy Smith, this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a blues CD!","review":"I really like Jimmy Smith and his B4... However, this CD has two problems: 1) it isn't a blues CD, it is a Jazz CD. 2) It doesn't feature enough Jimmy Smith, rather the trumpet and sax are also featured.

It's quite unlikely that the harmonically advanced post-bopper Sonny Fortune and jump-bluesman Eddie \\"Cleanhead\\" Vinson ever played together, though Dennis Fortune could be related to Sonny, since they're both from Philly. Another local Philly talent, bassist Charles Fambrough, produced and guests on this mainstream jazz recording.Dennis Fortune uses electric piano mostly, and Michael Cruse plays aggressive electric bass, pushing the sound of this group towards jazz fusion or smooth-jazz turf, yet the grooves and the playing are interesting enough to reward careful listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like the Donna's, you'll love this","review":"Great all-girl band from Austin.

Some of these songs he wrote back in the 70's 80's and the 90's as the liner notes state. You would think that songs that have been around for so long that an artist has lived with this long would be personal. Well they are,you can feel the emotion in each composistion as these musicians try to explain the joys and sorrows of life. When I heard the cello in the first song and all through the album I couldn't help but think of a couple of Eric Dolphy albums where he used Ron Carter to get the same effect. This is an album that drifts sideways, music that seems to cleanse ones soul over and over with soft melodies. I loved it,I reccommend it after a rough day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"This poster was a waste of money. The quality is very, very poor, with the background being so dark that you cannot even see the picture that is there. This looks like some kind of cheap bootleg type copy; I don't believe it is legitimate. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge","review":"I love this movie and this poster is a nice tribute to it. It's huge which I like and came in good condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written and researched","review":"I too was very disappointed by this book which is poorly written and researched. The author has not taken into consideration the many aspects of children's drawings and looked no futher than the projective literature to make a case for detecting child abuse through drawings. I kept feeling that this book was hastily put together to cash in on a topic that many worry about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent work","review":"This is a fantastic book to anyone who is into the Diablo PC game series. Richard Knaak does a fantastic job of writing out an original and entertaining story, while making various references to the classes, cities and spells from the game series, in particular Diablo II. The characters are well-developed from beginning to end, done by Knaak extremely well, by giving details of the characters lives, but not so much that we end up knowing more about the characters than we do the story. He does an outstanding job of going from the different character's viewpoints, for instance the swtich from Norrec to General Malevolyn to Kara Nightshadow is almost seamless, which does well to avoid confusion. But I found the story very gripping and didn't find the book boring at any point when I was reading it. So I do think that big fans of the game series will be very pleased with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book IS worth a read","review":"This is a good book; not great, but good. It took a little while for the story to come around, but it was indeed a decent read.There are those readers who over-analyze plots and who can't seem to stand it when books don't conform to their core set of beliefs, but their reviews are certainly much harsher than the book deserves.Knaak balances the book fairly well, without over complicating characters or trying to copy the game. I was actually glad that the book was not identical to the game.This is the first Richard Knaak book that I've read, but I was not let down in the least. I intend to read his new Minitaur series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the Author, not the book","review":"Well, I read this book, and I was very disappointed. I enjoy Richard Knaak's Warcraft novels, but this just did not do it for me. I am currently reading his first DragonRealm novel, which is better than this novel was to me. This only goes to show that subject matter can effect how good a story is just as much as the Writer that tells the tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diablo: Legacy of Blood Rocks","review":"This book is awesome! The plot is rich and characters are interesting and unique. Sure, it might be a computer game novel, but nevertheless, the author still came up with his own characters and much of his own story. You will like this book if you like fantasy books with swordplay and sorcery, and if you are my age, it is also quite challenging. If you do not like violence and some mild adult language, then you might not enjoy this book as much. All in all, this book deserves five out of five stars, if not six out of five!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Portrayal","review":"The only thing I think could have been better for this book would be alittle more action in cirtain parts. There apeared to be momentary slowdowns in the plot. All in all the book contained a fair amount of action and tied in quite well into the story. I think a few of the characters/places borrowed from the game were not portrayed quite the way they were in game. However granting creative licence they fit in very well to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I started with low expectations and they were met.","review":"When I read a book based on form of existing popular media, I have low expectations. The authors have to work within a given mythology and to stray too far away from it could lead to dissatisfaction of fans or employers. This book uses the basic framework of the PC game and then plods along to its less than original conclusion. Occasionally the reader's interest is piqued by a clever scene, but the overall effect is one of \\"Didn't I read this in a million other fantasy books when I was a kid?\\" The Diablo PC game could be a fertile ground for some series, but based on this effort I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for the \\"good\\" book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish","review":"Absolute waste...of paper of time of words of money.

Don't ask why I forced my way through it. it was a chore to read. Nothing made sense. Nothing was logical. Nothing was remotely realistic. Even if it is fantasy where the author makes the rules, they werent evident. Whenever there was a potential problem Knaak reveals to you an invented way to solve the problem. Even this a review is a waste of my time but if I prevent even one person from picking this up at the store then it was worth it. I am baffled at how this book has a 4 star raiting.

I went to reading it right away and as I read further into it, I just simply wanted to burn it! I mainly bought it because I thought it would be a good fantasy story; not like those other fantasy stories with hobbits and whatnot! This is terrible! Action low. Suspense low. A total disaster!

R.L Stine's monster blood series, night of the living dummy series, and other books or series similar to these.

Nevertheless, I still found them interesting to read again from this particular writer's point of view. The author has the ability to make each story easy to read and follow. There are twenty one short stories about various martial art masters. Some of these include legends about Kano, Funakoshi, Ueshiba, Oyama and Yamagushi.In conclusion, this little book is an excellent resource of anyone involved in the martial arts and desires to learn about the ancient masters.Rating: 4 Stars.

However, they are so short that you can read them all in a single sitting, which is what I just did. As I am quite ignorent of design history, it was extremely enlightening for me - I now feel ready for a bigger meal. It was the ideal preparation for a project I am embarking on on design. Furthermore, there are wonderful photos and features on many famous objects, all of which have solid descriptions of what the design innovation represented and what is new about them.

This is a step up from the camera he had and really is the best camera for point and shoot picture-taking. The pictures are really clear and it's very easy to use. We like the built-in memory feature. The camera is compact, yet the display is pretty big. I thought I got a lot of bang for my buck with this one considering there aren't a lot of 9 megapixel cameras out there in this price range and everywhere else I looked were charging a lot more for the 6 megapixel to 8 megapixel cameras. I have an older model Sony Cybershot camera and this one blows the Sony out of the water. I would never buy another Sony camera. They're terrible.

WRONG! this book isn't about being an a-hole, being rude, or being fake. it's about taking your empathy as a strength, of being clever in an elegant way. there are such detailed instructions and examples, i can't see why you can't lift these examples and use them in your life. in fact, right after reading this book, i started using some of the example phrases, and found them very empowering.finally...the nice people can win and still remain the good guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camp Throws the High, Hard One","review":"This book is presents a workable high concept view of the negotiation process. The key strengths are in the following themes: emphasis on valid goals and valid agendas, a focus on the needs and pain of the opposite party, and the value of providing the opportunity for your opposite to say \\"no.\\" These concepts alone are worth the price of admission. This is not a step-by-step \\"how to\\" book - it will not tell you how to deal with the forty or sixty pages of negotiation issues that you might face in a large scale negotiation. It is an effective statement of philosophy; everyone needs such a conceptual starting point to negotiate effectively. One criticism is a missed opportunity: the book might have discussed the link between bad selling and bad negotiation - a great negotiating effort cannot make up for a really poor selling or positioning effort. That said, I recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book.","review":"There is just nothing in this book. Even books like Solution Selling, and Major Account Sales Strategy have better negotiation content - and these books have maybe 10 pages devoted to it.The author uses his military background to create action anologies and military terms and name dropping to cover the fact there is NOT anything actionable that one could possibly take away from this book.If I had learnt anything at all from this book, I would negotiate my money back.HUGE Disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a very bad book!","review":"This is a very bad book! In this book the author presents 6 or 7 principles that negotiators should remember. His persuasive arguments for each principle have no foundational evidence other than anecdotal examples from history and politics. Examples for each principle are circumstantial and always based narrowly on his experiences. Also, he often contradicts himself and provides evidence which is mediocre at best.Overall this book is very poor and provides little if any insight into negotiation strategies. I stopped halfway in because I was so upset with the quality. I am sorry; I can not take things on faith. I need well formulated, fact based, and persuasive arguments, especially if you're arguing in-favor of adopting a new business behavior. In summary, don't buy this book, look to more reputable publishers for your negotiation studies.Brian GlassmanPh.D in Organizational Leadership from Purdue"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"This is a disappointment. Reading it, one always feels like there is going to be a technique or revelaton around the corner, but it never appears.

Usually when I have trouble reading a book it is because the writing is terrible and the story ridiculous. That is not the case with this novel, I have to say that the author writes well and does not underestimate the intelligence of the reader. However, the story just didn't engage my attention. The hero and heroine go on, and on, AND ON about why they are not right for each other while they search for her runaway charge. And that is about all that happens for most of the novel. The sensual tension is almost non-existent and I just felt like I was on an endless road trip with two semi-boring people. This is my first book by this author and I'm not sure I'll try her again.

But if you avoided this record thinking it was a soundtrack, you will not have heard this great song. Walls is not the only worthwhile tune on this enjoyable disk. \\"Grew Up Fast\\" is a great song and performance, and his cover version of Lucinda Williams' \\"Change the Locks\\" emphasizes the exaggerated humor rather than the desperation Lucinda conveys in her version. Overall, the record might've seemed like a footnote to the great \\"Wildflowers\\" CD, but \\"Walls\\" makes it essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-Rated Gem","review":"This has to be the most under-rated album in Petty's catalog. \\"Walls\\" is simply a great pop song, and \\"Change the Locks\\" never gets old for me. I don't understand why these songs never get played on the radio, but maybe that's why it's the Petty album I have in my player the most - I haven't heard these songs to death on classic rock radio for years.

In the case of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers, they only have one good song on the soundtrack to the movie She's The One. The song Walls, still creeps in as a very decent song. Still, the score wasn't anything to rave about. Hopefully, the next time that Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers do a soundtrack, it will be of better standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not this one","review":"You know you're in trouble when the best song on Petty CD, Lucinda Williams' \\"Change the Locks,\\" is not by Petty. On She's the One the band sounds sedated. There is no energy here, and maybe that's what the movie calls for (The Brothers McMullen is my only Burns movie) but as a stand alone Petty CD it just doesn't work. This band can generally sell even mediocre songs with their enthusiasm, but with lyrics like\\"California's been good to me, I hope it don't fall into the sea,\\"what can the band do? By the time some stronger songs come up (\\"Walls No. 2\\" Hurry up and Overdue\\") it's too late; the listener's in a coma."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't overlook this one","review":"When this one came out and quickly disappeared from the charts I was amazed and dismayed because this cd is terrific fun. I consider it better than \\"Echo.\\" While still technically up to Petty's usual standard I find the attitude refreshingly free and without any pressure to make the blockbuster album the executives always desire to market. In fact, there was very little marketing at all for this one. \\"Walls\\" is almost Beatle-ish, \\"Change the locks\\" is a great rocker, and the rest of the songs have a great variety to them that makes listening a real pleasure. Most Petty fans have this one but if you are only an occasional dabbler in his work this one is a real treat to own. I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 3/4 stars--not their best but still decent","review":"With most Tom Petty albums (with or without the Heartbreakers), I fall in love with at least 90 percent of the tracks. Not the case with this slightly below average effort (for this artist). Tracks such as \\"Zero From Outer Space\\" are interesting and different (can't say I've ever hear T. P. use the \\"f-word\\" in one of his songs before). The song \\"A**hole\\" is also an obvious departure along this vein. On another note, I don't see the point of having two versions of the tracks \\"Walls\\" and \\"Angel Dream\\", although both were decent tracks that were singles (I believe). This is a decent overall album that has some strong points-check out, for instance, \\"Grew Up Fast\\" and \\"Hope You Never\\", which are vintage Petty tracks. It is just a somewhat mediocre effort for an artist who normally shines start to finish on his albums. His follow up effort \\"Echo\\" was a return to a stronger overall album. This particular one doesn't quite measure up to many of his other albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 star movie, 4 star soundtrack","review":"The two versions of Walls and Angel Dream, the instrumental Hope On Board are the bright spots on this CD and reason enough to buy it.

Some of my favorite albums are Frampton Comes Alive and J Geils Band Blow Your Face Out. This album rivals all the great live rock albums. This is one of the most under rated and over looked rock bands of all time. If you like good old rock music and are not familiar with these guys, treat yourself and pick this CD up, you will be glad you did. While both CD's are good, I absolutely love the second disc in the set. A few years after this one, they released another live cd with a bunch of songs that didn't make this CD, Lamanamanuni, which is good too, but get this one first, it will hook you, then find a copy of that one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Book","review":"This is an amazing book,I was a little worried cause Ive never bought a used book before but it was in perfect state, except for a little dust coming out of the pages.Its a must read book specially for jewish readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Capture of Adolph Eichman","review":"Very detailed and interesting account of the capture of one of the most heinous nazi war criminals.

At least you can say they inject a little creativity here by combining the Stone's ''Bitch'' with Foreigner's ''Women''into one song and mix electric and accoustic on it as well. ''Sin City'' is a a stand out cut also.

They actually know what they're talking about, based not only on their extensive formal education but also based on their hands-on work with many, many cars.If I personally found anything annoying here, it's only their constant self-referencing which gets old.

I was especially disappointed because of the presence of that fine horror tale actor the late Donald Pleasence and the excellent actor Robert Vaughn. The movie was made towards the end of Donald's life and maybe he was too hard up to reject the role.

Your most used hanging tools will be in your bags, so this will make an easy carry - just get a bucket from your taper.Following this purchase, I saw a very good one at Sears for only 12.95, with pockets in the 42 range.This is why it didn't get all the stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Husband loves it","review":"My husband is into construction for a living.

It's been my experience that if you are trying to drive a point , then you must stick to one subject.

The second lasted 5 months before the bearings failed and the third just stopped working in the middle of a light duty sanding job. The last 2 sanders were made in China and I'm not sure where the first one was made but something changed for the worse. It's too bad as I love this tool when it works but can't trust it any more.

So much for saving costs by going to China."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing parts - Resolved positively","review":"My review will only cover the fact that my sander was missing the hook and loop pad when I purchased it. I cannot yet review how well it works, because I do not have the pad required to use the hook and loop sanding discs that were recommended for this sander. BE WARNED: make sure when you receive this that it includes all the parts it was supposed to come with. When I received the sander I put it on the shelf with my other tools until I needed it. When I needed it, I pulled it out and only when I went to install the sanding discs did I notice that it didn't come with all the parts it was supposed to. Since it was after 30 days from the date of purchase, I'm on my own for sourcing these parts.**Update, called Ridgid directly. They sent me the missing pad directly...with no hassles.

I'd had two Porter Cable sanders that worked well except that the later model has a flimsy dust-catcher that flopped and spewed dust after several uses, which is why I tried the Rigid. This isn't a terrible sander, it just isn't all that great -- not as good as the Porter Cables, and nowhere near as good as the Bosch that I have since purchased, which eats through wood like nobody's business and gives an incredibly smooth surface.

If I press the sander down, it will spin a lot slower and eventually stops rotating. If a RO sander is a combination of belt sander and a 1/4 Sheet Sander, this sander is more like a 1/4 Sheet Sander.It also have short life span.

In the book, James Lloyd names the individual referenced in the book of Revelation as \\"the false prophet.\\" That individual is the now long dead, Pope John Paul II.The book \\"The False Prophet and the Image of the Beast,\\" is laden with false assertions, conclusionary language, and out of context Biblical references. Also, the book is more of a pamphlet.Save your $5.00 and buy a gallon of gas while you can still get it for that price. This book is poorly researched, poorly presented, and the conclusions are spurious.Other than that, it's a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience, Patience, Patience.","review":"For amateurs who are just interested in lock picking as a past time, this book is pretty good as it covers the normal locks that you will encounter in everyday life- pin tumblers, wafers and others, just the normal ones though.the only thing bad about this book is that the information is too compact, sometimes even lacking in diagrams, but if u are one who are good at picturing with words, then this book is for you. it is scary to open the book with the pages filled with words!just note that this book was printed in 1991 (or for some other reasons), do not expect paragraphing like the modern books.key to lockpicking: patience, patience and more patience. it took me a week to open my first pin tumbler lock! and it only has 3 pins! adjust the torque wrench and ur pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie the Wire...POOR book","review":"I wouldn't get this book.....too expensive for its length, poor illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good info","review":"Good information and illustrations.

Without Phil Lynott's contribution, this becomes more of a tribute album. A valiant effort, with John Sykes constantly trying to invoke the spirit of Lynott and the band playing the music as well as any band could. The problem is it's really not Thin Lizzy. It's just another band playing their music. Musically I could have rated this as high as three stars but for its value to any but the most desperate fan, I can't give it more than one. Stick with Live and Dangerous for the sound of the real Thin Lizzy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is F****ed Up!","review":"Although this \\"Thin Lizzy\\" tribute thing may have the best intentions all around, it's still a piss on the grave to Lynott's vision. Maybe it wouldn't be so crappy if they didn't bill themselves as \\"Thin Lizzy\\" or 3-minute member John Sykes wasn't doing a laughable imitation of Lynott on every song. \\"Twonight there's gonna be a jaaillbreeak!\\" SHUT UP! Hey! I'd love to hear these songs all over again in concert, too. And if these guys need the money, then by all means, do some old Lizzy songs and take it on the road. But damn!

Its content covers the \\"heart\\" of the B&O's operations in the east - not just the Potomac Valley. The book will be useful to both historians and modelers as the pictures show the physical surroundings of the railroad - not just closeups of locomotives and cars.

He does have his housekeeper Mrs. Jeffries and the rest of his staff to help him solve this case. However, Mrs. Jeffries is so good, even he cannot figure out that they are helping him!Another good installment in the series. Highly recommended even if you have never read any of the others.

There are two or three excelent things-part of A-12 log written by Kelly himself and articles about SR-71( Kelly) and J-58 ( Mr Brown). The rest is low quality-known facts, to many and to big pictures instead of text. Description of pictures glorify the plane instead of giving sharp technical and historic data!! And what really made me angry. There are several the same photos that appear several times in the book!! And what even worse, the descriptions below these photos say that these are different photos,even when they are not. Book not worth its price. Better buy Paul Crickmore book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SR-71 Blackbird","review":"Was so pleased to get this book. Crowood Aviation series puts out some amazing titles. I even paid the full price without hesitation when I cold have bought 2 other books for this price. Imagine my surprise when I opened it to find it printed on poor quality paper. The book in itself is excellent but if one is paying a more than higher price than other titles from this publisher, I would have expected a better quality paper. It's probably a stupid point really but it ticked me off. Aviation Magazines don't print anymore on this quality of paper.Excellent book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Then and now","review":"This book is a good read. Viet Nam left us with so many with abuse problems or PTSD and the same is happending now in Iraq. The pain and trauma each one goes thru and the effects on their families is astounding.

I really like the fun bright colors. They are durable and well made. Also, unlike some metal and plastic weights they don't make your hands smell funny.

Surprisingly good. I agree, the beginning of the CD sounds stupid (begins with a radio commercial for the event), but the meat of the mixes is great. Finally, some energetic trance! Great melodies.NOTE: Look at the track list. 36 songs. This is a ONE CD album. Basically, almost none of the songs are complete. The mixes cut in towards the chorus and main melodies to fit the entire event on one CD.Overall, go out and get this CD. Looks cheap, costs cheap, but the music is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's a commercial on compact disk","review":"This is unquestionably the worst mix I've ever heard, though I'll admit I didn't hear it all the way through - I tossed the cd out my car window after about 15 minutes in. The track listing is deceptive - you get a few notes of each track mixed in with a constant beat. The worst part is that it starts off with a commercial for some radio station in Chicago, and each track after starts off with a cheesy radio voice telling you \\"you're listening to Too Cool Chris!\\". Not very cool at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"Noting \\"brief article\\" in the title in no way indicates how ridiculously brief this was.

Weapons entries are poorly organized, lacking in details, and have little to do with what Delta is using. Pistols are especially poorly covered. Most of the weapons information would be more appropriate to USSOCOM or even conventional units. No clue why a whole section is devoted to HK weapons that are little or not at all used by US forces. Equipment section is also lacking in detail and more appropriate to USSOCOM than Delta.

Richard's not certain exactly how he came to be, how old he is, or even if there's anyone else like him in the world, but he prides himself on keeping his city clean of the homeless, prostitutes, and other riff-raff.

I especially enjoy the details in this book (they uncover the depth of Nerdrum's paint.) From the beginning, the authors provide interpretation of his isolated figures and influences (Rembrandt, Caravaggio.)

I can understand people complaining about the production, however in my opinion, it's perfect for the genre, and specifically this release.The drumming is pretty crazy on this one, and the songs are strong. This has turned out to be one of my favorite Immortal releases, and one of the last releases by them with low-end production."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sublime Blast Beat Inferno","review":"For the title track alone this album should be remembered as one of the iciest and most brutal black metal albums ever made. It is chaos and structure, destruction and creation, protest and affirmation in one; a wall of sound that gives away its secrets gradually and only to those who are prepared to listen through it. What then arises is an epic, highly structured and yet immeasurably bestial composition of blast beats and demonic screeching, that \`rides from the North to the North', as the lyrics have it, without ever looking back or compromising to anything other than itself. Which is precisely the aim and essence of true black metal, but hardly ever was that essence captured in such an effective way. A must-have for anyone with a heart for the dark - although it comes in blinding white this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold, dark, brutal, it will put frost-bite on your ears.","review":"Imagine an intense sonic blizzard with a conscious purpose cold-blasting hymns to the Nordic people and the Frozen North. Whirlwind guitar rhythms, bleak and cold vocals. Less organized and less precise than later albums. Somehow colder. Poor recording of ultra-fast guitars. Drums are a tight-racket noise. Not much bass or low-end to speak of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Metal that is Excellent","review":"The music is played at a fast pace, and all the tracks are standouts. This album only speaks about mountains and snow, along with frost. Only two individuals will be playing on this album:they are abbath who will play the drumms and the bass guitar, and he will handle vocals. Demonaz will handle all the guitars-rhythm and lead playing. The photography is good on the cd; you will see the members wearing their corpse paint. Highly recommended music to all metal people, and listeners of other categories-pop, hard rock, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super Fast Music...Very cold...","review":"I hate to give IMMORTAL a low rating for something because I love the 3 most recent albums (At The Heart Of Winter / Damned In Black / Sons Of Northern Darkness), but there is nothing really catchy on this album to cling to that would make you want to listen to it repeatedly. Other than the insane speed and similarity of the songs, the guitars lack power because they seem to be in the background. I do admire their talent in being able to play their instruments very well (I especially don't see how Abbath can maintain the speed of those drums!), but the music needed more to keep the listener interested. I probably won't experiment with any more of their releases because this was supposed to be the best of their older stuff. I guess I'll have to stick with what I have and probably sell this one. It's a shame because the cover and photos are pretty cool - I just can't seem to enjoy the music no matter how many times I listen...sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"I just got into immortal,with sons of northern darkness(I know ,where have I been)I liked it a lot so I wanted to buy others.Read some reviews and this got good reviews.This is nothing like s.o.n.d.Too fast, every song sounds the same,you cant here lyrics,the music doesn't go with the vocals and the drumming is horrible.Crash symbols are being hit for no apparent reason and abbath's voice is bad.I guess I'll try damned in black or At the heart of winter"},{"rating":"2","title":"multimedia","review":"im trying to get a computer that has a cd burner and plays movies.

In fact I never saw this when it originally came out........VCR's weren't even a very common household electronic back then. This is very early Go Go's \\"our lips are sealed\\" was just climbing the charts and when they played songs off of their \\"vacation\\" album no one had even heard of it yet.

Beegie Adair should indeed be considered among the short list of great jazz pianists. Her recordings are one thing. Here LIVE PERFORMANCES are quite another.On An Affair To Remember, Beegie Adair and her trio, accompanied by a gorgeous full orchestra on this project, present the great romantic songs from the 1950s film scene in a, yes, \\"romantic\\" and \\"easy on the ears\\" format. Intentionally created for dinners, candlelight moments, and those oh-so-grand times of canoodling with your heartmate.This in no way dismisses her from inclusion among Bill Evans, George Shearing, Erroll Garner, Oscar Peterson, Tommy Flanagan, Gene Harris, et al. Still a sceptic? Go see her live concerts. I've attended dozens of them, and I have every single recording she has made (23 to date).Again, her recordings are great, no doubt. Her live performances are beyond great. Hear for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, Love Love It!","review":"This is one of my absolute favorite cds by Beegie Adair.

It's the last of the series and a good thing, it appears the author wasn't as spirit lead to write this one, just tried to wrap up the series. Glory's and Ruth's story get mixed up right in the beginning and Copeland doesn't do as well of a job in this love story. I skipped around pages just to get to the end, cause it was almost painful to read. It had the potential to be good, especially from Copeland. the end is a decent attempt to close the ladies stories. because as is evident with this book she was getting tired w/ the series had she tried to write a Mary or Harper story they could have been worse. Although I think a Harper story would be phenomenal, but she ended when it was necessary. leaving it open for at least Lily to show up in her next series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised","review":"I purchased this DVD with the expectation that it would spend the majority of the video going over the Crucible.

All the information they provide I had already known due to watching other videos. I was specifically looking for a more indepth video of what the Crucible is.On top of that I was not even impressed with the quality of the video.

I liked the way the author gave the readers an insight of Tina's background as a young lady because it showed that coming from a family with strong beliefs and moral values , it helped Tina to have the strength to overcome her sense of worthlessness and evolve as an independent, strong female.Tina could be anyone of the thousands of young, Afro-American Women in our society who face rejection, divorce and single parenting.

It's a hodge podge of modern Celtic Wicca, a sprinkle of Faery Wicca and a dash of ornamental magic with some dragon silliness thrown in. There is nothing Druidic about it. While it may contain potent exercises for self actualization, it's disgusting how she steals the word of Druid. She should have stuck to the subtitle - Celtic Faery Craft and Elemental Magic. There is a ridiculous romanticized history essay and while preaching about being open to wisdom, she is yet remarkably derogatory to modern druidry. It's awash in New Age and psychology psychobabble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Work","review":"There is NO need to run from this book, as one previous reviewer stated. The fact is, there are NO true Druid schools anywhere in the world. All Druid schools make stuff up. We do NOT know what the original Druids actually taught. I've taken courses from the larger Druids schools, and they were peppered with all kinds of New Age ideas and even Eastern Buddhist and Daoist teachings.Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with making things up. If someone has the ability to see into nature, including the human nature, and comprehend what others miss, then, indeed, I want to read their thoughts and insights.

But thankfully, this album is much more than a heavily-amped indie rock all-star hybrid, and it builds nicely on the excellent THIS IS THE WAY IT GOES . . . A FUTURE LIVED IN PAST TENSE is a true epic of ebbing and flowing guitar, from hypnotic hymns to maelstroms and minefields of guitar. And the sound is simply breathtaking. The layed squalls of guitar take on the richest, deepest, crimson tones- it defies description.

With the understanding that soundcard vendors have been left scrambling with Vista's accelerated rollout, the delay of Vista drivers for this card is now at nearly six months.I can appreciate Razer's need to ensure stability and functionality in their drivers, but after months of false promises, this delay implies to me a general lack of urgency on the part of the vendor.

I wouldn't recommend the display stand much at all because of this. The first reviewer made this thing sound like you need to remove parts. This isn't a Yamato 1/60 toy or anything, you need to swap out the heat shield for the canopy. For $20 per I'd say it does pretty well. If you have the Banprestos then this toy is easily twice as good as those and they tend to run $10 each pretty easy. If you got a lot of money, buy a much nicer Yamato toy. If you don't have a ton of money these toys are fun in a pinch and look good to boot. No, they're not meant for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have not purchased","review":"I haven\\"t purchased this item, it is not my to review, and it is in my e mail as an item I purchased.

Reading other reviews and being interested in tech/math rock metal, I almost have to laugh at the thought of these guys being any where close to either. I was turned on to them b/c some people compared them to Hella. This is basic straight forward stuff. Nothing like Hella and no tech math about it. Yea there are changes but nothing off the wall or new at all. The beats are boaring and most of the all the vocals are without a doubt probably the WORST I have ever encountered. I tried to block them out and listen for some interesting instrumental stuff but couldn't really find much of that either. If I can find someone to give this to I will (pity on them), otherwise its going right in the trash where it belongs. 0 Stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettin' a Lot of Radio Time...","review":"This one gets played just about, um, every day.

Several of the bands songs were on the playlist and i found them very catchy and just new. I decided recently to buy their album and i do not regret it at all. I thought the few songs i heard before were great, but every single song on this album is just fantastic. I know its been a while since its release and the band may no longer exist but this album shouldnt be missedNothing is worth skipping and the songs just really feel alive. This is not screaming and shouting i'm talking about, the group just sounds excited to be playing their music.

You should, however, look elsewhere if you are looking for a guide on how to write clear, easy-to-use procedures. The format for the procedures in this book is similar to the technical writing style of 20 years ago and is not suitable for procedures that will actually have to be followed by the end-user.

We followed the very detailed trail directions for a hike labeled as \\"Easy for Children\\". The trail was reasonably easy to follow at first, but led us through over a mile of land that was regularly posted as private property / no trespassing. But much worse, at the end, the trail simply disappeared. The book mentions that you may have to bushwhack for 100 feet at the end, but we were up to our waists in thorns, unable to see our destination and at least several hundred YARDS from where we needed to go. Definitely not easy to do when you are carrying a three-year-old. In retrospect, we should have verified the trail with the park rangers who would have told us that no such trail exists on park land.

I came upon these while browsing quite by accident. I liked the look of shiny copper so I chose these. The pics here and on other sites do not do it justice. When I saw them up close in real life, they looked high quality. They sure do add a touch of elegance to the kitchen. I've had no trouble so far with the bottom plastic plugs falling out as other reviewers have pointed out. In fact, it's an effort for me removing these plugs for refilling. And the holes for the pepper shaker seem big enough to allow an adequate flow without having to forcibly shake it out. I also like the fact that they have some kind of coating that eliminates any tarnish build-up. No regrets here and I highly recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish is JUNK....Don't buy these","review":"I purchased these salt & pepper shakers for my Husband last Christmas. I also purchased the oil can as well. Here we are 11 months later and the finish has black streaks all over the place. Not the pretty, aged -finish,Old Dutch International 4 Inch Solid Copper Hammered Stovetop Salt & Pepper Settype of streaks, but ugly marks. Also the top of the salt shaker is now excoriated (I think from the NaCl against the metal) and looks like dirty chrome.I followed the cleaning instructions by using a dry, soft cloth only. Their so-called \\"protective finish\\" is not worth the powder to blow it to hell!!

My only complaint: I wish the pepper shaker's holes were just a little larger--it takes some enthusiastic shaking to get an adequate amount of pepper onto food. Will fix that soon by enlarging the holes myself, but wish this had been done at the factory. If it weren't for that flaw, I'd give this 5 stars; worth the $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good quality","review":"I bought several pieces at the same time and some fared well and others didn't.

However, it has been less than two weeks since the order arrived and already the salt shaker has lost most of the copper paint on and near the salt holes. Sad to see I wasted that much money on something that was painted a copper color. I thought it was solid copper, dont waste your time or money!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a pleasant read...","review":"unlike some of the other reviewers I enjoyed this book. The hero is a decent, hardworking ex-bow street runner who now has his own agency. The heroine, a \\"lightstocking\\", a woman who is being kept by a lord as a mistress. The villans are truly villanous, the supporting cast are fun. Yes, some of the story is inplausible but it IS romance people. Just relax, and enjoy yourself:) I've read better but many more that are much worse. At least B++ sex, likable cast that you'll want to win, and great ending.

The basics of the story is that Lillian is pretending to Dillion's mistress to be protected from her evil father (not biological) and help give Dillion a good image since he is gay. The plot does a great twist when Dillion is accused/framed for murder by Lillian father and Dillion's brother. Lillian hires Nick to gather information and clear Dillion. As the reader to know the 'who done it' but how Nick undercovers the plot is a lot of fun. Of course Lillian and Nick hit it off - you will love how Lillian talks Nick into working for her...."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can FLY now!!","review":"I listened to this CD at least once per day - sometimes twice a week before I had to fly for something related to my job. I have been so afraid that I have been avoiding flying for years. I had even grown so fearful of flying that just thinking about it got me upset.

Even when we were told to turn off electronic equipment on the flight, I was able to use the techniques I learned with this CD to stay calm and comfortable.I won't say that I was not nervous at all, but I was far from terrified, and not upset. I was able to manage my feelings and enjoy myself and make it to my destination without drinking down any tiny bottles, if you know what I mean.I CAN FLY!!! I CAN FLY!!

In this set of interviews he presents himself as a kind of mythic hero, an adventurer who goes off into the unknown, contends with the contradicting forces and makes his own story. Campbell prides himself on having the courage to do it his own way and not follow some conventional , more ordinary way of life. He speaks a great deal about the subject of Archetypes and Myth, and shows his close affinity to Jungian rather than Freudian conceptions of human culture. He stresses the importance of those themes, those Myths which pervade in his view all cultures. He does this in a clear if nonetheless quite humorless and sober way. He does not really provide close information about his own personal story. For this reason I did not find that the book did the kind of biographical job which would really show the singularity of the individual in question."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazin Dance Hall Music","review":"Ok this guy is very good and his album is nice.

For this, I consider the seller blatantly dishonest, and I've been trapped in the his advertising BS. Also, when I bought it, it wasn't advertised as used, but surely that's what the packaging says. For $6 the return is not worth the hassle, and I must say it lives up to the label that indicates it \\"new like new\\". So the seller scalped $3 additional from me, but will get negative feedback that spills out to the quality of this recording. Compared to the recording of Gratitud, this work melts. It contains no stage depth, very boringly flat. I have an earlier version, a normal one, and I tell no difference. Love the material, but can't stand the recording.

And if you are beginner to philosophical argument in China you are ought to lay of this book. Graham writes about things extremely more heavyily and complex than they really are.

It is not big and bulky though, so it is easy to travel around with. It seems so much sturdier and well made than other soft coolers I have seen. We are so happy with this cooler, and will replace it with the exact same bag (if the time ever comes).

My only complaint is that level 2 is much much harder than level one. My son is okay with that and it gives us the opportunity to try to do harder things and if he gets frustrated then we simply go back to level one. I believe it said it was for ages 5 and up but level two was doing addition problems such as 32+40 and so on. Same thing goes for the spelling problems. I like this because it should grow with him and its encouraging with the phrases of \\"Good JOb\\" when he did something right. The bat wings fly out to the side when you open the laptop. He takes this with him in the car and it was a big hit with the other cousins. I did not pay the price on Amazon. Target should have it cheaper.

It is good to begin with, but i for myself have abandonned this recording for other interpretations by Daniel Barenboim and/or Vladimir Delman.

The author consistently stresses that if you choose to be a con artist you will be caught and exhibits some frustration that con artists are not punished more severly than they are, since most con artist crimes are perceived as crimes the victims brought on themselves through their own greed and avarice.The title is somewhat misleading. Don't read this is you want to actually be a con artist as you won't learn too many tricks.

This one (the 2003 version), however, isn't simply tougher to win against, it appears to be programmed to be impossible. I've played it for hours using all kinds of strategies, sound ones and crazy ones, just to see if I could get ahead. Usually when I would get a great hand and would most likely win, the other player or players would most of the time have better hands. This goes against random probabilities and makes it a joke to even try playing. I found this feature on all the card games.

As one of the founding members of the Beach Boys, this is his last recording. A coming together of 3 of my favorite bands...Gerry Beckley of America, Robert Lamm of Chicago and of course, Carl. Each take turns with lead vocals and you can hear each of their own band's personal influences on all the tracks. I particulary liked \\"Feel The Sprirt\\", \\"Sheltering Sky\\" and the ode to Brian Wilson, \\"Like A Brother\\". Well worth adding to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music of the Heart and Soul","review":"If you like the rich vocal tapestries of the Beach Boys and that beautiful voice of Carl Wilson, three songs on the piece are enough to satisfy you. Hearing Carl's voice again was like a gift from God, but the contributions of both Lamm and Beckley were also heartfelt, tuneful compositions that were well sung and nicely mastered. Although I felt they leaned a little to much on synthesizers for my own taste, it was the vocal harmonies that made many of the songs stick in my head, and I would find myself humming them weeks later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed..","review":"The sound of this album is far too 80's despite the fact it was released in 2000. There just seems to be no emotion in the singing and the songs themselves are quite drab and uninteresting.

Compared to Brian Wilsons Imagination album this is very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately bland","review":"I really WANTED to like this album. It's just not good. Carl Wilson's voice is the only thing that got this album up to the two star level. The songs themselves are strictly one star fare.

What a great talent and more importantly what a great man we have lost."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a shame...","review":"...That this will be the last set of recordings released by Carl Wilson. I really didn't expect much from this CD--Lamm and Wilson have spent cumulative lifetimes coasting on their respective bands' old hits, and really, who pays attention to America anymore?--and maybe that's why I love \\"Like A Brother\\" so much. This is the best collection of songs that any of these three have bothered to assemble in at least twenty-five years. The production is a little cheesy at times, but you won't notice. The harmonies are positively angelic--particularly when Carl takes the lead--and the songs are uniformly great. I'd say more, but I need to get back to listening to this CD again. Just trust me--Beckley/Lamm/Wilson is so much more than the sum of its parts would (recently) lead you to believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and solid","review":"I just recently got this CD in and the first time I listened to it I was happy with it. With me it takes more than one though. The second time around I was incredibly happy. The first song is a good starter. The second song \\"Feel the Spirit\\" is one of the most passionate songs Robert Lamm has ever written. The third is beautifully sung by Carl Wilson. Basically the whole CD is very well done although it's not without it's weak moments. The best songs are the ones that seem the most personal. All three men have an awesome blend together. This isn't something I would call \\"incredible\\" but it's still a good solid CD which is more than I can say for a lot of them. Robert Lamm has 2 leads, Gerry Beckley has 3 and Carl Wilson has 5. However all three men can be heard throughout the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a Brother","review":"This CD is wonderful. The songs on it are great to listen to.

Results were great, the color rendition matched nicely with what was on my screen (perhaps helped by Canon printer). I'd rate it: color 9/10, brightness 8/10. I recommend using 'semi-gloss' setting on your printer, as this paper isn't totally glossy nor matte finish (its somewhere in-between). Thickness and quality is good, not photolab quality, but it has about the thickness of 3 sheets of regular printer paper in my opinion. All-in-all, a great price, and I would buy it again!Note: I dont think not too many people know about this amazon product because it has a picture of a camera for its description and I totally overlooked this product when i was searching for photo paper to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kodak still makes great Inkjet printer photo paper","review":"Although the Canon paper gives me a slightly better quality printout, Kodak's paper does almost as great a job.

Then Adobe got a hold of it and royally screwed it up with 2.0. I use this program often and tried to give it a chance. No way around it, it sucks now. I am going to use Sonar, a much better product. The only thing I like about 2.0 is that you can burn to a disc from Audition. That is the only reason why I gave it one star. This is not a user friendly program."},{"rating":"1","title":"WINDOWS XP ONLY","review":"I wanted to make sure people who look at this product have a full understanding that Adobe Audition 2.0 WILL NOT install on a Windows 2000 Pro or Server operating system. Almost EVERY reference I have seen regarding OS requirements say Windows but not specifically Windows XP. The only exceptions have been on the Audition box itself and this Amazon listing (go Amazon). So if you are a Windows 2000 user understand that you will need XP for this product. If you can find a copy of Audition 1.5 you're good to go.I would say more about the product if I could actually get it installed but with the 12 PCs I use not a one has XP so I have a $300+ book end until I can upgrade (if you can call it that) to XP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, buggy piece of crap. Audition 1.5 was better.","review":"If, like myself, you have many DX and VST plug-ins installed on your system, then Audition 2.0 is definitely NOT the choice with you. Somehow, the idiots who made this junk have made it completely incompatible with 3rd-party plugs such as Waves Diamond Bundle. Oddly enough, this was not a problem in earlier editions of Audition, or its former incarnation, CoolEdit. But now, Audition crashes irrevocably when trying to use many VST and DX plugs (except, of course, the ones made by Adobe themselves.)Bottom line? This software is crap. Absolute crap. If you're serious about audio production, go with Wavelab. Heck, even free multitrack audio software like Kristal works better than this.If, for some reason, you absolutely need Audition, then go with an earlier, more stable version, such as 1.5.2.0 is about as useful as a football bat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with 1.5","review":"I suppose you could blame this on my system/drivers, but when Audition 1.5 fires up and works every time, and Audition 2.0 will freeze my machine after closing it, I guess I tend to go with 1.5.So it may work fine for you. I have several audio interfaces, and a TON of VST's, which are probably part of Audition's problem.The audio hardware configuration is confusing in Audition 2.0 and seems a little flaky, for instance, 2.0 won't recognize my Samson CO1U USB mic although 1.5 did.

I never put my cookware in the dishwasher anyway so that feature does not bother me."},{"rating":"1","title":"imprecise","review":"The main problems with this angle finder stems from the nut that holds the two pieces of plastic together. The nut protrudes from the underside so you can't put the ruler flat against a surface which prevents you from drawing a straight line or getting perfectly lined up on the angle. The nut loosens as you change the angle so you have to keep tightening it. This tool is good for rough measurement for wood cutting perhaps but not for any sort of drafting where accuracy is important. It could probably be cheaper for the construction as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Money!","review":"Flimsy and cheap feeling. Hard to lock the angle and very hard to read. No more than 1/2 degree of accuracy. Should not cost more than a couple of dollars. Two pieces of flimsy plastic, held together by a brass wing-nut.Go with one of the metal, digital options, like the iGaging 15\\" Digital Protractor With 12\\" Rule.

It was very well researched. I learned a lot about the A-10, the pilots who flew it, and the tactics. It also gives a good back story of the 1st gulf war. The book started with information about the development of the aircraft and then goes into the buildup to the war. The book is a little slow at 1st, but really gets going once it gets into the actual events of the war. The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that sometimes there was so much detail that it was easy to get lost. Otherwise it's a great book that I enjoyed reading. I think it classifies as one of those books that I had a hard time putting down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will actually feel as if you had actually been there and done that!","review":"This book takes you right in combat with the A-10 pilots in the Gulf War. The author takes advantage of the hundreds of interviews he made for this book to discuss interesting incidents not only from the point of view of the pilot flying but also from his wingman and other pilots in the area.This book is about real people going to war and facing not only the enemy but themselves and their own fears.Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping, passionate portrayal, but scant on details","review":"As another has commented, I find this a difficult book to put down.

It tells that story of how a ugly, slow plane became a swan during the Gulf War. You get an understanding of how it must have been to fly the Hog, on missions it wasn't designed for.

If you want to know what it's like to manage squadrons of attack aircraft that get shot at every day, this is a very good read. If you are like me, interested in the nitty gritty details of fliping switches and pulling stick while being shot at, look elsewhere. The shooting doesn't start until well past the halfway point of the book and then it's very condensed and perfunctory.

The prose reads as if it were written by a fourth-grader hopped up on sugar and children's TV and the entire book is filled with spelling, grammar and punctuation errors.

In fact, she wrote a poem about it. When she read the poem to our family over the holiday get together we all had to laugh. Ever since I read this book I've been pushing it on all the members of my family to the point of being obnoxious. Thank goodness she took over my role. Perhaps she can get my siblings to read it. They don't listen to me. Now I have an partner in my cause to get others to read this book. It changed my way of thinking and how I view the world. I highly recommend it.

Nowhere in the book is there a distinction between \\"your\\" and \\"you're\\". I don't find this a difficult distinction to make, but apparently the proofreader did. There were many other spelling and grammar errors too, but that was the most consistent. I don't mean to be nit-picky, but it did take away from the book for me and was most annoying.

When I picked it up I wasn't sure what to expect but it has not disappointed. It is the most amazing life story (so far) of a young boy born into a life of drug dealing, gangs and organised crime. It follows the tale of Burrel as he grows up, as he makes illegal millions only to lose it all. How on earth he lived to tell the tale is a mystery. What he has done however, is turned his experiences into positives, this is a real story of ethics and transformation. This book offers two things, a real insiders account into the gang culture and crime worlds of Chicago. It is also a great read, compelling and incredible. I couldn't put it down. If you want to deepen your understanding of gang culture this is for you but if you just want a great page-turner of a story this is it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"A masterpiece of the calibre of One Hundred Years of Solitute and The Unbearable Lightness of Being - according to the covertext of the Dutch translation. So not exactly light reading material, but rural Chinese horrors so accurately descibed that I think the book should come with a warning. The plot is gripping and the prose flows easily - not as heavy on the reader as the long sentences and philosophical reflections of the above mentioned masterpieces can be. The fact that the end of the story leaves one wondering can be either good or the only bad thing about the book - I am still wondering. This book should be read by anyone who is interested in history and the dark side of humanity in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Vivid","review":"This is one of the most vivid, gut-wrenching books I have ever read. It is so utterly real that it can't really be thought of as fiction. Of course, it really isn't. All of the horrors the author describes were actually perpetrated by the Japanese in China.The closest experience to reading this is Truman Capote's \\"In Cold Blood\\".

Dispointment to say the least, the word sorghum is reiterated to the point it annoys sometimes it goes to 4 times in a single page.

With a special focus on Japanese cruelity then and the overwhelming human cost. Somewhat crude, as society surely was at that location and point of time, with good emphasis on the clash between the then primitive and wild Chinese society in the Chinese north east and the far more advanced yet more ruthless still onslaught of the Japanese. All set to the backdrop of omnipresent Sorghum, it's multiple uses and metaphors of the red."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserved the Nobel Prize for the author","review":"The book is a wonderful story.

However, the story was just one description of horrible, disgusting, sickening acts of violence after another during the 1930s in China when they were invaded by the Japanese and also engaged in civil war. I don't normally have a weak stomach, but after about 100 pages of it, I just tired of it and put the book back on the shelf. I would have given it one star, except that there were some beautifully written descriptions (as beautiful as the others were ugly) of the countryside around the small village where the story takes place. Clearly, Mr. Moyan is a very talented writer, and perhaps the Nobel prize was deserved based on his other writing.Boyd Lemon-Amazon author"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremitting violence","review":"This was a book group choice based on reviews, and proved to be a mistake. There was little to like; the writing is often over-heated, the insistent repetition of the central image tiresome and the explicit violence sickening.

The background story was interesting, but it was obscured by the style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy It and LEARN, History DOES Repeat...","review":"I don't understand these Nit-Picky reviews by the grammar police. This is a good book and an excellent assembling of newly discovered information. The authors have answered the challenge to assemble this information in a way that both entertains and informs. Wiessner was a man driven by desire and motivation. And the stregnth he himself emanated drove and bolstered his entire team. As has happened all to often since 1939, poor weather, poor circumstance, egos, self-image and desire all played a part in this disaster. The fact that Weissner and Wolfe got as far as they did (within 800m) is simply amazing. They were all men of unbelievable stregnth and drive.

Although those on the right are most often the victims of Sternlieb's incisive caricatures, no political figure is immune. To be the not-so-concealed source for one of Sternlieb's fables is to be more cursed than blessed. Sternlieb graciously thanks a number of his \\"muses\\" in his acknowledgments. But these muses will not feel the warmth of his gratitude when they spy the artful dissection of their characters by his merciless pen.Sternlieb's writing is witty in every sense of the word. It is the product of an agile, acutely perceptive and highly imaginative mind. For three years, I have been lucky enough to be one of the few e-mail beneficiaries of the work of this great fabulist.

I don't like green hair, chlorine smell or the nasty chemicals in algaecides. Use a phosphate test kit and balance the pH. If you have a lot of phosphate, use the commercial phosfree concentrate.Pool water is fresh, virtually oderless, and crystal clear. No algaecide foam or ring. Simple once a week use, an additional dose after a big rain, and your are set for the summer. NO mustard, black or green algae.I have a 30,000 gal vinyl liner pool and have used this product for 5 years. I like this combo better than salt based systmes, and much better than routine algaecides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at a lower price than anywhere","review":"I use this in my pool every week and the pool stays sparkling clean.

They offer free monthly water checks, but had never told me about phosphates before. I had high phosphate levels, around 500. They tried to sell me a 2 liter PhosFree for $50, but I knew of lower prices online. I bought a 3L PhosFree for $26 shipped.

The best song, I think is, That's What You Get. The next single which is really good, and pop oriented was written by JC Chasez of NSYNC.

The harmonies are to frequent and contain so many voices that it sounds out of tune, and if thats the effect you want then please think about the about the public first!The only reason they get 2 stars is because I'm afraid I have to admit that there are 2 outstanding tracks :\\"messed around\\" and \\"thats what you get\\".

A rythm section starts out and soon the ever-present 4/4 bass drum kicks in, mixed much too loud to my taste. Slowly, a few attempts at melody are added, then a few chords, and the thing just goes on an on. More layers of sound are added every twenty or thirty seconds, but the structure of each track never changes.There's no melodic variation on the tracks, and most of them seem to go on and on forever.This is the sort of album which gives techno a bad name. Play this for an outsider, and they'll get all their prejudices confirmed: Annoying bass drum, monotonous, unmelodic music that goes on forever.May I instead recommend Another World by Astral Projection, I.F.O. by Pleiadians, or Sky Input by Filteria?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want something other than the DK, try spoken word, or Lard, or No Means No, or DOA, or Mojo Nixon, or . . .","review":"I love Jello.

You won't be disappointed. LATE"},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting Melodic Punk","review":"This CD was awesome. Great guitar riffs, smooth bass lines, and powerful drum beats all packed together with amazing vocals. It is very good melodic punk you find yourself listening to all the time.

The original translation, titled The Traveler, is a much better read if one wants to get the full effect Szerb originally planned. How can someone properly translate a Hungarian book if they don't even read Hungarian? Compared to Peter Hargitai's original translation of this book, Len Rix's version just feels flat. I believe a translator must be fluent in the language he is working with, if not he ends up with a book that's missing something. And that something is a poetic command of the language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex characters, beautifully written","review":"Apparently, this book is staple reading for Hungarian students and I can see why. The shape of the overall story is satisfying with complex characters who change their minds a lot but in the end, ring true. Lovely descriptions of various European settings. What I liked best about this book was that although it was first published in the late 1930's I kept forgetting when it was set. There is a timeless quality about the story, a bittersweet fact for contemporary readers with the hindsight of history. We know what the characters and author did not about what was to come in those parts of Europe, especially Hungary. It is sad that Szerb's brief life did not enable him to write more, but I'm glad that Journey by Moonlight was recently republished so that I got the chance to read it; hooray for translator Len Rix."},{"rating":"1","title":"PADDED","review":"I DO BELIEVE THIS \\"FOAM PADDING\\" IS OVER PRICED if there was more or the price was lower, it would have been purchased"},{"rating":"2","title":"STILL GREAT!!","review":"Solaar is probbaly the only rapper that treats Rap/Hip hop as an art form and not just the popular music of the day.

There were things in it that were good and unique but I cannot say it's worth the read. I do not recommend this book. Out of all of the baby books I have read it is my least favorite. In my opinion, the best part of this book is that it encourages women to have a natural birth and testifies that birth can be pleasant.There are better, more clear founded strategies on how to achieve a pleasant childbirth in Ina May's Guide to Childbirth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fighter Jets and Attack Aircraft","review":"I have purchased this DVD video and conclude that it is anexercise in frustration to load (install) or run.

I never expected such a messed up, but somehow faithful interpretation. This reminds me a lot of Coil's Hellraiser Themes and In The Nursery. This will probably make your child's head spin around, but it's very cool, all the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"This is bad. Don't waste your money. My daughter is into the Zep Rockabye. This one, not at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intense look at the wilderness within and without.","review":"As in his earlier \\"Coasting\\", Raban weaves his inner and outer journeys in his classic self-revelatory style. His portrayal of Vancouver's struggles makes a great sub-plot. His descriptive powers zero right in. I've never read a better passage on the fundamental difference between the US and Canada. Raban evokes the spirit of the place and the people in ways that are surprising for just one trip North. His passages about his relationship with his father and daughter Julia are heartfelt and moving. Having spent some years in Southeast Alaska in the early 70's working on the water, it's great to read something other than the typical gushing travel writer's fiction. Raban gives us a very personal glimpse into a unique world. Ranks with McPhee's \\"Coming into the Country\\" and Edward Hoagland's \\"Notes from the Century Before\\" as one of the best books about the Alaskan experience as well as a very personal voyage of discovery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Let me start by stating that I just wrote a review of Raban's book \\"Old Glory\\" and said that it was probably the best travel book I've ever read. This book, conversely, is one of the worst. Like readers before me have said, if you like sailing, and want to know more about Raban's personal life, this book is for you. The problem, I found, was that unlike in Old Glory, where he was only a few hundred yards from shore, and would dock any time he felt like it to speak with the local folks, in \\"Passage\\", he's stuck out on the Pacific Ocean with nothing to do but recount some history, talk about his family, and describe his boat... dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, best I've read in years","review":"Raban does a first-class job interweaving multiple themes into this wonderful story, including fascinating accounts of early navigation methods, unforgettable descriptions of the people along the way, reflections of the sea in native art, Captain Vancouver's amazing voyage and the harsh conflicts among his crew, and lastly, Raban's own personal discoveries, heartfelt and heartbreaking. As an eight year Alaska resident I can say it's the rare book that gives a honest, unromanticized account of Alaska portraying all its beauty, harshness, and the tragedies as well as triumphs of its people. This is the best book I've read in years, reminiscent of Bruce Chatwin and the lost art of combining travel writing with impeccable historical research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raban's story is a first rate, sailor/history/personal one.","review":"Mr. Raban causes me to re-think my attitudes towards Native American anthropological 'truths'. Any book that makes me pause to 're-think', has done the job I bought it for; learning. Fresh minds = fresh ideas. Personally, I would have run Cap'n Van through, were I aboard the 'Discovery'. Thank you Mr. Raban..."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epiphany","review":"Just after reading the conclusion of this lyrical and haunting book, I watched the Eric Rohmer film \\"Le Rayon Vert\\" (The Green Ray.) As the film explains, if you see the green ray as the sun sets below the horizon, then you will know the true feelings inside your soul. The connection between the firm and Raban's book was clear. Throughout this book, Raban attempts to understand both the Pacific Northwest and his own family through the experiences of others -- Native Americans, Captain Vancouver, and even the itinerant workers in the Alaskan canneries. Only too late, after the fateful conclusion of the book, does he realize that he has failed to look deep inside of himself. If only he had watched the sunset over the western ocean and seen the green ray! Perhaps his life would have turned out differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drifting, not sailing","review":"The author fails miserable to hold together the historical journey of Vancouver, his current plodding through the inside passage, and his personal family life. Drifting from one to the other I dreaded learning more of this egomaniacs personal life! If the 430 pages had been edited down to 100 dealing with the history of the area, told as he travels through it, it might be a winner. But alas it's not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Having traveled the inside passage after graduating from college, I was immediately drawn to the title. After reading reviews I thought I would be in for a real treat. Oh, how I was wrong. This is a very boring narration by a very critical and conceded Jonathan Raban. I only finished the entire book because I felt I was obligated to complete the journey. If you are a big fan of cocktail parties and own a sailboat you may enjoy this book. All I know is that I could not recommend it to anyone and still maintain a clear conscience."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah blah blah","review":"pedantic and self-serving, Raban blathers on and on in a way impressively formulaic and dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"I agree with the other poster. It really doesn't work that well at all. It runs low on battery after a short use, things get easily clogged in the tube, it just isn't that handy. I would look for something better.

Songs Like Pump Up The Valium , Slow Motion Riot , 1.80 down , Panic , Riot Riot Upstart , and Good Rats make this cd a classic. And for only 5 dollars you can own some of the best modern punk rock. I usually only listen to classic punk but this made me realize that modern punk rock is good too. Get this and you wont be dissapointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD at an affordable price","review":"Want to know where punk is going? This CD covers all the bases. Dropkick Murphy's! If not for this album I would have never bought Do OR Die, the greatest punk album of the century! Lots of other kick rear songs. Punk isn't just for X-gamers and skaters, it's for everyone whose got a soul! YOUNG AND OLD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk-O-Rama 5 Review","review":"Just buy this CD. It has 28 songs and is only about six bucks. I actually bought it for the NOFX song, but the other songs are good too. The CD starts off punk, then gets heavier near the middle, and then switches back to punk. There's a good variety of bands, so you should find something you like. If you like the other Punk O Rama albums, you'll like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finely A Good Punk CD","review":"Hey i wanna tell u that punk o rama vol. 5 is one of the best i have all of them up to 6 and this one is one of the best and its a really good CD and i jugest that u go and get this CD i first got this CD along with some other punk o rama Cd's and this one is jsut really good and jugest u go and get casue its really good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk o rama 5...possibly the greatest array of punk?","review":"Right off, I think this is a purchase i was most happy with. The cd has some of the best punk bands on it ever. The allstar line-up consists of nofx,dropkick murphy's, pennywise,vision,rancid, and alot more. The songs are great and you can never get tired of this cd. I take it everywhere and listen to it first.

Primera said they would send me a replacement but I haven't seen it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Bought this book for a friend who's in the graphic design business; all this book does is show you a bunch of fonts on paper, you still have to purchase the fonts through seperate vendors. TOTAL RIP OFF!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth having","review":"Many budget-priced classics are poorly edited, with a forward or introduction that is little more than a token gesture. This edition of Frost's early work, comprising his first two publications, is a notable exception. The introduction by William Pritchard and the afterword by Peter Davison are both first-rate. The poems themselves are very fine and if you read them in sequence they give a real sense of the poet's development. It is also nice that they are in their original forms, including the glosses that Frost later removed.With such fine editing, and at such a low price, this book is well worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good picks+lousy packaging= poor product overall","review":"The picks I received are fine. The problem is that when I opening the large box in which the picks were shipped, the clear plastic clamshell package that was supposed to hold the 12 pick was open and empty. In rummaging around through the shipping box, I could only find 3 picks. Either I got ripped off and the clamshell only contained 3 picks originally, not the 12 described in the Amazon item, or the other 9 picks fell out of the shipping box (the box was not that well sealed) during transit. Either way, I got cheated. In looking at other reviews of this product, I see that I am not the only one to whom this has happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 out of 12 ain't bad?!?!","review":"I received only 4 out of 12 picks. Amazon sent this in a shoebox size box. Along with the tuner I ordered, it filled up about 10% of the box. The pick packaging came open and 8 of them slipped out. I would have been much better off going to a local shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeated bad reviews for a reason","review":"NOT a \\"multi-pack\\" as described. NOT a 12 pack as Im sure the mail man shook his 5 picks worth out of the box (Horribly packaged). Just look at how many people are having the same issues!So here is what you SHOULD do: NOT BUY THESE PICKS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These are JUNK.","review":"I ordered 2 dozen. EVERY ONE of the 24 picks had rough edges all the way around. Where is Fender's quality control? They feel and sound like used picks. You can not get a smooth sound when playing, only a raspy tone because of the rough edges. With a name like Fender, I expect better.These picks are a disgrace to the Fender name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I am very disappointed with this purchase as in two sessions I have managed to break about 6 picks (playing an acoustic guitar). The edge breaks off when strumming. I have never had this happen to me in over 20 years of playing. I can understand the odd one or two, but 6 picks!!I'm going back to nylon picks for my next purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice tough, great for Heavy Metal pics","review":"I have always liked the Fender brand pics. These are the Heavy Fender guitar pics. These are great for any style of music, but I especially like these pics when I play on my stratocaster. I think these are the best pics you can buy because they are the toughest and do not flex when you strum the strings. These are the best in my opinion. I also like the blue and black swirls on the pic it looks great too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um, not a SINGLE pick in the package, really?","review":"wow..guess the other reviewers weren't kidding...just got mine and the box was fine (there were other items that arrived in the same box without a problem) but the package of guitar picks was completely empty. um, hello amazon? who do you have checking these things? lame!oh and hate to give 1 star, but will def change my review if I actually get to try one one day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking, a little awkward","review":"I'm a newbie on the guitar... so I bought this knowing very little about different picks (had only used one).It came quickly, looks like the photo. I will say, it feels very \\"firm\\" and long to me. So I'm having a hard time adjusting to strumming with that level of stiffness. That said, I don't know how much of that is my fault- so I'd still recommend it to someone looking for a firm pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fender 351 Premium Celluliod Guitar Pick","review":"I am a begginer, sorry I dont know anything about guitar picks, it's been a little over 2 months so far and they haven't gotten bent or broken.
