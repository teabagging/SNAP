Each of the chapters focuses on a theme or a region, ranging from the artistry of Loos to the social engineering of Scandinavia. Though most of the examples are familiar, the author gives them a fresh spin-starting with the cover illustration of Hans Scharoun's Schminke house of 1933, now restored and used as a day care center. It embodies the daring and idealism that powered the modern movement and is now being rediscovered.

I do not have this problem when printing directly from the printer via a Compact Flash card. Also, this printer will not feed properly when only a couple of sheets of photo paper are in the 4X6 tray.

So I tried it on the Mac, it is SLOWER. It runs about 1 page per minute and a half. A color photo takes 5 minutes, and this is a small 4x6 print. I'll keep the 1115. It has better photo quality also.

Two minutes to do a printed page in black and white. A color photo of 4x6 takes 5 minutes. This is on a HP Pavilion POC computer. So I tried it on my G4 Mac that has an excellent 1115 Photosmart on it. The 7350 would not work with OSX until I downloaded the latest driver from HP which took an hour as I only have dial-up. The printer works a little faster on the Mac, but not by much. The photo quality is not near as good as the HP1115 or Epson I have. I cannot recommend this piece of junk.

This allowed me to print from iphoto and photoshop. The photos I printed on glossy inkjet paper are average, which is the only good thing about this printer that I have found so far. It isn't hot swappable (USB is supposed to be, and my last USB printer was), and I commonly have to restart my computer to get it to print if the printer is unplugged.

She recalls visiting the local store with her pocket change, being encouraged to mull over the candy counter as long as she liked by the elderly proprietess; her lifelong love for words and books; and the fierce protectiveness displayed by her elder brother William, and in turn she for younger siblings Mary and Henry.This quietly moving story is surprisingly engaging, as readers are quickly pulled into a long-ago era and a distinctive kind of life that many can only imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"No customer support","review":"It looks good but their support is terrible.

As they are 30 degree strips and not the 34 degrees specified by Porter-Cable, they sometimes don't feed so you have to give the feeder spring a flick once in a while. The no feed happens about once every 300 nails. For my project it's an inconvenience I can live with compared to banging nails by hand.Overall though, I think I've made a good purchase.

In the area of light viennese polka and waltz music there a many beaten paths and many favorites played to death. Harnoncourt uses his great knowledge and thoroughness to surprise listeners with different wonderful pieces every time he ventures into this genre. As a musical scholar and teacher one of his great themes is the musical dialogue, and in this collaboration with the Vienna Philharmonic (he used to be a cellist in this same orchestra), the dialogue is clearly working very well. My one issue with him once again is pace. Some of the pieces are a bit slow-footed and they loose their lightness in the process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Like all my favorite albums I didn't care for this much at first but it grew on me.

So many techniques were in the book but they seemed to be glossed over quickly instead of giving each of them the space they deserved.Many of the examples used seemed rather dated to me, such as flounces or a cowl/draped neckline. The technique for keying a zipper could have used more space to expand.Additionally it was too bad that the publishers didn't decide to do the book in a hard cover.

Okay, maybe Algonquins aren't so strict about being on time as Germans, but neither are Greeks or Arabs, and nobody says those guys are too primitive to understand the concept of linear time.How insulting."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT WORKING BREAST PUMP.

I was surprised how much faster I could express the milk with this pump. It's a bit noisey, and it doesn't suction as hard as the manual pump, but it was much more comfortable and efficient. once my child started sleeping through the night i was engorged in the morning. My child would nurse all of one breast, then i would express the other; this is why i chose the single pump over the dual. the single is also a lot cheaper. This pump also works great if you are trying to stimulate a greater production of milk. try expressing whatever you have left, even if it is too little to keep it will cause your body to make more milk more often. it works great for trips, though it is bigger than i expected and is a little inconvienent to carry around.

After 2 days of pumping I noticed that I was loosing all of the skin around my nipple and the pain was getting worse. I had the pump for less than 1 week when I noticed I was pumping a lot less milk. I thought maybe it was me, maybe my milk was drying up. I tried the pump again the next day and it wouldnt work at all.

I hate that the suction cup, its shaft, & the bottles are frosted so you cant see if you're aligned properly or if you're even getting anything out.The handle swivels all around,so once you're actually aligned you lose the suction & have to start all over.

This works great now that my son sleeps through the night, so I do not even have to get up to pump.This pump does take two hands if your breasts are heavy with milk because the plastic shield will need to be held firmly in place to allow the best suction. The unit is much quieter if you use the cover or place a pillow over the top. I've never used any other pump, and the pricier ones may work better, but for the money I will recommend this pump first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pump!","review":"I pump exclusively (baby won't latch on), and this pump has been great. I can usually get about 5 ounces out of each breast - 10 minutes each. I like that this is a single breast pump and not a double since getting the hang of a double breast pump can be challenging to say the least! As far as the pump being noisy, if you put the cover over pump (make it look like a purse), it muffles quite a bit of the sound.I, also, wish that this pump didn't accomodate the wide mouth bottles, but considering the sizable savings compared to similar breast pumps, it's not such a big deal. I can definately live with it.I will definately recommend this pump to anyone who asks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best BuY","review":"I am pleased with this product!

Also, the breast shields cut into your nipple and leave marks around your areola (when the suction is actually working!). Also, alot of precious milk leaks out of the breast shields when you are done pumping and remove the shields from your breasts. This product is horrible!

My nipple would hurt so bad with the shield it came with (Too small). If you have even average size breasts (which most women do after giving birth) your nipple will not fit into this shield.

If this were to combined with his later works, like The Mind of God, into one expanded volume I would definitely give it 10 stars. I've gone through 3 copies of this already - having lent the previous one's out only never to return- a small price to pay to turn others on to such an excellent author.

Did God create the universe? What is life? Are we here by accident or design? What happens at the 'end of time'? Intelligent and forthright, Davies will make you question what you think you know about the nature of reality, and leave you well informed about the many differences (and even the common ground) between science and faith. I highly recommend this book for those truly wanting to broaden their understanding of the cosmos, but fundamental religious people should be warned that the presence of \\"God\\" in the title does not mean this book will pander to common religious thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seeker of wisdon and truth","review":"Typical of Paul Davies, he is relentless in his quest for enlightenment on the ultimate question.

It did not do much to carry his point when the conversations were obviously slanted in a manner to present physicists as totally logical and reasonable, and anyone that believes in God as an emotionally based illogical dolt.

In addition, I don't feel that sufficient detail is given to the elements of the story to make them believable. There are too many glossed over details to draw the reader in properly.The main plot (at least it seems the main plot) itself represents an interesting idea - the mind pool - but it is lost in the noise.Nevertheless, it is a somewhat interesting story, and a unique vision.

These intel MacBooks are really fast compared to any PowerPC books I have used in the past. The built in iSight is a nice feature and the remote is handy. If your going to invest in one of these though, I would highly recommend getting the Apple Care protection plan as I have experienced various hardware problems with my iBook. By that point you might as well fork up the extra money for the black. The only bad thing about the MacBook is that is gets quite hot. For those of you with an iBook, be prepared because this one gets even hotter than that.

I've been using laptops for nearly 15 years now, and I've felt notebook computers a lot hotter than this one.Finally, I purchased this item from Amazon, and received it a day later - USED AND BROKEN (it even had the previous owner's amazon invoice inside the box)!

I found Herrera's way of looking at life quite wise for a 30-year-old. She expresses her thoughts in original ways that set the reader thinking and wanting to be more creative in outlook. This book will appeal to memoir fans, but even more to those wanting to \\"visit\\" the Cameroons in all its wonder and pain.

It just left the book feeling empty and contrived.It seems like the author was most concerned with getting to know herself through her journal entries, which is entirely understandable, as most of us would do the same. However, I just don't think there is enough interesting material about herself to justify my time in a novel.I wanted to get to know the Peace Corps experience and her country better, but feel like I only got to explore her thoughts and feelings rather than a deeper connect with something that would interest a third party.She is definitely a great person and someone that would be great to be friends with, but it is not really worth reading a whole book about her journal entries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice writing, not Peace Corps","review":"Five of us, all Returned Peace Corps Volunteers, read this book together. Our consensus view: Herrera can write but the book is more about how her time in Cameroon fits in her life than about being a Peace Corps Volunteer. If you want a book that will provide a view of what being a Peace Corps Volunteer is like you should read a different book. If you want an interesting, well written book this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book!","review":"I stumbled upon this book, which I'd never heard of, while browsing in the library, and checked it out on a whim. It proved to be a real stroke of luck, because the book was a delight to read. Not only does it paint a fascinating picture of life in a small Cameroonian village -- a far cry from what it's like here in the United States -- but the story of the author's personal journey, told with honesty and integrity, is compelling in its own right. The biggest surprise was that Herrera is a very talented writer with a real gift for poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensitive look at finding oneself in another culture","review":"It's hard to tell who was changed more when Susana Herrera went to a small village in northern Cameroon to teach as a Peace Corps volunteer: the villagers or Susana. She brought a hidden capacity of strength and independence as a woman and the ability to ride a bike. They brought an understanding of how a person could feel at home in her own skin. It's hard to tell who got the better bargain.But the reader wins the most from this touching story of a frightened and self-conscious young person who becomes a fierce and vibrant woman treasured by the people she comes to help and ends up learning so much from. Through storms, droughts, anarchy in the classroom, life-threatening illness, political upheaval, love, hate, competition and pain, the author learns how to live--in her own skin. A phenomenal book, particularly for a first book. There is something important about embracing life in this memoir that will speak to every reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Land of Cliches","review":"I had to think long and hard about this one. Was this movie so bad, so awful, that it then became good? It lies in the intent of the writer and director. Were all the cliches scenes meant to be sincere? Was the dialogue unoriginal on purpose? Was the direction decively devoid of cleverness? There was no sense of irony that could redeem this film.

The story is thin and lame and held together by ridiculous dialog and plot holes large enough to drop a planet through. The acting is second rate ..at best , although given the garbage they have to say Deniro and Pacino would seem bad.Even the cover is a sell job as the actors shown (other than C Thomas Howell) don't really resemble his co-stars.

However, you cannot find it anymore, and the price they're asking for them both here and eBay is ridiculous. Folks, it's plastic and foam. The foam fins and top were torn up within a few weeks, and one bad landing made the plastic body crack. Also, the control handle broke within about 1 month, and the tube gets all twisted so it's hard to keep anchored.I guess it was definitely worth a summer of fun for $10......but the price Amazon & eBay sellers want for it is borderline criminal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cheap price","review":"I have five of this model right now, and it works totally awesome! With 3 lights, you can virtually fill a 12'X12' room with black light. Also, it is very efficient - it only uses 13W, which is far less than common 60~100W bulbs in your bathroom. The 180-degree turning ability works beautifully, enabling you to setup lights just as you wish.Shortcomings would be that it does not come with mounting stickers. It gives your screws and bolts, and that's it. But if you are the kind of guy not wanting to harm your house walls, buy mounting stickers along with this item separately. Another shortcoming is that the product does not specify what kind of specific florescent it is using.

This book is very well written and I am happy that such a publication exists because there isn't much available on the lesser known Uralic languages.

It should be a more prominent section in the book and the facts and figures he uses to make his case should be beefed up to the level of the research he used in the other sections. Overall, a good source of information. Globalization is a strong force - how do we reap the benefits without the dire consequences? Definitely makes you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating!","review":"I liked very much \\"The world is flat\\" because it is written objectively and presents mostly facts. Globalization has its friends and foes but Friedman proves that it IS valuable and even necessary in order to live in a more balanced, connected and positively heading world. This is a book which will definitely broaden your perspective and open your mind to so many wonders and problems that happen NOW. It is always better to be informed and have an opportunity to come up with an opinion instead of to wait for a problem to surprise you. You may not agree with everything in the book but it is a good and valuable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Handbook for all strategists","review":"Friedman's \\"The World is Flat\\" is an eye-opener, especially for the developed and advanced countries like USA and its young generation that seems to have lost the purpose, living in an isoalted world of comfort and assured good future.

India and China have been constantly mentioned as the most priviliged to have taken the maxumum advatnage from the flatter world. The future holds bright for these two giant economies for their ability to adopt and adapt to change faster than others.

A serious book can't be that popular. If you have taken the economic 101 and scored above B, you will agree with me.Mr.Friedman obviously lacks of even basic training on economics to handle this topic. He approaches to the topic the same way he used in his another famous but not serious book \\"Lexus and olive tree\\". Really shallow!That is because he doesn't have the training to digest enormous volume of economic researches, papers, and data available.Yes. He is sharing with you a lot of stories. He does travel a lot. But he is rumbling. Lot of stories are barely relevant and too lengthy.Bottom line: if you want a casual reading and are satisfied to show off to your friends some strange stories, buy this.

I mean globalization is great, the world is becoming flat and jobs are being outsourced, to which Mr. Friedman states Americans will have to work harder to create better jobs to fill the vacancies left from outsourcing. Mr. Friedman has faith in the future generation, but as a teacher I must say I don't see the hunger in any of the students I teach, I beg them to try harder, I explain to them that the world is changing, that they must start now if they want to prosper in the future, but they are all too complacent, to enamored with PS3, Flavor Flave, ect....so what is plan B, if Americans do not wake up and acknowledge the flat world, what then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Premise but some Overreacting","review":"As usual great stuff from Friedman. He has this knack for distilling and presenting complex issues.I thought he made good points but I read an interesting take on his views by Suzanne Nossel over at DemocracyArsenal.org.

Apparently, those young people are shocked to find that their countries' economies lag Europe's and America's and the rage they feel, the \\"cognitive dissonance\\" pushes them over the edge.

But the world is not american it is too vivid , colorful and full of chaos to be covered in a book.His examples of Infosys, UPS and many other companies are very apt to support his point.Yes I agree that US is lagging behind in some core areas like physics, mathematics. They need to take a more careful approach to get thier young to take up science in maths, Computer Science ,Nano technology etc.He is right in saying even if the world is flat, America will always have a very solid postion because of its open policies ( dont talk about politics ), enterpreneurship, law etc.In all a very good book and a must read for any one interested in the world you live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friedman's Circuitous Expanded Edition","review":"Having worked with computers since the TI-99/4a, and having been directly involved in IT outsourcing for at least 10+ years, I found much of this book to be self evident.

But can he write less? As a writer of his caliber, I would have expected more in fewer words. The idea behind The World is Flat is solid and accurately represents the state of today's interconnected world. Much of the book consists of interviews and stories that merely confirm similar notions of globalization and technology enabling the flattening of the world in terms of access, opportunities and communications.

Students are falling into debt even before they are productive adults. What kind of burden are we putting on the students of the future by letting the government shorten financial aid? (let alone private school tuition)The world is flat is a very good insight into globalization, but it only tell the story of what the develop nations want to hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Makes you Think ...","review":"This book will not only broaden your horizons but will also entertain you at the same time. Thomas Friedman presents global view on word economics, politics, science, technology and shows their interdependence. The discussion of ten forces that flattened the world makes it a fine way to spend a few reading hours. The clever prose and quality storytelling assures your interest in reading from start unttil the end. For more of Friedman I also suggest readingThe Lexus and The Olive Tree, Revised Edition: Understanding Globalization"},{"rating":"2","title":"He is Almost an Expat","review":"I liked Mr. Friedman's book. He is a cheerful Midwesterner abroad. He has affection for the people he meets, and that is great.I have lived in Islamic countries for over 20 years. Unfortunately, the flattening process has not happened here and is being actively resisted. I hope his next book will be about the \\"other world\\" of recidivist religious fundamentalists, Christian, Islamic, Jewish, Hindu or whatever, that have put their people back with their fanatical ravings.On the other hand, it sure is nice to see an optimistic journalist and I hope he keeps it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Work","review":"Friedman writes a history and sounds the alarm about the world becoming flat. The first half of this book reads fast, and is very interesting. The United States is slowly falling behind the rest of the world in math & science.

It is really fascinating how the world is changing - this book will help you get a grasp on what is going on.

Friedman captures with a little bit of liberal slant, what has been going on with globalization, and the out-sourcing and in-sourcing of jobs since the new \\"flattening\\" of the world has occurred through the global telecommunications networks, and the internet.

Take a reality check and pull your head out of your 5th point of contact.Congratulations to all the companies that have shaved a few points off the bottom line at the cost of their US former employees, and the long term well being of the country that sends out young men and women out to fight and die keeping you free."},{"rating":"1","title":"What about ecology and sustainable development?","review":"Friedman and his MNC coherts ignore the ecological damageto the air and \\"commons.\\" Their uncontrolled and unregulatedprivatization of nature--everything from land, to water, toseeds, to timber is gravely endangering our ability to survive.Read Daniel Diamond's Collaspe before you swallow these ideaswhole."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I wanted","review":"I thought the book was a hard cover - when I received it and it wasn't, I wrote to the person who sent it, asking how I could return it, because I needed a hard cover book to replace one for a friend - I received no response back.

Must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Flat","review":"If you've heard Mr. Friedman interviewed on NPR or CNN, skimmed an article in Newsweek or surfed the net on his subject, you've pretty much read the book. Friedman pads a heck of a lot of fluff between the first chapter and the last, saying the same thing over and over. It's as if his publisher demanded a large word count and then sent him out on the interview circuit to promote what easily could have been said in a concisely written essay. It's too bad that we see so much of this today; a huge marketing campaign goes into propping up a book that wastes too much of the reader's time. The concepts and insights are enlightening if you've not been paying attention in the digital age, but for a message about global economy, it's ironic that the medium used is redundant, padded, and required the use of so much paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different point of view but better than you would think","review":"I think this book is a good guide on how you can benefit from the globalization and the internet. If you are an entrepreneur or you just want to know what is happening in India and China at the moment, I guess in other countries as well, then this is a must read for you. The stories are interesting, simple to read and understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I miss the Technology revolution in front of me?","review":"This book contains very thought provoking ideas and information regarding the influence of technology on the world as a whole. How does India's rise as an outsourcing location influence the US? Why are Chinese learning Japanese in certain towns / regions? Yes, this revolution is and has been happening right in front of me and you. There are consequences on a social, political and economical level for all of us. A definite must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late awakening, but not too late...","review":"The book is very well written and encompasses the happenings in the last 2 decades that have shrunk the world. Friedman has tried to give a name to this shrinking, he calls it flattening-fair enough.Friedman also talks about the top-10 \\"Flatteners\\". The list is pervasive of what happened and created the flat world. Though it should not be considered and compared with books on technology trends such as Megatrends (John Naisbitt) or even Road Ahead (Bill Gates). What Friedman has tried to achieve is to bring home the idea of \\"flattening\\" to the average American, who needs this more than anybody else.Friedman uses his immense experience travelling the globe to explain the social and economic changes that this \\"flattening\\" has brought about.In all, well researched book, the writing style is very gripping and filled with quotes from experts in the world, most of them the IT diaspora who felt the change first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on the economic history of modern world","review":"How technology can change the economic dimensions in the world is unimaginable. Thomas Friedman shows this effortlessly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unknown and untapped globalization","review":"Friedman does an excellent job providing a thorough analysis of business (primarily outsourcing), global economic development, and historical political events and their impact on the changing face of global business.Friedman is at his best discussing the advantages of call center operations in Bangalore, India and how companies like Google, Wal-Mart, and UPS has changed business efficiencies.At times the book is a bit too technical and Friedman pushes a political agenda, thus pushing the book 50-75 pages too many. However, this book is a MUST read for anyone pursuing an MBA; works in international business operations; and is looking to identify methods to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Educational reading for those who wish to learn","review":"Globalization is a topic that leaves few indifferent when they are truly concerned about the future of mankind. Friedman offers us his points of vision on the subject in this interesting collection of his point of view.One of the things we must all consider is the root behind outsourcing and, hence, the fertilizer for which globalization is blossoming beneath our economic charts. I, for one, believe the mere mindset of keeping jobs in the US for having them in the US with no consideration of how the price of labor will affect American products in an ever competitive world market, is completely incorrect. Friedman takes this issue and many more to task as he explains the world we live in is no longer a simple one, economically speaking. In a nation that worries more about the latest American Idol voting over the course the market is taking, this book is an eye opener to the times that lay ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Even if you don't know much about technology, this book will open your eyes and show you how the world is flattening day by day and how it is impacting millions of people not only in the United States but all over the world.

Of course, we are discussing levels of interaction and not geometric shape. A short review will not do this book justice. It will not be the easiest read of the year, but it is certainly worth the effort. Buy it, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The World is getting flatter","review":"This book summarizes many topics that need to better published and discussed on a regular basis. Mr. Friedman has been able to take the main topics that really matter in the tech and management work and related them to our current day to day activities. Mr. Friedman has a way of explaining certain topics and is able to blend all the information needed to see our World in the future. He does have a way to ensure that the right message comes out for every reader to understand. The expanded version of the audio cd has an end section that tied his previous book to his new one, by answering some questions from readers of both books. His previous book is also a good read but not needed for this one.

Suffers from an occasional and unsubstantiated spewing of personal opinion about politics but the basic conclusions are thought provoking. This book should be required reading for all policy wonks."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate that things are moving so quickly...","review":"This book would have been a good read for me about a year ago. I look at it now and realize the information is already dated. The author relates stories about people sitting in meetings and finding answers to questions right then and there, from their wireless equipped handheld devices. This is no longer a novel idea. Internet everywhere is dubbed the steroids that are pumping up all the other world flatteners, such as outsourcing, in-sourcing, globalization, supply chaining, etc. The benefit of this book is the author's ability to view the world at work, then distill many of the processes into a single theme (such as each of \\"The ten forces that flattened the world\\"). The expanded edition does a really good job of brining some of the concepts up to date. Perhaps version 3.0 will discuss the impact of the iPhone, WiMax, and tagging. In the meantime, you should read this to catch up on the trends which will shape the next few decades."},{"rating":"2","title":"All is good","review":"Book was cheap, in the condition advertised, and shipped as advertised.

The book itself, however, would be a far better read at 250 instead of almost 500 pages. Friedman never uses 2 examples when he can use 5 (and drop an additional 3 CEO names in the process). After 3 weeks and 350 pages I threw in the towel, the first book I haven't finished in probably 10 years. Had he edited himself more rigorously, this book might have become a must read for businessmen like myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat Flat World","review":"A friend recommended this book to me. I think the author put a lot of research into this book and deserves some credit for that, but I found the book to be flat. It throws a lot of interesting data at you but doesn't keep the mind from wandering.I would like to point out that I am not an expert when it comes to reviewing a book, and that my opinion may not fit with what everyone else thinks. My friend really liked this book. He liked it well enough to talk me into ordering it all the way over here in the Philippines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Symbols for the symbol-minded","review":"Simplistic anecdotes that condescend to the reader. Friedman fails to live up to his own conceptual assertions, time and time again. A waste of time, and dangerous because Friedman writes in a way that people FEEL like he's distilled the issues in a way that's utterly understandable; instead, he's left out 80% of any given issue. I've given this guy shot after shot to say something important and meangingful. That's all over now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant","review":"It is quite tedious to get through this tome.The author's approach to such an expansive topic is well organized and his perspective is clear. However, each section is terribly repetitive. It seems the author did not trust his readers (or listeners) to get his point after the first, second, or even third explanation, and thus he continues with his excessive expounding and legions of examples.My suggestion: try the abridged version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only his head is flat.","review":"Another xmas present, this one's a dud. Friedman rahs rahs the depreciation of American white collar workers with the astonishing claim that this outsourcing will be as good for them as the selling out of American blue collar workers for the last 20 years. All those higher education degrees? Who needs a Phd to flip burgers? You might need one to take the order for the burger but that job's gone to India. What a knucklehead! Fortunately the Pajamadeen blogs will soon make bloviators like Friedman unemployed at the Times - do you think Friedman will be as jolly about his own Pink Slip as he is about everyone else's? Its all good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clueless","review":"This has been well documented by others both here and on the internet but Thomas Friedman is a total moron. This book is void of any insight that a child couldn't determine by reading or watching the vannier that is the main street media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing original. Too long winded.","review":"I've read this book. The ideas are not new, and can be found elsewhere. It is still alright if the book can present the same ideas from a fresh perspective. But it didn't. It is too long winded. Everything can be distilled into 100 pages at most. I like ideas presented clearly and concisely. I hardly extracted anything of value from the book. In short it is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic propaganda piece","review":"Friedman has a religion: unbridled global capitalism. He wants us to believe that everyone benefits from globalization, free trade, outsourcing and offshoring. He glosses over dark underbelly of these trends, namely a widening of the gap between the rich and poor, and the shrinking of the middle class in the developed world.There's no question that there is a trend here towards outsourcing and offshoring. The big question is who wins and who loses.If you want the pollyanna view of globalization, by all means, buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check the facts please?","review":"Even the simples facts are not checked. For example: LP records are claimed to be digital storage of music. Also Friedman claims that only SOAP and XML allowed applications to communicate together. Maybe he has not heard of EDI? That has been around for about 25 years.Lot of hype, lot of wrong facts and it goes on and on about the same thing never really extending or studying it further. First 50 pages would have been enough. After that it is all rerun.Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to your columns, Tom!","review":"There are some very interesting, novel, and innovative ways of thinking presented in this book.

It didn't have to be repeated, and repeated and repeated, on page after page.I think that this book could have been less than half its size and still have gotten its ideas across quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The world is flat, according to Friedman. The world is connected, in normal language. So what? I have read the first 60 pages and then began to skip pages, trying to find something else , but found more and more examples, illustrating the same point again and again. I got the feeling that I am reading the weekly magazine column over and over again.As much as I like Friedman style, the book is way too long for a couple of ideas that he has on the subject. Alternatively, he should have left writing on economics to the professionals. \\"Roaring 90's\\" by Stiglitz have more ideas in any one chapter, than there are in the whole \\"Flat world\\". (Well, Stiglitz earned his Nobel prize in economics, so presumably he is better qualified to write economics books)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a book, but an essay","review":"This is one of the most overrated books in recent history. His premise is sensible enough, but he takes nearly 500 pages to repeat himself endlessly and tirelessly when he could have made the same points just as effectively in 8-10 pages. To me, the sign of a good writer is the ability to clearly, precisely and honestly express him- or herself with brevity and poetic rhythm. Despite his New York Times pedigree, Friedman is anything but a good writer. Instead, he takes to absurd form the student fulfilling the assignment from a middle school teacher to \\"write a ten-page paper\\" when that student only has enough material for a two-page paper. Eight pages of repetitive, redundant fluff would be bad enough. Unfortunately, in this case, Friedman provides more like 480 pages of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Flat","review":"Thomas Friedman is an astute columnist, and his columns ring true because he knows the issues that he discusses. Unfortunately, this book is about topics that Friedman admittedly discovered too late and he spends page after page convincing us and perhaps more, himself, that he now gets it. Very little here is new to even the casual technophile; what is interesting is that there is a story connecting the technology. However, that story-telling is marred by an obscene number of references to the term \\"flatten\\" and its variants. What starts out as a clever book title and metaphor becomes obnoxious after it is pounded to the reader on virtually every page--do a search using one of the new-fangled search devices Freidman has now heard about and you will find thousands of the \\"flatten\\" words in this book. A ruthless and human editor would have improved this needlessly lengthy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenging World and Cultural Perspective!","review":"BRAVO!

If you read the news paper and think about the stories you read there is nothing new here. There is a lack of solid evidence for his arguments and is based on Friedman's opinions instead of statistics and market trends. Friedman does do a good job linking everything together in an easy to read fashion. If you are looking for a good balanced book about globalization and how it's changing society this is not it.

His thesis is that this opens up great opportunities both for businesses and for terrorists. He seems to have little sympathy for the person displaced by globalization and offers few if any words about ameliorating the plight of those who lose jobs to globalization. He also offers no real course of action to battling the use of globalization by terrorists -- only offering the observation that truly democratic nations with large Muslim populations (e.g., India) seem to spawn many fewer terrorists than non-democratic nations. I was very disappointed that Friedman spent so much time saying what we all know and almost no time exploring how we as nations or individuals should handle the problems as well as the benefits inherent in globalization."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opening read","review":"This is an eye-opening, entertaining and instructive book.Friedman not only exposes the state and inner-workings of this new economy, but also proposes some ideas to satisfy the increasing need to churn out a larger pool of individuals that will allow the US to compete with the rest of the world and come out ahead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressed as the New York Times is...","review":"This book did not impress me... although I have not finished the book and probably won't.

Care to defend that somehow?\\" I don't disagree that the country needs to rethink how we interact with other countries, but we need to put the partisan bickering aside and get things done. Apparently Mr Friedman would rather rant and rave with his liberal pals and not have a real dialogue with someone with a different point of view.

Or more importantly, perhaps it is because I DID read every word that I find many of their comments suspect. Particularly unfair were comments that TLF offered no solutions.

Friedman is an author of extreme eloquence, and this is a tough book to put down, especially for one on such a weighty issue as globalization.However, he is lacking in convincing analysis. As interesting as his historical perspectives are of industry in the pre-1800, state run era, and in the corporate era of 1800-2000, it is difficult to trust his opinion on the global implications of the last 5 years.Also, too much of the book is devoted to America falling behind, or the education gap between America and other industrialized countries (especially China and India). Not that this topic isn't interesting, but it is somewhat tired, and Friedman brings little more to the table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsupported","review":"Thomas L. Friedman once again fills a few hundred pages with concrete examples about how a kid in India now has the same chance of success as a kid from suburban America.

He makes some very dated and very trite observations (do you know that Burger King saves 5% by using call centers for their drive thru customers?) and is overjoyed in doing so - so overjoyed, in fact, that he is often repetitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to step up","review":"I am in the IT field in a large american insurance company.

Worth a second, third read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pablum","review":"Don't waste your time. This book is unreadable unless you worship at the alter of the New York Times. If you do you will probably enjoy it.Interesting subject but the writers style is to make it about himself, who he knows and share how enlightened he is. Basic premise- Walmart= Bad, treats employees poorly, forced US manufacturers to go overseas to be price competitive. Costco= good, as they provide more health insurance.Friedman may be known as a great writer but for me it was too slow paced....I would agree some points are on the mark as I head to China again next month to explore the flat world!May have been more topical in 2004, but today for me it seems outdated....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Shoddy Analysis","review":"Although I applaud books written for popular audiences intending to educate them about certain subjects (e.g. economics, astrophysics, political science, etc), this book disappoints.Friedman's analysis presents his beliefs through dogmatic anecdotes and stories, rather than through scientific rigor. For instance, he proffers that the main argument against globalization is that it results in the loss of domestic jobs to those in other countries such as India. Although this may be the popular mantra, this is in fact false. Globalization creates more jobs than are lost; the problem is that many of these jobs are lower paying. Unfortunately for the reader, Friedman does not know this and he does not address globalization's other numerous critiques (i.e. neo-marxist critiques of Western economic hegemony, environmental destruction, the unfair treatment of workers in poorer countries, demise of the welfare state in the West, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat perhaps for 1/3 of the world","review":"Friedman's book is full of great international anecdotes and explanations; however, I was thoroughly disappointed with his view of the flat world. Perhaps it is getting flatter for a few people in the developed world as well as some others in Bangalore and Shanghai- but other than that I was never convinced. Africa, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the other parts of India and China are hardly mentioned at all in this book. There is one sentence he admits that there are three billion in this world who are way behind and will have a difficult time catching up, but other than he doesn't really address those 3 billion people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the e-World!","review":"Friedman using metaphor of \\"flat world\\" to describe the continuing phase of globalization.

Friedman emphasized on the role of Internet technology that encourage the revolution that changed the way of business in the rest of the world.China and India have gotten space more bigger in this book than others since both countries was growing so fast. For instance, the biggest retail business Wal-Mart imported products amount of US$ 18 million from the China's supplier. Compared with total supplier for Wal-Mart which totally 6.000 companies, so that could be said China holds 80 percent of Wal-Mart \\"share-holders\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brief History","review":"Friedman is so fascinated with the term \\"flat\\" that it becomes his little buzz word that you hear way to often and in the strangest situations. Friedman has great insights into Islam and how India and other countries are reacting and going to react to progressing interconnectedness, and it may be that much of this is spurred by individuals, not governments, but the places where we can tweak (I doubt the tide can be radically altered much at all) its progress, how we can look after the value of distinctiveness, the environment, the stubborn lack of international consensus, whether stemming from our country or another, poverty, I don't know how deep are investigated"},{"rating":"1","title":"...and so is this book","review":"Though it has become an immensely popular book, Friedman's work is fairly shallow and simplistic. It is important to remember that this is a world analysis written by a journalist, not by a political economist or any type of economist or political scientist. His views are oversimplified and his support relies heavily on anecdote, making his 600-pager about 400 pages too long. We read it for a poli sci class and proceeded to tear it apart intellectually."},{"rating":"2","title":"Globilization & Flattening","review":"In my estimation Mr. Friedman did three things in this book. He interprets and represents the recent past; he projects the new future, and he attempts to give some answers to the problems which have arisen due to the flattening process. While I thought his book was quite informative, I did not agree with all his solutions.Being an educator, I was particularly interested in the chapter entitled \\"The Quiet Crisis,\\" which features a discussion of education in the US and our neglect of the fundamentals, and I am in strong agreement with him on that issue.Some of the information regarding US and international companies was quite eye opening, and I enjoyed the various anecdotal comments of the folks he interviewed.Who should read this book? Educators, businessmen, and certainly young people thinking about career choices. Things are changing, and Mr. Friedman's views will help younger folks sort out some of the better paths."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Lovely Book Fredman","review":"Like the other books written by Thomas fredman this is simple to read very informative and logical.

Thomas Friedman has a gift for making big concepts personal and relevant to our everyday lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"More poorly researched generalizing by Friedman","review":"Friedman somehow feels qualified to make broad generalizations about the 'flattening of the world' based upon a mere 60 hours of interviews. He bases the title of his book on a statement from an Indian CEO--hardly representative of the world population he superficially claims to represent. Several careful academic studies have challenged Friedman's ill-supported arguments.

Technology has had a leveling effect, and international connectivity has changed the way we do business. Hello? Even George W. Bush knows that, and he doesn't know much of anything.It's a dehumanizing book as well. And scant attention is paid to education. Increasingly, we live in a world like Friedman's, where no one really needs to KNOW anything. Why learn math when you've got a calculator? Why learn spelling when you've got a spellcheck? why learn History or Literature when all that matters is Business?I like books that point the way toward light, not those that take us further into the darkness. 30 minutes spent with Morris Berman's THE TWILIGHT OF AMERICAN CULTURE is worth more than 30 hours spent with this one.I can't think of a thing in this book that someone with a reasonable amount of common sense hasn't already figured out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good review of world globalization trends","review":"Easy reading, a lot of examples, interesting summary of business, technology and political reasons behind globalization and \\"flattening\\" of the world (as the author calls it).One of the last chapters discusses terrorism and its potential of slowing down or stopping globalization process.

If you are wondering about outsourcing, co-sourcing, in-sourcing, off-shoring, India, China and the WAL-MART effect; this book sorts it all out.

He comes off like the sort of creepy fast-talking know-it-all that you know you can't trust even when you don't know why. I hate to just hurl insults, but my honest impression is that he's basically a mind flatterer for readers (particularly American ones), a corporate apologist, and a CEO groupie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written; sophmoric","review":"Friedman, like another reviewer says, is good for 500 word essays but his journalist style breaks down after than into annoying pratter.And he does not compartmentalise the issues, rather he throws them all together, like a salad.A much better and scholarly book is Financial Times columnist Martin Wolff's book on globalization, which is not a cheerleader's book but nevertheless positive about globalization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello???","review":"Other authors have been predicting this for over 20 years.

Puhleeze.)Friedman wants to be Michael Lewis, but he lacks the focus, the intelligence or the wit. So he settles for being Forrest Gump, criss-crossing the globe in search of more filler for his book.Somewhere in here is material that would've made a good feature article for Wired. As it stands, it's about as enlightening as watching your parents sign up for their first AOL account. Anyone under the age of 40 will be bored to tears.

Sooner or later, I kept telling myself, Friedman will tell me something I don't already know. Alas, it never happened. This book consists of 469 pages of stuff you can read in newspapers, in magazines, or experience personally every day. Is there anyone out there who has not yet had an experience with an Indian call center? Is there anyone who is not aware that increasingly high tech jobs, and even management jobs, are being outsourced, and that the USA is falling behind in math, science and engineering education? There may be a good 100 page book somewhere in all those pages trying to get out, but it is so buried underneath the commonplace it is hard to find. It's not that this is a bad book.

But since this is George W. Bush's policy it was never discussed in the book.

Author Thomas Friedman literally covers the world for \`The New York Times', and his access to important local authorities, corporate executives, local \`Times' bureaus and researchers, the Internet and a tape recorder has enabled him to compile a huge amount of information. All of it buttresses his views about the important convergence of political and technological change. He offers interesting anecdotes about companies worldwide and intriguing conversations with friends, reporters and experts. But Friedman, well-spoken expert that he is, still needs an editor to tame his long chapters and repeated points. He conveys abundant knowledge, with incisive insights and interpretations, but skim where you must. With that caveat, we warmly recommend this wide-ranging treatment of technology's role in global business and politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friedman For President","review":"Friedman's view of the world situation is the most comprehensive I've ever read.

His insight is unparalleled -- I couldn't put the book down.Friedman descends into mortalness when his writing becomes largely PRESCRIPTIVE -- the last half of the book.

Of course, I was setting up the network on the weekend/at night, so DLink was easily the winner here. The Linksys router is less, but in my mind the 24/7 support is worth the extra money.I agree w/ the review from \\"An electronics fan from Honolulu, HI USA\\", who said that no cat-5 cable was included.

That 2nd one went belly-up the next day; same deal, but the off time varied from the earlier one's 3 minutes.

I also had a problem with configuring ports on my computer so when I asked the help desk and they gave me the runaround with no help at all. Very poor customer service by this company.

She is learning to read and this has been a great way for her to practice her letters and sounds. They have fun activities that she enjoys so much! This book begins with lower case letters and starts by introducing one letter at a time, then adds another to it after they practice it for a time. It does not go through the whole alphabet, just a portion of the letters, each subsequent book adds more to their learning. I have been vey impressed so far... And she doesn't fight me on it. That is always a good thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great series","review":"the explode the code series is fantastic and the A,B,C books are great warm ups for children just getting started reading and writing.

The activities are interesting enough to keep your child engaged too."},{"rating":"2","title":"FR350R","review":"I recently purchased the FR350R framing nail gun from Porter-Cable and have found the gun to perform wonderfully. My only complaint was how the reconditioned nail gun arrived with major scratches and no labels. I know this product was reconditioned, but it looked like it was used on a job site for many years performing heavy labor. I would have preferred to spend the extra money to have bought the new tool.

Overall a solid tool that has paid for itself with time savings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Nail Gun, second time around","review":"The first nailer I recieved didn't work properly, the driver wouldn't retract. I followed the instructions for oil, and used the proper nails but no luck. Amazon's return policy worked flawlessly. They sent me a replacement via FedEx 2nd day and I received a perfectly working nailer that looks as if it has never been used. The price was excellent and I was able to build 85 feet of fencing without a single problem.

I am an authority on Elvis because I am an original member of the Memphis Mafia and have been since 1961. I am one of the only members who actually lived with Elvis at Graceland.

I have recommended it to my sister-in-laws, who now also think it's the best thing to have! I did end up getting it, and it's even better than the one from 13 years ago!! It comes with a baby bear that you can actually insert the sound box into (from the mother bear) and use it when traveling.

The new Manheim Steamroller is the most diappointing CD I have purchased in a long, long time. If it sounds like the other Manheim Steamroller CDs, that's because it is the same music played with less finesse and recorded with less integrity than the originals. The story that is ungracefully imposed on the music is trite and poorly written. Olivia Newton John and Chip Davis read with a sappy tone that is a real turn off to kids of all ages. If you want good Manheim Christmas, stick with the first two CDs, this just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"re-hash of previous recordings","review":"if you have previous Mannheim recordings, don't bother with this one.--just a remix of previous work. the narration is not an worthy enhancement"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary and spooky","review":"This CD is more suited for Halloween than Christmas.

However, any true fan of Chip and the Steamroller knows that this CD is the soundtrack to a televised ice skating show that aired on NBC back in December of 1998 and will be airing again this December 2000 on NBC (It may even become a Christmas tradition). The music, for the most part, is from previous Christmas recordings, but it has certainly not lost it's magic! The story, narrated by Chip and Olivia Newton-John, is a bit unusual, but makes more sense when watching the ice skating performance. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because most of the music found here is on the other 5-star Christmas releases from Mannheim Steamroller. It's worth having if you're a Chip Davis fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Utter Waste of Money!","review":"I've always enjoyed Mannheim Steamroller's Christmas stuff, and so bought this when it first came out. Wish I hadn't! I like the Steamroller for its music, not constant talking and storybook nonsense. \\"Carol of the Bells\\" and \\"Greensleeves\\" were great, but they're featured on another CD. I found the melody to \\"Above the Northern Lights\\" somewhat intriguing, but had to listen to Olivia Newton-John talking, and the music was strictly background.

A much cheaper foam mat would give your child better cushioning against a fall, not to mention that a foam mat is not \\"spongy\\" and pillowy like this, definitely better for babies who are learning to crawl and walk.

She is a great American, now globally triumphant, and her writings deserve to be treated with far greater sensitivity, intelligence, and respect than is shown in this book, a book that reduces them to the level of cheap pulp fiction. So please don't waste your money. Buy her poems in a good edition such as those of R. W. Franklin or Thomas H. Johnson and read them. And if you would like to read about her life, read the excellent biography by R. B.

Nonetheless, despite its lightheartedness - no, BECAUSE of its lightheartedness - it manages to skewer everyone's foibles brilliantly. There are no strawmen here. The Muslims in town have quirks and flaws, as do the Christians, and they all share many of the same problems (gender wars, generation gaps, coping with one's own values, coping with someone else's values). In fact it's the fact that they have quirks and problems in common that shows us how much they share simply as people. We can identify with all of the characters, whatever their religion. Laughing at them or with them, we might discover that we are laughing at ourselves, too. And that's a good thing.For us American types, try accessing the CBC website and buy the DVD there, if you find that amazon.com is not carrying it. It's worth searching for, and sharing with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious show-- too bad you can only see by buying the DVD","review":"This is a great show-- a very funny portrait of small-town life with a Muslim flavor.

I enjoyed it thoroughly. It is a gentle comedy making fun of stereotypes of Muslims as well as both Muslims and non-Muslims. It could easily have become very heavy-handed, but managed to keep a light touch. It illuminates without preaching, and manages to foster a greater cross-cultural understanding, without forcing it on anyone.

I bought this CD because and ONLY because it is Snoop.

I got into town, disgusted that I wasted fifteen dollars on this. I got home and told my friend about the slopped together CD, and passed it on to him, begging him to take it. The next day he agrees with me - it was the worst CD he ever heard.All of these songs were previously unreleased because Snoop had taste and didn't want to disgust his fans be releasing them.

I know this is just kind of a thrown together album with some unreleased tracks, but Snoop should have put a stop to this CD coming out. It is so generic; it sounds just like all of his recent music. It is filled with the same weak funky old-school beats that he has used before. He just wants to put out something that sounds like every other hip-hop album coming out now. I hope he will make a comeback with the Last Meal album that is coming out soon, but I am not optomistic. If you are a fan of Snoop, stay away.

Well we will show the cd publishers someday, that we can do the same as men (but better).

It was downplayed in the public because Snoop did not WANT anyone to buy it, since it was from his Death Row years. Most of these songs are old though, and tight as hell. Hardly anybody has this CD, but it is way better than Tha Last Meal (which was released at almost the same exact time and made much more public because that is the CD that Snoop WANTED people to buy). Lots of controversy around this CD, but I am a huge Snoop fan and I think this is his third best. Too bad he didn't want anyone to get it, because I did, and I still love it.

Yeah, it's not the best tablet you can get, but for the price it's a great tablet for anyone who just wants a little more flexibility than just a mouse and keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product for the Price","review":"The product works like it should! Only gripe I have about it is that I have not been able to figure out how to adjust the sensitivity on the tablet. It is way too sensitive and I occasionally have to backtrack on my lineart in Photoshop because of a sudden \\"runaway\\" line. Otherwise, for the price that it is, it is pretty good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I bought this when the pen for my Bamboo Fun tablet pen broke, and it would have cost just as much to buy a new one. So far, so good. sometimes it has issues with sensitivity, pressure gauging, but I LOVE it so far. It doesn't have as many functions (no eraser) but it's a good, cheap solution for artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great For Drawing","review":"I needed a pen to use for drawing and so far this has been great! The pen is pressure sensitive so I can easily create artistic digital paintings on Paint Shop Pro (Jasc 8) and do some awesome drawings on Photo Shop (CS 5). I also use it for Toon Boom 5 animations it works well in my opinion. I did have some awkwardness with writing at first but I quickly learned. I wouldn't use the pen as an everyday mouse though, it comes with a mouse that works well. Overall I love the product and for the price it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pen is defective","review":"The pen that is necessary for the tablet to work is too small to use the included batteries. When you try to replace the pen exterior after installing the battery following the instructions (they just give pictures), the covering is so tight that the pen does not close all of the way. The pen never got recognized by the tablet. It started to get very hot and started to catch fire. Why would they design a device that does not accept the AAA battery that they provide?I do not see how it is possible that anyone could use this device with the pen that is included. My only theory is that the pen provided for the tablet the I received was incorrect. Either it needs a special (ultra thin AAA) or it is simply defective.I am very disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good information but details are missing","review":"This book is a great source of Black history. I have the 1996 edition, and noticed that Carter G. Woodson and details about the Black Wall Street in Oklahoma are missing.

Their chameleon-like, blank slate, track-by-track approach puts them something akin to the underground Ween, with subtler, though intact humor. But they over-try on so much of their material. This album is full of those kind of tracks- cool ideas that do not nearly effectively gel enough. Hearing a memorably unique standout track like \\"Daughter in the House of Fools\\", the disposable nature of most tracks is even more obvious."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzz","review":"The first few chapters are so confusing, that you're nearly giving up and relisting it on amazon. it does become more lucid afterwards, yet, i'm sure there are other books that are better without the dullness from the onset."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Live CD","review":"I usually don't care much for live CDs. After much hesitation, I recently purchased this CD. Man, am I glad I made that decision. This CD is fantastic!Both artists are in top form, sounding very energetic and they compliment each other very well. This set features both live solo performances as well as duets.Of particular interest to me was Roberta's reading of the late Gwen Guthrie's \\"God Don't Like Ugly\\". Her live performance of this song has always been more bouncy and vigorous than the version she originally recorded on the 'Roberta Flack Featuring Donny Hathaway' album.Bryson sounds as soulful and stunning as ever, putting in a superb performance on each and every song. Both he and Flack are consummate artists.If you dig either artist, this CD is absolutely essential for your collection. It is a pure delight from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great drum head","review":"I purched one of these drum heads when I bought a used Ludwig set several years ago. That set did not have a front head. I have played at home for my own practice and enjoyment, and later set up my drums to play in various chuches. I worked out of the country for a while, and the drums were put into storage for a total of about 6 years. When I got the set out of storage recently, tuned everthing back up and played my drums again, they sounded perfect!I have helped a couple of other churches get their drums in shape, and will likely be puting this base head on one of them also.They are worth the money!

I was glad that I could fine it on Amazon. If you are looking for music to chill with...I highly recommend this CD. I see that you can purchase both Vol. 1 and 2 together in one package as well. I plan on checking out more of his music too. Oh...some of the tracks contain ambient sounds of nature and it really is not distracting at all.

I expected more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a good concept","review":"I was NOT impressed with the album - it was no more than a collection of James Brown songs, but without the funk, without the creativity, and without the spirit.

This was a fun summer read. While saying this I also must explain to you that this book is not meant to be anything more than a summer adventure. As I look back to my summer adventures, though they are not as explosive as the African Safari our hero embarked on, are just a break from the routine life that I was accustomed to. Similarly with our hero who after returning from the trip will leave Africa behind and all his troubles. That is why this book must be read with that in mind. Our hero is 19 so of course he think his wisdom is worthy of contending against Solomon in his pride. His spirituality and philosophizing is not meant to blow the reader away in awe, but to be viewed condescendingly by the reader. Condescendingly as in, \\"Ah, yes. I remember being 19 and being that silly.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Psychology, Not Enough Q&A","review":"I thought this book would be filled with technical questions and answers to review before a technical interview. Was I ever wrong. Out of 6 parts (and part 6 is all appendices) the first four have no interview questions. They have to do with resume writing, networking, increasing your confidence, making a great first impression etc. etc. That leaves one part for technical questions and answers. Part 5 is what I thought I was paying for and consists of one chapter totaling just over 150 pages. Here's a sample question under the job category of Database Adminstrator: \\"What is a trigger? What is the most complex trigger you have written?\\" Answer: \\"A trigger is a common database element and you should be prepared to discuss how you've used this element in the past- for instance, to implement business rules. Try to be as specific as you can in your examples of the types of triggers you've created.\\" That's the whole Q&A on triggers.

I have season 1 and season 2 vol 1 on pressed DVDs Which play on all players even recorders and PC Drives. They will work 25 years from now but burned DVDs will not. The 2 star rating is because of the burned DVDs otherwise it would be 5, Simply because it completes season 2. But like I said, Vol 2 will not play in the future because of the dyes in DVD-Rs fading away over time. Another thing, They are single layer DVD-Rs meaning you lose 50% quality.

Salak takes you to places most people would never go in their life. Following the path of a British explorer, Salak paddled 600 miles of Niger River to Timbuktu. Along the way, she experienced kindness from strangers, hostile attack from tribes, voodoo fortune telling, hunger and sickness. This trip makes her realize one doesn't need much material things to lead a happy life. It's hard to imagine, in the other end of the globe, there are people living in very primitive lifestyle. Watching commercials on TV is considered a big event for the whole village.What is disturbing is that slavery and mutilation of female body parts are still practiced in some villages. Her account of the experience is so alive that I got goosebumps reading them.Definitely a great read for someone who wants to explore Niger river, but doesn't want to leave the comfort of his own chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plus ca change....","review":"Salak does a beautiful job of meshing her on-the-spot adventures with those of her mentor, Mungo Park. Although he died mysteriously on the journey after passing Timbuktu, the power of his experiences call to her out of the gap of 400 years through his writings. After reading this excellent travel account, I see that many things too often remain the same along the Niger: hatred by the Moor towards the non-Muslim to the point of physical torture and robbery, clitorodectomy for 90% of the women, slavery in Mali (where it is officially outlawed). Of course the Niger itself remains the same, too, and Salak has to contend with its gods the way Park did: they send unbearable heat, rain unlike any she has experienced, hunger....Because of her extraordinary sensitivity, the reader learns to absorb it all. Caroline Alexander's account of her retracing of Mary Kingsley's W. African journey in \\"One Dry Season\\" would be a good book to follow this account on one's bedside table."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good dose of hype","review":"This book was hyped hard by reviewers and jacket comments---(do they pay these guys or are they all with the same publisher or what?) as a SOLO first descent. I picked up the book at the library (fortunately), because I like to read about solo canoe/kayak travel.Come to find out, a few pages into the story--the author admits to being shadowed by a photographer!!I couldn't believe it. It felt like a betrayal. That's as far as I read. This is not a solo adventure book in the sense that it reflects the same perils and exposure, physically and psychologically--as the archtypical \\"solo\\" adventurer is exposed to. That aspect of experiencing the perils and paying the inexorable dues for errors and lack of judgement is what makes adventure real. This book does not reflect that philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky , the album's grooves are from New Orleans","review":"Discover the different sort of attitude from down South .The Doctor is here to help you....shake it .This sort of music is unlike any you've heard before , unless you've been exposed to Harry Connick Jr's piano as well .The music is varied and shows the Doctor's versatility as well as that of the great backing band , the Meters .Another great record for a party .This music is part of the heritage of America , as well as being extremely groovy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"missing words in the last chapter","review":"I enjoyed reading this book but there were several sentences that did not make sense in the last chapter.

Unfortunately, they're important ones which leave the reader hanging. I actually liked the book; at times, the dated style was distracting enough to prompt skimming forward, but it was interesting enough to keep me up late seeking the denouement, which, oops, is missing.

For those interested in Kierkegaard, it is worth noting that he provides a helpful comparison between SK and Richard Rorty on the issue of irony. As the title suggests, Prickett sees the world in terms of ironists and fundamentalists, and ends up placing SK in the former camp and Rorty in the latter. According to Prickett, Rorty is guilty of developing what he labels a \\"closed system\\" with \\"no external reality-check.\\" He therefore finds SK's approach of \\"mastered irony\\" far more helpful.

Great album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Varied, but the Highs are Very High","review":"It's natural for a compilation like this one to be a bit all over the map. So here there are highs and lows. But the highs make this well worth having.Yusuf's reworking of old material in several songs is interesting, but please know that this is Yusuf Islam covering Cat Stevens, not Cat Stevens himself. We all change and grow; please listen for the changed man.That said, my favorite cuts here are all new. Yusuf's modernizations of traditional material are always fresh and his recording of the Adhan, the call to prayer is simply haunting. But the song that stays with me most is \\"God is the Light,\\" which, to my ears, combines the tuneful beauty of old material with the humble spirituality of the new.Note: the booklet accompanying the CD is one of the nicest and most informative I've ever seen. It adds a whole new dimension to the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Cat Stevens CD","review":"I have every Cat Stevens/Yusuf CD and I am really disappointed with Footsteps in the Light.

Basically, this is the true story of Forrest and Jean Holly, both of whom are blind. They marry, and have four children. Forrest works to support his family and ends up with his own successful business and Jean (who was raised with live in servants) manages a household on a California ranch in the 1940s and 50's. Reading about the struggles that they faced and how determined they were to lead a \\"normal\\" life never feels \\"inspirational\\" or preachy, but gives the reader excellent insight into the Hollys' life. The story ends when the youngest child is about seven and the family moves to a larger city. I would really like to know what happened to the family after the move, and am hoping that a sequel or interview with the surviving family members may become available."},{"rating":"2","title":"You should read this!!! Five Stars!!!","review":"You often wonder how to act around a blind person. Well, read this and you will know. They compensate for the one thing they do not have - sight - by using every other sense they have to the utmost. Their ability to be just another person is spelled out in this book. I have absolute respect and admiration for this young couple and their families.Both of these people were blinded after some years of sight, so they know absolutely what they are missing. And while it may make their lives difficult, they overcome all kinds of odds to become just another couple with children. Not sure if I would have what it takes, but I certainly would hope so. After reading this, I know it is not impossible.This is a must read for everyone. You will not be disappointed.Jan I."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Love Sees","review":"What Love Sees puts in in the position of its story teller, and lets you live life through her \\"eyes\\". I actually found myself closing my eyes to \\"see\\" how I would cope being in my own world without vision. I couldn't help but wonder how life would have been if she would have married a sighted person. Would it be easier to have someone sighted help you along, or to have a partner who knew what it was like to be blind. I loved it that her children were typical children. Her challenges in that respect were like all of ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Precious Sight!","review":"Sight is one of those gifts a person takes for granted. I know I do, but after reading this book I don't think I ever will again. Jean loses her sight at the age of 12 and has so many things to overcome. Luckily for her, her parents didn't coddle her and made Jean do everything for herself that was possible. As the years go by she feels something is missing and after meeting Forest Holly, a man who also lost his sight, she knows that she needs to be married to him. This story takes in all the years from 1930 on through Jean and Forest's married life and all the challenges they face through lean years and the hardships of raising four children with little help. There were some hilarious parts, and some sad too.... This is truly a book that will make a person thankful for their sight and let you know that whatever adversities you may have to face, they can be overcome. A book I will recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"INDEPENDENCE","review":"I THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS GREAT AND VERY HEARTFELT IT SHOWS THAT EVEN IF TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE VISUALLY IMPAIRED THEY CAN STAND ON THEIR OWN.I WAS AMAZED HOW THEY RAISED FIVE CHILDREN .I HAVE A SEIZURE CONDITION SO I KNOW HOW IT IS TO BE LIMITED AND I STILL LIVE WITH MY MOTHER SO I CAN RELATE WITH HOW JEAN FELT WHEN HER FATHER KEPT TREATING HER LIKE A CHILD AND NOT LETTING HER TAKE A WALK INTO TOWN WITH HER SEEING EYE DOG OR WHEN SHE AND GORDON WANTED TO GET MARRIED."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about my grandmother and POP, it is wonderful.","review":"If you are looking for a true love story and true dedication in a marriage, this book is for you.

For the last 10 years, it's been my absolute favorite Christmas album, and every November I start getting the itch to listen to it.

Read and enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written - Where the Hell Were the Editors?","review":"I make no comment whatsoever on the content of this book, nor on its accuracy or its biases. My entire focus is on how someone could take a life as dramatic as Cromwell's and rob it of any excitement. I guess that is an accomplishment of sorts. This book is horribly written. It is like trying to read a legal document. The sentences are too long with multiple layers of phrases. It reminds me of trying to decipher a complex mathematical expression with six levels of parentheses. You spend most of your time trying to figure out what phrase modifies what. Where the hell are the editors when a book like this is submitted for publication? It should have been thrown back in Fraser's lap filled with red marks, most of which would say: break up into multiple sentences! Avoid this one. Unfortunately, I have yet to find a good book on Cromwell, and I certainly wish I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good prose not enough to overcome the tedium","review":"I wanted to recommend this work, but find I can't. The book is clearly directed at the English, with a supposition that places/names/dates are already part of the reader's cultural literacy. Without that grounding, this effort becomes a tedious read relying on someone spending inordinate time consulting outside resources.To her credit, Lady Fraser writes fine prose, and the level of detail would be engaging if it weren't for the issues I note above.Bottom line -- if you are from Britain and interesting in a deep dive, then this is probably a good buy. If you're from elsewhere, it would behoove you to do some pre-reading on English geography, English history between 1300 and 1700, and a healthy dose of ecclesiastical literature before tackling this. Otherwise, seek an overview if you want the 'high points' of Cromwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Epic","review":"I gave Cromwell, by Antoina Fraser, this rating because I was expecting this to be historical fiction. Although that disappointed me, I was not disappointed in the amazing detail that this book provides about Cromwell's life. This is a book of epic proportions in that respect and I would recommend it to any historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soldier but terrible political leader","review":"Growing up an Irish Catholic American, I grew up hating Oliver Cromwell without really knowing why (an influence of my Irish grandmother). Fraser's biography of this brilliant and driven soldier is thoroughly researched and surprisingly sympathetic. She gives a great insight into what drove this man as well as giving a broad look at the political, cultural, and religious influences behind the brutal English Civil War. Cromwell was a brilliant general whose strategic and tactical genious beat the King's trained forces. His genius, unfortunately, did not extend to the political sphere. This is a great account of a flawed individual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and boring, full of superficial details","review":"This book was so incredibly boring, that I was tempted to skip parts of it. Some of the other criticisms leveled are true such as the fact that she completely skips his childhood.She also is completely void of any humour or literary style in terms of presenting his life as an interesting story.Instead, you are bombed with such trivial details about things that you wouldn't even get quizzed on Jeopardy about.Avoid this book like SARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"****YAWN****","review":"This book is completely lifeless. This woman has no sense of humor, nor does she know how to tell a good story. There are also so many tedious details that will tend to put you in a comatose state.

Vanity Published (well almost, IT IS PUBLISHAMERICA afterall) garbage. Very disappointing. The Author is frighteningly well regarded as a ghost on guru and other sources. I realise now, that's he's popular because he's a cheap ghost option. I'm glad I researched first though.

The jokes are still as corny as ever, the music still as good as ever, and Junior's delivery still cracks me up.The sad thing is, Time-Life is the company putting out the DVD's. These DVDs are a poor value. One show is all that is provided.Also, Time-Life has obviously not seen fit to restore any of the footage. Colors bleed badly (which is extremely obvious on a show with loud sets, lighting, and clothing), and grain is everywhere.Should you buy this DVD, or the subsequent releases? Well, I doubt this show will ever be released as it should have been....in full season sets. So if you want to have copies of this classic, this is probably your only choice.

It brought back a lot of good memories and places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bang? - This album's worth the shot!","review":"Another album I picked up to hear more from Tommy Bolin, this one did not disappoint. Back in my high school metal days I would have hardly given this album more than an approving nod but now I am glad to be able to appreciate it. Overall, it's a good straightforward early 70s rock album, American style, with some very talented guitar work by Bolin. The style of playing familiar on Deep Purple's Come Taste the Band and Bolin's solo albums is noticeable here. Some guitarists are technical masters while others go for style. Bolin has the technical side down perfectly and adds flair with sound effects that give punch to the music without detracting from the song. Personal favourites of mine are Standing in the Rain and Ride the Wind. Bolin's Alexis is a great ballad in the true sense of the word where the song tells a story.If you're into finding good rock albums from the 70s and enjoy some great guitar solos then this album is worth picking up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't we all just get along?","review":"Let's get this out of the way first. The Walsh vs. Bolin arguments are \\"apples and oranges\\" all the way! Think of Jim Fox and Dale Peters (James Gang drummer and bassist) as the \\"Sly and Robbie\\" of 70's American rock. These were two solid musicians who were fortunate enough to hook up with two of the era's most gifted guitarist/songwriters; Joe Walsh and Tommy Bolin each brought thier own unique artistic sensibilities to the table. It is therefore unfair, and uninformed, to stack each \\"version\\" of the Gang against the other. That said, classic rock enthusiasts will find a feast of tasty music on this 1974 Tommy Bolin-led release.You won't find a weak cut on here, from the anthemic \\"Standing In The Rain\\", with its goosebump-inducing opening salvo of joyous \\"Baba O' Reilly\\" style chords, to the haunting closer \\"Mystery\\", this one holds you in thrall. Only complaint: the 1991 CD mastering is hissy and thin; hopefully we'll see an improved version soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rocks","review":"Rocks, rocks, rocks.

While it has its moments, it wears thin very quickly. It lacks the cohesiveness of the early works, and sounds like a series of also-ran pop singles. You may love it, I certainly don't dislike it. I just think it is a disappointing follow-up to the early works. (Note: maybe it's a contractual issue but I notice not one of the Bang tracks is on the 15 greatest hits CD)"},{"rating":"1","title":"second chance","review":"After growing up and returning to my musical roots, I have tasted the fruits of a number of branches I had never climbed before.

There are over six hours of music here but that's just quantity--a dubious basis for value--it is the quality of performances of Edward Wickham and the Clerks' Group that make this set so compeling. The Collection is made up of most of the Ockeghem the Clerks' have recorded--don't fret doubling up on some of the masses if you've already started collecting the single albums--those are worth getting for the fill-ups by Ockeghem's conteporaries.

Unfortunately we have some complaint with ours. One being that the clips do not hold a single piece of paper, we need to put the whole pad of paper in them. So we use tape to keep the paper on. Another would be the chalk board. I'm not sure why, but our is really hard to write on, so the kids don't use it.

I did have the same problem with the chalk not writing on the board, like the mom above, but I it was caused by crayons on the chalkboard (the wax keeps the crayons from writing).

Moody, mysterious songs, beautiful production, the sort of postmodern-exotic sound of a Luaka Bop release... it reminded me of many things, from Tom Waits to Chris Isaak to Brian Eno's 1970s pop albums.So I started asking my friends to find out who loaned it to me.

And even without such anevent as 9-11, the \\"America\\" track by Snowden seemslike a cheap shot, like somebody intentionally playingthe National Anthem off key, ha ha. The samewith \\"Lift Every Voice and Sing\\" an almost sacredanthem to African Americans, a point that must haveeacaped these record makers.

I played it so much that the record is now scratched but I still have it along with the cover. I never thought about checking to see if it had been made on a CD when I saw it on Target.com I had to have it and ordered it. I know that I will be getting hours of listening enjoyment as I did in the 1970's. I recomend Roberta Flack Chapter Two to anyone if you don't buy another Roberta Flack CD ever you must hear this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Terry Plumeri arco bass solo","review":"This album travels successfully into several musical rooms, with an array of great players.My favorite song on this album, is \\"Business Goes on as Usual,\\" a trio between voice, snare drum, and arco (bowed) double bass.This is a fine example of bassist Terry Plumeri's early sound. With time, work, and vision, this developed into his subsequent, ground-breaking playing style and ability.The introductory theme, \\"When Johnny Comes Marching Home\\" is hauntingly played by Plumeri, followed by double-stopped fifths in the bass, slightly wavering in pitch (for effect). Percussion is simple, but effective work on the snare drum. Ms. Flack's voice enriches the upper register, with power and nuance. The climax of the tune is a piercing, very vocal, arco double bass solo, coupled with Ms. Flack nearly shouting the lyrics.While all the songs on this album are lovely things, nothing represents the frailty of human life more aptly than \\"Business Goes on as Usual,\\" in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flack stole my trousers","review":"Hi when Flack made love with me long ago in 1988, she stole my pants. She dessapeared form the room and she had stolen my wallet, trousers, and slip.

Yeah, some of the songs are pretty strange and makes it evident why the second lp was not a double album but that was the essence of NAZZ. They were hit and miss. Who knows, without this band we may never have heard of Todd Rundgren. I must also mention that the liner notes are most interesting with many comments about the evolution of the group coming from Todd himself. For every fledgling musician that had a combo back in the late 60s this was a group that you could emulate and copy. You could play these songs at the roller rink and no one would give you any crap about performing \\"obscure\\" material. Everyone in the audience liked NAZZ even if they had no clue who they were."},{"rating":"2","title":"Before Todd there was Nazz.","review":"Before 'The ballad of ...', there was The Nazz. Over the course of 138 minutes, experience how a skinny weird looking kid from Philly came to be one of rock's greatest exponents of ... just about everything. The all singing, all dancing, all powerful Runt starts as just another guitar player, and in less time than it takes to listen to 'The Ikon' becomes who we have known and loved for the last 30 years. Everything you expect from Todd has it's beginnings here, the songs, the playing, the overblown ego-trips.

I tried these Cheddar Bunnies as I have enjoyed other products by Annie's, and have now found my all-time favorite snack cracker.From a nutritional standpoint, they are better than many competing products as they have no hydrogenated oils or artificial flavors, and are made from organic ingredients, including real Wisconsin cheddar cheese. The packaging does an excellent job of preserving freshness, the taste is natural and very refreshing for a snack food, and the price is comparable to other non-organic products.I am completely satisfied with these crackers: the are a good value, they compare favorably in the nutritional realm with competitors (although they really don't qualify as \\"health food,\\" of course,) they taste fantastic, and last but not least, they're fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains a Form of MSG","review":"The product labeling in my mind is a little deceptive considering these crackers contain a forum of MSG.

IN THE BEGINNING IT WAS GREAT. BUT ABOUT 2 WEEKS AFTER I BOUGHT IT I STARTED HAVING PROBLEMS. I HAVE THE SAME COMPLAINTS AS THE OTHERS. ITS EXTREMELY NOISY. IT DOESN'T HAVE THE SAME SUCTION ON BOTH SIDES. IT LOSES SUCTION WHILE PUMPING. THE BREAST CUPS LEAK BECAUSE OF THE LOSE OF SUCTION. THE MOTOR SOMETIMES SOUNDS LIKE ITS GOING TO QUIT. IN THE BEGINNING IT EMPTIED MY BREASTS AND I PUMPED A LOT OF MILK. BUT NOW IT'S NOT EMPTYING MY BREASTS. READ THE BAD REVIEWS!!!! I WONDER IF THE GOOD REVIEWS ARE FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THIS PUMP FOR A SHORT TIME AND HAVEN'T USED IT ENOUGH. SPEND THE MONEY AND GET A GOOD PUMP LIKE MEDELA OR AMEDA. YOU CAN ALWAYS SELL IT USED ON EBAY AND GET SOME OF YOUR MONEY BACK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it worth it?","review":"This is probably ok for very rare pumping, but not for much else. The cycling isn't enough to keep up a supply while working during the day for us. I have found the Avent hand pump much more effective, and much quiter. The Whittlestone Expresser has been even better- not as much harsh suction as the pumps and more suckling like my baby!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd read the reviews on this one before buying...","review":"This pump is quite painful to use. I'm away from my baby 4 evenings a week and have to pump. One side pumps harder than the other, and in order to get any milk out of the side that pumps less, you have to turn up the suction which almost makes me cry. It's also very loud. I was pumping in the lactation room at the hospital where I work, and another mom (armed with her Medela) commented that she heard the pump down the hall and wondered what the noise was. I hate using this thing. I wish I'd spent a little more money, done more research, and bought a Medela."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pump","review":"This pump works very well as many reviews have said, but unfortunately not for very long,mine keeps getting condensation in the air hose and shortly after it breaks, this is my third one, the only reason I still have it despite its unpredictability is Babies R Us took it back with the receipt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Breast Pump","review":"I have no other reference, but I have no major complains. I've used it everyday for 4 months now and have had a good experience. I express 7 ounces in 10 minutes. I read the other reviews stating that they express less milk than with Avent Isis and dont know what pump they are using but it certainly isn't this one.Major flaw: Sometimes the bottle snaps off in the middle of pumping.Overall great cost saving alternative, if compared to MEdela Pump in Style."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pump is Painful and Awkward!","review":"The suction is so hard it is painful and frustrating. I hated the thought of having to pump. I had an unexpected cesarean section which left my middle section swollen. Using the \\"bar attachment\\" they supply to allow you to use one hand was nearly impossible. I now have the Medela and LOVE IT! It is so much more comfortable and efficient.I do have to say that when I called the company to express my dissatisfaction they offered to refund my money, no questions asked. That is great customer service. I wished I would have read the reviews first before I registered for this pump. All I can say is spend the extra money and save yourself the pain and headache down the road. If you cant afford the Medela, rent it, it is worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"New mom","review":"This pump worked fine for 2 mo., then suddenly quick working from the wall plug. It still took the 4 D batteries (and drained them quickly) as a power supply for a while longer then died all together. I think the problem was condensation in the hose (as another reviewer complained), but the real flaw is in the design that would make it so easy to ruin the motor. BabiesRUs was wonderful to take mine back and I bought the medela equivalent. I have been absolutely sold on the medela line and would urge everyone to shell out the extra bucks for a quality pump that will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pump is horrible!!!! It is worth zero stars!!!","review":"After returning the first pump I went to use the second one and the motor broke. The manufacturer said they would send me a replacement. I said absolutely not and requested a refund. There I was engorged and in pain with a crying infant. Please spend the money on a Medela. It is not worth saving money if you are going to have to spend time and effort attempting to get your refund. Also, do what I didn't do: research!!!!! By the way, here I am 3 months later and still no refund yet. The First Years customer service stinks!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now I know why it was so much cheaper","review":"I totally agree with all the prior negative reviews. I had the same problems with unequal suction. The containers they provided to store the milk do not fit the lids properly and therefore the milk leaked. My pump quit working completely just after the 90 day warranty had past, so there went the $150 pump down the drain. The pump was so loud that I had to pump in another room with the door closed so I wouldn't wake the baby. I am very disappointed with the pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG MISTAKE","review":"This is the worst pump I have ever used. I have used 2 pumps before this one so I know how to use them. The suction really hurts and you can barely express any milk. Listen to these reviews when thinking about your purchase and don't waste your money. It is a lot better to save up and get the Medela pump. That works excellently. When I called the customer service they were rude and basically told me I was stuck with the pump because i recieved it as a present and didn't have the receipt. I will never buy anything from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!!","review":"Never, ever again!!!Reasons:1) It does not pump both sides with the same intensity. I purchased the double pump to save myself some time and ended up not being able to pump both sides at once.2) Bottles hardly ever remain in place while pumping.3) The pump is so noisy, it gives me headache every time I use it (the last thing a new mom needs!)This pump is going back to the store/manufacturer, as soon as the new one arrives from ANOTHER manufacturer.Good luck to all brave enough to purchase and use this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual Breast Feeder","review":"This item is amazing for women with twins or more, this dual electric feeder saves so much time and effort to breast feed it's controlable in speed which is the most important part of the product because as all women know we get sore breast due to heavy breast feeding. I greatly recommend this product! It's so discreet that you can take it anywhere it has a cooling storage for the milk. It's battery or electric operated and very convenient. The only problem with this it's abit heavy but alot of us know that nothing is easy. It's definitly worth the buying. Alot of the other products are asking for too much money and you can only do 1 bottle at a time but this dual one helps you double the bottle and lessen the time and effort, giving you more free time to handle your baby. I truly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Pump","review":"I don't really have anything to go by, but I think this pump is great. Once you get the hang of it, it doesn't hurt, it does a thorough job and it was a decent price. The only problem I have with it is that the arms sometimes move while I am pumping and I lose suction because the cup gets moved. The manufacturer should of had a locking mechanism for them. Otherwise it's a lot faster than doing it by hand!! That's for sure!I would buy this product again if I had to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am sorry that I Skimped!!","review":"Although this pump is half the price as its competitors, IT IS NOT WORTH IT. I am only getting 3-4oz for 20min of pumping. It is painful to use, the breast pieces leak, the bottles do not always stay attached and my suction cable broke at the base, and one side is stronger than the other. It has not helped me maintain my supply while away from my baby 40+ hours a week. Might be good for occasional use but not for someone who works full time outside of the home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money!!!","review":"My daughter had a hard time breast feeding so I bought this pump because I still wanted her on breastmilk and I heard that this one was less expensive then the others. I should have read the reviews on it first. After a month it lost almost all suction and it wouldn't pump any milk out. (...)I would not recommend this pump to anyone unless you want to waste you money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this pump!","review":"Well, I guess I should feel lucky because after readying the reviews, apparently I got more use out of this pump than other moms! It worked just fine for four months, then one side stopped working, now the whole pump has stopped working. I can't take it back to the store because it was purchased 7 months ago (I had it for three months before I started using it when I went back to work). And The First Years won't take it back because it's over the 90-day warranty. 90 days -- they only guarantee their products for three months!?!? I'm disgusted with the product and disgusted with the company's short warranty period."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"I had problems when my baby first came home.

At any time, a single paragraph could begin with a character's thoughts, jump right into exposition (which was usually not very useful to the story), and end with the thoughts of a DIFFERENT character. Where was the editor?!By the time it ended, I didn't really care how things turned out for anyone.I want my time spent reading this turkey back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NYC vs. Madagascar","review":"On one level, Sapphire Sea is a compellingly fast-paced tale of a rich man in a poor man's world. But there is much more going on in this novel. That Globalisation/Technology now permits a rapid reveral of power structures (a la 9/11) is now a truism. Unsurprisingly, 'literary' novelists have largely missed the boat on this one. This novel is not perfect and suffers from hurried editing, but its' central vision of a rich new yorker crouching in the shrub to evade a mob that would burn him alive is chillingly relavent in today's world. That the New Yorker may well deserve that fate makes the novel that much more intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This book succeeds on so many levels - a twisting plot, a wild and adventurous pace, the exploration of cultural dichotomies and the creation of rich tangible characters. I couldn't put this book down until I finished it, and when I did, the vivid cinematic quality and the depth of the characters continued to entertain my thoughts. This is just a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The intrigue of the exotic","review":"You keep reading the Sapphire Sea not just because of the compelling story line, but because from your own couch you have entered a world completely unknown to you, but created here with sensual intimacy.

But the content remains the cornerstone of a solidly constructed EE education. The style and organization provide an enviable model of clarity and purpose. The preface to the second edition, in which Van Valkenburg quoted A.F. Whitehead on the proper place of proof in education, outlines a philosophy of teaching which is -- if anything -- more and not less relevant today than then.

The author Turtledove shows a great knowledge of how people from history MIGHT have been if things went differntly. For instance, I notice that no-one here noticed Adolf Hitler's entrance to the series. Did they???? It was a little hard to spot, though I was looking for it. Always thought Anne Colleton might have been paid a visit by a 'German artist', but since Adolf couldn;t make a name of himeslef doing that BEFORE the Great War, he wouldn't be doing that now. So. Where is old Adolf??? Here's a hint, look at page 170 in the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Always Interesting!","review":"I love to read Alternative Histories, most especially anything dealing with the South and the Civil War. This installment in the American Empire Series continues the strong tradition that Turtledove has established. I found it to be one of the better books in this series and find the character development quite fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive and Boring","review":"I - like many other Turtledove fans - are reading the continuations in his various series strictly on the basis of completing what we started. He uses 500+ pages to barely advance the story. Where he does advance the story, it is entirely predictable. One chapter a character is in some situation, and in the next its 4 or 5 years later! He repeats character traits or sitations ad nauseum. If it wasn't for the fact that I picked this book up - and previous books in the series....Time to take a break Harry. Even Stephen King can see the writing on the wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good book","review":"This is a very good book overall, however it just seems to mirror our true history.i.e Freedom party(Nazi).

But 'Hey hey what can I do?' has been my favourite companion for a long time. The most part of Zep fans love this song, and if you do really want to test their fidelity, then ask them of 'Hey hey what can I do?'. Maybe, the Page's choice to exclude it from several collections and best of and from live song lists has made the fortune of this song. If you truly love Led Zeppelin you have to share this unforgotten treasure with us."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wanna tell you about the girl I love...\\"","review":"Before the day of hip-hop and techno remixes, material recorded for an LP, but was, for whatever reason, not used in the final cut was added to fill extra space on singles. For the b-side of “Immigrant Song,�?Led Zeppelin included “Hey Hey What Can I Do?�?an idle track recorded for Led Zeppelin III. The song became a classic in its own right and is still often played on classic radio stations. By popular demand, Atlantic has released the Immigrant Song single on CD, just as it was twenty years ago on vinyl. “Hey Hey What Can I Do?,�?otherwise available only on their expensive boxed set, is a track like no other in Led Zeppelin’s catalogue. Featuring some of Jimmy Page's finest picking, It is their only foray into barroom, country rock and it is swaggering and invigorating. Because of this track, the Immigrant Song single is surely a worthy purchase for serious Led Zeppelin fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential piece to the collection","review":"For an avid Led-Zeppelin collector such as myself, I would scoop up anything that bears the name Led-Zeppelin. This single is no different than the original vinyl 45 of \\"The Immigrant Song\\"/\\"Hey Hey What Can I Do\\", that was available in the USA. The 45, just a factoid, has \\"Do What Thou Wilt\\" in the trail off on side 1, and \\"Shall Be The Whole Of The Law\\" in the trail off on side 2. Of course, a reference to Page's so called paganist lifestyle. The only reason this didn't get 5 stars is because it's really nothing new. But it is a good piece for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"The cd came right on time in perfect condition.

The tempo is slow, and the ballad is beautiful as she describes her life as just fine, until she thinks back to the love that almost killed her in the past.The first track on the single is similar to the album version, except for a vocal improvisation that's been removed during the bridge, as well as a background vocal that's been removed as well.The two remixes are excellent, my favorite being the extended remix. The difference between the two is that the extended remix starts off with an instrumental, while the original remix starts the song immediately with her vocals.\\"Ven Conmigo (Solamente Tú) - Karaoke Version\\" is excellent because the only vocals that have been removed are the main vocals.

Mostly due to his seminal book, Prince. Yet the essays here reveal a more complicated person. He ardently believed in Italy, at a time when the peninsula was fragmented into a bevy of quarrelling kingdoms. One historian, Felix Gilbert, expounds on this at length.Another, Joseph Kraft, tries to disabuse the reader of any mistaken comparison of Machiavelli with modern scientists. He reminds us of excerpts where Machiavelli speaks of omens, the occult and spirits. So rather than a cold eyed realist, for which he is often held to be, Machiavelli is as superstitious as many of his time, in medieval Europe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy going, overly self-indulgent","review":"I expected to find this interesting, and didn't. Nancy Friday injects far, far too many of her own experiences and attitudes, and expects them to be the norm. She seems to believe that many of the \\"Good Girl Rules\\" still apply, citing the fact that most men still hope to marry virgins, etc. Riiiight, and most women would like to marry a millionaire. Ask the British Royal Family about the availability of virgin brides! Any mother of a teenaged boy can tell you, adolescent girls today are often avid, relentless pursuers, and sex with them is pretty much a given, not a mere possibility. Their mothers can be pushy and enthusiastic co-conspirators. There's no social penalty! The world has moved on, however much we may bemoan the fact. This book doesn't ring true for parents who find themselves in the trenches, or for people who know why the latest scandal has become a huge yawn to the general public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"For Nancy Friday fans, this book is perfect, because it is almost all about Nancy Friday. Her theories were interesting, I give anyone credit for having enough to say to write a 777 page book; however, most of her theories are not scientifically supported. Instead her theories are derived and supported from experiences from her unique past. Basically if you were looking for a book that talks about the importance of beauty in our society in terms of anthropology, science or even statistics, do not buy this book, as she concentrates mostly on her own experiences. I would like to sit and have lunch with her, she seems wonderful, but this book just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"DODG a pleasant suprise","review":"I bought the movie expecting a mediocre performance. What I ended up with was a great dance show from Colin and Jean. When it started, I half expected the show to be a cheap rip-off of Riverdance, but it's quite original in what it does. A tiny bit cheesy at times, but what dance show isn't? The beginning was a little bit of a Riverdance rip-off, but the rest made up for the beginning. The steps are intricate and compleltey original. DODG is a show to fall in love with over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars! An Irish Dancer's Review","review":"As an Irish Dancer myself who won first at the regional dance drama competition last year, I have been to numerous perfomances competitions and have seen nearly every Irish dance performance on video/DVD. To me what is so spectacular about this show is simply the choreography. The dancing is the highest of quality with world champion dancers. It is also extremely passionet with spectacular acting. The style is new and loose. The choreography has some new types of fun things like dancing while doing push ups and dancing in a pub like seen and much more. And last but not least the story is very interesting to watch. Just becuse the outfits and stage lighting aren't super glitsy and flashy like Lord of The Dance, doesn't mean that it isn't exciting. The dancing is absolutly perfected and more intricate than almost any show Irish show I've ever see. Oh yeah did I mention how good and unique the music style is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You've Got To Be Kidding","review":"After seeing Feet of Flames, LOTD and Riverdance, other shows are hard-pressed to even come close to the adrenalizing delivery of the aforementioned productions.One of the main characters in the show, an older gent, walks around the stage throughout the production which starts out as simply awkward because everyone around him is dancing and he's pretty much a statue. It eventually becomes flat out annoying because in a show full of Irish dancers, he does nothing but grimace and stand around.It's unfortunate the talents of Jean Butler and Colin Dunne came up with something as weak as DODG. You watch each number with disappointment hoping the next will turn things around but it never happens. The story had potential but this show becomes nothing more than soda without the fizz. No wonder it died financially and never reached the States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish Dance of the Future","review":"Wow! I am an adult Irish dancer who loved Riverdance and Lord of the Dance (except the a fake machismo of M Flatley). I am so impressed by this show because it is vastly different than those that have come before. Jean and Colin are brilliant as always; and are truly trying to push Irish dance to become an expressive dance form instead of just showcasing the actual steps and rhythmns like previous shows have done. They have expanded on the traditional aspects of the dance and gone into uncharted territory. The dancing itself is top tier, near perfect execution, but with much more feeling and passion than previously seen in ID shows. Top quality dancers, innovative steps and beautiful but simple costumes and sets~ as close to perfect as you can get. What a terrible shame that this show did not have a longer run. Jean and Colin are two gifted artists and their vision of where ID can go is truly modern. Not to be missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dickies fan, but not with these.","review":"My husband doesn't like faded colored jeans and all he wears are Dickies.

The guitar player Robbie Blunt throws great ideas into the fold with Moonlight In Samosa and Slow Dancer being great achievements. As for Robert he is as passionate as in any Led Zeppelin album and obviously excited by the new soundscapes and possibilities his new music offered him. His singing is still in forward motion true to the spirit of his previous band and to think this was recorded a little more than a year after John Bonham's death makes it even more special and puzzling. I can't help but imagine a great Led Zeppelin album that never was...

No, it;s better than Detroit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Continuation Of The Classic Led Zeppelin Sound And Style","review":"On PICTURES AT ELEVEN, Robert Plant's first solo album, he picks up where his former band's last one, IN THROUGH THE OUT DOOR, left off, showing that when drummer John Bonham died in an alcohol-related choking incident in 1980, a lot of work remained unfinished. This album successfully takes the classic Zeppelin sound and style to the next level, and what you get here is where Zeppelin might have gone had Bonham lived. As a result, this CD provides comfort to Zeppelin fans brooding over the demise of their favorite band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like He's Never Been Gone","review":"Buy this album if only for the song \\"Like I've Never Been Gone\\".

Touching the front of the clock would cause the lights to change brightness randomly without ever touching the buttons. I returned it for a replacement, and that one worked fine up until the bulb burned out in the lamp it was controlling, after that it would flicker similar to the other one, and wouldn't dim all the way. This is a great idea, and when they come out with one that works better I will buy one. Until then it looks like I'm out of luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please Use it WIth a Surge Preventer","review":"I have been using this for 3 or 4 years, and I really like it except for a few things. The cord is so bulky it's hard to make it sit flat on a table, and I wish the alarm volume was adjustable.The fatal error, though, is that when our power went out a month or so ago, the volume quit working. That was okay, because I seem to have trained myself to wake up with the light by itself. However, the power went out again last week and fried the display, so now it is unusable. I will replace this clock with another sunrise model, but I recommend plugging it in through a surge protector."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reliable","review":"I really enjoy this product when it works, but it is not reliable.

The examples are very basic with no \\"inside\\"-tricks or tips.I am pretty new to Catia so it's hard to judge what the difference is between unix-Catia4.1.6 and the current windows-Catia5.4 but if i look in the book and on the screen the book looks very outdated.This book reminded me of some books a read about autocad 9 or 10 years ago.

My CD was cracked but the models described in the book are so basic why would you want to use it? You can teach yourself with the CD help that ships with CATIA better than use this books.

We have a full sized (Ford) van with headrests that are part of the seat.

I just hope their new label is able to give this CD the promotion and distribution it so richly deserves. Not a weak cut on the record!

Certainly. I subtract two stars for trotting out the same old titles again and again and I subtract another star for just plain trying to pull the wool over my eyes and doing a bad job of it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mixed Bag","review":"This offer from Warner Brothers at the $500+ launch price only makes sense if you want to start a blu ray collection from scratch and desperately want all the names in the 50 film collection right now regardless of the price .Bear in mind that only half of the titles are must have names in any serious blu ray collection and these are highly ranked by AFI so the collection does have a value at the right price. You can buy the 25 worthy names now on Amazon for about $250 to $275 and save yourself some bucks or alternatively wait about a year when this box set collection will be selling for about $150 to $200 through Amazon UK. Just make sure the blu rays are region free. If you want this box set, patience will be rewarded otherwise I would pass. Just my recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like these movies, you likely already own most of them.","review":"Personally, this set contains 24 movies I hate or dislike, about 5 I already own, 2 I want, 7 more I like but wouldn't necessarily buy and the rest I don't care about.

I like this book because Wright shows that relationships have advantages as well as disadvantages, and if both people in the relationship focus is God, things can be worked out. At the end of the book there are so many questions you can ask about yourself and you mate as well. This is a great books for singles to read, so when they encounter a future relationship, they are ahead of the process and are not ruled by there emotions, God is leading the relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well!","review":"This timer works well and is easy to operate.

One day, a ghost from her past comes to her land and reminds her of the time before she ruled Faery. She returns to the Real World to seek more contact with that ghost.Mandy Z is a rich sponsor for artists--while secretly he is an artist himself. He's a carver of faery bone collecting these grisly tokens from kills.If that's not enough to whet your appetite, nothing will. \\"Autumn Castle\\" has some thrilling elements, but is not quite as fast paced as I would prefer. As a rule, though, a very satisfying and rich read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evocative","review":"I bought this book on a whim, and since have become addicted to Kim Wilkins' style, characterization, and worlds. The Autumn Castle is the fist in her new Europa suite, and is a wonderful tale of a young woman who is reunited with a long lost childhood friend. It is also about an eccentric artist's horrible desire to exterminate faries.It is a story about fear, about betrayal, about magic. Kim Wilkins created a fairy tale for grown ups (or eliminated all the kiddy elements of pre-existing ones).

There are so few brilliant scripts these days we must recycle old classics. In a world of infinite diversity, why do we do so? Are we faced with a world-wide writer's block? Or are we driven by marketing, hype, PC, and the lowest common denominator? True Grit, Survivors, the list drags on and we are dragged through another rewrite which shouldn't have been made... Indie is the only realm where bright ideas and challenging topics are presented.Unlike computers where garbage in = garbage out. Once again we see the BBC, Hollywood, et al manage classic in = garbage out.The original series was brilliant, but sagged when Terry Nation left to write and mount Blake's 7. Season one was astoundingly affecting, brilliant in presentation. Season two also had brilliance and was worthwhile. Even the lowest points in season three beat this rewritten tripe.

Will Not Support Garmin GPS.","review":"I bought one of these to mount my Garmin Nuvi 755T GPS. The item description and photograph for this item are not accurate. Firstly, the photo shows a ball-end mount where devices can be attached. The item came with a rectangular square plate and screws that you have to bolt onto the device being mounted. Secondly, the description states that it is \\"compatible with all Garmin(r) Nuvi(r)\\" devices. This is absolutely false. Maybe with the ball end as shown in the photo. Maybe. But definitely not with the screw-on mounting plate provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"I bought this product one month ago. When I plugged it into my lighter socket and connected the dongle to the GPS, the fuse blew. I bought more fuses and they all blew very quickly.

Despite being extremely careful with it, the exposed wire shown in photos started separating at it's insertion point and the device charging failed after only several weeks of use. This is just like cheap headphones that lose sound in one ear after a few weeks use because the thin audio cables start to break off of the ends at the ear buds.The end that plugs into the car's charging port also fell apart once while unplugging it, but I was able to reassemble it and use it again until that super-fragile electrical wire started to fail.You can consider it a disposable device.I won't buy another like this.

You need to pay close attention for location where the GPS will end up. Ask these questions first:1. Are there any obstacles , like shifting handle, coffee cup, etc?2. Is it in a location that is easy to view while driving?In addition, I used a Garmin cable which plugs directly into the multi-pin Garmin connector. I then tied/strapped everything together so it could be used as one unit. I wanted to be able to grab the unit and plug it in ready to use. (One unit = Socket adapter, Garmin GPS, and Garmin cable all strapped together).I gave it only four stars because if you do get on a road with a lot of bounce, the socket adapter can work its way out of the 12 volt vehicle socket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great option","review":"We always had problems with the windshield suction cup mount falling off, tried the \\"bean bag\\" on the dash and it would slide around. This makes for a great option for mounting the Garmin Nuvi - it puts it in an easy to see spot in both my wife's Focus and my Mustang. The only downside is it will come loose going down bumpy roads and in the Focus it will slip and turn in the holder at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prine's most intimate album","review":"After his self-titled debut album, Prine eschewed flashy production in favor of a more stripped-down sound for \\"Diamonds In the Rough\\". His \\"band\\" mostly consists of himself, his good friend and fellow singer/songwriter great Steve Goodman, and his brother (lending his talents on fiddle and dobro). More than any other album, listening to this one makes you feel like Prine and his intimates are sitting right next to you, talking to you, telling you stories.

Like.... oh pretty much everyone else in this movie.Then, at the very end, I'm not quite sure what happened. I had to rewind it and watch it one more time to see if maybe it'd make more sense if I saw it a second time. But no.Too many new songs, all a little flat or melodramatic. And none have the same brilliance that the original songs have. Too much weird stuff. Too many bad performances. The movie's too long, too.

THE WHO and Pete towndstead are AMAZING, but the direction was horrific. i honestly felt bad for jack nickolson oliver reed and any other cast member. Ken Russel butchered what could have been an amazing movie. i had to watch like 3 jewison film after seeing this to convince myself that film wasn't a curse on the earth. i wish tht this film could be remade with a director who actually knew what he was doingTHAT IS ALL"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst things I have ever seen.","review":"It's just not good.

Oliver Reed can't sing, Ann Margaret looks great but also can't sing, and so on to infinity. The big names here in can sing and have a presence on screen while the others slop their way around like some amateur night talent show. Be Warned - The origianl is better and this only serves to annoy and well you get the picture.The sets are overblown and very colorful but only serve to confuse as to whether this was intended to funny, sad or exactly what they were thinking.

Horrible acting, dumb story line, WOW! What else can I say. Unless you possess and use MASSIVE amounts of drugs and alcohol.... I would not recommend it. Not rated, but NOT for children or minors!

Roger Daltrey prances around with a blank look on his face, vaguely giving the impression he is either in a shampoo or tampon commercial. Ann-Margaret writhes on the floor with a giant sausage-shaped pillow, while covered in beans that spray out from a television set. Eric Clapton, appearing to be in a heroin-induced coma, portrays a singing preacher with all the charisma of a dead turtle. Elton John, Tina Turner, Oliver Reed, and even Jack Nicholson all attempt career suicide with their zany and misguided contributions to this catastrophe. To top it all off, the ludicrous premise of the album (vegetable-like pinball champion becomes messiah) is kept intact, while the great music has been replaced with the sort of noise the CIA would play to torture prisoners. Consider yourself warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Incredible Waste of Talent","review":"Director Ken Russell's godawful 1975 adaptation of the rock opera \\"Tommy\\" takes Bad Cinema to an entirely new level.

I have many fond memories of them singing that song live. The movie itself I enjoyed. It's colourful and keeps you interested. There's not a dull moment. For a 1973 movie, it's still pretty good today; Ann-Margaret is georgeous in it. I also liked \\"I'm Free\\" and of course \\"Pinball Wizzard\\". If I was a non-Who fan, I would give it 7/10.

However, I must protest the music and singing in this film. Jack Nicholson? Already, this has \\"disaster\\" written all over it. Plus, to take all of that great Who music and synthesize it, well...that's just wrong. The Who shouldn't be heard that way. And then there's the plot...well, there is no plot. It was insane. If they were trying to clear up any confusion over the album, they failed miserably. This was just too weird. But then, I like weird. I just don't like incoherence.

I did not like the people who played Tommy's parents, or rather his mother, played by Ann-Margaret, who was OK when she was younger, and his step-father, played by Oliver Reed (who has done some good stuff, but this wasn't it). Tina Turner, as the acid queen, was over-done, but at least we could understand the erotic nature of her role. But the iron maiden torture was absurd.It seems whoever wrote this nonsense had no respect for the music, or the musicians, but believed all acid trips are bummers.OK, Roger Daltrey was pretty sexy, and that may make it worthwhile for some; but find it on a bargain table, because it's not worth much.

It's fun to see the stars in different roles, Takes a shot on religion and the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remember the context","review":"One must remember the time frame (the era) in which a movie was made. In this case, there are technical flaws and moments where the color is a bit off. There is a dis-jointedness in directing that continues throughout the movie. However, that being said.....it is a great rock musical and of course, one cannot deny Elton John's wonderful Pinball Wizard. His shoes!! His shoes!! It is a clever and colorful rock musical/opera. I personally do not like Ann M's voice in this show, but aside from that subjective comment, EVERY ACTOR really gives it their all. You can see the commitment the actors give to this production."},{"rating":"2","title":"watchin dis now on vh1","review":"love the sequences featuring tina turner (the acid queen) and the eric clapton part. i am only familiar with the who's tommy album. always shied away from the soundtrack to this just because i am a who fan and the who didn't perform all of it but now after viewing the movie i might check out the soundtrack. this is a pretty trippy movie, msybe even campy in places. Reminiscent imo to Pink Floyd's 1979 masterpiece,The Wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"You had to be there.","review":"Being a child of the era, this was a hoot to watch! Elton John and Jack Nicholson never looked so good - and at the same time, haven't changed a bit! Very \\"period\\" piece. However, if you don't LOVE the WHO, you will find yourself in the middle of it, a)inexplicably needing to clean the entire house. b) worrying because you realize you really did do too many drugs in the 70's. Watch it for nostalgia, not for good film value."},{"rating":"1","title":"not meant to be watched sober","review":"this movie was, im sure, (althought i havnt tried myself... and wont) was made to be watched while under the infulence of... anything really..but watching it sober just makes the songs drive you flippin crazy (its quite repetative) and the story make no sense...in fact the subject matter is as bad as a clockwork orange so i definately do not reccomend this film for anyone under 18.

How does this resemble The Who in any way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Ok let me say that Daultry himself, Elton John, and Tina Turner did amazing jobs (that's why I gave this film 2 stars instead of one) but every other part of this movie was pure garbage. This movie bears little resemblance to the Who's amazing rock album or the equally amazing stage version. It's an ugly, psycodelic excuse for a movie. The sogs are rearranged and destroyed, the cast (except those mentoned above) are horrible and have little or no singing abiities. I'm all for artistic creativity, but so many of the visuals in this adapttion make no sense (expect maybe if you're smoking something you shouldn't be) Some adapttions are so bad they're funny and worth a view just for a laugh, but that's not the case here. If you're curious and have money to waste, go ahead and buy this video, but I would recommend you use your money for the original album by the Who or the Original Broadway Cast Recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"No voices like theirs","review":"This is a special treat if you dig Issac Hayes too, bcuz he wrote alot of their more popular stuff.

The horn riff on \\"Wrap it up\\" along with the vocal harmonies are alone worth the price of admission.

There are very few scenes about how a dot com is started. Instead, this movie is about the disfunctional lives of many of the people that work at a dot com called Hot-Tots.com. They want to take the company public, but they are declined due to Hot-Tots.com's poor financial results. In the end, they sell the business and all of the employees are angry. That's basically it."},{"rating":"1","title":"little new","review":"The story of Lady be Good is remarkable but when you buy this book you also realise that it is of limited scope. This book contains so much padding and speculation that it becomes annoying. Not well written and with poorly produced photographs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good synopsis but a horrible story","review":"When you read the synopsis of the story it sounds good but when it comes to the storytelling and introduction of characters they kind of just jump into it leaving you with no idea of who the characters are and why you should care about them. Which drags the story, another problem is not only do they not put enough into a character but they introduce another when many are left incomplete.(spoiler alert- they also kill a character off before giving us a complete sense of who he is and expects the audience to care). So yeah I'm giving it two stars, if you want to watch it just go online don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly great","review":"This air conditioner is great for small rooms. I hate that it doesn't have a remote control but its a small matter. The only thing that annoys me is the vent that is located on the top of the air conditioner outside. rain just pours right in and does leave, but if you turn on the air conditioner after it's been off during a rainstorm or shortly after, you get this.... watery.... trickily noise. It's rather loud. Once again, small matter. just turn the fan on before it starts raining alot and it's no problem. I think it has to do with water getting in and sitting there but if the fan is running it doesn't have a chance to sit.Good AC for the price. Just make sure you have some extra wood and old clothes to fit in the window because the unit is obviously small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price!","review":"I purchased this air conditioner for my son who lives in an apartment in NY - for his large bedroom.Ordered it around 6:30am Monday morning and it was delivered to him Tuesday evening (2 day delivery).He just turned 19 - put together whatever needed to be put together and popped it into the window.

The first unit had to be taken back to the store as it would never come on. The second unit I brought home as soon as you attempted to turn the unit on, the knobs cracked on the side. The unit would never get cold, just cool. I called customer service and it took them three months just to get me new knobs and the knobs they sent didn't fit this unit. Told them the unit doesn't work right and they told me that I could mail it in for repairs...well, what do I do for the three months it takes them to fix it? Really bad air conditioner, really bad service from the company.

During the summer nights my one bedroom turns into an oven. So I picked this AC up because i could not bare another Pittsburgh summer in misery. The price was right and free shipping was great. I am very satisfied. It's only 5,000 btu, but it works great. One review said it was noisy? I don't agree. My only concern is a design flaw. The drain holes are not located in the right place. So water builds up and the fan sprays on the outside window. It doesn't really affect the performace and it only seems to happen on humid days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware","review":"Although this product will function as advertised, be aware that when the compressor kicks in, it is REALLY noisy. Not just a simple buzzing, but rather a low, loud, hum that will actually travel through the walls to other rooms in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Dented","review":"I sent this air conditioner back because it was caved in on one side. Definitely did not happen in shipment as the box was intact. Had to go thru the trouble to return it. Amazon made the return easy but I still had to drive this thing to the Post office and place it on the counter! FUN! I would only buy an air conditioner from a store but I guess the same thing could have happened there. The box looks fine, then you get it home, cut the whole box open and find that it's caved in on one side!

This contains some great covers including Graham Parker's \\"Crawling From the Wreckage\\", Hank DeVito's \\"Queen of Hearts\\" ( I believe this version was the original and better than the hit version of Juice Newton's), and John Fogerty's \\"Almost Saturday Night\\". His originals are good too with his sterling and very distinctive guitar work. Not as thorough as the \\"Anthology\\" but pretty good. It's still a crime that his first American solo album with \\"I Hear You Knocking\\" on which he plays everthing has not been released on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girls talked, they said, \\" No\\"","review":"Name the first toe-dip into the '70's New Wave pool.Wrong! It was Dave Edmunds! with his slowed down hard hitting 1973 hit cover of \\"I Hear You Knocking\\". Not on this CD. Maybe his version of \\"Sabre Dance\\" not on this CD, either.The England Pub Rock of the early mid '70s scooted Dave into bunches of bands, most importantly a friendship with Nick Lowe a love of '50's American Rock and Roll and a desire to put in a contempory hurray!This Cd has what is probably the first example of a top 40 '70s New Wave hit, \\"Girl's Talk\\", written by Elvis Costello, produced by soon to be band member Nick Lowe.The rest of the CD is a nice reminder of LP fun, but hardly the example of Dave at his best. This CD is for only those who want a half smile not a full grin"},{"rating":"2","title":"dave Edmunds Review","review":"Never knew he had some of these great hits. Very good CD.

That hurts, people."},{"rating":"2","title":"High def Destruction","review":"This revamped Ganera trilogy was truly deserving of the blu-ray treatment. These films have finally earned the giant turtle a spot next to Godzilla. Each film looks better than the last with Revenge Of Iris being completely captivating. This was great buy. This set is worth for more than the $10 I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible localization","review":"The movies themselves are excellent, but the subtitling is perhaps the worst professional work I've seen, especially with the first and third films. In the first, none of the Japanese on screen text is translated, despite the movie using a large number of things like newspaper headlines to provide information. The third is the worst by far, with a good 20% of it not being subtitled at all, and quite of few of the subtitles being mistranslated. It's an absolute shame, since these are great movies that deserve much better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"So close, yet so far....","review":"I was really looking forward to this set the minute I saw it. The picture quality was awesome and the deleted scenes and behind-the-scene extras were a nice bonus. However, the fact that English subtitles drop 1 in 8 lines of dialogue is inexcusable. They didn't even re-dub the English version, simply reapplying the ADV dub. The only improvements I can find about this version is the picture quality and the box art..... It's a terrible shame because these films deserve so much more than this lack-luster treatment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying saber-toothed fire-breathing space turtle","review":"What's not to like. The CGI in the first movie was poor but come on, you're buying a Gamera movie, not a Hollywood blockbuster. I thought the plot was okay and generally well executed. Blue-ray makes it better than the UHF we had to watch it on in the old days. Be warned, this is not the campy, kid friendly Gamera of yore. This is darker, has some swearing and people die in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla level of fun","review":"If you like the Japanese Godzilla movies, then you know what to expect from these (Gojira was a serious movie... I'm speaking of the latter ones). It's cheesy and campy, but fun to watch. The special effects have gotten better. BD menu systems are not that great.

Don't miss this opportunity to acquire it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brief.

They are all innovative, creative, inspiring and incredibly beautiful. The different types of binding used in the projects are ingenius and unique. This is definiately one of the best book binding books on my shelf, and is great for people with a some experience. The instructions are set out in blocks of text, so beginners could easily get lost in them. Also, the layout of the pages and instructions are a little disorganised and cramped, but the calibre of the designs far outweigh the slight cons of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring book...","review":"I continue to be impressed with the caliber of books produced by Design Originals, and \\"Book Arts\\" is one of their finer efforts. I particularly like that the author, Mary Kaye Seckler, has included not only clear instructions, but templates. The photography is beautiful and her book art is inspiring. This book deserves a place in your reference library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted money","review":"This book is not the one that will teach you how to bind a book. It is more like a photo album of \\"artistic\\" book designs, but they are too artistic to be really used as a binding for a book you'd actually like to read.The designs presented can be used to create decorative book objects, that's if you manage to get how to do it, as the instructions are very scarce.I also have Hand Bookbinding: A Manual of Instruction (Paperback) by Aldren A.

The best songs on this album are the first 4 and the last one, but buying this album is the only way to get them in the U.S. If you like cheery, dancey pop, and speak french or are learning to, i would definietly reccomend buying this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good books for digital photo, but goob for adobe","review":"This books is more focus in how to edit your photos with adobe photoshop, that how to take a picture. the author do not cover the diferents techniques, nor he explain how to improve the shot with you camera or before you take the picture, basilly the books has 4 or 6 chapters on the difirent features in the camera and then goes on in how to edit the photos in you computer. not a good book if you want to improve you technique on taking pictures"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Oldie But Underrated Goodie","review":"I love Mott & have for years. This is sorta a catch-all recording, but it shows of the stuff they had beside \\"All the Young Dudes\\" about as well as anything they ever did, really. It's a remarkably solid record. I had the old vinyl LP years ago, and had practically forgotten about it when I got to poking around on the Intertubes and found it again. I'm glad I did. Mott's sound is something like what might've been if Bob Dylan was and Englishman fronting David Bowie's early 70s groups. Two of my favorite song titles are on this disc, too: \\"The Wheel of the Quivering Meat Conception\\" (pretty much a throw away vamp @ :26, and the nearly 5 min long \\"Death May Be Your Santa Claus.\\"). What can I say? Those phrases stick with you over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed my tank","review":"I have a 75gal mixed reef tank that was doing great as a bare bottom tank.

I am pagan and know hundreds of fellow pagan of which none of them wish to control this country or the right wing who ownes it. They wish to practice their religion with out persecution. Christianity has a long trail of intollerance and hatred toward all other religions but their own. Instead of pointing fingers at pagans they need to turn the finger on themsevles.

I am a pagan and I am a great person, I have friends of many religions, the majority of which are christian. This book was not researched or correct in any way. Pagans do not want to control anything except their own lives. Christianity has had more control over people and lives than any other religion in history. to any one who likes this book, read a little history. Christianity was the cause of most of the wars in the last 2000 years and has done some horrible deeds, like witch hunts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Jesus Mysteries","review":"The Jesus Mysteries is a much more accurate book than this one. This one seems to be inspired by fear. Christmas and Easter are basically pagan holdays, after all. Easter is a celebration of life's cycle of birth-death-rebirth, a spring rite common to most resurrection cults going back to Egypt's Osiris. In fact many historians now believe that the Christ figure is based on Osiris."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Book","review":"As a Christian, reading this kind of hateful bigotry makes me sick. The author should go back and re-read the passage in the Bible about loving others being the highest commandment Jesus gives. Note that the Bible doesn't say we should love all the straight white middle-class (or upper-class) Christians. It says to love everyone without exception, and that is exactly what true Christians do. Any Christian who doesn't love others just because they practice a different religion from him or her needs to pray to the Holy Spirit to fill their heart and show them Jesus' true path."},{"rating":"1","title":"religious tolerance","review":"Pagans don't want to take over the country, govt, world, etc. To pressure someone into a certain religion or to make accusations about people who follow a religious path that's different from your own - that to me is cult-like. I highly suggest you take a religious studies class at your local university if you want to learn about religions. This book, is at best, slanderous against all pagans and promotes intolerance. If you're a Christian, please take a religious studies course before you blindly follow someone else's claims that a certain religion is \\"bad\\" or \\"dangerous\\". That is what Jesus would want you to do if he was here."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fundamentalist/Right Wing Bigotry","review":"Well what can I say? Just more fodder for hatred in a world too full of it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerance & Ignorance","review":"For each person who read this book I'd like them to pick up a copy of Vivianne Crowley's, A Woman's Guide to the Earth Traditions. Unlike the text contained in this book,Crowley's examination of a host of spiritual paths promotes tolerance and understanding, not blind hatred.As she herself notes, killing, maiming or despising another human being simply because their concept of the Divine doesn't look quite the same as yours, is ludicrous!To dispute the religion of anotheris the mark of a narrow mindO Lord! O Magician!With whatsoever faith or feeling we call on Thee,Thou art pleasedI suggest you stop saving souls already and listen a little more clearly to what the Creator is trying to tell you.

However, nobody mentioned \\"Personal Manager\\"...turn out the lights, put on your headphones, and tell me \\"Personal Manager\\" isn't just about the pinnacle of American, electric, urban Blues. If you're trying to discover why some folks are fanatics about Blues (and where just about all popular music comes from) you can't start anywhere better than this.

So many good tunes here, like \\"The Hunter\\", \\"Born Under A Bad Sign\\", \\"Oh Pretty Woman\\", \\"Kansas City\\", etc. I wish Atlantic had reissued this with it's original Stax cover art, but that's a minor gripe.

I learned a lot about my favorite band and it wasn't at all boring. Great reading material, especially if you're a Radiohead fan.

This is the only one to own...it has Randy Newman wit + the Band's ideal of American music in an time forgotten and ..really , honestly never was.It's like Waltons TV show fake nostalgia written well for those who didn't live through it.Nevertheless!Fine songs and esp. sounds good in 5.1The separation of winds and bass is great on each speakerThe vocals remain centered and consistentThis is a fun 5.1 to own"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Classic","review":"I own this hybrid and I never grow tired of listening to it. On my vintage home stereo it sounds great, much better than expected. Listening to this you will find that Elton's talent, craftsmanship,musicianship and song writing is second to none-back in the early 70's and now. This is timeless music, quite relevent to this day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Of a Book","review":"It is more of a large pamphlet than a book. I was disappointed and felt misled by the title. Instead of a book about Jackie Wilson, it had 4 photos including the one on the cover and a few pages of biography, and the rest was the words and music to 27 Jackie Wilson songs. So if that's what you are looking for I would give it a higher rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but it's the same as Seven Wheels of Light","review":"I like this CD. However, having just discovered Joel Andrews, I purchased this CD as well as Seven Wheels of Light thinking they were two different CDs. The songs are all EXACTLY the same except with different names. There was nothing in the product description that indicated this and it was extremely disappointing to discover. I felt like I'd been duped. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable series debut","review":"Mary Ryan is a bitter pastry chef at an upscale restaurant when she finds the body of one of the kitchen workers stuffed in a laundry bag. Worried that her detective ex-husband will get the case, Mary's relieved to find the detective in charge is the ex's partner -- for a while. As Mary investigates the people involved, we are treated to the dirty secrets behind the scenes of a successful restaurant, from illegal workers all the way up to prima donna chefs and crooked managers. This is a good mystery and Mary is an interesting protagonist. I look forward to others in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, practical advice","review":"I've had the benefit and pleasure of being taught both individually and in team forum by Dave and Arky Ciancutti from the Learning Center in San Anselmo. Arky's book is a great compliment to the in-person sessions and an excellent standalone pice of work. Sound, practical advice on how to develop and sustain personal and business relationships. I won't go as far as to say this changed my life -- but that's not far from the truth. This is a very readable book, with checklists, advice, key points all presented very clearly. Read cover to cover or use as a reference when your technique needs brushing up. Arky clearly explains why things happen and why we do what we do. Armed with those data we're much better prepared to make a change for the better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Taharat HaMishpacha","review":"Dr. Zimmerman has done a fantastic job bridging a gap in knowledge about taharat hamishpacha (Jewish marital laws). This book does a great job of giving you a rundown of the basic principles and laws behind taharat hamishpacha. There is a lot of very practical information and just as importantly, this is not a sickly sweet propoganda piece touting the mystical nature of this mitzvah. Essentially, it is the modern woman's guide to taharat hamishpacha. Zimmerman offers solutions but encourages direct Rabbinic involvement if questions or problems emerge.There is great women's health information that other books ignore entirely. Zimmerman also provides information on contraception and infertility and how those can affect mikvah practices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Betty Joplin -- still great after all these years!","review":"I've known Betty Joplin's work for years and years, spent many a Friday evening with friends at a Lansing \\"Jazz & Blues\\" lounge called \\"The Garage\\" falling under her magic spell. Was thrilled to pieces when she won a Grammy for her work with Arthur Prysock, and was so happy when I found this CD. Betty's voice is as as powerful and clear as a bell (as always) and she performs with a heart as big as her voice!! Upbeat version of \\"What a Difference a Day Makes\\" is surprisingly great (didn't know it could ever get as good as Dinah Washington!) It's just fantastic to hear someone who knows their way around jazz and blues standards, as well as interpreting some of the new stuff. Thanks, Betty. Again, I'm under your spell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing old songs with upbeat arrangements","review":"I was drawn to this CD by the version of the old bill withers jewel- use me and the betty joplin arrangement and vocals. truly unique, and very catchy, as are many of the other songs on this cd.

All that needs to be said is that BEDlight for BlueEYES is going to make a huge mark with their Trustkill debut. Not only does The Dawn feature some of the best vocals to date, but melodies that will keep you listening over and over.From start to finish, this album captivates your senses and just mesmerizes you. Christian Guererro's voice is immaculate. To come across a singer with vocals that have immense range, is one in a million. When listening to the song \\"Nature Of The Ghost\\" the combination of Christian's voice intertwined with the instruments is immaculate. The melody would make your 80 year old grandma want to get up and dance and sing along.The Dawn will shock you, awe you, and make you scream for more. BEDlight for BlueEYES is what the music scene needed. You have amazing musicians that know how to create enticing melodies that will never bore you.

Nobody can touch Christian Guerrero's vocals. Its incrediable how good he sounds. I have been looking forward to this album ever since i heard they signed to trustkill. I was not dissapointed. The only thing i wish for is that there were more tracks on the album. Also they did put on the album there two demos \\"Leaving Berkeley Heights\\" and \\"The Promise\\" both of them excellent songs but i was hoping for some more new stuff.

Company claims this is the 'new replacement' and after days of emails, we finally were able to get this flimsy piece to light up. Our son doesn't use it but will sit under a table lamp instead. The tower piece is clumsy and hard to pull up and down and the light is minimal, at best.

The book is rife with non-sequitors, incomplete thoughts, and contradictions. It's a bit of a marvel, really. A good subtitle might be \\"How to get customers off the lot ASAP -- without making a sale.\\" So why two stars instead of one? Because some of the advice, carefully separated from the rest, is sound. However, if you don't already know quite a lot about what makes customers tick, I'm unsure how you'll separate the good bits from the bad. There are better articles all over the web for free, built on arguments that make sense and are internally consistent. They can't all be correct of course, except in the sense that we each learn a different way to sell effectively. But, if you try to follow Mr. Davis's advice, all of it, you'll be tongue-tied and tripping over your own feet.

It says the same things. Maybe there are a bunch of cliches' in the car business that people refer to as training. I think this is true, because almost every other book I read has the same useless information. I did find one book that is well worth the cost of all these other books combined (which is what I had to pay to find it) Try \\"Cars and People: How to Put The Two Together\\" if you want something that works, is clear and concise.

I not only have many notes and underlined/highlighted areas within the text itself, but also within the notes, especially those at the end of each book.

From reading this book you would think that the golf swing is more complicated than quantum mechanics, relativity and string theory combined, or that the editor and author were both manic and high on crack cocaine.

Thats why I said that the old italian or britishhammer horror filmswere much much better than the hollywood cheap modern scray tales. I said well the old british and italian horror films are much betterthan the modernhollywodd one, because the stories had a full classical literary meaning and the interpretation was absolutely excellent, which the modernHollywood scarryfilms are not interrested in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucked","review":"this was such a rip off of those old freddy movies.

In my opinion, the first one is the best, but I still like watching the others! This set also has the nightmare series encyclopedia, which is spectacular! I spent over 3 hours straight going through that disc. It's true that you don't have to solve the puzzles and explore the labrynth to see all the little video clips and interviews, but doesn't that ruin the fun!? I was really impressed with the effort put into that disc. I wish there was some more movie-specific stuff on the discs, but i suppose theatrical trailers and a few dvd-rom stuff here and there is ok when you have that encyclopedia. Well, if you collect movies like I do, or just love horror movies, you should defiantely pick this one up.

But these Nightmare/ FREDDY Series mean nothing to get the value of the classic horror literature like what the Hammer british horror films or Brava films had done in the past 40 years.

Of course there are some really bad installments included, such as part 2, but it's still fun to watch them in sequence. The video quality of this set is excellent, and I've enjoyed all the extras more than a couple of the films! The menus are well done, and believe it or not, the 8th disc has some of the best DVD extras I've seen so far. It features a documentary, and an interactive game in which you explore the elm street house, including the boiler room, collecting items and watching rare footage and interviews.

It only lasted for a few episodes, but I was really hoping to be able to see them again someday on DVD. One would think that a collection as thorough as this one would contain \\"Freddy's Nightmares\\" but sadly it doesn't.All in all, I would say this is a great buy for lovers of the \\"Nightmare\\" series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 80s Horror Icon","review":"Wes Craven's Nightmare on Elm St. is a classic horror franchise.

It won kudos from fans for its ground-breaking special effects as well as teenage fantasy sequences. This is an overall classic horror series.

This is a great collection and I hope more DVDs are done this well. Also, unlike \\"The Alien Legacy\\" box set, the 8th disc is not a \\"send-for\\" disc. It's included in the collection and includes alternate endings (you have to find one of them) for the first film. Very cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"My one star isn't for the movies themselves","review":"I wish they would re-release the 8 disc DVD set in Blu-ray format, or at least give each movie in the franchise it's own disc!

I had completed two years of alternative civilian service, and was living in an apartment in downtown Baltimore. I sported longer hair, tie-dye shirts, and was more of a folkie than a rock and roller. This album reflects that time well, yet has many songs that are just as great now.Graham Nash is one of my favorite songwriters, and this has many songs that I consider among his best. The electric guitar sound on the opening, title track is bare-bones but intriguing. From there, the tone turns country with Hey You (Looking at the Moon), even though the words are hardly the usual country fare. One of my particular favorites on this album is And So It Goes - to me it epitomizes the Graham Nash solo sound.This album will always take me back to a time when we had hope that things would be better and music was considered a key to that change."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album rightly loved by many","review":"Wild Tales / Graham Nash: This is neither a classic nor a masterpiece, but an album that many (including myself) have come to love and treasure.

However, I having recently purchased his 2nd solo cd \\"Wild Tales\\", I was literally blown away by the great, classic tracks on this masterpiece. Graham Nash doesn't have the super-genius of Neil Young, but he's essentially assembled Neil's \\"Harvest\\" band to create a wonderfully consistent and timeless piece of work. I would honestly say that virtually every song is a keeper on first listen (which is saying alot considering CSNY's sometimes spotty song selection).

We've all heard these songs before and we've probably downloaded all the \\"acoustic\\" versions of Stillborn that there is out there. Why not come out with some new material to re-energize the fanbase??I think BLS is a victim of their commercial success what with their merchandising and all that. It's practically a brand name and the BLS letters have more hype behind them than actual substance. As a die-hard fan, I feel that the last 5 or 6 years of BLS have been a letdown musically and we've been suckered into the image of BLS rather than what made us fans of them in the first place.

If you were blown away by the first one -- rightly! -- and are hoping this is more of the same, take your expectations down a couple of notches and enjoy the same basic sound deployed in the service of a much inferior set of songs. If you could pinpoint where Stills lost his genius, it's somewhere between Manassas and Down the Road. There are a couple of lovely songs in Spanish here, and this band had Latin-inflected chops to spare, but there's a wasted weariness to the whole affair, as if the band had spent too many nights in the hotel bar snorting the lint out of Joe Walsh's pockets.

I decided to give this one a try even though I skipped it years ago when it first came out having heard bad things and by that time I was a bit burned out on this type of music. I wish I had skipped it this time around. The entire project seems thrown together like as if Stills and the boys were forced under contract to put something, anything, down on on record. The lyrics are sophmoric, and the rest is beneath Stills to put out. Two tracks are worth hearing - Isn't It About Time and Pensamiento.

I had no idea that Maggie Fox was one of America's first mediums, as was her little sister Katy and that today's interst in mediums and spiritualism began in the 19th century. I'd recommend this book to anyone who likes stories about real women, as well as about the Victorian Era and its romances-- and of course, about mediums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the good progressive trance?","review":"With all the good progressive trance being released on mix albums, you'd think you could get similar enjoyment from a non-mixed album, like this one.

They're Brazilian symphonic power speed metal that sounds overly happy yet overly heavy at the same time. The music can be epic at times seen in \\"Choice Time\\" and \\"Judgement Day\\" while other times be something from Disney on a sugar high seen in \\"Let the Show Begin\\" and \\"Here Comes the Life\\". Cultural sounds can be found throughout the album, especially \\"Spirits of Light\\" with a crazy drum opening. Overall the album has a very different sound with its symphony and vocals from generic power metal bands and can make you quite happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"COSI FAN TUTTE Delight","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this vibrant and different interpretation of this Mozart opera.

I love Cecilia Bartoli, but I felt her voice didn't go together well with Nikiteanu's. Maybe it's because they are both mezzo sopranos, I don't know. Also, I didn't think Widmer and Sacca sang their parts well. Agnes Baltsa was excellent as Despina. I think Carlos Chausson did ok for his part, but I had a hard time getting past those devilish eyebrows. It was just weird to me how the Zurich opera house changed the story around. They made Don Alfonso a much darker character and the whole setting (a school) and the weird staging and everything just totally did not work for me. I had a very hard time getting into this production. Thankgoodness I got it from the library first. If you are looking for an excellent Cosi, I suggest the Gardiner version with Amanda Roocroft, Rose Mannion, Rodney Gilfry and Rainer Trost. It is the most beautiful Cosi I know of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mandatory reading for photographers","review":"You look at his life without knowing him, and you'd say he led a charmed, privileged life. Not so. He struggled like the rest of us, but did not let himself become callous, embittered, resentful, and all the other unproductive attitudes that people use as a crutch. He always dwelt on the positive aspects of life. I liked his social conscience. He photographed and wrote about Manzanar, and the plight of native Americans of Japanese ancestry. His Manzanar writings, for me, is one of the highlights in his autobiography. His many acquaintances and friends are fondly and personally recounted in ways that I've experienced from no other author. All throughout, you get a strong impression that he was a very scientifically-minded person who also excelled as an artist, and that's very rare even today. He poured himself out into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, dude, but:","review":"This one just didn't grip my nuts the right way. I know the author writes in an experimental, say-whatever-the-hell-comes-to-his-head-at-the-moment fashion...but I thought this one, having a small semblance of a plot, could've used it more. A serial killer would seem like an ideal topic for Rogers, but he doesn't use it. I'm wondering if it's not time for Rogers to focus less on himself and more on the writing. The 'experimental' aspects could use a refreshment. Still, his books are good for reading while taking dumps between classes. I'll hit you up when I read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Max Ernst and Mondo Macabre going hand in hand","review":"This is a new, strange and exciting book from author Jason Rogers.

Unfortunately, he knows virtually nothing about musicals, and so this book is full of errors of fact, misunderstandings, etc. He routinely gets song titles, plot points, and musical terms wrong throughout the book, and he doesn't seem to have any respect for musicals as an art form. On top of that, this guy thinks Meat Loaf wrote the score for \\"Rocky Horror\\" (Richard O'Brien did). He thinks \\"Hopelessly Devoted to You\\" is from the stage version of \\"Grease\\" (it's not). He confuses the lead character's name with the actor who played him in \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" and gets them both wrong (Mercurio is the ACTOR). That kind of thing is all over this book.There is some useful information here and there, but how can a reader trust that info when there are so many mistakes throughout the book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Recent History of Musicals and Hollywood","review":"I'm not so sure that the musical as a genre of movie ever really died. But like anything else in Hollywood they go through cycles. There will be a truly great, award winning, lots of money making movie; then the copycats will start making movies that are worse and worse until the idea goes around that this genre gets a bad reputation.But that's a nit. Mr. Muir has done a great job talking about musicals from the 1920's to now. About a quarter of the book is a general history to get us up to through the 1980's. The remainder is broken down into decades. From the 80's and into the early 90's musicals languished. Not a solid hit among the bunch. Then came 1996. Madonna did 'Evita.' Then came 'Chicago' with a bunch of Oscars. Finally the book ends in 2004 with 'The Phantom of the Opera.'The musical has changed over time and the book talks about these changes in a literate and understanding manner. Very interesting reading from a very knowledgable author."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF WILLIE'S GREATEST","review":"I grew up on this album as a kid.

Not to mention, you are most certainly going to get yourself hurt if you try to do what is described in this book.Even as a cardio-workout, you are going to tare your body up. Why? the exercises in this book do not match the proper footwork with the appropriate cuts. Also, this type of moment combined with the hyper extension of the body displaces your center of gravity and will unevenly load your joints. An Olympic gymnast may be able to do this workout, but that does not make it right, and especially not right for someone trying to get into shape.If you are a practitioner of the Japaneses sword and want a good laugh; then, by all means buy this book.

We know full well that after learning Ilaria's workout we will not be qualified to lock swords against the masters, just like we wouldn't expect the next Ultimate Fighting champion to come out of the ranks of Tae Bo practicioners. It's a FUN WORKOUT with additional benefits, which will be different for each practicioner. My wife and I want this workout to be something else that we can enjoy and have in common.

After reading it I realized that what this book has to offer is very little. As novel a concept as it appears to be, this book was a waste of money, time, and publishing. There is nothing offered by this book that is unique or even worthwhile.Perhaps the actual classes have more to offer, in person amongst other people, I'm sure it is more interesting.

As with Flies, the result isn't very attractive. Nocturne takes place on a new planet, colonized years ago by Earth. Family structures are no longer, and people's surnames are indicative of the school they attended. Each section of Nocturne has a governmental structure which is ultimately overseen by a higher council. Again, to me, it drew similarities to Lord of the Flies, except there are regions rather than individuals-- though the individuals certainly have their own agendas as well.The critical conflict occurs when there is an explosion that destroys a vital food storage bin. Was the explosion an accident or an act of deliberate cruelty and manipulation? You'll have to see for yourself in this gripping sci-fi novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geonosian War Rooms","review":"The Geonosian War Room is a must have for hard core star wars collector's.

The disc is quite generous (76:58) and includes the well known pieces Octet and Dumbarton Oaks, along with Ragtime, two Suites for Small Orchestra, and the Concerto in D for String Orchestra.While the music is recorded in monaural sound, the sound quality is clear and well balanced, and the disk is very pleasant to listen to. It's a wonderful disk for Stravinsky lovers and all music lovers in fact. I bought the CD specifically for Dumbarton Oaks but the disk overall is a delight! An unusual aspect (besides the music being conducted by the actual composer in this case) is the first track, which is an excerpt from a rehearsal recorded in 1954 where you can hear Stravinsky speaking with his players (in French)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Neat Book","review":"This book is great and covers a lot of neat formulas in math that have some cool real-world applications.

It makes no sense unless you already know what it's talking about. (Or maybe if you are brilliantly intuitive about math, but then you've probably seen these formulas already.)Entertainment-value-wise, it starts off amusingly at the beginning, but then quickly devolves into such passages as, \\"It is possible to show that the angles C1GC3, C1GC2, and so on are all equal and that their cosine is -1/3. This is because if B designates the point where the line C1G intersects the plane C2C3C4, then the distance GB equals one-third of C1G... the angle must be approximately 109 degrees 28 minutes.\\"Maybe fun to read as a refresher for math you have learned but long forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"This book series by NT Wright is great!

Hara, by rewriting IJN torpedo doctrine in the 30's, can honestly be said to have contributed more to the IJN's battle success than any other person.

The author portrayed the realistic response of a mother repeatedly asked for a pet, the gentle heart of an elderly man who just happens to be a very smart professor, and the caring of a son when his mother doesn't feel well. After both children read the book, they were excited to learn the back flap states there are to be subsequent books with the \\"invincible duo\\". We can't wait to buy them!

My biggest issue is the combination of the text and images.The layouts are messy, some illustrations are not on the same spread as the text they are meant to accompany. There are also pictures re-used in smaller versions...I guess to try and punch up the pages of just text. It would have been better to shorten the story, particularly the review of how the cat works, which we see as the professor creates the bionic cat, and again as he explains things to the boy he made it for.Also, the text and illustrations don't seem to have been created for the same age groups. The illustrations are fine for young kids, but the story is too wordy. Older kids could appreciate the story, but might be turned off by the 'cutsy' illustrations.It feels like a book created by people wanting to fill a niche, and for those wanting to read in that niche it serves it's purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"About a young boy who wants a cat but is allergic","review":"Boing-Boing The Bionic Cat is an endearing and unusual children's picturebook by Larry L.

Oppo doesn't have a whole lot of articulation, but he does have swivel shoulder joints and wrist joints. But more importantly, he has a flexible tail. The painting on the face could be a bit better, but it actually holds up pretty well after being a decade old. I do like the subtle shading in Oppo's hair and beard.

Buy it at your own risk, and be prepared to fast forward through huge chunks of the boring sections. If this is the kind of humor you're into, I'd recommend Jackass or even Tom Green.

Swinburne's arguments are characteristically erudite and will require considerable attention on the part of readers.Although this book may not acheive its intended success in the mass market, I consider it an excellent introduction to Swinburne's work. From that standpoint, \\"Is There a God?\\" may be used as a primer to his more substantial scholarly writings.In this present title, Swinburne's first (\\"God\\"), third (\\"The Simplicity of God\\") and sixth (\\"Why God Allows Evil\\") chapters are particularly noteworthy.

Where you live, that's where I'll live too.\\" & the two women say their goodbyes to their marriages & head south.Written in 70-year-old Naomi's voice, Bret Lott takes us into the grey, cold world of grief where numbness & despair dwell.

I also enjoyed the dialect that Naomi uses to express herself -- at least at first.That said, very little happened. I'm more in favor of character-driven versus plot-driven novels, but the character here wasn't strong enough to drive things and there was way too much repetition. Both the infidelity theme and the forgiveness theme were driven into the ground. A much better novella than novel.I also wonder if a woman who spent 60 years away from the South would still be so very, very Southern in her voice. I've lived away from my home for only 25 years and have lost much of my local accent. \\"Might could\\" and \\"fixing to,\\" \\"couple three\\" seem as if they might have dropped by the wayside after that long a time.

What a disappointment. I felt like the author was patronizing in his tone as he OVER explained everything, even down to the coffee cup stain in the sink??? Additionally, I was very disappointed at his liberty taken in the characters. Although fiction, if you introduce a book to follow a Bible story, you should try to retain the integrity of the story. This was not done. Arduous, boring, unnecessary writing. So sad too, because Ruth and Naomi is one of my favorite stories in the Bible.

And when 2 came out we went right out and got it. Unfortuanately I lost contact with that friend and haven't played MOO in years... and plan on buying it tomorrow. The game is great. It is like Heroes of Might and magic. A turn based strategy game where you take bases. But the bases are planetary systems and you get to control the people and make armadas. You even get to make your own races with special abilities and the ability to live in specific habitats better. It is defidently they best in it's class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Classic Game","review":"This game is an awesome game and very addictive.

Great time waster.","review":"Pick up this game if you can. The interface is way better than the first MOO, but this is understandable since that game came from the late 80S. Anyway do not play this game if you have a lot of work to do since you can easily spend anywhere from 3-4 hours building colonies and ships, waging war, and doing diplomacy. I would have liked this game more if there was more interactivity in building the colonies and ships other than just picking an item to build or just assembling a ship and then waiting for time and resources to be allocated so that the item can be built. Personally I would start with this game and then go out and pick up a copy of the original MOO ... both will provide lots of substantial playing time."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest games of all time...","review":"Masters of Orion II is a great game.

You are the leader of a civilization, and you control the moves and decisions of what to build where, and what civilizations you want to conquer. Sort of like starcraft, but in my opinion much more addictive. You found cities, and each town builds one thing at a time, whether it be a troop of soldiers, a city improvement, or a wonder of the world. The goal is either to wipe out all other civilizations, or be the first civilization to colonize the moon. Sometimes I decide to play this game for an hour, and end up playing it all day.

It does a good job of living up to this promise: you control an entire civilization, able to adjust almost every aspect of everything. One suggestion though: get some friends, its much more fun to have a LAN party and play this than to always be opposing the computer players (although they are suprisingly good and hard to beat). Also, I wouldn't suggest buying simply this \\"jewel case\\" version of the game, because unless you are already familiar with the controls and units, the manuals and posters will prove to be extremely helpful. Definitely worth the price: if you like simulations, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the bucks.","review":"When I played Civilization I, it started to wreck havok on my system stability, especially when running other programs -- even after a full reboot. I used this version of Civ II on my same computer, and I don't have any of those problems. If I play it straight for two or three hours, I have to do a reboot due to a need to refresh memory. In that sense, we need a revision on the programming level -- memory is not automatically refreshed.As far as the game is concerned, it is worth the money. The computer proves to be a challenging opponent (to me anyway, which is all that counts since I am the paying customer).The game gets 5 stars as far as playing the game goes, and it gets 4 stars in regards to the needs for programming streamlining.

Aside from the horrible 1996 graphics, there is dead boring game play on a buggy interface.You spend hours building cities that lack character and armies symbolized by one awful figure. Dragging your people around the map is a real challenge because you can only move them a tiny bit each turn, while getting them onto ships is even more frustrating due to the awkward tile design that governs movements on the map. Historical value is 0, as ancient Egyptians build cities named Melbourne and Helsinki and the American Empire begins with Abe Lincoln in 600 B.C.Do yourself a favor and grab a copy of Age of Kings or even better, Combat Mission--if you like WWII themes--and you won't be disappointed.

I think you can only use Terrorsaur and Airazor in the rescue missions. I guess I'll find out eventually! There are eight rescue missions in which you can rescue a lost Transformer (In other words one who died) by collecting a Rescue Mission token with a flying Transformer (such as Inferno) and you get to destroy the enemy ship and rescue the Transformer.

However, after owning the Timex T300b for about a month the tuner just died and would no longer tune to any other station than the one it was stuck on. This phenomenon occurred on both the AM and FM bands.Also the \\"waking to nature sounds\\" tape loops are way too short. They only last 5 seconds before repeating! Try waking up to the \\"Brook\\" tape loop. Every 5 seconds you have this really annoying bird chirping the exact same chirps over and over again!

That having been said, it could certainly do more to conform to Windows standards.The linguistic content is very primitive and of arguable value. You just learn words, which in itself can be useful. However, the choice of words is very questionable - I could think of many more useful words than 'raspberry'.The overall presentation, largely based on animations and games, is more suited for toddlers than for adult learners.

So this Blu-ray was a pleasant addition to my nature and wildlife collection. The narration is good. The documentary shows an interesting storyline for each of the seven animals. It was sad to see the mother hyena, trying to scavenge food for its cubs, killed by the dominant male lion for no reason. It was intriguing for me to watch & learn for the first time that a lion would track and kill another animal (a female hyena in this case) not for food but just out of spite. Also, I didn't know that buffaloes were capable of scaring away lions to protect their young. One learns how the leopard, which itself is a powerful predator, has to hide its pray out of reach of lions and hyenas. The picture quality and sound were good but not great considering that I have a full HDTV (1080p) with HDMI connections and blu-ray.

The first twelve tracks are from the original verion of the album (1994) and feature Buckener backed by pedal steel and violins. The bonus tracks are merely Buckner and his accoustic guitar. But because the instrumentation on the whole album is so spare, you hardly notice the difference.Overall, Buckner's musicianship is outstanding and his lyrics are compex and occasionally powerful. But his songwriting tends to suffer from a certain sameness after awhile. If he ever fixes this flaw in his music, he could potentially be another Bob Dylan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums I've ever heard","review":"Why isn't this album available everywhere?

Used it about 10 times with no complaints. Then we had the \\"Condensation Error\\" We put it away hoping it would \\"FIX\\" itself. I was wondering where the condensation came from since it was never outside. Long story short did not fix itself. Missed birthdays, Christmas, even 1rst steps! I read a few reviews and cleaned the sensor, and by golly it works again. We purchased another camera and is on standby in case it crapps out during Christmas this year. By the way..

It could never be used during humid days outside and not very good for recording a baseball game, and basketball games inside a gym. Not only that, after a little over a year it's broke and will cost $180 to fix and had to pay $30 to find out what is wrong and estimate to fix. The CCD IC Lens Assembly is screwed up.

I now have to send it to a repair centre at my own cost to have it fixed, if it can be at all. I like the camcorder itself, it's easy to use etc, but it's unreliable and I'm sorry I didn't pay more money for a more reliable model. It's put me off buying any more JVC products and I think I'll stick to the Sonys or Canons etc, in future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look before you leap.","review":"I purchased this camera 4 months ago. Only used it 3 times. The last time I tried to use the camera, I got an e04 error code. The camera told me to eject and reinstall the tape. The camera won't eject the tape.

Being the cost of camcorders came down so much we decided to buy something smaller, instead of paying $$ to get the old one fixed. The salemsan told me that you can't go wrong with a JVC! Yeah Right!!! We went to video my youngest son's first birthday party and we are getting a low light flashing icons, but there is no picture available on my LCD or through the viewfinder. I now have to go through the hassle of having this thing repaired, but after reading everyones comments, I am not sure it is worth having fixed to have something else go wrong with it. I am cursed by the camcorder demon! So my obvious recommendation would be to go with something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashed it to Smithereens!","review":"Got the condensation lock error and that was it.

Went out, found a rock, and smashed the hell out of this frustrating piece of crap! That made me feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Don't waste your money. I got this camera a while back and it's been nothing but problems. Camcorder was sent back to JVC 2 times for the same apparent problem. Both times they did repair the problem but after the second time i knew that i problem had a lemon.

I got half way through this book and then threw it away in frustration.Many American readers will find some problems with the 'Englishness' of this novel (proprietary names of products not available here, contemporary references, etc.)and no doubt others will enjoy it for just that reason.My main problem was that the 'color' was overdone: although there was an excess of detail about the village in which the story is set, and the people who inhabit it, this all came at the expense of any development of the characters. Barnaby is still rather a cardboard cut-out even at the end.The plot is weak, and the narrative is too slow.

Unfortunately all I found were distasteful characters and VERY innaccurate descriptions of bell ringing - which ended up having little relationship to the plot. The story bored me, and Sgt Troy is just disgusting. The lack of a satisfactory conclusion was sort of the last straw. I will not try any more Graham mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Show is Better","review":"I think this is the first time I've found a TV show to be better than the book. Firstly, Sergeant Troy is such an unpleasant character, but worse, doesn't seem to serve any useful role in the story, except perhaps as a counterpoint to Barnaby's good qualities. Secondly,it seems that the author's desire to produce an accurate picture of life in the English countryside has trumped the story -- or at least buried it for long stretches. After a while, I began to think that if I were living in a place like that I'd just kill myself right away.... and then, if the author showed me yet again how shallow life was there, that I should just stop reading then and there. The TV series can make that point with one short scene, and then move on. And the show deliberately and ironically places the action against some of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. If you're an Amazon Prime member you can stream Midsomer Murders for free -- and see whether or not you agree with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointment","review":"I was intrigued at first by this mystery, but found the solution -- or lack of one -- unsatisfying. I have read most of the other Barnaby and Troy mysteries, and am finding the character of Troy to be increasingly distasteful. Graham may think his mysogyny and homophobia is amusing in a cantankerous way, but it borders on the offensive. I'm not a member of the P.C. police, nor do I have an automatic disdain for tasteless humor, but I find nothing redeeming or entertaining about Troy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and surprising-a modern day mystery.","review":"The level-headed detective and awkward sergeant make the journey to the conclusion of the case entertaining.

My vocation as a Thealogian, and chief administrator of the Temple of Lylyth, has lead me to question the deeper spiritual, psychological, and political ramifications of Sadomasochism. This text has proved itself invaluable to me, time and time again. The essays are all very easily readable, and are a mixture of humor, political analysis, and deeply insightful psychology.

Each haiku points straight to the book, chapter and verse that inspired it, leading the reader back to the source. I hope the second edition contains an index of the verses cited, so the reader can see whether there is a haiku for a particular verse.The author's dedication to this project, writing over 1,000 haiku relating to the Bible, glorifies God and is a testament to perseverance and faith. Her work also presents an implicit challenge to those who appreciate haiku and are people of faith: what is the Bible saying to you that you can express in haiku?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soy sauce","review":"The soy sauce I received is wonderful.

Through his hatred for the communists and Lenin (no doubt Lenin was a ruthless man), he gives too many one-sided and biased accounts of Lenin. Perhaps Pipes should know that Lenin tried to please non-Russian nationalities of his empire programs such as Ukrainization, he even forgot communist ideology for one moment when he set up the New Economic Policy allowing his starving countrymen to sell their products and keep the money. The main thing Pipes is good for is history of Russia before the October Revolution where he is deprived of his prejudices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound Blaster card","review":"This card worked very well in my computer and was easy to install.

The Mama Mix of the title song is an extended version (there is a House mix of this song but this is not it) this version has a few weird and rather obnoxious edits and sound effects (including the tape rewinding) that the mix could have done without but some additional instrumental sections toward the end of the song are nice. The \\"Ooh I Like That Mix\\" is a weird version of this song with different music and with Janet singing \\"Ooh I Like That\\".

The readers are promised answers to many paranormal and conspiracy related questions, but what we get is a long-winded introduction that more or less ridicules those people who chose to believe some of the topics listed. Nothing is ever answered, topics are just listed matter of fact with no real depth to any one subject. The author calls these topics, \\"varying degrees of human greed, fear, and stupidity.\\" (Pg. 27)The author never takes a diffinitive stand on anything. There is a big market for paranormal books out there and it seems as though the author wanted to strike while the iron was hot, but not knowing what he believes in just chose to list things out instead of stick to anyone topic.Any real paranormal buff would not find this worth the time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Shipped Actual Item","review":"We ordered what is shown and received the Air Dog with the Squeaker which is not this item.

It is almost enough to make me wonder if the author even read the original books at all! Though it would take a true dragonlance fan like myself to spot such inconsistencies, I feel that this is one of the weaker books of the rather expansive series. Putting a rather dull spin on Sturm's character, the plot isn't exactly anything to brag about either. And while the summary of the book promises, (as do all other books about Sturm Brightblade), to once and for all solve the mystery about the fate of his father, I have yet to see a book that has, nor do I expect to see such a book in the near future. My advice: find a different book if this is one of your first Dragonlance books. (Sorry about the spelling)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid history in the tradition of the Dragonlance line","review":"Telling the story of Sturm Brightblade and his history was a diffcult task. After the Dragonlance Chronicles where written, one was left with many mysterys, one of which was Sturm's relationship with Gunther Uth Winston, and of Derek Crowngards extreme hatred of Sturm. This book anwsers those questions throughly and finitely. Written by Micheal Willams, the poet of the series, this book involves music, and devious ploting. This is where Sturm gets the seeds planted in his head that the Oath and the Measure are not all they are cracked up to be, although he fails to realize it at this point. The only thing lacking is a difinative timeline that only the true hardcore Dragonlance reader will mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic tale intwined with Dragonlance","review":"This book is an attempt to intertwine some Arthurian storylines into the Dragonlance mythos. Though not terrible, I was a bit upset by the lack of originality. The Dragonlance world has some very unique attributes and forces at work that make for interesting reads, this book, however, was quite low on my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fell asleep reading it 3 times","review":"I will admit it's got some great poetry but it just seemed the author wanted to take the challange in King Aurthur's court and put it into Dragonlance. It could of worked but it was so dragging and boring! It never moved and it had no excitment to it. I had to stop reading since it was a struggle just to continue reading it. I believe the author though, could write some outstanding poetry but should never write a book again unless Margret Weis is right over your shoulder writing it for you! This was the first and only book I could not read because it was so terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Addition to the Dragonlance Saga","review":"Michael Williams is the poet laureate of the Dragonlance saga. But that does not mean he can write a novel. There is a lot of fluff here as Williams brings in a good deal of Arthurian imagery to craft a dull story about Sturm Brightblade that goes nowhere and does nothing to add to the saga. Williams is a well read writer. Anyone who reads his notes in the annotated versions of the Chronicles and Legends can see that he knows Yeats and Rossetti very well. Williams should know that not every poet could transcend poetry (as anyone who ever read the plays John Keats wrote can attest!) and his rhetorical gifts can only go so far. There are some interesting ideas in \\"The Oath and the Measure\\" but this remains a weak entry in the Dragonlance books and should be avoided as much as possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not make me like Sturm any more","review":"This is by far the weakest Dragonlance I've read of the first 5 Meetings Sextet / Chronicles / Legends / Tales I trilogy. Sturm is not one of my favorite characters, and the fairly wandering plot combined with the lack of interesting characters leads to a very tiresome novel. Williams has a neat premise (someone who hates the Brightblades because of their lack of respect for the Oath and Measure) and incorporates his love of music into the novel. However, it never \\"clicks.\\" I never felt in the hands of a skilled storyteller and whisked away to another realm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great first computer game for kids","review":"Good news here - this game is truly fun and engaging for kids 3 and up.

Now that they're reduced, I'm getting more for next year's additional ornament purchases! Taking down the tree wasn't the chore it has been for 30 years, because I didn't have to wrap each ornament (we have hundreds and hundreds) separately. No fun at all, and consequently some years the tree didn't come down till February or even March. Embarrassing. These containers will make the tree easier and more fun to put up because I'll see at a glance all of them and can decide which one to hang where. It's true that really big and wide ornaments don't fit, but 90% of my ornaments did.

The selections are mostly his hits from early in his career. I would have preferred a better mix of his rocka-billy '50's with his contemporary country style of the '60's-'70's. If you love listening to his music, you'll love watching him play and sing his classics. If you are new to Jerry Lee's style, you will love taking a nostalgic trip back to the '50's and '60's with the 'Killer' himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"inferior production","review":"the sound and picture do not match in a number of places. I sent one back and got another and same thing, so it is a problem with the production. Also, the older Austin City Limits shows do not have the crispness that newer shows have.

As for the show, the Killer is very good and it is worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jerry Lee At His Best","review":"Of all the Austin City Limits shows this is one of the best. Rock and Roll Jerry Lee style. Fascinating to watch him turn the Big Bopper's hit into a flat out rock number. I have to mention Jerry's rendition of the gospel song: Come To The Garden.

I read them and pass them around. I was looking forward to this after reading such uplifting reviews. Thump! Down with a crash. I managed to get to the end of the book but it was a struggle. I really hope she goes back to writing about her Malamutes. I don't think I will bother to read another one if her \\"cat books\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"I have read and enoyed Ms. Conant's dog series for many years. So when i saw she had written a cat mystery, I had to give it a read. My main problem with this book is how unlikable the main character comes across. Felcity seems, and I believe is, a fake and very very self-centered. How can you feel any connection to a main character whose first thoughts upon finding a body is how it can work in her best interest.Please, Ms Conant, if you continue the cat series, help us like Felicity a little bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different voicd","review":"To anyone who has read and loved this author's dog mysteries, it is amazing how different the main character is from Holly Winter. It's an amazing gift to be able to create such a totally different voice for this new character."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Letdown","review":"I have read and thoroughly enjoyed all of the Holly Winter books, and was really looking forward to this new venture, especially as I have cats. I've almost finished it, and I can only reiterate what others have said. The protagonist is quite unlikeable--I haven't yet discovered one redeeming quality she possesses. She is self-centered and smug, and possesses no sense of humor.The worst thing, which clearly demonstrates her lack of intelligence, is that she writes books about cats and knows nothing about them. No cat lover, even in the fictional world, would buy books by an author who does absolutely no homework.I hate to make these comments because I have always enjoyed Ms. Conant's work, but this is quite substandard and a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to finish","review":"Thank goodness I got this at a used bookstore! Felicity, supposedly the \\"heroine\\" is the most self-centered, selfish character I have read in a book in a long time. She hated teaching, looks with disdain upon her writing club friends and, even though she writes cat mysteries, seems to hate cats! When a dead body is placed at her door all she can think of is how this will help her writing and promote book sales. That's just icky. A cat is left with the body. When Felicity takes it to the vet, all she worries about is that when the vet will find out the identity of the body before her and steal her thunder. Even ickier.I don't think I will even bother finishing, it doesn't look like it was successful enough to spawn a sequel... Don't bother with this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Those poor cats","review":"I just finished Scratch the Surface, my first Susan Conant book, and was very disappointed. Perhaps Ms. Conant is more familiar with dogs, since she certainly does not do well with the two cats featured in this book. I also found the writing to be childish and almost amateurish, more suited to children than to an adult audience. The plot was nicely convoluted, but the writing style could have definitely been more elevated. This is not a book I would recommend to cat mystery lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats not the same as malamutes","review":"While the book is well written, I am very used to Susan's dog mystery books, which I enjoy alot. I did not find the mystery writer an enjoyable or particularily sympathetic character. I did get some insight into an author's life, which was interesting, Susan Conant's love for dogs shines thru the Holly Winter series. But I didn't get the impression that she is a catlover.For part of the fun of an \\"animal\\" mystery is thinking, my pet does that, or I know a dog/cat like that. While the cats seemed like lovely cats, I wasn't drawn into their personalities. Wait for the second hand copy, if you really want to try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prine Tamed","review":"I am a huge Prine fan, but in my opinion this is one of the few poor albums he has made. Prine seems uninspired on all of the tracks here and there are few great songs on this album.

I have been able to get a whole year of listening out of his first three albums (the self titled, Diamonds in the Rough, and Sweet Revenge). But unlike his first three albums, which rewards you by repeated listening, the so-called \\"Common Sense\\" album just seems to repulse me more and more. I love John Prine's music, and will certainly continue to make my way through his canon...but this album is definitely not the caliber of his first three....it's no wonder I found it for $4.95 in a discount CD bin at a record store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set!","review":"We purchased this set for our 3-year old daughter and she loves it! Her play kitchen is one of her favorite toys and she is always \\"borrowing\\" my measuring spoons, bowls and cups - so I thought she would enjoy having her own.

The other items in the set are very good quality and I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poorly deigned clock radio","review":"On screen, this clock radio looked great - good price, 2 alarms, big display. After having using it though, it's the worst designed home electronic/appliance I've ever had. Where to start? How about the plethora of buttons on the front. 4 buttons on the right, and five on the side. Want to turn of the alarm, hit the bottommost of the five buttons, the tiny reset button. Try to do that when just waking up. The sides of the clock have dials and switches galore. Try to turn on the alarm from bed, while feeling through all the switches. On to the clock display. The indiglo display looks great...during the day, at night, it was virtually unreadable. Finally, the radio. The FM band had a low pitch hum, and the stations on both AM and FM drifted constantly. Using a product like this makes me have great appreciation for all the well designed products out there that we take for granted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't read the stinkin' display!","review":"I must start by saying that I never write product reviews. Seems like too much time to spend, even though I do read other reviews and purchase accordingly. When I saw that amazon carries this clock, I HAD to write!!This clock seems good, has dual alarms, date, etc. But I am looking for another clock because the display (it is adjustable) drives me nuts. I have to set it really bright to see it at night (my whole side of the bedroom glows, which my fiance and I aren't too thrilled about. So when I turn it down where the light doesn't qualify as a light source, I can't read it at night.A very frustrating clock, am in the market for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex: The one that keeps on ticking?","review":"Thank goodness this clock has been discontinued. What a piece of junk. While the unit is physically sturdy, the display is small and awfully hard to read. The display light is inefficient at letting you read the black digits.

I'm ready for a new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong fit","review":"I ordered these for my chevy suburban K1500, they came very promptly and I fitted them, bit tight but didn't think much of it being they were ceramic. Had a rubbing sound for ages that I put down to the new ceramics, turns out the metal shim parts of the pads were a lot deeper than the correct parts, they were rubbing on the rotors and created a deep groove in it which in turns meant they were jamming on it and not working correctly. Partly my fault for not realizing they were wrong and partly the seller's for not knowing. I had to replace both my rotors and pads for new due to the damage, expensive lesson to be learned and I have worked on cars all my life. Bought them June 13th and replaced them on August 6th so not a very good life span. But this is only due to the incorrect sizing, the pads themselves would probably have been good so cannot comment on that part."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the real thing","review":"My parents were Italian immigrants and while they were from a farming community about 75 miles south of Rome most of the recipes in this book are exactly what I remember being prepared by my mom, dad, aunts & uncles.

The music is a bit dreary and monotonous. Still I wasn't ready to give up on the cd just yet. After a few more listens, the music eventually began to grow on me. There is a dark, ambient influence, almost a more sinister sound especially on \\"Silent in Time\\". I wasn't really too fond of that particular track especially the vocals by Klive Humberstone. Sarah Jay Hawley who has worked with Massive Attack in the past contributes to a few tracks on the album. Her fragile vocals complements the sparse electronic melodies especially on \\"Tempered Wings\\". I really love her whispery vocals on the sumptuous orchestral track \\"Vantage\\". \\"Era\\" is a good cd but there is nothing here that I haven't already heard before in ambient music.

Boy, was I disappointed...the story was fragmented, full of characters that had no background provided for and what little we found out was too brief to understand their place in the story, we weren't given the opportunity to get to know the main character because she was so shallow and confused it was very hard to be sympathetic when she got into trouble. Her \\"relationship\\" with the cop was very weird and the sex scenes between them were anything but exciting. We didn't have anything but her narration to go by about their previous time spent together. I wish I could say something positive about the story, characters and the ending but I already wasted enough time just getting through the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable characters, predictable plot","review":"I tried to read this book, I really did, but after three weeks of reading a page or two and then completely losing interest, I finally gave up.

Ms. Naher makes up large scetions of the book about the Karmapa and his mother without a single word to tell the reader that it is all her imagination. The book is not a reliable resource of information about the Karmapa and contains numerous mistakes about the facts and the situations in which she finds herself. Ms. Naher's real subject is herself, her life and her travels.Further, the structure of the book is confusing with too many stories happening at once,and so there is no clear picture of any one of them. If one is interested in the Karmapa, there are several other books (in alphabetical order, by Mick Brown, Ken Holmes, Michele Martin, and Lea Terhune) that give a much truer picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Read for Potters","review":"Clary Illian has given the ceramics community an amazing gift by writing this book.

Doesn't work well with mouse. There is an arcade game, along with the 3D version, but the arcade version has a \\"slanted screen\\" look I disliked. Also, game goes through a long boring intro without the slightest clue on-screen or in the booklet how to skip past it.

Now its one of the only games I play. So happy to find it again that I bought two of them. Only problem is that you need to use the game's lowest resolution setting for maximum trackball movement in the arcade mode which, since I haven't been able to enable in Vista, means playing it with XP. Faster is better, of course. I don't play the adventure mode very much but it is also fun, regardless of resolution or OS. This is the original fun game for a trackball. Good graphics and 3D for old school video. It's also more fun than the official arcade version that I bought and cooler looking.

The eyeliner is perfect for me and every time I run out I buy a new bottle, but I got lucky and was able to find such a great deal through this seller. This is the BEST liner you can get if you have problems with \\"racoon eyes\\" or smearing. This eyeliner will not budge until you put some water and soap on it and gently rub it. It will stay on literally until the next morning if you fall asleep with it on. It's perfect for me because I don't have the eyelid crease. I have Asian eyes and use them to line the tops of my lids and they really open up my eyes, look great, and it stays on all day."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the effort","review":"I bought this eyeliner expecting great things, and was sorely disappointed. Application is difficult, mistakes are almost impossible to correct even if done immediately, and I can't soften the line (it *is* smudgeproof). If you are used to a brush-on-liquid-liner, have a very steady hand, and want a dramatic look, this might work for you. I prefer a softer line, so this didn't.Also, it almost completely flaked off over the course of the day.I'm giving it two stars because it really is smudge-proof, no sliding or transferring. I didn't have the dark shadows from smudging but I did have flakes, so I'm still not happy with it.This is definitely not worth the pricetag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really doesn't smudge, and comes of cleanly","review":"This eyeliner works as described. I would give it 5-stars except I'm not a big fan of liquid eyeliners that use a brush. It can be too hard to control the applicator, especially if you want to apply under the lower lashes. Since this is a brush on liquid eyeliner, it can't easily be smudged for a smoky look. Of course, the fact that it can't be smudged, once it is dried, is the whole point of this product. It can be cleaned up before it dries, but once it sets, it will stay there until you take it off. When you want to take it off, it comes off very easily, and cleanly, and really doesn't require anything but plain water to remove. I've found that very helpful when I travel. I also have sensitive eyes, but this product has not bothered me at all, probably because it doesn't flake or transfer into my eyes. If there was just some way to get this product in a \\"marker\\" style, and a few more colors, I would be in heaven, even with the high price."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to control","review":"I had trouble controlling the product. It took several tries before I got a nice even line. However, due to the heavy line, I ended up looking like a raccoon. It was hard not to get the product on the lashes, so it made the lashes stick together. As a result, when you need to apply mascarra,the lashes are 'stuck' together from the eye liner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard to use, not at all worth the price","review":"I am a makeup junkie and I love trying the latest products. I like Blinc's black mascara because it really stays on, even if it is kind of tough to apply if you're trying to avoid clumps or flakes. But I figured out how to do it correctly, so I was psyched to find out about another Blinc product.This is like using a ball-point pen to line your eyes. You cannot get a smooth line, it is impossible to get it close enough to thelash line to look flattering or natural, and there is no way to smudge it to fix either of those problems.I have no idea why anyone would recommend this eyeliner.

It is very dramatic and sharp looking. I have only had it about a month and I dont know how long it lasts. It is pricey but I like this eyeliner better then any other liquid eyeliners I have tried.

The other reviews are true that you can't blend it and must be careful where you apply it - think marker instead of chalk.However the issue I had is that is starts to come off during the day and looks blotchy.

It was very much over priced and was not worth the money. I expected a lot more from the book than what I received. It's only worth about $20.00. I would not have wasted my money if I had known what a small paperback it turned out to be. Not worth the asking price. It also appeared to be used.

So, imagine my surprise when I came across this CD and its wonderful reviews. I purchased it immediately and found that the music lacked depth. The cello notes were sustained and flat much like the proverbial kitty on a fence howling its love song to the full moon. The arrangements were one dimensional and unimaginative. However, the poetry and photography included with the CD was quite enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete and Inadequate","review":"First the good: Kaiser is obviously quite knowledgeable, and is not a mere Bible thumper in my opinion, as some of the reviewers seem to think.The bad: This work should be MUCH longer to adequately deal with the material. I am left with many questions. Second, it is clumsily written. Third, I have no objection to the very conservative viewpoint, but I do not think that he ably argues that position at every turn--though he does much of the time. Lastly, some passages are incorrectly referenced. I agree with the reader who thought this work read like a rush job.Dr. Kasier should return to the data and literature, and re-write this work from the ground up, doublling its length."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shallow piece of historical pseudoscience","review":"The bible fundamentalists should choose someone else thanMr Kaiser Jr. to defend the idea of the litteral interpretation of the Bible. Mr Kaiser's reasonings are infantile and do very little to support his extremely conservative view. For instance the primacy he claims for textual material (the Bible) over acheological finding ignores the fact that archeology gives information on what happened at the time it happened whereas the biblible is an oral and then written tradition whose earliest exponents are at least one thousand years later than the events they describe.Mi suggestion is not to buy this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"An okay Alarm Clock","review":"I had such great expectations for the alarm clock when I purchased it over a year ago. First of all it works fine. It sits nice and compact on my nightstand. However, it has too many little problems to make it worth the hassle.The alarm clock has too many batteries to keep up with; one for the analog and one for digital clock and the nature sounds can be heard bleeding through when the radio is playing. Its just slight but its annoying to me.Its not worth the hassle or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Inormative!","review":"This book gave you so much insight into the spiritual experience of both ATR's (African Traditional Religions) and even the Black Church.

It describes three routes through the city, each covering different sections. We were easily able to identify each stop described in the book, and to identify important artifacts from the photographs in the book. The book also provides concise historical information for each artifact - it was easy to read a little interesting background information about the artifact and then move on to the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nearly Wordless Story Book","review":"This book was highly recommended in Teaching Reading in the 21st Century for use in kindegarten and first grade classrooms.

I could not sit still through all three cd's. If you are a PVD fan, this is an absolute MUST HAVE! As a review said, and I whole heartedly agree. \\"Trance Nation, this is our king! \\""},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"Years back, I read Merle's first biography, \\"Sing Me Back Home\\". This was very in-depth and interesting; which I found this book totally opposite of. There are parts of this book which you know are Merle's words, and others, which are clearly Tom Carter's. There, it's an inconsistency.Merle chooses to delete certain information which he reveals in his first biography, so therefore, it really isn't a secret. Also, some of the language used in this book is deplorable. The point can be well made with those words omitted.Overall, I prefer his first book. While that one only extended to a certain point of his life, it was better-written and held the reader's interest much better. This book should've been written the same way, and picked-up where the other one left off. Instead, it rehashes old facts which we already know."},{"rating":"2","title":"My version of the man \\"The Hag\\"","review":"Honest,raw,direct,entertaining.

We didn't set it up for over a year. When I set it up nothing would be printed on the paper. Called Cannon and it was beyond the warranty period. Got this cartridge cause it was dirt cheap. I then checked the reviews of this model and the reviews were terrible, just as I am stating. Very strange as I have other Canon products that have lasted for years. This cartridge printed, but 5 months later with very little use (40 pages) the prints are terrible. A new toner cartridge is more then half the printer, so it's getting tossed. A large Canon printer/scanner another person is using has been running fine for 3 years. This copier is just a bad product/design. Sorry I didn't open it earlier during the warranty and have them send a different model.

But this is the album you should go to for Swing-era standards like \\"Blue Champaign,\\" \\"Tuxedo Junction,\\" \\"Java Jive\\" and \\"Candy.\\" The MT also take on some gospel-flavor with \\"Operator.\\" There is some bop-flavor with \\"That Cat is High\\" and some doo-wop with \\"Boy From New York City,\\" and ballads like \\"Gloria.\\" My wife is often amazed that I know lyrics to songs that pre-date me.

But now, I think 2 stars is pretty generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Analog clock stopped working","review":"It worked great for about a month, then the analog clock stopped working.I love the design though and the alarm was very nice. It started out soft and got progressively louder until you woke.I'm pretty sure mine was just a fluke, but who knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for awhile","review":"When I bought this clock I loved it, the clocks lite-up, with adjustable brightness, the alarms (I chose bells) were great, I loved the fade-up alarm feature. But first the face clock stopped then the light went out, then the snooze feature works intermittently (my wife loves this when it goes of ten minutes after I've left the building). Now the alarm just doesn't work dependably enough to use it at all. I was just looking for a new alarm clock when I saw this and decided to write a review. I may have just got a lemon. My last alarm clock lasted for almost eight years, so I don't think I abuse my alarms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended for deaf people","review":"I bought this because I like analog clocks, and this was the only clock radio I could find with an analog clock.

It has some nice features, if you don't mind futzing around with learning the controls on yet another electronic device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful product","review":"Do not purchase this radio. Quality control is awful. The radio sounds like it has tix boxes for speakers with awful eardrum piercing feedback when played above a whisper.

I originally gave a good review before the analog went out on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I think the nature sounds are sad. The loop of the bird calls is about two seconds long. If you like to listen to the same shrill whistle fine. The fidelity is really bad. The ocean waves, I think it is ocean waves, are more like static waves. Like a transformer is about to blow. Not very restful, although you can use it to wake up to. The radio, as someone mentionned, is something you'd get as a toy in a fast food promotion about fifteen years ago. The body of the thing has buttons everywhere. So it is not that easy to figure out what you have to do to have a simple alarm. The package came from Amazon as a pre used product and two of the three batteries were gone and the one that was in the box was still in the machine and had been drained. This ranks up there as the worse purchase I have made on Amazon. On the bright side, the design does look cool with the clock illuminated very nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, not functional.","review":"My husband hated this clock!

I would like to know where it was between those 9 days!Other than the lightyear it took to arrive, I really like my clock.

I had a Sony FP30 Picture Station and decided to replace it when the feeder become worn down. I bought the PictureMate Pal (PM 200) unit based on the positive reviews I have seen for it, the price, and the high-speed at which the unit can print.It usually starts out okay, but inevitably the quality degrades as it prints. I usually have to stop it once or twice and clean the heads or align the nozzles - wasting precious ink and paper in the process.I continue to lose photos because the quality gradually degrades, and by the time it is noticeable, I often find myself going back to reprint 15 or 20 prints.I have a MAC, and the Photo Impression utility is not user friendly at all. When the printer is interrupted, instead of resuming it starts over resulting in wasted prints.I would recommend staying away from this unit -I'm kicking myself for purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great photo printer for the price","review":"This is a great printer.

It just printed it's last photo.The quality of the photos was great when I could get it to work. Almost every time I used it, I had to do multiple self-cleanings, which need to be initiated over and over for about 20 minutes. At $35 a print pack and only printing ~30 photos each, it is an expensive print at about $1 a print. I won't buy a printer that doesn't sell ink separately from the paper again. Even wasting as much paper as I did on the self cleaning, I still have a few hundred sheets left over because the ink always ran out long before the paper did.If you're willing to spend $1/print and replace in two years, you might be happy with this.

Think of the Eagles and \\"Hotel California\\", or \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\" by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. For Jean-Luc Ponty, \\"Civilized Evil\\" is that album. Which means, of course, that if you buy only one JLP album, this is the one you should get.Ponty illustrates both his mastery of the Jazz Violin (Now there's something you don't see every day!), and every aspect of his techno-funk fusion style on this CD. And his style is varied, ranging from the hautingly beautiful and orchestral \\"Forms of Life\\" to the pure driving fusion of \\"Peace Crusaders\\" to the retro progressive Jazz sound of \\"Happy Robots\\".Buy this CD now, and, like me, you'll be listening to it with as much happiness 20 years later (My God, has it been THAT LONG!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jean-Luc Ponty is by far the best jazz violinist today!!!","review":"I have 3 tapes by Jean and anyone who is a true lover of jazz must add these to their collection. When I first heard this tape, I'd never heard a violinist play with such a unique style as Jean plays. I was so overwhelmed by his talent that I immediately began looking for more of his music.

Yet, if you enoyed the music, I can assure you that you will love the soundtrack. It's true not all songs from the film are included on the CD, but the postmodern and pastiche interpretation of some very familiar songs is really astonishing and very refreshing. Ewan MeGregor is fabulous, his voice is truely touching. My favoirtes are 'El tango de Roxanne' and 'Hindi Sad Diamonds'. A great and innovative soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't spend the seventeen dollars","review":"I bought this on a whim, having seen a lot of previews for the movie. boy, is it laughable-literally, some of the songs (namely rhythm of the night, roxanne, elephant love medley, hindi sad diamonds) are cheesy and awful beyond belief. The voices of Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor are tolerable, although their tracks are definitely over-produced to attempt to cover up their inadequacies.No one buys a soundtrack expecting a classic, and after getting past the really bad tracks named above, some of the rest is pleasant and even, occasionally, fun. Just overall, mediocre."},{"rating":"2","title":"41/2 to be exact.","review":"First let me start off by saying that \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is the best movie out right now. I loved it. That said, I really enjoyed the soundtrack. My favorites are all the songs that Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman sang. The rest kind of bites. This CD has the best love songs I have ever heard. Never have I expected to hear 80-90's music blended together to make beautiful melodies. This is on the top 5 of my fav. CD list. First go see the movie, then as the tears continue to fall out of your eyes go....and buy the soundtrack. You wil not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run...Don't walk...Away from this CD","review":"I bought this CD in hopes of a decent musical romp...instead I was audibly assaulted by a rather hokey collection of so-called songs. From Nicole Kidman's awful rendition of \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\" to the laughable hodgepodge called \\"The Elephant Love Medley\\", the \\"Moulin Rouge\\" soundtrack is one hysterical musical! How can one not laugh at the tango version of \\"Roxanne\\"? The only saving grace is \\"Lady Marmalade\\". Don't get me wrong, I love musicals and cheese...but not when it's done this bad. Give me \\"Rocky Horror\\" any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"this CD is absolutely fantastic! it has lots of different songs in it that will suit anyone's taste. if there is one song on there you don't like, there are bound to be at least three to take it's place! great CD everyone who likes music needs to have it to have a complete collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my!","review":"I bought this CD 5 days ago and have played nothing else since. I've even been out and bought a load of AA batteries so that I can listen to it on my discman at night. Ewan McGregor is stunning as is Nicole.

The songs on this are very good. I can listen to this CD through and through and still love it. Unlike some of the other CDs out their, with 'filler' songs (by filler I mean unpopular songs you've never heard of before), this one has alot of songs, every one o them is magnificent, to say the least. As for the movie, you either loved or hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing the best","review":"I also was blown away by the film. The song segues throughout the film were breathtakingly brilliant. It's a shame that whoever built this album did not think it could stand on its own, hopefully it will be released as intended. The break between I'll Fly away, and Christian's response is unforgivable. How can a film have such heartstopping musical momentum, and not allow it on the CD? For a good example of hearing the movie through the music, check out the soundtrack for GIGI. It has the words before the songs, they're in the right order, and sung by the principals, just like this soundtrack should have been."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"First off - DON'T buy this CD unless you see the movie. You won't appreciate it as it should be appreciated. I thought it was a fabulous film and the love story was breathtaking. The music - incredible. Especially love #6,10 & 11 because they take me back to those magical moments in the film that give me hope for a love like that. I love this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All or Nothing?","review":"I can hear them now...\\"Why do we make you buy the whole album instead of the one or two songs you like? BECAUSE WE CAN!!!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what expected","review":"Most of the music on the soundtrack must be music used during the credits or opening or something - it was not the more popular music within the movie itself, which is what I was hoping for."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for music lovers.","review":"I absolutely love this album. I even think Ewan McGregor's version of \\"My Song\\" is better than Elton John's! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it does not have all of the songs from the movie. As another reviewer said, they should come out with a \\"More Moulin Rouge\\" so they can put the other great songs and mixes from the movie that were left off. (Such as Zidler's rap-mix with Lady M., all the versions of Come What May and John Leguizamo's Nature Boy.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"1st wary, then impressed","review":"I initially got the CD for Lady Marmalade. At the time that was the only song I liked on the CD. I finally saw the movie yesterday, and listened to the whole CD last night. Now I love it. Seeing the movie puts visuals and understanding to the songs. I especially love Hindu Sad Diamonds...a wonderful beat and mix of music. It is a refreshing CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a few things are missing...","review":"This is a really good soundtrack, but it lacks something. Lots of songs from the movie are not on this CD. \\"The Show Must Go On\\" is missing, as well as \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"Spectacular, Spectacular\\", and the remix with Nirvana's \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"/\\"You Can, Can Can!\\"/and Harry Zidler's song. I have heard of the Moulin Rouge 2 CD that is coming out, so they may be on that one. I hope so...This CD is entertaining,though. I like \\"Nature Boy\\", \\"You're Song\\", \\"Elephant Love Medley\\", \\"Come What May\\", and a few others. \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\" is good, also, as well as \\"Diamond Dogs\\". If you get this CD, you'll enjoy it, and you shouldn't be too disappointed in it.Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love it!","review":"I bought the soundtrack after seeing the movie for the second time (and definetely not my last). 'Moulin Rouge' might as well be the best movie I've ever seen. It's like this emotional roller coaster that takes you from laughing to crying in a heartbeat. Listening to the soundtrack is kind of like reliving the story. My favorites are the beautiful Elephant Love Medley and the powerful Tango De Roxanne. Also Your Song and Come What May are the greatest love songs in the world. I was surprised by how well the actors (Ewan, Nicole, and the others) could sing. They make it feel so real. *sigh*In other words, if you've enjoyed the movie, you'll enjoy the soundtrack as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular, Spectacular!!!!","review":"My husband bought me this soundtrack because he was sick of me watching the dvd over and over again for the songs! It is a great soundtrack!!!The first cd has all of the main songs of the movie, including \\"Lady Marmalade\\". The second cd is a great compilation of songs heard mainly in the background or at the end credits.If you liked the movie like I did, buy this soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that's crazily smoooth...","review":"This is a great thing to buy if you liked the MR movie because it has almost every song you could want. Almost - there's a few songs (such as Kylie Minogue's appearance) that are omitted and I'd much rather have had them than the instrumentals provided on the second CD or the Lady Marmalade remix (I do like that song, but you can hear it too many times.) Practically every song on this though is enjoyable and there's a nice range of different types of music. Overall it's a rich and exciting selection and getting two CDs is a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skips","review":"This CD skips a lot, luckily not on the song I really like.I haven't listen to the whole CD yet but the first song wont play at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Half these songs are not in the Movie.....","review":"I love the Film, More than anything I have ever seen, this is a Musical theatre film!! (BRILLIANT beyond words) (I have seen it 3 times) but alot of the songs on this CD are not in the movie, and alot the songs in the Movie are not on the CD. What UP?? Lady Marmalaude is not even in the movie except for the mix during \\"Because we CAn CAn Can!\\" So, When can those of us who ADORE this film get more soundtracks? I want the real Deal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular, Spectacular!","review":"My friend told me he'd heard the soundtrack was just a bunch of covers of sappy old love songs.It's so much MORE than that! It's an amazing assortment of lyrics, taken from songs of all genres and eras put together in an ingenious conglomoration, making for a soundtrack that crosses all kinds of musical boundaries. Ewan McGregor (Christian) and Nicole Kidman (Satine) sing their characters' songs, and they have incredible hidden talent that would never have been discovered, had it not been for producer/director Baz Luhrman's perfectionistic vision. The nightclub, however hand-me-down in name, leaves room for an anything goes attitude, influenced and encouraged by the Bohemian themes of the movie's plot and characters. All around, it's a wonderful display of talent on both sides of the mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baz always experiments well.","review":"His style is a conventional radical mix. The accompanying musical soundtrack challenge the audience also. For the \\"Ballroom\\" soundtrack included both Doris Day \\"Perhaps perhaps perhaps\\" and a Cyndi Lauper \\"Time after Time\\" remake. In the \\"Romeo\\" soundtrack he had a boys choir sing Prince's \\"When Doves Cry.\\" Read that it took him 2 years to get the music cleared for \\"Rouge.\\" One of his soundtrack musical choices is that the disk will feature cutting edge modern artists doing new tweaked covers to popular tunes. Bono sings \\"Children of the Revolution.\\" Top 40 tunes with a lemon and lime twist! Double barrel effort. Leading star Nicole Kidman sings a medley of \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\\" and \\"Material Girl.\\" Again the tone is dramatic and an exotic alley cat of creativity! Not the usual fare, looking forward to his re-make of the musical film genre, 2001 style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I've been listening to this CD ever since seeing the movie. I went directly from the theater to the music store 2 doors down and promptly bought it as the movie was one of the most riveting and original works I've seen ever.The CD is a mixed bag of the truly \\"musical\\" numbers and pop numbers like Marmelade. A few things are missing that were in the movie which was disappointing and a few songs are missing (like the \\"Like a Virgin\\" number and the extended sequence of the group explaining the show) but most everything else is here.Without the accompanying visuals it's definitely not quite as good, but for those who have seen and loved the movie it is a must. Just to keep living in that wonderfully weird world just a bit longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have CD For All Ewan McGregor Fans","review":"I just purchased this cd today and have already listened to it at least once all the way through. I was blown away by the entire thing.Ewan and Nicole both do their own songs and yes,they really can sing! I highly recommend this cd and will continue to listen often.[Every day,at least]"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"I loved the movie; I hate the CD. Sadly, the music without the movie just doesn't cut it. Some of the songs don't even sound the same and there are some extra songs added in. I have wanted to order this CD forever and finally got around to doing it recently. I just lisetened to it for the first and last time. It will go out at my next garage sale. What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Since I saw Moulin Rouge, I haven't been able to get the music from the first time they visit the Moulin Rouge out of my mind. The meshing of several different songs at the same time from what I believe is a melody from Nirvana, to Lady Marmalade, is absolutely striking. I hurriedly bought the soundtrack because I couldn't get enough of the synergy from the music. I was VERY disappointed listening to the soundtrack within the first 30 seconds, and it didn't get better after that. All the synergy and life that was actually in the movie is almost completely missing in the soundtrack. And how could they POSSIBLY leave out the rendition of \\"Like a Virgin\\"?!? I could not recommend this CD less. They are releasing a \\"Moulin Rouge 2\\" soundtrack. I will still give them a chance on this one. The DVD, on the other hand, run, don't walk, to get your copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Real Soundtrack!","review":"Hmmm....aren't soundtracks supposed to be the tracks off the movie.....these aren't exactly what we heard....On top of it, the best songs are missing from the CD, we were so robbed!

It shelters the love we feel. I really think this CD was perfectly designed. It is about truth, beauty, freedom and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"When I first heard that there had been a musical made with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor, I thought the movie industry had hit a new low. But when I heard my friend's copy of the cd, I found I had been wrong. It had some wonderful music. \\"Your Song\\" is one of my top three favorite songs now, and nobody can sing it like Ewan MacGregor. I was most surprised by the voices of Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. They can really sing! This is an excellent piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GR8 CD","review":"Hi all! I wish to change my former review: I love this CD!!! At the beggining I thought it would be bad because it does not contain the original songs, but I heard it and I absolutly adore it. Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are superb, keep on the good work (espacially Ewan, if I may) and well in conclusion: if you loved the movie - buy this CD. If you didn't like the movie - maybe you should watch it again, cause it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Unfortunately, I haven't seen this movie YET... but I'm sure I would probably love it more if I had seen this movie.I love this soundtrack, it's really lively and a pleasure to listen to. I'm glad I decided to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper than at Itunes","review":"I bought this product from a 3-rd party vendor. At 5.22 (total including shipping)it was cheaper than Itunes. All I really wanted was the 1st track to add to my playlist, but Itunes will not sell you the single only, so you have to purchase the full CD.Suprisingly, (and I've never seen the movie) there were quite a few tracks on here that were worth the extra $."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Loved the music in the movie -- thought I'd by the CD. Mistake! Some of the best songs from the movie are missing...like \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\" and \\"Like a Virgin\\" and more. Plus there are some lousy songs that weren't even in the move. I actually thought it was a mistake and that I ordered the wrong thing! Unfortunately not. I feel cheated!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky, zany soundtrack that screams with colours!","review":"Moulin Rouge soundtrack packs a lot of dynamite inside! From the gritty version of \\"Lady Marmalade\\" to \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\", 'Moulin Rouge' is a bottle of soft drink roughly shaken 15 times, waiting for the day when you take the lid off. I love the sound of Ewan McGreggor and Alessandro Safina singing Elton John's \\"Your Song\\" and yes, I am pleasantly surprised when I hear that Nicole Kidman can really sing! Just listen to her version of \\"One Day I'll Fly Away\\", and you can really sense the hidden strength of her voice. Ewan's voice is a wonder as well - unpretentious and clear.This album is like a patchwork of blaringly colourful individual pieces. Take them one by one, and each song would be more palatable, but put them all together, you'd have an explosion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge Soundtrack","review":"I really liked the movie and decided to get the soundtrack. In the movie I was thoroughly surprised by and equally enjoyed both Kidman and McGregor's voices and thought the musical arrangements were wonderful. I expected the soundtrack to reflect what was offered in the movie. Not so. First of all they left out some great stuff while opting to include songs that were not even in the movie. Second, the arrangements they put into the cd were the 'perfectly rehearsed and recorded' versions not the movie performances(I didn't care for the elevator pop rendition of 'Come What May'-a great song in the movie-or the greatly shortened, emasculated version of 'Roxanne'). The movie was a wonderful mixture of melo-drama, color, intensity, emotion - sensorially stunning - and the original soundtrack captured and reflected all of it. The released, sanitized version does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shame!!","review":"When you buy the soundtrack to a musical, it's reasonable to expect that you'll be getting the songs that were in the musical as they were? I think so! Well, you get this here...sort of. Some of the songs that we all love are there, and others aren't. Instead they're replaced by stupid pop songs. You can get all the songs as they were (more or less) in the movie, BUTyou have to buy the second CD! What a ploy! I was mightily upset by this. If you like pop versions and remixes, then the CD(s) will probably be worth your money, but if you want the original songs, you can probably save money by buying them off the iMusic store."},{"rating":"2","title":"You must see this film, then listen to the sound track...","review":"I've longed for a time when actors and actresses would break into song on screen outside of musicals. I found this sound track to be quite artistic and highly enjoyable. It is so unique and wonderful. I'd strongly suggest it to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"When I bought this cd, I was pretty excited. The movie had been great and I really enjoyed the music. This soundtrack, however, was a disappointment. Most of the songs are cheesy and boring, with ultra pop-styled lyrics. There are a few songs that are good, but only because they're the same as they were in the movie. Most of the others were redone and poorly so. I also bought the second soundtrack, and its inclusion of the more obscure but higher quality tracks from the movie, as well as just simply including the origninal tracks from the movie, make it a more enjoyable buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"moulin rouge volume three","review":"Moulin Rouge was a great movie to watch at the cinema i've got both of the moulin rouge movie soundtracks I am a bit dissapointed with the second one it dosn't have all of the songs on the second soundtrack they are these:1 The children of the revoultion2 The sound of music3 Diamonds are a girls best friend4 Nature boy remix5 Satine's musical love theme6 Pride in the name of love7 The end come what may your song one day i'll fly away finale8 The Dukes Plan9 Smells like lady maralade10 Entertain' us11 el de tango roxanne12 I will always love you13 Zidler's rap14 Satine's musical theme15 A fool to belaive16 Chours final17 Smells like teen spritFiona"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good music, bad soundtrack","review":"You may look at the rating and get the wrong impression -- that I dislike the music in Moulin Rouge.

Forget all that extra music spent on scores. This has got the REAL music from the movie. There is a little variation in the songs directly from the movie but not enough to effect the richness of the songs. And as a break from the bitter-sweet love songs, you've got a little extra sweetness. Christina A, Lil' Kim, Maya, & Pink in \\"Lady Marmalade\\", Bono in \\"Children of the Revolution\\" and you'll fall in love with the flowing melody of \\"Complainte de la Butte\\". You've got the upbeat sounds of Fatboy Slim. And they don't give away every song in the movie!

This is an incredibly powerful mixture of musical genres interspersing one another with a rollercoaster speed. From uptempo \\"Lady Marmalade\\" to smooth ballad \\"Come What May\\" you cannot resist this magical, spell-binding avantgarde.My personal favorites include the above-mentioned \\"Come What May\\" as well as \\"Your Song\\" (a remix of Elton John's old hit) \\"Elephant Love Medley\\" and \\"Le Tango de Roxanne\\". The rest is only stunning. :-) Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman prove that they actually _can_ sing very well.Buy it and cherish it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip the soundtrack, buy the DVD!","review":"Already owning the DVD and being an absolutely spectacular spectacular fan of the movie, I anxiously awaited the arrival of the soundtrack. What a stinker! The other reviews warning that what you hear in the movie is NOT what you get on this soundtrack ARE ABSOLUTELY TRUE. Buyer beware. Case in point: the splendid \\"Come What May\\" sequence in the movie is reduced on the soundtrack to Donny & Marie styled drabble. You won't recognize \\"Nature Boy.\\" The CD will gather dust in my collection -- I'm just going to keep playing the DVD! Whatever happened to the days when Hollywood would release \\"original soundtrack albums\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Think I Missed Something.","review":"I don't want this to come off as bashing or trashing, I'm simply going to state an opinion. This is a horrible album, and an overproduced try at a soundtrack.First mistake:There is no definite feel to the album. It starts depressing and ends depressing, but in between it's filled with conflict. I know this sound very appealing, but it seems crass to me.The vocals are bad, and half the songs are downright painful to listen to.The one good song, \\"Lady Marmalade,\\" can be purchased in the dar surperior UK/Norway import single, which includes a nice variety of wonderful mixes.There is a time and a place for singing prostitutes, prancing lovers, and overzealous pimps, I believe. I'm just not sure I want to be there at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lady Marmalade Only Good Song","review":"Lady Marmalade Is The only good song on this album by the way the original version of the song is horrible Im glad they remade it because it sounds a lot better.

It is a mix of all of the classic love songs. You can't listen to this CD and not pick up a song that you do not recognize. With its vibrant beats and familiar choruses, this soundtrack is addictive. I know my CD is so beat up from its constant use. Although it is missing a few favorites from the movie, such as Like A Virgin, The Sound of Music, and Spectacular Spectacular, it still is an amazing soundtrack that adds a new twist to old songs and keeps you coming back for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have album if you loved the movie","review":"\\"Moulin Rouge\\" was one of the very rare movies out of hundreds I've seen that brought me back to the theatre to see it again the very next night. The CD is a must, although it, of course, does not have the visual banquet of the film.

What ever happened to this movie bringing back the movie musical when they don't even release the actual songs? personally, the show must go on was my favorite number and i thought a pivotal point in the movie, and they didn't include it? i am sorry the bottom line is they butchered the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had to review again...","review":"My first review didn't quite do the soundtrack justice. I have listened to the whole thing several times, except for \\"Children of the Revolution,\\" \\"Nature Boy,\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs,\\" which I think were wastes of space.The soundtrack is magical, and I look forward to the other CDs. I think they should have arranged the set by the order of songs in the movie, with Nature Boy first, the Can-Can, etc. etc. That would have been more sensible.Roxanne gives me chills. Complainte de la Butte (when was this in the movie, praytell?) is an awesome song, tho I have no clue what it means. Elephant Love Medley, Sparkling Diamond, Lady Marmalade, Come What May, Your Song, and Hindi Sad Diamonds are my other favorite tracks. I'm eagerly awaiting the next CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!!","review":"This soundtrack rocks! It's all I listen to now! The sounds were awesome in the movie, so of course the soundtrack would be wonderful to listen to, also. I can't even listen to \\"Come What May\\" because I'll start crying, but I love all the others. They're either extremely pretty to listen to (like Roxanne) or else upbeat (like Lady Marmalade) or even fun (like Sparkling Diamonds.)!They left out \\"Spectacular Spectacular,\\" \\"Like a Virgin,\\" and \\"Zidler's Rap.\\" While Zidler's Rap was cool, and I wish it would be on the soundtrack, the other two were kind of...I don't know the word. But, while they were an enjoyable part of the movie, they weren't exactly ones I'd pop into my car stereo and listen to. Needless to say, I certainly don't mind the fact that they were left out, and unless you're an extremely die-hard music fan you won't either.All in all, it's an excellent soundtrack from a great film. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for Baz","review":"I thought this was a wacky yet completely appropriate blend of music. The movie was entirely magical and I plan to see it several more times. I was very happy to find out that the \\"sparkling diamond\\" can actually sing! And the love duets are mystifying. This soundtrack completely deserves five stars, but I am afraid that it is lacking a few key songs that are needed in corespondence with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the second CD?","review":"What happened? I see the movie, I can quote lines from the songs, I love them, I go to get the songs, and this is it? What about Like a Virgin performed in a way that had the audience in stitches? What happened to the Can Can remix? And where is a new rendition of a classic Queen song? these are some of the best songs in the movie in my opinion. Hopefully this will be another Romeo and Juliet, with 2 soundtracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, but half of it's missing","review":"I really liked this movie. I really liked the music that went along with it. But like any musical, I like some songs better than others, and unfortunately, only about half the songs I really liked were on this CD. I've been trying ever since I first saw this music to find out what the title of the closing credit music is, and who it is by. I bought the CD in the hopes it would have this orchestrated song, but unfortunately, it does not.However, this CD does have a wonderful mixture of the different types of music present in the movie. \\"Fly Away\\" is a wonderful rendition by Nicole Kidman, who really can sing very well. I also liked \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\" for the mixture of genres.I do agree with the other reviewers, though; this CD is merely a sampler. I really hope they come out with a box set that includes all the songs (as they were sung in the movie) and also the rest of the score. The great music of Moulin Rouge is not limited to lyrical singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a story about love...","review":"This is the best film I've seen in years, and true to his spirit, Baz Luhrman inspires us at home with the soundtrack. Having owned his \\"Something for Everybody\\" for years, I still find myself listening to it frequently. This CD will be much like that. It's the perfect thing to listen to when your mind starts wandering back to the film. Nicole Kidman's voice is a pleasant surprise, and Baz Luhrman's arrangements are perfect. The one thing I was hoping for is more of the music directly from the film. Still, the Elephant Love Medley is enough to keep me entertained until the next installment of the music comes out, or until I can get my hands on the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come What May get this CD","review":"Yes! The sound track is great. True, it is not an exact duplicate of the music in the movie, but it captures the excitement and pace of the film. While all of the singers are excellent, best is Ewan McGregor. His singing, especially in the movie's original song Come What May, gives chills. The movie from begining to end (Ewan's voice-over is spectacular, spectacular) is non stop pure enjoyment. I ran out and got the CD after seeing the movie and was not dissappointed. From now on, Ewan McGregor should burst into song at least once per movie. Let's see --humm, Black Hawk Down -- what could he sing?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why discard the original soundtrack???","review":"I have to admit I was a little disappointed with this CD: this soundtrack is not the real soundtrack you can expect from this incredible musical movie.

A personal favourite of mine on the cd is 'Roxanne' i loved it because of its overwhelming power!!!

I sincerely hope that a complete soundtrack is coming soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicole and Ewan delightful, but something's still missing","review":"I'm a fan of Ewan McGregor, so I knew I'd see this movie eventually. Ewan doesn't fail to impress, and neither does Nicole; Unlike Ewan, though, Nicole doesn't seem confident enough to belt it out. I bought the soundtrack after seeing the movie, because I wanted to hear Ewan and Nicole.

This is not the case of this soundtrack. First, some of the songs that were in the movie were abruptly cut and put back together. (For example sparkling Diamonds). Also many of the songs were not the versions heard in the movie. The notes that were sung in the first and last song of the movie are not even close to the notes that are being sung on the soundtrack. This is true for many of the songs on this soundtrack.

Unfortunately, much of the brilliance of that soundtrack is burried under pop renditions which diminish the character of the original motion picture versions. The tracks which most closely preserve the original presentation (\\"Because We Can,\\" \\"Your Song,\\" \\"Elephant Love Medley,\\" \\"El Tango De Roxanne,\\" and \\"Hindi Sad Diamonds\\") also inherit the movie's emotion and power. I wish the rest of the disc were as true to the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"I enjoyed the movie so much that I just had to buy the album. Obi-Wan Kenobi really outdid himself and made a spectacular musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music 24/7!","review":"This has got to be my most prized possesion of all time. And it's only a cd you say. Yeah, Right! I love dance, french, latin, rap and many more topics of music. I have to say Moulin Rouge has all of them. I crave David Bowie's song Nature Boy and I love to death Lady Marmalade by Pink, Lil Kim, Mya, and Christina Aguiera. Diamond Dogs by Beck is defientely a must. These are just few of the 15 songs on the soundtrack to a truly heart warming movie. I promise you, you will not be disappointed in this cd. It's got everything. I even bought the cd before I saw the movie which made the movie even more excellent. So if your looking for a good cd to bring on a plane than Moulin Rouge is the one for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfaithful Soundtrack","review":"Potential buyers should note that this is \\"Music from...\\", not a soundtrack per se. This is an important distinction, because if you loved the 2001 movie and want to relive the excitement you will find this an unworthy addition to your collection. Some of the orchestral numbers are here, yes, but some of the earlier songs switch performers from the movie cast. David Bowie is nice, but I want to hear John Leguizamo (Toulouse) perform \\"Nature Boy.\\" The omission of the \\"Like a Virgin\\" cover in particular is almost criminal. What we get in return are remixed style covers and cuts that were not in the original film.Be certain that this is what you want before you buy. If you want the movie experience, you may be better looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word: Spectacular!!","review":"I'm a 14 years old fan of Moulin Rouge. I really love this movie, it's my favorite one, I've seen it almost 30 times! I'm serious.I love the music on it, it's really awsome, I love how they have mixed old songs with new ones, it sounds really amazing. This is my favorite soundtrack of all. Nicole Kidman (who, by the way is my favorite, favorite actress) sings really really good, I love her voice, it's really natural. And Ewan has a beautiful beautiful voice; together they are just perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Something...","review":"I thought I wanted to see the film. Nicole looked sooooo good in the trailers for it. I bought the soundtrack (it was one of 12 for a penny ;) It has moments. It has dialoguish-sounding stuff way too mushy for my tastes. Some of the music seems catchy and cool...some consists of gratingly butchered popular tunes. I haven't quite decided if I really like it or not yet...but it makes a poor advertisement for the film. I'll probably wait for it to come out highly edited on FOX some night. The soundtrack might wind up for sale on a card table on my front lawn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge (Soundtrack)","review":"The movie was spectacular for its sound, among other things, so this supposed \\"soundtrack\\" CD is a tremendous disappointment. The sound mixing is atrocious; the singing of Nicole Kidman and her leading man is overwhelmed by the orchestra. Each track has different sound levels, requiring one to change the volume constantly. The opening song in the movie, which is a stunning rendition of \\"Nature Boy,\\" is sung by a different singer on the CD, a major disappointment. (How CAN this be called a soundtrack, then?) And one can only wonder why some of the best music of the movie wasn't chosen to be included! Save your money. I wish I had!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I have a question","review":"Ewan sang a song(in elephants love medly) \\"Don't leave me this way...\\" what is the song title?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh...Yeah, right.","review":"This album has ONE good song on it. The cover of Lady Marmalade is the only decent song. The rest are utterly unbearable. They are sang by actors. Why? Actors are actors for a reason. They are good at playing a part, not singing. Most of the songs sounded like you were in an opera somewhere. That just isn't me. If you like that sort of music, you may want to buy this. Otherwise don't waste the money. Just go out and try to find a single of Lady Marmalade."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SOUNDTRACK EVER","review":"This is the best soundtrack ever! It's very up beat and you can dance to a lot of the songs. I recomend this CD to every one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moulin Rouge [SOUNDTRACK]","review":"I was really disappointed in the soundtrack. I absolutely love the song by Christina, Pink, Mya and Lil' Kim but the rest of the CD is a waste in my opinion. Granted, I have NOT seen the movie and maybe if I had, I would be more impressed by the CD. But, it just isn't \\"my kinda music\\". There ARE a couple of decent songs on the soundtrack CD but most are not. Of course, the best one is the title song by those four terrific singers! If I would have known the rest of this CD was what it is, I would have saved my [price]!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would rather have more of the REAL music from the movie!","review":"Where is the song \\"The Show Must Go On\\"? The movie uses the fantastic song by Queen, but it's not on the soundtrack. And the Lady Marmalade remake is a joke. Sure the actual words didn't quite fit the movie, but did you have to use Christina? Ugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bohos Do It Right!","review":"When I bought the CD a year ago, I only bought it for Elephant Love Madeley, which I had seen on Vh1 earlier. But I was surprised. The first song, \\"Nature Boy\\" by David Bowie, is haunting and looming, and a very accurate description of Christian's descent into the Underworld that was Momartre.The other songs are also great; Nicole Kidmans remake of \\"Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend\\" Ewan's \\"Your Song\\" which puts Elton John to SHAME, \\"Children of the Revoulution\\" By Bono are just a few.The real jewel of the CD though, is \\"Tango de Roxanne\\" sung by Ewan McGregor, Jacek Koman, and Jose Feliciano. The Police's so-so song about a prostitute suddenly has new life when Koman sings the opening lines, followed by McGregor, singing in such a voice that you know his heart is breaking. Once you see the moive, you know that the song goes along witht eh darkest part of the movie, and is perfect for it.All in all, the CD is wonderful, and so is it's companion CD, Moulin Rouge!2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the movie!!","review":"The soundtrack to Moulin Rouge is really good. For some reason I like the music a whole lot better than the movie. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor do a really good job singing as far as just being actors go. This Musical really has great songs in it, it takes a whole bunch of older songs like \\"In the Name of LOve\\" by U2 and \\"Diamonds are a girls best friend\\". Even though the music is outstanding I only reccommend the soundtrack. This soundtrack is outstanding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some great songs are missing...","review":"As fascinated as I am with the film, Moulin Rouge the Soundtrack was rather disappointing. This CD does not have some of the greatest songs of the movie, like \\"The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)\\", \\"Like a Virgin\\", \\"The Show Must Go On\\". If you like these songs, I'd recommend getting the 2nd CD, that one has them! Although I'm still happy that I bought the first CD since the quality of songs is a lot better than the second one."},{"rating":"2","title":"an interesting mix and concept","review":"Prior to Moulin Rogue I didn't know there was a series of film called \\"red curtain\\" where, moulin rouge is the third of said series. The first being ROMEO+JULIET and the second one STRICTLY BALLROOM.I found the music to Moulin Rouge pretty eclectic, fresh and inventive. Though the film itself is set in the late 1800's, the music they used on the film is undoubtebly 70's, Very brave, very wise, very visionary. How else could you have made a movie where most of the people can understand the lyrics of the songs their singing. I mean, these are songs you grew up on.Noteworthy tracks include FatboySlim's can can song, Lady Marmalade, and nicole doing someday I'll fly away. Critics don't get me wrong, it is not amazing that she can sing, its amazing that she is able to. Just for that is worth the price of admission.I can't wait to see the film if it lives up to the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic music! :-) Incomplete soundtrack. :-(","review":"First of all, the movie rocks and the music in it is just fantastic. Wonderful blend of pop, rock and modern musical with a touch of the drama of the classic opera. Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor are surprisingly fantastic.However, the soundtrack is incomplete. The songs are all remixes of what you hear in the movie, which are fun, but they drop a lot of the cool stuff unique to the movie. (i.e. Lady Marmalade is the version you can get everywhere and not the one with Harold Zidler's voice over) The other problem is it's missing a lot of great songs (\\"Like a Virgin\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On\\") aren't even on it. Many of the songs that are sung several times in the movie in different ways (\\"Come What May\\", \\"Fly Away\\") are on the CD in an attempt of a mix, but again, you loose a lot of cool moments.Overall, the CD was fun, but it would be nice to be able to get one complete with the movie version of the songs and all the reprises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astronomical","review":"This had a wonderful blend of some old favorites put into a new context, and new songs that set the mood. A masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good","review":"I really like the movie, and the music. This CD is truly unique because it has broadway-sounding songs on it mixed with all sorts of other songs of the rock/pop genre. It's a good mix of music. I highly reccomend this CD to anyone who gets tired of listening to the same thing over and over. This CD is hard to get tired of listening to. Also, you can't really appreciate it unless you've seen the movie. Seeing the movie makes this soundtrack a lot better. It's not one of my alltime favorite CDs or anything, but it's good so I'll give it 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Reminder of LOVE","review":"After seeing this film I had to rush over the the nearest store to buy the Soundtrak. The film is a unique show. It's not your typical movie. It's like watching a Broadway Show. The time is Paris, 1900, yet the music meshes music of today in a flawless and romantic style. I love the music. I think you will too. Enjoy...and find happiness through this musical of LOVE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please buy the DVD","review":"This CD does do exactly what a movie soundtrack should do - it displays all the songs from the motion picture to give you a vague idea of the story of the film. The film is absolutely incredible and never fails to entertain. However there is another thing from the film which this cd highlights - Nicole Kidman's raspy, thin, 'nothing' of a voice. Quite frankly i would have preferred a dub than to have her strain her vocal cords down a speaker at me! I am afraid to say that not even the magically rich scores of music which accompany her can hide the fact that she just can't sing! Ewan Macgregor does pull-off the role of Christian however, his high tenor voice is actually too bad. As my titel says, it is absolutely essential to buy the DVD instead of this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"all that baz","review":"I had the utter misfortune to, last night, be trapped in a restaurant which felt compelled to play this soundtrack not only once but twice. Almost all of these songs are just warmed over versions of songs which were novelties in their own era. Why in the world would anyone on earth need to hear a homunculus like Beck sing a David Bowie song? That's like Pee Wee Herman singing Sinatra. And the rest of these songs are mostly just irony laden disco songs which still pale next to the funky originals. Personally, I think Baz Luhrmann is a talentless idiot (since when has been setting La Boheme to a few songs twenty years old considered original?)--he's really only interesting on the most adolescent level--and after being forced to listen to this useless collection twice in a row, my opinion is not only reinforced but is now twice as strong. This CD is so useless; case closed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt one of the best soundtracks I have heard.","review":"I love the song \\"Lady Marmalarde\\" because Christina, Pink, Mya, and Lil Kim aren't people I'd picture collaborating and was happy with the outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a good soundtrack","review":"First,some songs from the movie disappeared, like \\"like a virgin\\",\\"The show must go on\\" ...Second,Nicole doesn't sing well.She is an actress,not a singer.Ewan is not bad,though not very good.2 stars for \\"Nature Boy\\" and \\"Le Tango de Roxanne\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Disappointed","review":"Ok. Now I was 100 percent impressed with the movie and I just KNOW someone out here is going to READ my REVIEW but the soundtrack disappointed me. Now I didn't buy the soundtrack through Amazon.com and the titles showing ARE NOT what they appeared on the One I bought in the stores so I might be mistaken here.The reason I rushed out immeadiately to buy the albumn is this. They sang the Show Must Go On JUST AS GOOD as the Original Artists. I was soooooo impressed. Most people who redo a Queen song screw it up BIG time.I am a HUGE Queen fan and to here it in it's entirety impressed me completely. I loved it. And I am soooo disappointed that they didn't include that song on the albumn.It gave the picture more impact. Especially since Freddie Mercury must have known that he had HIV or even AIDS at the tim ehe wrote and recorded it.The music is good but a disapponntment because it would include something like Diamond Dogs on it but not include the Show Must Go On."},{"rating":"2","title":"come what may","review":"I just recently saw the movie, and it was \\"spectacular, spectaular\\". The songs in the movie were great, so naturally i went to the store to buy the soundtrack. I was surprised that \\"Like A Virgin\\" was not included, as well as the Sound of Music parody (the hills are alive...). What also struck me as odd was that they included some songs that weren't really in the movie. The songs from the movie that were included were great though. So don't get me wrong, I think the soundtrack is very very good, but it cannot be the complete five stars because of what is lacking. All in all, if you don't mind that some songs are missing, you should definitely go out and buy this soundtrack. The Elephant Love Medley is the most hilarious batch of songs, and McGregor and Kidman have quite good voices."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOULD BE 5 STARS...IF IT HAD MORE SONGS FROM THE MOVIE!!!","review":"I LOVE this soundtrack but it REALLY, REALLY (BAZ, I hope you are reading this) needs a Moulin Rouge 2 CD with the rest of the fabulous music from the movie.

Baz Lurhman (director of Moulin Rouge) was recently interviewed on NPR and he said that there will be a three CD box set released sometime soon (later this summer? early fall?) that will contain ALL of the music.The reason the initial cd release is short is because they wanted to have an \\"affordable\\" version for the public to buy, as the 3 cd set will probably run around an amount.Have faith people-- Baz won't let us down. We just need to be patient. Meanwhile, I think I'll go back to the theater and see it for the THIRD time (and I doubt it will be the last).WOW! And super kudos to Baz and Cast of this film. It's just spectacular, spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Okay - Half Excellent!","review":"One of the things I dislike most about soundtracks for movies is when you go to see a movies and there is very little what was in the movie and more of the new songs or new version of songs a studio is trying to push.Hald of this album is like that. FIlled with the cover songs or remixes of the music that was NOT in the film or layed down as part of the original soundtrack. That is very anoying.However, the second half...the FOUR songs that were actually in the film - especially \\"The Elephant Melody\\" are wonderful. I was so disappointed in this CD when I got it that I almost wrote the studio asking \\"Why?\\" If you liked the pop stuff they have been playing on the radio - you'll love this CD - if you are looking for what was actually in the movie - you'll only find FOUR true cuts - and/or cues.But, guess hwat? They released another CD....now read that review I have written!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True Taste Of Moulin Rouge","review":"This is truly f*&%$in' brilliant.With an ordainairy soundtrack you wouldn't expect much, a few songs, the usual, nothing like this. What's unique about the soundtrack is that it takes you inside the movie. The selection of songs, and the particular order, seems to me, to be rather symbollic.Of course, David Bowie's magnificent redition of Nature Boy starts it off. But then, songs follow which take you inside the Moulin Rouge. Thrashing Rock, to Techno, to Pop, you're having a great time!Then, we zoom out to the more generally ideas and themes of the movie. Truth, Beauty, Freedom and Love, the tale of Satine and Christian's love, and on a sligtly depressing note, the jealosy and hate.Beautiful in it's selection, you can listen to the whole album, the songs seem to link up so smoothly.Wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Craig Armstrong: Genius","review":"Great movie, great soundtrack.

As for me, I do love the album. True, some of the songs are better than others - strangely enough I disliked the remake of Lady Marmalade, which was one of the most popular songs of the soundtrack!For me, the songs that really caught my attention had the most power, including Because We Can, Sparkling Diamonds, Children Of The Revolution, Diamond Dogs, and Hindi Sad Diamonds. Strangely, though, my absolutely favorite is Complaite De La Butte, which is terribly touching.What can I say? I do like the album - it's not perfect, but it's still very good!(Review of Moulin Rouge [soundtrack])"},{"rating":"2","title":"A 5 for me","review":"I love this soundtrack and find myself lisening in from time to time, BUT I hear some copmplaints as noted with 1 ratingd. I often do not think 1 ratings are worthy of consideration when outliers, but here you may want to give them a read as they may have a point.Personally I am VERY happy with the soundtrack and truly enjoy the package sent off to us in the market - the change here or there had no affect on my opinion. To be fair, I am assuming most soundtracks are not identical to the movie, there must be some alteration as the experience (wathing a movie as opposed to listening to music) is certainly different.It's a solid 5 and although the 1s should be considered - statistically speaking most don't agree.Just enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleasing...","review":"Highlights are:Lady MarmaladeSparkling DiamondsRhythm of the NightOne Day i'll Fly AwayYour SongElephant Love MedleyCome What MayHindi Sad DiamondsComplainte De ButteAlthough is does get a little tiring if you listen to it too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"The music was amazing and I just saw the movie and I think that everyone should go out and see it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"If you loved the movie it's a must to own this CD.

The concept of a pure heart doesn't even extend to the children characters. The whole novel is a constant exercise of looking under rocks for one another's nasty, sliminess. The absurd argument of the NBA committee debating whether Pendleton's book should be disqualified as fiction if it was based on \\"real\\" events is a particularly piercing jab at the holy sanctity of art awards.

I got very frustrated and went searching on the internet for the web pages listed on the manual. I downloaded the 'patch', rebooted my computer, this time the game lasted longer than the previous 7 attempts. Finally I turned everything that was running in the background on my computer, except for the two basic programs you need and the game ran fine for 6 games in a row. (I have to admit when it runs like it should it is fun.) The seventh game I was almost at the end of the game when it crashed the computer. No matter what I did the 'butler's voice' would only start working about 3 turns into the game.

I would venture to say they seem idiot-proof. I will be using this book again (third year in a row) for my holiday baking/gift-giving.The photos are what sets this book apart from others.

A child's delight in meter and poetry will be deferred, not encouraged, by the reading of this book. Example: \\"I is for ice skating on cold, icy lakes, A winter wonderland of dazzling snowflakes.\\" Other books of verse for children include rollicking, rolling rhymes with easily discernable cadences, but these klunky, confusing lines sound awkward and stumbling.There is no magic or spark in this flat, listless piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Chopper Grinder Makes Work Easy","review":"Chopping, blending and grinding are a natural a part of good cooking.

Imagine if he had stayed off that darn bike and could join Boz on his tours today.

Although Greg Allman is a featured guitarist, Boz sings the blues as only he can do. I was living in San Fransisco the fall of 1969 and KSAN played the title track several times a day but I'll tell ya, every track on this effort is classic Boz and a must own for the consumate fan.

Issued 1969, it sold poorly and in 1977, somebody at Atlantic had the bright idea of completely remixed the original album (it was done in Los Angeles), bringing up Duane Allman's guitar and drowning other aspects of the original mix. On \\"Finding Her\\", for example, the volume level of the music drops down way low for the last 40 (or so) seconds....something the original mix never had.Apparently, the original mix is only available on the original vinyl LP (SD-8239).

Fast clean up, easy set up, great for making mayo, hollandaise, whipped cream, soup... Then into hot water and soap, hit the blend and you're clean.But the battery dies and won't hold a charge. This is forseeable, but does Cuisinart offer spares/replacements at reasonable cost? Nooooooooo!Guess what? We'll buy a cheap corded model. We're disappointed. Every product has some limitations, but one should be able to use it for 3 years with no problem and replace failure-prone parts quickly, easily and at a good price, if desired.This product is just another example of bad business and we don't want to reward it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get one with a cord","review":"They still make this?

It is good for mixing up drinks. One down side is that it eats up batteries really fast.

Clean up was a breeze, too. The worst feature of this blender the 'rechargable' battery, which, withihn a year, took less and less of a charge after each use. Now we have to charge it 3 times to use it once. It does not surprise me that Cuisinart does not sell rechargeable batteries separately, which, in hindsight seems like planned obsolescence, but in turn, Cuisinart should not be surprised when I never buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"convenience\\" isn't convenient at all","review":"Cuisinart's ad copy and product directions claim that the charger can be kept plugged into the wall so it's always ready for use. However, this is a nickel-cadmium rechargeable battery. Plugging it back in to recharge before you've fully drained it is DEATH to NiCad batteries! This stupid design decision on the part of Cuisinart almost guarantees a poor user experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product until it stopped working","review":"Had this indispensable item for less than two years when it died. Worked well one day; seemed to be recharging but was totally dead the next day. Three year warranty, but you have to pay postage both ways (they require you to send $7 with the defunct product)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor design","review":"I like using this blender for smoothies and whipping cream. Its a little awkward to hold but was very handy as my old kitchen had few outlets. But after a few months its a hassle. Water, or some liquid has gotten into the shaft containing the blade - I can hear it when I shake it but I can't get it out. I'm wondering if whatever is up in there is getting into food. The plug for recharging the motor section jammed and will not fully extend, so to recharge I have to use an extension cord or that component just about falls out of the outlet. Frankly, I'm fed up with Cuisinart. I just moved and was surprised to be chucking a toaster and a coffee maker - both with little use. This hand blender will likely soon follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I was a little skeptical at first that a battery operated blender would have any amount of torque approaching an electric version...BUT I let all the rave reviews convince me otherwise, and after all it would be one less electric cord cluttering up my countertop.Well, I should have stuck with my first instinct. This device is next to useless...unless you are blending things you could easily blend with a spoon. An electric blender would cut through frozen bananas (in milk) easily...come on...alot of you do this to make shakes...this battery powered blender can's handle it. After cutting the banana into little chunks...then put up with 5 minutes slow blending... careful not to grind the device to a dead stop. If you think its too good to be true, it usually is !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I bought this blender primarily because it was cordless and would therefore be easier and safer to use. But its performance has been very disappointing. The battery does not hold a charge well; the motor dies after just a few seconds. It's hard to hold down the power button for very long. And the stick is just too tall; I have to hold my arms up too high over whatever I'm trying to blend. I bought this at full price ($75) a year ago, and it was a waste of money. I'm going out to buy another model that has a cord and is more comfortable to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great everyday blender","review":"I've had mine for two years now and absolutely love it. I primarily use it for my protein drinks in the morning, and it has traveled all over the U.S. and Canada with me. The only drawbacks in the beginning were that (1) as others have mentioned, it is large and took some getting used to compared to my old corded hand blender, and (2) the instructions on the side ('press button to attach/detach') are misleading; it is not necessary to press the button to connect the pieces, and the first one I had felt like the connections got stripped when I tried to do so. Fortunately, the retailer permitted an exchange for a replacement. To attach the segments, simply push them together and it will work fine. You do need to press the button to separate the segments, and it can be tricky to pop out the plug to recharge it without breaking a nail at first, but once you get the hang of it this is a wonderful appliance."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Hand Blender Rocks for Protein Shakes","review":"I have used this blender for a few months now and am very happy with the purchase. My initial impression was that it was huge! Admittedly, I hadn't previously seen one ... but it is big. Luckily it stores in 2 pieces in a provided stand, which keeps it out of the way. I use it to mix protein shakes. Mixing by hand left lumps of powder...by blender added lots of air, made to much noise (sleeping toddlers)and was to tough to cleanup. This cordless hand blender is very easy to snap together, mixes shakes (even with fruit) very well, is powerfull and the battery lasts a long time. I use it at least twice a day until the battery dies (as it is a nicad). I have to recharge it about every 8-12 days. The end result is a perfectly mixed protein shake, very smooth and without a lot of air/froth. If you want the froth, you can add it by lifting the blender head up and down a bit while you blend allowing air to get into the head openings."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Amazing to Think That This Book Might Actually Offend Some Christians","review":". . . But it will. This book by Craig R. Koester will make it a whole lot easier to teach my Sunday school class on Revelation without having to go to some modernist debunker to do it.

If you're a serious Christian who wants a Revelation that will inspire you through trials that may befall you because of your faith, through out all of your \\"Left Behind\\" crap and read \\"Revelation and the End of All Things\\" instead.

Several years ago I read a book that was very detailed about the events that would occur during the end of time. I have not been able to locate that book again, but it was based on the Bible. I was hoping that this book would be as good. I was extremely disappointed with this book. I only read small sections of the book because it was rather boring and seemed to give several points of view instead of actually giving the author's interruption of events to come.

Alas, I was quite disappointed. The writing style was plodding, and frankly it was often a boring read.The information contained in this book is quite good. But Mails jumps around so much between tribes, it is difficult to follow. The book is broken into two chapters; the first is about the training of young boys to become warriors and the second is about the mature warrior.If you are just looking for information about the life of the Plains Indians(for a term paper or you are just interested), you will probably benefit by purchasing this book.

As time went on, the message appeared more often and lasted longer. Now, it's hard to even use the camera, it works 1 out of every 25 times i turn it on. JVC won't respond to e-mail's and i have done everything to fix it that i have read on the internet. I cannot take it to a service center because they want $100 to just look at it and i think I can get a brand new one that hopefully will work for about $200.

The advantage is that all portions of the world are covered. By focusing at the regional level (e.g., North central Europe, Southern Africa, Arctic region), one does not get quite the detail desired.

She gives you a perspective of the history of this area based on archeology, history and the Bible. But it is her own personal observations of the places and the people she met during the year she spent there, that I found so fascinating and could personally identify with. It is somewhat dated as far as a tour book, having been written in the 60's. I would buy updated travel books, for the nuts and bolts of the trip, if I ever journeyed there.

But within about 3 months, one of the players would just stop for no reason every so often. It would start playing again if you restarted it, but then you'd have to remember where you were in the movie and get there again. We then just switched to only using the other one. Now after another 3 months (6 months after buying it) that one stops too - every time we go over a bump or turn a corner. It drives me insane.

Fortunately, the patrons of this wonderful place are capable of dealing with these problems. The characters range from the (forgive me) mundane to the utterly outrageous. The puns are some of the best (worst?) ever put on paper. Spider's characters are real.

I got to see Maxine Sullivan during the second phase of her career, when she came back after working and raising her children to thrill those of us who weren't around for Phase 1. The lady loved good music and presented it well. \\"Loch Lomond\\" and the other classics from her early career were not among my favorites. But even in the 1930s and '40s, Maxine made memorable recordings of ballads like \\"Easy to Love,\\" \\"Spring Is Here,\\" \\"Ill Wind,\\" \\"When Your Lover Has Gone,\\" \\"Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye\\" and others. Her later recordings for the Concord, Audiophile, Atlantic, Baldwin Street, Kenneth and DRG labels were better than some of these early efforts, but this four-CD set shows you how it all began.

It kept the tiny bugs out of regular steam rice but DID NOT keep the tiny bugs out of sticky or sweet rice, which negates my need for the product. I also didn't think the dispenser portion being at the bottom would be a problem but it was annoying to bend all the way down to dispense. I ended throwing both dispensers away because one had bugs inside. A better solution for me was a sealed container on wheels @ CNTNR store =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the convenience","review":"I was curious to see whether this would really be a convenience or if I was just wasting money on a \\"gimmick.\\" But I love this dispenser, and it really does make it easier and less messy than storing rice in the bag or in a tupperware type container. Another reviewer complained that it does not dispense a proper cup measure, but the measure is actually set for one Japanese cup of rice. It is slightly smaller than an English/American cup, but the measure is in fact, perfectly suited for a rice maker. So, it is convenient for me because I can just depress the button a couple of times to dispense an appropriate measure of rice, dump it into my rice maker, add water to the appropriate fill line on the rice maker, and not really have to measure anything. It comes out right each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great knife, great price!","review":"I bought this knife to round out my collection.

Also the bonus screwdriver's \\"DeWalt\\" label was peeling off fresh out of the box, kinda cheesy and not the quality you'd expect from these guys normally.Most of these bits seem to come coated with oil.

Flip to the facing pages of Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan, for instance, and you will find Reagan's page says \\"Challenger Disaster, savings and loan failures, 500k people protested nuclear arms\\" etc, etc. Carter, on the other hand, says things like \\"modest carter, human rights as the key element of foreign policy, restore all that is good and decent and honest and truthful and fair and competent\\", etc, etc. Amazingly, it even says \\"Iran returned hostages to the US\\" under Carter, which actually happened under Reagan! I am always disgusted when authors use a children's book to push their own agenda, and actually inlcuding misinformation is just revolting! Shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Resource","review":"I loved this book as a child and it really influence me in my adult hood.

Nobody that bought this book wants to admit it and review it. They are hoping someone else will make the same mistake so they can laugh at them.

I called Mintek and they said \\"The product is not really defective. The backlight just doesn't work.\\" HUH?I have read feedback from others who have experienced the same problem.

I've even left it on overnight to see if it would load if I gave it enough time and the next morning the disk STILL hasn't loaded. I've been doing some research and apparently this is a pretty common occurence with Mintek products.

Though, it has some biographical information that is not the books purpose so a lot of the book is about aviation and women aviators in general. This book is great to see how aviation and women were viewed in the 1920s and 1930s however.

It was not to be. All of us show varying degrees of success in our professional endeavors. Being a writer is no exception to this simple rule. In this novel the characters are both flat and entirely uninteresting. The plot drags itself through communist agitation, the failure of parenting, into midlife crisis and escapism and finally into a milquetoast acceptance of one another. In sum, it starts no where, goes no where, and ends up no where.I suggest that if the reader wishes to explore Sinclair Lewis that he start with Elmer Gantry and proceed onto Main Street. The author's writings tend to slightly decline after this point. But with 'The Prodigal Parents' they seem to have fallen completely into an abyss...."},{"rating":"1","title":"caution","review":"If an author is descibed as being someone who 'lectures' for an institution, or even worse, societies, this doesn't mean they are a trained academic.

The songs flaunt their R&B influences, but also rock. They have soul, they have purpose--and for the first time, it sounds like these guys are less concerned with making a catchy song and more concerned with really expressing something. \\"She's Gone\\" was probably the strongest single they ever released. The entire first side is comprised of breezy gems; \\"When the Morning Comes\\" is a surprisingly strong opening, and \\"Las Vegas Turnaround\\" is the most addictively cheery piece they ever composed. The best piece is probably the title track, though, which has four different portions of very different structures and time signatures and a whopping sound and purpose: it really hits the nail on the head. Or in this case, the key on the cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hall and Oates best Atlantic Records recording!!!","review":"Great Hall and Oates album,includes the now classic She's Gone in all it's 5 minutes plus glory,the radio seemed to play the 3 minute single edit,but the version on this album is much better,that's not the only great song,every tune on this classic album is top notch,a very recommended album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A CLASSIC OF CLASSICS","review":"Clearly the best Hall and Oates album in my collection of 13.While reading the reviews,Im glad im not the only one who thinks so.Also while reading i noticed that some people are a bit mis-informed.One writer said that \\"Daryl wrote all the songs on his own\\",thats not true.John wrote 3 all his own(Had i known you better then,Las vegas turnaround,Im just a kid)Lady rain and Shes gone by daryl and john.the rest were written by Daryl,out of the 9 songs total on the album.And actually this is there 3rd album together(Past times behind \\"70\\",Whole oates \\"72\\")Vocally John really shines throughout this album and blends perfectly with Daryls highs.Maybe thats why this album is considered by many to be there best album ever.

I now have it on CD and it is still an amazing piece of musical art. On this CD both of these guys have a real chance to shine as one side belongs to Hall and one to Oates. This early stuff has an acoustic mellowness to it that really runs contrary to the more recent \\"do wop\\" type stuff they migrated to. The compositions are more personal and the lyrics are filled with sincerity.It almost seems that after this point Hall and Oates morphed into something entirely different and never returned. What happened to these guys? I guess success took quite a toll. If you have never listened to this, I think you will be shocked by the almost thematic quality of the album and you might not even believe that these are the same guys that did the stupid eighties videos and sang about maneaters and that other crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This CD was exactly as described, arrived quickly and is a treasure in my collection.

Classic cuts like this shouldn't be cut short. Short is better than nothing though. I'm afraid I've run into Atlantic Records dreaded DRM practices with this disk.

It features the same themes of mental illness and wreckless behaviour that Alice is known for.\\"Devil's Food\\", \\"The Black Widow\\" and \\"Cold Ethyl\\" are a welcomed return to form for Alice after the humorless Muscle Of Love album. \\"Stephen\\" is almost disturbing and the final songs of the set continue the \\"collapse\\" until \\"Escape\\" serves as the wake up call.A classic from beginning to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Cryin In My Beer","review":"Something was different. Alice without makeup, Alice in a tuxedo.The band had gone taking some of their spark with them but Nightmare would suprise by it's depth.Alice sings of giant spiders and a cyclops,and of course Ethyl his stone cold girlfriend. The gutteral rasp of Devil's Food, the kick of Only Women Bleed give the first sign that Alice Mk2, parody or not was going to be worthwhile.Dept Of Youth with its immortal line on Donny Osmond introduced black humour into Alice's music, no one I have ever heard since has delivered anything like it for me.Steven, is the album's conceptual stagepiece and is really pretty chilling. But for me the album's closing song Escape is the most overlooked of Alice's entire solo career, this surely is John Lennon just back from his first LSD trip and wanting to tell the world about it. Steal my mascara any time you like Alice just dont tell the Pope, I'm a catholic girl.Alice could still make music without his band no need to wake up just yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get ready to run","review":"I love this Album.

Laura's debut is a very strong album, which showed that the ones to come would also be excellent. She has an incredible voice to add on to the great material. There are meaningful ballads as well as neat dance and rock tracks. My favorite ones are: \\"Loving You Baby,\\" which is so powerful and touching; \\"Living a Lie\\" which is very energetic; \\"Gloria\\" which is obvious by just listening to it why it was such a big hit; \\"Please Stay, Go Away\\" which is a great dance track; and \\"Down Like a Rock\\" which is a fun upbeat song.

Evocative of Edith Wharton, her characters are ensnared by the prevailing right and wrong of the times in which they live. In this case, it is post World War II Italy. With an economy of words, she paints a magnificent sense of place, imbues it with ordinary people and requires them to make life altering decisions.Unlike contemporary writers, Hazzard does not pin every detail on the page - readers are required to think. There is always an elegance in Hazzard's work, even in this early, straightforward novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tender, slender","review":"Shirley Hazzard's first novel reads very much like a first novel. She has a fruitful set-up--an Englishwoman, of half-Italian parentage, falls in love with an older and more sophisticated Italian man separated from his wife--, but she cannot figure out what to do with it. The individual scenes in this episodic narrative are sometimes beautifully evocative, but nothing much ever comes of the story.

Claire, as usual, nailed the role. But the real surprise is Billy Crudup. He's magnificent in this film, so good, I didn't even recognized him until half-way into the movie.

After having heard the first cut on a local FM radio station, my soul was stirred. I finally found the CD on Amazon.com and orderd it. Once I received the CD, I put it in and much to my disappointmet the audio quality was poor. There is no stereo information. Although the bass was acceptable and the dynamic range is O.K., overall the CD audio quality was very, very poor. Dee Dee's voice is smooth almost like Sarah Vaughn in her latter years. Her range is great, again like Sarah Vaughn's, but this CD only gives you a glimpse of what she really sounds like. I noticed that the CD was produced by Dee Dee Bridgewater. This only added to my disappointment.D.

The remaining straps all broke, the anchors pulled out of the skin, and one of the zippers broke. So, we'll get two seasons out of it and it will have to go in the trash. I'd say avoid it.

Brilliant!","review":"Tom Wright (the more informal way N. T. Wright addresses himself in his more popular and accessible material) has shown his brilliance once again. He says more in 2 - 3 pages about a major section of Paul's letters than many commentaries say by using dozens of pages. This series is meant to be simple and accessible to the average layman, and yet, because of the author, the insights are profoundly brilliant. I can't think of a better series to use for devotions. Buy any of these -- you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wright is the layman's yeoman","review":"Bishop Wright's commentaries, which is really what this series is (i.e., Paul for Everyone, John for Everyone, Luke fr Everyone, etc.) are a superb gift to the Church. Though one of the finest academic New Testament scholars alive, his commentaries are extremely readable and accessible for the layman.Even though his audience is the layman or woman, his work is rooted in serious thought, scholarship and reflection. He doesn't always try to solve or answer every textual or theological problem but he will always give the basic tools or parameters allowing the reader to make one's own decision.He is quite reliable in his underlying exegesis of the text. His tone is pastoral, hortatory and narrative.

The author takes deliberate controversial positions that beg for further discussion. His ideaology tends to stick close to the Ancient Matriarchy as proposed by Merlin Stone and M. Gimbautus. The books weaker points are that because many of the essays were written in the 1980's, so much of the science he bases his arguments on is getting outdated - also Davis' past as a SF writer shows thru in his rather strange and elaborate explination of the humans soul as a Tesseract."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad merchandise","review":"I purchased this item because it was well priced and looked good. when i got it and put it on i noticed that it worked with the brakes on as advertised but, it worked with the right blinker and not the left.

Other than that, the entire list of his is amazing. Might i recommend Soilwork and As I Lay Dying, which are 2 of my current favorite bands right now.

I read it only to better understand the movie, and was extremely surprised at what an excellent story I found it to be. It is told from the perspective of a little boy, about his struggles and triumphs, and the little things that help him cope with life in a concentration camp run by Japanese. If you think this is your typical \\"WW II survivor story\\", guess again. As I was reading I forgot the book was about a concentration camp. It became the story of a ordinary boy and his mother, and their day-to-day life amidst a horrific background. The harsh reality is it is a true story. I hope the movie does it justice. This book is extremely under-rated. It is up to par with Oprah's book club books. Please read it, and I think you will be surprised. If anyone knows how I can contact the author, please let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"a truly great book","review":"i am 16 years old and read this book for the first time last year. i truly enjoyed reading the book. i am not into books which have a difficult plot or a lot of long words but anyone can undersatnd this book. i cant imagine what the boy would have went through and had to keep on reminding myself that this actually happened. i definitely do not think that this book is given the credit in which it is worth. reading the book makes you realise what a good life you have compared to what the boy went through. so go out and read the book now. p.s. have a box of tissues ready!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Something.","review":"I didn't get as excited about this book as the other reviewers have.

I've yet to see any cathode-ray tube with a better picture. I guess the rating should really be 4.5 stars, because it's a little on the bulky/heavy side, even for a CRT (I think that may be why Compaq redesigned their monitors shortly hereafter).

The images are sharp and clear, and with Compaq's Coloreal technology you can enjoy true-to-life images on its 16.0 VIA. For a 2-piece stereo speaker system, the JBL Platinum is excellent, too. You can connect headphones directly to the speakers. The Digital Audio Player port lets you use the speakers as output for your mp3 player without switching on the computer. This is definitely one of the best flat screen monitor around. If you don't want this, get a flat panel display."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good monitor for everyday, normal use.","review":"This monitor was included with a Compaq computer that I bought and it hasn't given me any problems since. It's a flat screen (different from LCD) with 2 small slits on both sides to slide the speakers in to hang on the sides of the monitor. If you don't have the speakers or if you don't want to connect them to the monitor directly, that is no problem because the slits are barely visible and do not stick out. The monitor doesn't take much room and fits snugly on my desk. I don't ever have to turn it off because like most monitors, it automatically goes on standby when the computer is off or in sleep mode and turns back on with the computer.

This is the extended version of the second exit song (the one where Manager is disco'ing). One of the more unique tracks is titled \\"Japan #16\\" fans of the series will remember this from Episode 2 during the pantasia preliminaries when Azuma created \\"Mt. Fuji\\". The track can be heard during Kuroyanagi's reaction to the bread. If your a fan of the series deffinatly pick it up one of the better ost's I've heard.

The author focuses on Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and William James as a means to highlight the problems of elevating technique over substance. The book does not assume any familiarity with any of these philosophers, and so provides an entry into their thought. By focusing on Wittgenstein instead of the later logical positivists and Heidegger rather than Sartre or another existentialist, the author can bring out the true greatness of Wittgenstein and Heidegger compared to later philosophers. I recommende this book to anyone interested in critical thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended/Excellent Writing","review":"I find William Barrett's books on modern philosophy accessible for all readers. I have read all his books, some of them several times, and each time find new insights into the persistent philophical questions of our modern age.What I particularly like about this book is that he gets somewhat autobiographcial at the end, demonstrating his philophical belief in God.The Illusion of Technique is at the same level of excellance as Irrational Man,his most famous book, which is quite an achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Sharp as a Laser, and fast drying colors!","review":"Best choice I made, I wasn't too sure about gettin a Compaq printer, but when I did, I see what they say : \\"Buy Brand and get Quality\\" Enough said, you get what ytou pay for.

Its melody is instantly memorable and the vocal (which I think could be from a Tracy Chapman song) will remain stuck in your head for weeks, even if it is a looped, off-kilter sample. Technological funk music that never rubs its machine-origins in your face and never gives off a jaded attitude. Music to be enjoyed, not flaunted. I do not know much about the producer(s) though I own several more of their singles from Locked On and various remixes for other labels. This is still their most stellar piece of original material. I have not heard any new material from Dem 2 in a while, so if anyone has heard any news of more singles, or an album, let me know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook!!!","review":"I agree with Michael's review whole-heartedly, but I can even go up a notch (6 stars?) and say that I am playing Half Life 2 at a full 1600 X 1200 resolution without a hitch.

He backs everything up with scripture, and the book contains a spritual messasge as well. The book basically describes how, Jesse was taken up into heaven to recieve a message from God. He describes the actual city of heaven and surrounding paradise, as well as his conversations with several major bible characters. The main part of the book is his actual conversations with Jesus.

Ask a pilot what happens when a hole gets blown in the fuselage while flying.

Even trying to blend soups with well cooked vegetables is time consuming and frustrating- often chunks get caught above the blades and it doesn't create enough suction to pull food through it. Anything raw? Forget it. The blades are dull, the motor is weak, and it's kind of uncomfortable to hold because you have to manually hold the button down while blending. The blender part doesn't detach from the motor part, so it's awkward to clean.I got it as a gift, so it's too late for me, but you should save your money and skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go for the KitchenAid Immersion Blender instead","review":"I bought the Cuisinart Immersion blender a year and a half ago, and used it 2-3 times a week with passable (if noisy and slighly lumpy) results, until it died last week. I was pleased with my Cuisnart until I replaced it with the KitchenAid Immersion blender. This thing ROCKS. It's quieter, twice as powerful (check the amps!), has nine speeds AND a detachable blade arm for easy, submersable, cleanup. Best of all, it leaves no lumps. You can taste the difference!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Optimal: Cuisinart CSB-33 QuikPrep Hand Blender.","review":"Having been a long time user of a similar product (Moulinex Turbo) for 8 years, my old unit had seen better days and was in need of replacing. So, I made some assumptions about the product based on my experience with my other Cuisinart products and purchased the CSB-33 QuikPrep Hand Blender. Much to my dismay, the Cuisinart hand blender performs nowhere nearly as well as the Moulinex did the day I threw it away. The Cuisinart has a blade that is not sharpened. Consequently, it doesn't cut up food (like blueberries, for instance) very well. It just sort of beats stuff to a pulp, quite literally, and doesn't puree them into liquid. It also has a system of holes around the perimeter of the blade guard that just get clogged up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big BOOM","review":"I had this hand blender when it came with the stainless steel beaker cup (which I did keep), the plastic beaker, lid, chopper & 3 blades. I loved all the gadgets & gizmos it came with. It was very nice to start, but once I started chopping fresh fruits...BOOM! --Sounded like a gun went off! It died. Maybe they are different now? hmmm...sounds like the motor hasn't improved too much though.I'll just stick with Cuisenart's bar blender."},{"rating":"1","title":"a truly lame product","review":"I've owned immersion blenders for years. This one is truly a terrible product: blades are small, not sharp at all, so blending is uneven at best. Shaft doesn't detach from the motor, so there is no way to clean up the blade in a dishwasher. Motor is underpowered (100W), so coupled with dull blades, it takes forever to blend anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible product","review":"we bought this to puree baby food and it conked off within 15 days.

The majority of the companies cited as examples of the onslaught of the new economy are no longer in existence. Earnings are barely mentioned. Companies cited as the movers and shakers of tomorrow are now penny stocks. The total lack of balance relative to other sectors is appalling and in retrospect is by itself educational. Everyone bought into the hype including the entire VC industry. This might explain why they all sat on the sideline in 2001 trying to regain their sense of direction. The entertainment value is a 5 and the educational value a 1. It is your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Useful","review":"This book is truly unlike anything I have read so far on venture capital.

Obviously Pair-ed up since they were two of the Association's better albums.

I wanted to give it five stars but felt that at times it got bogged down in details that could have been glossed over.

Overall, a good read, especially if you are interested in the Ohio Valley and its earlier inhabitants."},{"rating":"2","title":"History that reads like a good novel.","review":"Eckert's ability to make history come alive is truly a one-in-a-million talent. Like the books in his Narratives of America series, this account is almost impossible to put down. The history of the \\"old Northwest Territory\\" is fascinating even in the most dry monograph, but this account makes the characters come alive. You may want to read Eckert's \\"The Frontiersman,\\" and \\"A Sorrow in Our Hearts\\" to get the full context. Dark and Bloody River is actually a follow up account to the two above titles.

I found this book extremely helpful in clarifying just how Jewish Paul, and the other disciples, actually were. I also find it a bit disturbing that this book was put together in this manner, with extra commentary and afterwards that often hindered a full appreciation of Yoder's work. Although Ochs and Cartwright are insightful, I'm not so sure having their writings in this book was the wisest of choices on behalf of Eerdmans and Hauerwas.Nevertheless, Yoder would have appreciated a continued, more nuanced, study of the schism between Jews and Christians... indeed, a schism that did not have to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"The answers I was looking for !","review":"If - like me - you are interested in the title's answer, Ms.Brown's is the book!

And - believe me! - Ms. Brown interviewed people - in Taiwan ( living there) and interviewed people - in China !!! We are talking about an Stanford University Professor. Congratulations and thanks to Amazon ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very insightful !","review":"I'm a Taiwanese myself. Even though the content of this book is not new to me, it still provides a fantastic read for me personally and I can imagine it'd be more fantastic for someone wishing to know more about Taiwan. Because Taiwan is so isolated in the international arena, books such as this one is highly recommended for the average person. The only aspect I did not like about this book is the first part of this book's title: \\"Is Taiwan Chinese?\\". I'd just like to inform readers that all the population in Asian countries (east, north and south east) all originated from China. So basically everyone is Chinese, so it doesn't just apply to Taiwan. It is like saying: Is Australia British? Nevertheless, a rather informative book for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reprint of very old book","review":"I threw it in the garbage, it refered to african americans throughout the entire book as the N word.

It is a gripping and sexy narrative that keeps the reader turning the pages to uncover the secrets at the heart of the story. Yet, at the same time, it is also a deeply thoughtful and intellectual novel which poses questions about war, displacement, risk and identity that most readers will grapple with long after they finish the last page.In particular, book groups will find that this novel sparks meaty conversations about love and relationships in the larger context of our duties to each other and the larger world around us."},{"rating":"1","title":"godawful","review":"its dullness is only surpassed by its pretentiousness. what a waste. i just finished eggers' \\"heartbreaking work of staggering genius\\" before reading ROE. it really drove home how lame this book was in comparison. maybe if i'd tried reading some other dreck it would have looked better.reading the author's distinguished education on the back cover is also rather dismaying. all that larnin' and that's the best she can do? shudder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version is a mess","review":"I honestly can't give a fair review to the content of this book because I only made it through the first chapter or so. The problem is that the Kindle version of this title is RIDDLED with typos. Some are actually kind of funny (like substituting \\"pogrom\\" for \\"program\\"), but in the end, they make the book very difficult to read. The book also contains a lot of computer screenshots, and in the Kindle version, they're impossible to read as they are. You can click on them to zoom in, but (a) this slows you down quite a bit, and (b) some of them are still very difficult to read, even in the zoomed version. If you know anything about programming, you know that not being able to properly read punctuation in code is a disaster. Periods, commas, semicolons, and different brackets are all important, and if you can't read them, you're in for a lot of frustration.If you're interested in this title, find a print copy instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ratings","review":"I used to value the reviews on Amazon until I purchased this book. If you think some of the Dummies series are not your style, well, this book speaks to you like a child. It is more like reading a work of fiction than a programming book. Sure, there are writing styles for beginners but this one goes too far. The book is written as a \\"day in the life of a teacher\\" and includes conversations with his students. Needless to say, I purchased this book to learn Java but left this book in the recycling of my hotel room after the first chapter and purchased another book. Very disappointed in both the book, and the high ratings it received on this site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart","review":"I've owned this book and after a few years the pages of the book fall out.

It takes you from the ground up in the world of Java programming. Java is difficult, but Smiley does a nice job breaking things down. His class room style writing technique is entertaining and raises a lot of good questions. He has some excellent analogies and uses some good examples with illustrations. I use this book in conjunction with Intro to Java by Liang (which is used in my Java class at school), and find that when I'm confused with Java it's Smiley's book that helps me wade through it.

With a sharp awareness of how much and how little cricket really matters, Marqusee dissects the vile attitudes of the English cricket establishment, explodes many of the myths it promulgates to maintain its grip on the game, and offers serious (if utopian) proposals for how the game could be reformed. Most striking is his detailed account of the racism whihc appears to pervade the top levels of the game. Unlike him and Dennis Skinner (from whom he took the title) I've been England fan all my life, but I suspect I shall have a hard time supporting them again.

So: a traditionalist Catholic, an orthodox Jew, a Lakota shaman, an American scientist, a civil libertarian, a psychologist, or anyone else who disagrees with a bunch of narrowly defined BS about \\"productionist metaphysics\\" and Reichian pseudo-science or anything else proposed by a bunch of French a**holes is now a fascist. Anyone who would like to found a community based on traditional values or who dares to suggest such \\"ultra-reactionary heresy\\" as that there might be an objective truth or the commonsense notion that perhaps \\"reason is indeed reasonable\\" is really a fascist in disguise.

Is that too much to ask for? Apparently it is cause this movie features none of the above. Actually outside of a few sprays of blood, one quick scene of drug use and a few cuss words TOOLBOX MURDERS could air on network television. I'm not exaggerating.I could explain all the things wrong with the script, but really it'd just be pointless. If you wanna watch it then watch it. Maybe you'll get a good nap out of it, but remember Tobe Hooper is the same guy who directed THE MANGLER, INVADERS FROM MARS and CROCODILE.Oh yea.

This little gem is a must for those interested in going behind the scenes of these movies, very nicely done! The second documentary, The American Nightmare, has been a special feature on another horror DVD, which it makes it a dissapointing choice for a second special feature. Tobe Hooper tries to work his magic but the story just can,t decide whether its trying to be like Texas Chainsaw or Friday 13th. Jason Voorhees or Leatherface? Take your pick? The scriptwriters tell us that this is a re-imagining,not, a remake, but to be honest they might have made this a lot more scary if they,d stuck to the original premise!

Very fun to watch, overall, I gave it 4 out of 5 because it leaves a lot of questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted it to be good, really I did","review":"As much as any other horror fan, I'd liked to have seen Tobe Hooper come out swinging with a film that shows he still knows how it's done, but Toolbox Murders sure isn't it. You've seen the same basic premise handled much better a dozen times before (even in hogwash like The Sentinel) and Hooper does nothing new with it. He also never generates any real suspense in Toolbox, the gore murders are silly and pointless, and the acting is wildly uneven. It's too bad because there are a couple ideas here that you can imagine (or have already seen) put to effective use, but Hooper just doesn't make it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gory","review":"Hooper did a great movie with Texas Chainsaw, but this movie is poor.

The photos show an actual San Marco bracelet with fully formed, individual links. What I received should be called an \\"Illusion San Marco bracelet\\". There are tiny \\"links\\" that are actually only about 1/3 of a true San Marco link - just the side of a link. Think of cutting a length-wise piece off an elbow macaroni so that the piece is rounded on the outside and hollowed out on the inside, and you'll get the idea. Plus, they packaged the bracelets in such short, narrow little plastic bags that each of the bracelets has an odd bend or kink in it.

It will dry and help seal the barb to hose connection. A small amount in the hose will not cause harm, but *you do not want the soap in the hose.*Cons: You will need more zip ties for a secure & clean install.

This book helps fill in some of those gaps. On the negative side, it's too short for my appetite on the subject and the treatment of everyone as solely seeking ways to increase their revenue (and not exploring the social work done by the Church) is disappointing.Also recommended: Everyday Life in Traditional Japan (Tuttle Classics of Japanese Literature) (Paperback) by Charles J.

There wasn't much way to see color examples, so I selected a 'safe' vanilla color. I have also seen synthetic shawls marked as Pashmina.The shawl arrived quickly, and was nicely folded and packed. It is very soft, and light weight. Since cashmere is much warmer than wool the light weight is actually a good thing in my opinion. The fabric is handwoven and as such shows some variation in the weave. I love handwoven fabric, so I did not find this an issue.The shawl has a lovely drape and hand, and I am seriously thinking about ordering another in a less 'safe' color."},{"rating":"2","title":"pashmina shawl","review":"The shawl is nice and large, is light but has a nice feel, and suits my needs quite well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A soldier telling it like it was.","review":"General Crook minces no words in his autobiography, a book that gives you real insight into one of the nation's most renowned Indian fighters. A quiet man in real life and somewhat of an enigma to those around him, he had a unique understanding and appreciation for Native Americans and the injustices heaped upon them. In later life, he attempted to use his influence to help better their conditions. Crook never took his biography to a publisher -- that only happened long after he was dead. If anything, his narrative leaves you wanting more detail and less modesty about the role he played in history. The editor has done an admirable job in filling in the missing pieces. An important book for anybody interested in the people who built the West, or in influential military leaders in American history. I enjoyed this book immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, updated take on the material","review":"This one is definitely not for medival purists. They have played with the simple lines of the source material, using all sorts of studio effects, although the basic music is presented using vocals and acoustic instruments. This experimental approach works quite well.And what they do with it comes off quite well. Big, boomy reverb, vocal drones, and some excellent drumming add stature to these songs.You get not only relatively well known medival pieces like -Chanterai por mon corage- and -Palastinalied-, two of the better tracks on the record, but also interesting music I was not as familiar with. -Imperator rex grcorum- is another standout track, given a nicely dramatic reading here."},{"rating":"2","title":"captivating and magical","review":"This album is one that brings me to distant, long ago yet ageless lands, among a people who live in magic and the mystery of life. The male singer has a rich, deep beautiful voice and the female singer's voice is beautiful also and perfectly matched with the music. The music itself a superb mixture of medeival music (including some chant) with a modern touch. The drum piece is incredible. The album is sung in french, but for me, not being able to understand the words just enables me to focus all the more on the music. Historically intriguing, also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Daimbert's In Trouble Again!","review":"When Daimbert took on the job as the royal wizard of Yurt, he thought the job would be a boring one. Every time Daimbert starts to wish something exciting would happen, he gets more than he bargained for. This time is no exception. The king of Yurt has gotten it into his head that he needs to go on a quest. He's heard rumors of a blue rose being raised in a far away land which is just what he needs to add to his rose garden. The king's nephew wants to find out why his father died. Joachim the priest wishes to make a pilgrimage to the holy land, and to his home. A prince of a nearby principality is seeking an ancient artifact said to have belonged to Solomon. On their journey, Daimbert and his friends run into treachery, intrigue, and powerful black magic, not to mention a huge green djinn. The plots in the book are wonderfully interwoven, and the whole book has a light-hearted, humorous feel to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PRETTY LAME!!!!!!!!!","review":"When we turn to television to answer our questions, it is obvious that the \\"BOOB TUBE\\" has taken over too much of our daily lives..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big hype for nothing","review":"Well in my opinion, the worst part was the pouch to mix in water; it tasted so horrible.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"This is the seventh book I've read in Asaro's Skolian series. It's also the first one that I found boring.

It is set in the Skolian Empire but not as invested in its epic history. I would put it in the same group as Asaro's other standalone books like The Phoenix Code and The Veiled Web. I actually prefer those to the \\"To Be Continued\\" world building trilogies.There is enough science to qualify these books for the science fiction section but it is the characters' interaction that keeps me interested. As another reviewer said, the huge difference in ages is disconcerting. It is mentioned as a fact but does not seem to influence the relationship as much as you would think.I liked the story very much and went immediately to see what else she had written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance squicked me out....","review":"I listened to the unabridged audio edition of this novel. It starts off okay with a young Los angelean teen discovering a cyborg-like pilot Althor from the future. She takes him home and eventually they have sex. He is 50+ years old and she is 17. The age discrepancy really squicked me out. I'm not a prude, but this story was not to my taste. What's with Asaro and her huge age gaps anyway? I dunno, I was disappointed. I prefer characters to be closer and age.As far as the narration goes- Anna Fields has never been a favorite, her masculine voices sound goofy and stilted. 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Juvenile","review":"Girl meets weird, otherworldly guy on the street in the middle of the Los Angeles slums well after midnight.

Sane, mature people just don't behave that way. I don't think the heroine's telepathic powers and instincts about people are a good excuse for setting up such a poor role model.I picked up this book primarily because I was curious tto see how the author would integrate romance with hard science fiction.

And it truly is an aesthetically beautiful piece of work.I have no complaints what so ever; My Mouse works perfectly I am even using it to play Links2003 (Golf). Don't expect to drop strokes right off the bat, it will take a round or two to get used to the \\"swing\\" just like any new \\"Club\\" would.

It's really meant for professional use. So casual artists; you may want to go with a smaller size, unless you really have the dough to spare.Let's just remember that it IS just a tool, much like Photoshop or Painter or any other artist's tool/medium. It won't magically make you an art master over-night."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate tool for so many projects","review":"I have wanted a Wacom tablet for years. When I was finally able to afford one for myself, I decided to go for the gusto and get the big'un. This tablet has allowed me to express myself in the digital medium far more than I ever axpected. Being left-handed, I could never really draw anything on the computer with a mouse using my right hand, and I could never truly control a mouse with my left hand either. Now with this tablet and the pen-stylus, I can draw directly into the computer and create artwork in Corel Painter, Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator, and I can draw frame-by-frame animation in Flash. There are too many new horizons to list for my creativity with this tablet. If you are creative and want to find a better tool to express yourself in the computer world, I STRONGLY suggest getting one of these tablet. Maybe not the biggest one, but at least one that will allow your creative juices to flow right onto your computer screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous and Fun","review":"Great product - love every minute I use it - smooth and accurate. The only thing to be aware of is that the software they include doesn't work. I had to call customer service (delightfully located in Washington, not India for a change).

While it was somewhat frustrating, that fixed the problem immediately (my cursor was magnetized to the upper left hand corner of my screen)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacom is a winner","review":"You can't go wrong with this drawing tablet.

Political satire is rare these days, and most of it is not very good. This is brilliant. From the first page to the last, from the Ted Kaczinsky bomber jacket to the J.

As it is, it comes at a point in the cd where it makes sense to muddy things up and get into an extended jam, like \\"Possum\\". When you first start listening to \\"Possum\\", the lack of conventional drums makes it a little hard to get into, but, for me, about eight minutes into the track it all starts feeling really good.If you like Reed's more experimental work (The Bells, Berlin), I think you'll be able to enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Observation","review":"With the total stereo separation between the guitar tracks, \\"Possum Day\\" sounds like Metal Machine Music slowed down.

I'm getting older and that may be why I found large chunks of the music to be grating without redemptive qualities.

The title cut sways, slow and steamy. \\"Mad\\", with all its horns, is great. And \\"Future Farmers\\" hearkens back to Reed's punk heritage. A great album overall, one of the best of 2000."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for an amzing album","review":"Although it's not exactly a concept album, many of the songs on Ecstasy carry a theme of a love that is falling apart. As a musician, Lou definately isn't falling apart and as a matter of fact, he's no where close. The album really gets under your skin in a way that few of my cds have. Most of the songs are very good. This isn't one of those albums that has two or three songs that are above average and the other stuff is just mediocre. My favorite song is \\"White Prism\\", but other fine songs include \\"Paranoia Key of E\\", \\"Like A Possum\\", \\"Rock Minuet\\", \\"Modern Dance\\", and \\"Big Sky\\".

I purchased the book based on a piece on NPR. I guess I misunderstood. I was looking for something more informative, educational and with much more about the babooons. Probably partly my fault. I should have known from the title; it's a memoir.I didn't do a page count, but it left me with the feeling that pages dedicated to life with the baboons were in the minority.It wasn't entertaining, interesting, or well-written enough to be a good novel. It wasn't educational or informational enough to be good non-fiction. There are great books, both fiction and non, about life experiences in Africa and also great books by/about primatologists and their work. In my opinion, this book isn't very good as either.Even as a memoir I didn't care for it, but it seems that most of the other reviewers did.

But there is no denying the power of the book, and for that I am willing to overlook its lack of structure, grammatical precision, and the fact that there is not as much info about the baboons as I would have hoped.

This is a great item to open or keep unopened for collectability. If you do open this item, that is where the good stuff happens to be. The sandtrooper figure has removable gear and can become a regular stormtrooper. Not to mention this sandtrooper has a removable helmet, bet you wouldnt know that unless you opened it. Same with the Darth Vader figure, he has a removable helmet as well, and is the best vader ever produced thus far. The princess leia is a rare piece itself as well, it was originally part of the early bird certificate mail in about a year ago. As for the C-3PO figure, it is from a rare line of figures. It is originally the Vintage Original Trilogy Collection (Votc) C-3PO. It was the rarest of the first set.

Plus they are antibacterial and leave the skin soft and hydrated. They just seem to be much better on my child's skin. In addition, they have proved useful in many other clean up situations. For example, I use them after my 1 year old gets out of the pool or has been in the sun to help get the chlorine and sunscreen off. Basically, they are fantastic anytime a regular baby wipe just isn't enough. Children get dirty and messy and sometimes they need a mini bath.

Coming to understand the flow of the slave trade (where most slaves were shipped to the Islands and Brazil), how the British ended slavery, that slavery existed in South America for years after the United States Civil War and continued in the Arab countries helps put a different slant on the issue.

Kind of a bad design in my opinion. Doing a manual reset to the correct security settings is certainly possible, but seems to be finicky (it requires a login to a web-based utility) and usually takes me a few tries to get it working correctly.

And now, less than 6 months after buying it, it's started to periodically lose all connectivity (wired, wireless, even phone) every few hours. The only solution I've found for this is to briefly unplug and re-plug the thing, which solves the problem for a while -- although 20% of the time I do this, it completely loses all the settings I'd programmed it with, forcing me to change the admin password, SSID, and wifi password over and over again.
