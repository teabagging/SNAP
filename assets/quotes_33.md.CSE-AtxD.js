Paint By Numbers is their first album and while a worthy disc from an excellent group, it no longer effectively captures what I feel has become the band's sound. There is no substitute for a live performance; it's not a show where the artists crack jokes inbetween songs, it's a non-stop audible experience unreplicatable on CD.For a more modern glance at their sound, check the iTunes music store for \\"Something Given\\" and \\"Why You.\\"Still, the album has several amazingly excellent tracks; it is one of a handful of albums I can listen to without skipping any.

All they did was play basketball, drink beer, curse a lot and try (but never succeed) to be funny. It was SO bad, after about 20 minutes of disgusting, yet vapid and nonsensical dialogue, we had to turn it off.Any high school student taking a film class would have been lucky to get a D- if they handed in this piece of $*># as their class project!---STAY AWAY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HYPNOTIZING MUSIC!","review":"THIS WILL DEFINITELY RAISE YOUR SPIRITS...A TRUE BRAZILIAN GEM I'VE DUG UP ON PANDORA.

This is a perfect example of why one's biography should not be written by a relative. As mentioned, the author oddly fails to mention within the pages that she is Harvey's sister in law. One can only assume that old family grudges or resentments lay behind what seems to be the author's distaste for her subject.There is precious little information on Harvey's films (barely a page on Darling) and most quotes from his co-stars are lifted from other biographies.The author would have made a wonderful source of information for a less biased and more talented biographer. I cannot recommend spending anything near full price for this bio, though I could justify a few dollars to read about Harvey's early life. Unfortunately, it is so clear that the author has an ax to grind, that I wasn't even sure her descriptions of Harvey's \\"Mommy Dearest\\" mother were accurate or the ultimate revenge against her own mother-in law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the Actor - Hate the book","review":"I was very happy to see a book about one of my favorite movie actors.It was maddening that it was written by his siter-in-law, who obviously has an ax-to grind.You might get the facts, but not the truth from this \\"Biography\\"See his movies instead of paying for this junk, as I have.Room at the Top, Manchurian Candidate, Summer and Smoke etc.It is odd that she does not reveal the nature of her relationship to LH in the narritive----I suggest reading it if you would like to know names dates etc., but do not expect a balanced insightful portrayal of an artist, that this author probably was resentful of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Voices & Reading Make This Audio Book a Dud","review":"I selected this audio book because I liked the idea of listening to a selection of well read stories and I thought the variety of stories looked interesting. The stories themselves are fine, but the audio book is marred by a selection of readers who lack expression and whose voice qualities are not sufficiently professional for an audio book. I expected the quality of reading to be comparable to that heard in NPR's \\"Selected Shorts.\\" This isn't even close. The first story was fine, I cringed through the second, felt mildly frustrated with the reading of the third, and gave up by the 4th. Perhaps it gets better since each story is read by a different person, but I couldn't spend 12 hours finding out.

Many seemed more appropriate for a collection of the worst stories of the century rather than the best. Most are simply descriptions of things, often laboriously stylized, without plot, dramatic tension or point. Most of the protagonists are passive, shallow and uninteresting.

Of the numerous stories he has collected, only a few are worth their weight in paper, but even they are NOT deserving of their inclusion in the BEST SHORT STORIES OF THE CENTURY.

Some country!I did like 5-6 stories a lot, making it percentage-wise little better than picking 55 stories out of a hat. My own list overlapped Updike's in one place (\\"The Things They Carried\\").The real problem: the exercise was misguided. Too many excellent short stories did not appear in Best American Short Stories of 19xx, which was the criteria for making the first cut here.

The buttons and D-pad are positioned very accessibly, and I've seen them fit perfectly into hands both large and small. The design is lightweight and highly ergonomic, but sturdy enough to stand up to the casual abuse that any game pad must endure.The WingMan gamepad does not come with any super-fancy bells or whistles- notably, no force-feedback- but if you're looking for a solid midrange game pad, you simply can't do better.

Considering that it only [was fairly inexpensive] and only has 56 pages, I didn't expect much. However, it was even lower than my expectations. I felt it lacked content and the authors provided little factual information to support the lifestyle they were trying to promote. The ten reasons they give to consider swinging is pathetic. The real stories they provide are oddly placed throughout the book and hardly worth reading. Even as an introductory book on swinging I would barely consider it acceptable.

The short stories that describe swinging situations could have been hotter, much much hotter, but I can tell that they we're doing their best to stay honest and not get too graphic with the details.One of the things that was grossly missing from this book was the discussion of fantasy fulfillment what was far too briefly discussed on less than one page.Of course it is only $5 and if you want something more in depth, pick up a copy of Ed and Dana's other book \\"Together Sex\\" of which this appears to be a Cliff Notes version of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more content","review":"This VERY BRIEF booklet doesn't offer anything new or particularly insiteful.

With the CF reader plugged into the USB port, my PC would crash anytime, without any reason. It took me some time before finding out that if I didn't leave the CF reader plugged when I wasn't using it, the problem would disapear. I still use the reader pretty often but I have to plug/unplug it every time.I use Win Me.

First off, the story holds promise and I'm convinced that Ms. Heggan can weave a pot together. Bad guy number one really made me mad! I actually found myself steaming. Abbie Di Angelo made me angry for a different reason. I just wasn't buying the victimization of the seemly self-aware person. How could anyone this smart, and with such great people skills be this much of a doormat? I didn't put the book down at that point. I bought the romance and her devotion to Rose, the first bad guy's ex-wife. Nice touch. I related well with Rose's circumstances.

If there had been I would not have bought this CD. We love Celtic Woman, love their ethereal music and enchanting voices and all their wonderful instruments. But this CD was NOT it. I really wanted a Christmas CD with a Celtic sound to it and only felt like one of the songs even felt that way. It sounds like plain old boring, anyone-can-sing-this Christmas songs. I wanted THEIR sound applied to the songs. They're not bad nor is the singing bad (though some songs were a little dull and skip-worthy) but this CD just wasn't what I was hoping for at all.

I am an avid collector of interesting Christmas music, so while I consider the album to be delightful, it is not 'outstanding' in the true sense; too many 'common' carols, hence 4 stars rather than 5. I would have liked to hear more tunes particular to the British isles and Celtic tradition, but perhaps I can hope for that on a future holiday album. I did enjoy \\"Christmas Pipes\\" very much, and my favorite track would have to be the treatment of \\"Carol of the Drum\\" (\\"Little Drummer Boy\\") with the Gregorian chant lead-in and minor-to-major key transition.

I was wrong. Of the 4 movies, only two are halfway decent. The first, Dark Alibi, is embarrassing in its use of black actor Martin Moreland aka Birmingham Brown. The worst combination of stereotyping and bad schtick are visited on Moreland who plays off Benson Fong as \\"number 3 son.\\" Fong is dreadful in this role and Chan seems angry or bored or both. The other three movies are fair but the plots are weak and the sidebar shenanigans of Moreland and Victor Sen Young (back, thank goodness, as Chan's number 2 son) detract from what storyline there is. Save your money for something better than this set! A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"MORE MONOGRAM CHAN FILMS","review":"Warner is stepping up to the plate, giving us Chan fans a great set with four of the Monogram Studio Chan films never released on DVD.

She had already published \\"Music Minus One\\" and she was in the process of writing \\"Happy Family.\\" Not only are the poems in this collection beautiful, but the language she employs is a tribute to her artistry. She creates glorious imagery through sounds and reduces the pain of adolescence to a poignant and memborable symbol.

She began by asking if anyone was from New Jersey - and I immediately knew I liked her. She was engaging and kind, and when she began reading from her book, Music Minus One, I wanted to take it from her hands and read it in one sitting. I purchased two of her books - one for me and one for my mother. What I didn't expect was that my mom read the poems, and then annotated each one with her own memories of growing up in New Jersey. She did the same with Happy Family, and I am thrilled at the prospect of adding another to my collection - which has become my most prized possession. Jane Shore takes you there - even if you never been, and for me, introduced a world inhabited by my mother - one I may have otherwise not shared with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album stinks!","review":"After reading the reviews from Amazon, I purchased this album (it took nearly a month to receive it).

What a letdown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely comprehensive for travelers","review":"I know that the book has gotten poor reviews for lacking things that a normal OED-type dictionary would have, but I'm approaching this from a traveler's standpoint. I've spent time in Italy, and being solo and unable to really speak any Italian outside of basic stuff, I need a thorough reference that fits in a pocket that I can refer to when I run into an Italian word I don't understand (which is a lot of them.)

The mermaid and the umbrella girls on roller skates, the sort of ballerinas under \\"V\\" and the image of the two little girls with dark bangs reading the red books!!!! I would have poured over these pictures as a kid (and I am doing just that today for good measure).

Obviously it does not comment on his career post-1989, but it provides a superb commentary on his major works up til then. The biographical information is interesting, but this is not a biography of the MAN Penderecki, but simply the COMPOSER. A chronology of his life is given - birth, education, travels, performances etc. - but we learn very little of Penderecki as a person, and how he expressed himself through music. This is unfortunate and I hope one day to see a true biography of Penderecki. So, as I said, this book is primarily useful in the commentary on Penderecki's compositions. It does require some knowledge of musical theory beforehand, but for those who meet that requirement and are interested in Penderecki's music, this book is invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"I bought this for my 24 year old brother for Christmas.

Since the phone had bluetooth, I thought it would be nice to have a wireless headset for convenience and safety (in car).The first night I used it at home I loved it. Nice sound, easy to use. My only complaint was that the device was not more adjustable; it was not as comfortable as other wired headsets I have used.The next day I used it while in the car and found I hated the thing. I ended up pluggin in my old wired headset. First of all, I could not get the volume up high enough to hear the callers over the car's wind noise. I also could not get the speaker closer to my ear (lack of adjustments). However, the straw that broke the camel's back was that half the calls I made / received did not connect from the phone to the headset.Nice idea. Not ready for prime-time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie.","review":"I had never SEEN \\"American In PAris\\", but decided to explore the music first.

I'm using the isolate after I finished this one. Both are solid products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feels like a milkshake!","review":"Overall the product is easy to drink and for me that is all that matters. What is the point in buying protein if you can't even drink all of it. Syntha 6 is also a reasonable price. The strawberry flavor is okay but is way better than other strawberry protein drinks I have tried. Chocolate is probably the best flavor available if you like chocolate milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tasty Protien","review":"I've ordered Syntha-6 a few times before and I have to say the Chocolate Milkshake is the best flavor... though they seem to all be pretty good. Order came fast with no issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"This is definitely one of the better tasting protein powders out there.

Much more potent than cheap-o powders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately the container was cracked & I won't get to taste it. :(","review":"upon recieving this, the lid was cracked & powder was spilling out into the box.

Also one of the best tasting shakes Ive ever had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great taste!","review":"I have tried many protein products in my lifetime, but this one is by far the best tasting one of them all. It works great as a dietary supplement as does everything from BSN. The vanilla milkshake flavor is the best. Mix it with some milk and orange juice and it tastes like a orange 50/50 bar! so good and so good for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes like drinking a milkshake, I feel like I'm on my cheat day!","review":"Taste is great I've had the peanut butter with chocolate one. The fact that it has some aminos in it is very cool. I use one scoop in 8oz of skim milk right after my workout. (lifting and cardio) I use this as a meal. Im cutting right now and it hasn't hindered like a mass gainer or other protein with filler ingredients would which is awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn good value","review":"I've found Syntha 6 to be pretty decent. I'm not a hard core lifter, so I usually just get an inexpensive protein powder. But since the price is significantly less on Amazon than in the store, I decided to give it a try. I like the blend of different sources of protein, though some of them (such as whey concentrate) are on the lower end of the quality spectrum. It also tastes amazing. I usually mix with milk, but even with water it's got a rich, creamy taste.It's also a bit high on the calorie scale to be super good for cutting, but lower than most bulking products. Even still, overall, BSN is a respected company and this is a darn good product, especially at the Amazon price. Signed up for the recurring shipments, so the price was less than $22 (it's since gone up a few bucks)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's My New Favorite Protein Shake","review":"I mix Syntha-6 with skim milk and it tastes great. It's a very high-quality Whey protein and if you actively workout, you need to takes lots of protein to support muscle growth and recovery.I used to exclusively drink MuscleMilk but switched over because I personally feel MuscleMilk has too many additional nutrients and other additives in it that I'm already getting from other sources. It's chock full of nutrients and minerals, and that's great if that's what you want, but I already take multi-vitamins and eat well - All I want is a straight whey protein shake that mixes well and tastes great. Syntha-6 is the answer. Just make sure you shake it long enough in your mixing bottle otherwise you'll have chunks in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"best bang for my buck","review":"syntha-6 products work and they don't make me gag. This stuff REALLY can be palatable when mixed with water. One thing to be aware of - this product is more of a meal replacement product than straight protein powder. There are small amounts of 'good fats' as well as digestive enzymes added. Oh yeah, and amazon's prices are the best on the net."},{"rating":"2","title":"This + SizeOn = good results","review":"I have been working out a consistant 4 pretty hard days per week. I use SizeOn during the workout and slam one of these immediately following the workout.

I found my results were even better when I would use BSN's NO-Xplode pre-workout and Syntha-6 post work out. BSN has done a great job with working on the taste of their products. Syntha-6 mixes very easily in every flavor I've tried so far, and Vanilla Ice Cream is the best tasting protein powder I've ever used. The runners-up are all Syntha-6 flavors as well. I prefer to use skim milk with my protein shakes for a little extra protein and an even better taste.Highly recommended in Vanilla Ice Cream flavor or in Chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great protein","review":"Tastes great and easy to mix. I bought this only b/c of all the good reviews I've read on it, and so far, it's lived up to the hype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Value","review":"Overall has a pretty good taste, but lower protein per serving than I thought I was getting at 25 grams.

Overall I'd probably stick with Muscle Milk if I were satisfied with less protein just due to the amazing taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"No lies about the taste.

It's not the best I've tried, but it's close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid protein powder!","review":"Straight to the chase:The 2.91 lb tub is a good amount relative to price. It should last you 2.5-3.5 weeks if used fairly.It tastes good. It is not Ensure or Sport Shake obviously, but it is not a pain to guzzle down. Overall it tastes smooth and non-chalky. I used ~7 ounces of whole milk with one full scoop (Vanilla flavor Syntha 6) when I first used it.It does not blend completely with basic stirring; you will get some soft protein clumps in there, but it is not a deal breaker. If you are willing to use this product in the first place, you can easily look past it.Expect to work out some digestive \\"kinks\\" initially haha. Drink up before bed and you get the protein you need; GOOD product! Don't hesitate to get this stuff, it honestly works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taste","review":"Gave it to the youjngest Son , HE LIKED IT , I did try it but i'm not into it , but did give it a good based on what he told me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible taste","review":"I'm surprised by all the positive reviews - the main reason why I purchased the product in the first place.I ordered the Chocolate Mint Flavor. The taste is sour and rancid. I had tried Chocolate Mint flavor before by Muscle Milk and it was the best protein shake I ever had. This in comparison is awful.Whether or not the protein shake does it's job, however, is another question. And, of course, this review is based solely off the taste of the product.To drink the stuff, I usually pour the powder in a cup along with milk and a banana then blend it together. I've been drinking my protein powder like this for years and so it can't be the milk or the banana being sour - it's BSN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sweet","review":"I decided to order the Carmel latte version of this, though it was way to sweet for me. I tried with just 20oz of water, and the flavor was awful to try and gulp down. I even tried with milk which made it twice as sweet. I however decided to make my drinks using about 2 shots of espresso and a splash of milk which dulled down the sweetness, but it's still not my favorite. My boyfriend purchased the chocolate mint which is about 5x better tasting than the carmel latte. I do not recommend this to anyone, it does not come near to what a true Carmel latte even tastes like. Good product otherwise, it's a bit high in carbs & fats, but it's probably one of the better tasting protein shakes out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and Creamy","review":"This protein shake I take with 1 and a half scoops with 8 ounces of water to get my full 30 grams of protein I need everyday. The taste is rich and creamy, I found that after you mix it if you leave it for a minute or two it is much more creamy. This shake fills me up and I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best","review":"I wanted a good protein powder and this one was found to be the better one from Amazon. It contains a mix of different proteins and I like that. It is No : 2 in best seller category of Protein powder and most of the other brands contained artificial sweeteners and unhealthy ingredients. But to my surprise, I fund that this item also contains some dangerous ingredients. A person told me that there is a little high Cadmium content in it. Now I take this powder only every other day. It is a little bit sweet and I don't know why a brand like BSN needed to sweeten this product with artificial sweeteners. It forms chunks when mixed in milk or water with a spoon. But if you use a juicer, it gets dissolved easily. If the ingredients were of high quality & if it was not sweet, I would have given it a 5 star. Now I will better go for Natures Best Isopure Natural Low Carb Unflavored brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tastes amazing.","review":"But it has real cookie pieces in it.

Spent an hour on the phone with their \\"overflow\\" customer service (Vitacost) and am not satisfied with their wishy-washy response.

Plus more protein per scoop.I honestly couldnt tell you if it works any better then Muscle milk because I can't stomach the syntha-6 alone. I REGRET my purchase.

I can't tell if it does anything for your body but i never could with other shakes.Overall, I would recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Quality and Good Tasting","review":"My husband and I started P90X and we wanted a good-tasting, high quality protein powder to incorporate into our diets. Syntha-6 was highly recommended on a number of professional websites so we bought the chocolate peanut butter flavor. It is delicious - we almost feel guilty drinking it after a workout. We've been using it instead of the P90X recovery drink and it has worked very well. I also put a half spoon into my oatmeal in the morning and have found I do not need sugar or butter - it tastes great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard_A","review":"I find the syntha-6 to be quite tasty.

I believe the second or third ingredient is sunflower oil. I noticed that after two weeks of taking this several times a day I put on some unwanted fat. Not a good sign and unusual considering I have a very healthy diet and am a competitive athlete. I replaced this w/ ON's protein instead which provides 24g of protein with only 120 calories.

I tried this before I read the label (silly me) and didn't realize it contained Sucralose(splenda). I don't eat artificial sweetners and this product(one half scoop) caused a massive migraine. I found it a little deceiving that the description says it has no Aspartame, when it does include other artificial sweetners. If this isnt a concern for you the flavor (Chocolate Milkshake) was good, but it was fairly clumpy. I returned this to amazon, which, as always, was a fast and easy process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste..... Not so good.","review":"I ordered this product after reading all the great reviews for it. I drank some the first day I received it.

Maybe it was the Egg ingredient that caused the gas, Im not sure but it was rough.

It is the best by far. I mix it as is and sometimes add frozen fruit. I needed a good protein supplement because of my rigorous exercise regimen (Insanity by Beach Body) and the other products that I was using wasn't sufficient. I was introduced to it by 2 Deputy Sheriffs that I work with at my job. They are athletic and sport coaches. When they recommended it, I figured that I would give it a try. I found the price cheaper on amazon (especially using subscribe & save)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing protein shakes!!! Love all the flavors!!!","review":"I've started drinking this product to supplement my long run days, and loved the chocolate flavor. Someone recommended I try Syntha-6 for the high protein, and I've been hooked on all the different flavors for a while now. A few months ago I started a type of bootcamp style workout at a local organization and after each VERY intense workout I make sure I drink one of these shakes and have a banana. Awesome way to recover! I would recommend any of the flavors...love them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Say what you will. 80 lbs lost says it all","review":"Starting using his as a meal replacement for breakfast and sometimes lunch. using this and an exercise program i lost 80 lbs in 7 months. size 42 to a loose size 34 pants. tons of energy and feel great inside and out.

The reviewers are right. You got to try it. Taste better than Nestle quik!What I like about it is that it dissolves easily with liquid and still taste great even with water so additional calories!. Other protein drinks taste like soy and I just had to add like bananas to mask the taste. Some other protein powder in chocolate flavor taste nasty with just water so I have to add milk! (more gassy me!)And with most protein powders you need to use a blender to really mix it well. This one you just shake it like a bartender and no more powder.simple 1 scoop + 6 oz cold water = thick perfect shake . enough amount ."},{"rating":"2","title":"tastes like Starbucks","review":"I love BSN. Mochaccino tastes a lot like a starbucks frappuccino. SYNTHA 6 is smooth and creamy without that gritty protein taste. I actually enjoy drinking this protein shake"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bad Value.","review":"At first glance this protein seems great. It gives 22 grams of protein per serving and appears to be quite cheap given that with subscribe and save you can buy five pounds for roughly $34. Unfortunately, other products routinely provide 25 grams/per serving and they do it in a total gram serving of 30-33. These other products are providing you with a product that is roughly 80% protein. A serving of Syntha-6 is a bloated 44 grams and only half of that (50%) is protein. That also means that per pound you only get 10 servings versus 15 servings from a regular 30-gram serving. This breaks down to $7.14/pound and 3.17 cents per gram of protein, which is really high. A mix of protein from a custom mix site is about 3.3 cents per gram including shipping. Some people might want to use this as a meal-replacement protein but it is always much cheaper and better to just add simple foods to your protein shake to get those extra calories. I would recommend buying something higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quarter Empty","review":"I decided to get a different flavor of the Syntha-6, and I was extremely disappointed to see that over a quarter of the container was empty.

And when you mix it with milk, you don't care about the \\"milkshake\\" flavor anyway.-> Banana = awesome !!! This is so delicious, especially with cold shaken milk where it totally feels like a milkshake without the fat and bad calories !!-> Chocolate Peanut Butter = very tasty ! I am not a huge fan of artificial peanut butter flavors, but this one is delicious and definitely stops your hunger by making you feel you eat a dense meal.All the syntha 6 shakes I tried were very onctuous, which adds a nice texture to the already delicious flavors and help your body to feel like it is having a lot of calories, even though it's only one shake.perfect for before-to-bed shake for your muscles to grow during the night and not to starve when you wake up"},{"rating":"2","title":"By far the best tasting out there","review":"Syntha-6 is by far the most tolerable protein powder out there, even bordering on tastey. My favorite is the chocolate milkshake, but the vanilla ice cream and chocolate peanut butter are very good too. Ultimately it is just a method of putting descent quality protein into my mouth, and I'm far more likely to drink shakes if they are syntha-6 as opposed to optimum, cytosport, or EAS.I bought mine from the seller TigerOTC, and am very please with them.The bottom line is that Syntha-6 is top quality stuff. 6g of fat for satiety and proper hormone production, 5g of fiber, and 22g of protein. A great recipe for beefcake!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BSN Syntha 6 Protein Powder Vanilla Ice Cream","review":"I have tried protein powders in the past and to me, they were awful.

It is foamy. thick and tastes great. This will be a regular product for me because I don't eat very much daily (1000-1200 calories, if that) and I need the protein.

I base this on these criteria:TASTE - [referring to this Vanilla Ice Cream flavor only] is awesome because for me it adds richness to anything I've blended it with.TEXTURE - this is by far the smoothest I have used. I have actually blended half a scoop in 8 oz. of milk WITH A SPOON BY HAND and had ZERO lumps.VALUE - Purchasing through Amazon [and selecting the automatic shipping option], I feel it is an outstanding price for the quality.QUALITY - in terms of, does the product do what it claims? Well, I am naturally a person with lean muscle [5' 9\\" 145 lbs, approx. 8% body fat] and have been active in martial arts for over 15 years.

This does a good job for someone who does not intend to spend a lot on proteins and other supplements after workout.

It is an effective protein blend that also has 20% your daily value in fiber.

Great results and great flavor are a hallmark of this effective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most delicious protein drink I ever had!","review":"This stuff really does taste like milkshake. I was spoiled by Optimum Nutrition for over four years but decided to give this a shot since I heard so many good things about it. I don't think I will ever go back to ON. This is absolutely delicious and mixes very well in water and milk. One thing I would caution, however, is to realize the scoop is much larger than most other whey protein scoops like Optimum Nutrition. What I normally do is take the scoop from my old tub and use it with my new tub since the new scoop is usually deep in the tub from shipment. Halfway through this tub I found the new scoop and was shocked. Guess I was only getting like 15 grams of protein postworkout LOL"},{"rating":"1","title":"GNC Wheybolic Extreme 60 is better","review":"I started working out a year ago, starting with GNC Wheybolic Extreme 60. It's much lower cholesterol and fat than Syntha-6. I lost 5 lb of fat and gained back 9 lb of muscle in 6 months with Wheybolic Extreme. Healing time was always less than 24 hours. It tasted like a rich smooth milkshake.Then I switched to BSN Syntha-6 because it was almost half the price of Wheybolic and I was recommended it by a huge bodybuilder. The mochaccino flavor is pretty good, but is chaulkier than Wheybolic. It's not a perfect milkshake consistency. Recovery time was almost extended to 3 days - that's like as if I wasn't taking any protein at all. I also have not gained a single pound in the the past 3 months with Syntha-6. It just doesn't work.I also looked up Consumer Reports 2010 on protein powders. Syntha-6 contains many small, but legal, doses of poisonous metals. Wheybolic does not. I'm pretty sure I'm going back to Wheybolic."},{"rating":"2","title":"CARAMEL LATTE -Great product, Great price, Killer taste!","review":"Pros-This protein powder has really been a great product to lose weight. I am currently in a weight loss competition, and drinking one serving every morning after my workout. Assist with building lean muscle, and fills you up until lunch time. At first I was mixing it with 1 cup of skim milk. But recently, I have been adding 1 serving of espresso, and half a cup of water. The texture is still creamy even with water/coffee, and the flavor is AWESOME with this combination. I am really having a hard time purchasing any other flavor since I look forward to this every morning.Mixes well (I use a blender), and never clumps or have any grainy textures.Of course the price is GREAT......

Mainly because my body does not agree with almost every other shake, i either get bloated or feel nauseous afterwards.Syntha has been a miracle worker for me since I did not think my body agreed with protein shakes.I tried both strawberry shake and chocolate peanut butter. Strawberry works well with just water while the chocolate peanut butter it tastes better with milk and just \\"ok\\" with water.Syntha does not mix as well as ON Gold standard so you will need a blender bottle or a regular blender to mix this unless you don't mind little clumps here and there.Shipping was fast - got it in one day and of course the price can't be beat - it is only $25 with Auto-Delivery vs $36 at vitamin shoppe and 50+ at other stores.Amazing value, great taste and it is perfect before going to bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best tasting, mixing isn't perfect but OK","review":"It's delicious. In milk it mixes OK but not perfectly unless you stir for a long time. It mixes at least as well as any other powder I've tried and tastes better than all of them except the stuff at Sams which is similar. Anyway, no complaints, it's a good price which is why I tried it and it seems to work. I'm not a hard core muscle builder but I like to drink this after I lift. 5 pounds lasts me for months.

The taste is quite smooth and pleasant, and I'm very impressed with how much they minimized the artificial taste that most protein powders get from their sweeteners. It hardly has any of that fake sugar taste at all. I wouldn't call it delicious, but it's the closest a powder has come to actually tasting like a chocolate shake, at least out of the ones that I've tasted. Unfortunately, it doesn't mix as well as other formulas. I usually end up getting some chunks even when I dilute it over the suggested amount and shake vigorously. The other powder I use, a whey mix by Muscle Milk, mixes far better.This is the powder I use this powder for extended recovery, namely right before bed and in the morning, if I'm worried that my food protein intake won't be sufficient. The casein composition makes the powder just right for this purpose. I do not use this right after the gym; a whey isolate is better for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can not wait to have breakfast shake in the morning","review":"Two years and I still love having this chocolate milkshake in the morning.

The Mochaccino flavor had a slight sharp after taste. I would not purchase these flavors again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darn good product.","review":"Syntha-6 rates pretty high for me in a few important categories.- It mixes easily. In fact, it will mix with just a little spoon action. Anyone who uses any sort of nutritional powder knows you can't over-rate this quality. We've all gagged down clumpy morning smoothies, and scrubbed gunk out of our mixers. This stuff mixes like a dream.- Really does seem to provide sustained energy. I've felt better since using it, had more energy, and less inclination to snack.- Delivers bang for the buck. It's one of the more reasonably-priced alternatives I've used.However it does fall short of my expectations on one point: It's WAY too sweet. Cloyingly sweet, I'd say. I've taken to mixing up some fruit with it to cut some of the sweetness. I'm not particularly happy about this, but it won't keep me from finishing the jar. It will make me cautious about trying any of the other products in this line, though.Bottom line: If you don't mind uber sweet products, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Taste","review":"Chocolate Peanut Butter is the best tasting protein powder I've ever had, and by a good margin.

Like best protein shake I have ever had based on powder alone.

Recommend to anyone bulking or in the market for protein supplements."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality product","review":"This protein powder is great. I've only tried the 'Vanilla Ice Cream' flavor so far, but it tastes wonderful. Appears to be a pretty good bang-for-the-buck, and consists of high quality ingredients and minimal additives. Mixes extremely easy, too. Many protein powders I have used practically require a blender to eliminate dry chunks floating around in it. With Syntha-6, that's anything but the case. You can add a scoop of this to whatever you please in a regular water bottle, give it a quick shake, and it mixes completely. I'll definitely be purchasing more of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best shakes!!","review":"These are the best tasting protein shakes out there, this size lasts a while, great value!!!

I work out and eat healthy for myself so I have no problems ensuring the protein shake I drink is actually palatable. 22g of protein per scoop makes for a great supplement to my normal day to day protein intake and if you have a waffle iron I'd highly suggest mixing a scoop in with some waffle mix.

There's very little to say for this, except that it wasn't all that expensive and the cover looks good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-absorbed designer angst","review":"There is actually a theory of fun buried in the book, but the time spent developing the theory is minimal.

'nuff said on that topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bit of a Letdown","review":"I didn't really feel like there was much of substance. The same items/examples were rehashed multiple times, but not in a way that made it a slow reveal or created a more profound understanding of that example in the context of what was being discussed. Quite frankly this was a quick read that had more nostalgia and self-justification for why making games is a real job than any real discussion behind a theory of what makes things fun. Don't get me wrong, he does bring up some valid points regarding the role that games play and always have played in society regarding teaching valuable lessons, but I felt that the real meat of this book could have been done in a quarter of the space than the already brief book spread it out across.

However, the mass market edition was actually published before the trade book edition -- and it suffers from having a much lower level of editing that the later edition.

One can understand how easily this type of scenario could happen and the churning of bureaucracy is more about making money than helping people. As well as being a little frightening there is a predictable love story running through the book that takes the sting out of what could easily be a real life situation.

All disc burners that I know about use a 480i quality, the same as standard def TV, and much worse than DVDs (480p, except for some junk discs). You can't use 480i in a home theater because it looks like fuzzy crap when blown up on a big screen. You can also burn it yourself for next to nothing if the film shows up on cable/sat.

But instead of interpreting and parsing these interviews as other biographers have done, Ms. Blackburn allows the interviewees to speak for themselves in extended excerpts. The result is as if we were allowed the privilege of sitting down with several of Ms. Holidays friends and acquaintances and hearing the real skinny for ourselves. For those of us who are devotees of Lady Day, this book is a revelation and a reminder that despite their towering achievements, all our heroes and heroines have feet of clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not brilliant - good research, badly put together","review":"Julia Blackburn's biography of Billie Holiday is disappointing. She makes poor use of what appears to be excellent research by Linda Kuehl. Some of the interview material is fascinating, but it is poorly cobbled together.It's small wonder that this book gets intolerant and hateful reviews like that of Desiree Troy (though I suspect this particular reviewer is very young and inexperienced, given their extremely naive perspective). You get very little sense from reading this book of why Billie Holiday's music is still important to people nearly fifty years after her death, and seventy years after her prime.You cannot evaluate Billie Holiday just from reading this book, and in fact you probably shouldn't read it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Window Back In Time","review":"Based on interviews from 1971 with people who knew Billie (mostly musicians), this book is somewhat lacking in cohesion, but offers a good historical narrative of the life and times of Billie, and more broadly, the Harlem community and black jazz culture of the 30's, 40's and 50's. Sometimes the subject matter veers away from Lady Day, and centers more on the speaker's life, which may be of less interest, but overall, where else are you going to hear directly from those who knew her personally? Each chapter centers on a different interviewee, sometimes quoting, often paraphrasing. The book also makes it clear that Ms. Holiday was hounded by the federal lawmen ostensibly for her drug use, but more because she was a celebrity, and that harassment was part of what broke her spirit in the end. A worthwhile read, although some photos would have been nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story behind the headlines","review":"I was still young when Jordan retired for the first time and a few months later decided to play baseball. At the time I thought Jordan was show boating a little and wanted to show everyone how great of an athlete he was. Other theories was that he left basketball because of a gambling problem. After watching this documentary it's clear that he left basket ball because of the death of his father and a dream the two of them had. It an amazing story and this is a great film. One of my favorite from the 30 for 30 series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showed he was better ball player than what most people think","review":"I enjoyed most of the 30 for 30 videos. I have some of DVD including this one. This showed that he actually was a better ballplayer than what most people think and if the strike didn't happen or ended before 1995, he could had a legit chance in the Majors especially since the D-Backs and the Rays started in 1998. I believe as a Rays fan, if he did play for the Rays for a year or two and barely hit .200. His number would have been retired. Plus his B-Ham jersey is still the highest sold Barons jersey of all-time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I own most of Kelly's workouts. Some I like better than others. This one is awesome and reminds me of a Cathe workout. It is true that the workouts are longer than the advertised 30 minutes, especially with warmup and cool down, but that's fine by me. Both segments are total body routines. Additionally, there is a separate ab workout. I didn't find it boring at all and the music is quite good too. I'm glad I bought it.

I have quite a collection going, mainly because I get bored with exercise so easily so I need to change it up. Being pressed for time, I'm always interested in a quick workout. This is by far the WORST dvd I have ever purchased.First, the workouts are well over 40 minutes. Second, the upper body movements are dangerous. They involve throwing and jerking motions with hand weights that left me in a lot of pain (and not the good kind).Third it was boring. Repeating the same moves for four, five cycles. There are much better dvds out there.

The black and white images convey such innocence in the children.

Although I read this entire book, it is not about the tools for Peak Performance as much as it is an investigative journalist's study of the technologies being used, and those that have been developed by governments for the control of other people or the manipulations of their brainwaves. Lots of technical information, nothing in the way of usable tools for an individual to use in controlling their own mind or for achieving peak performance. This is more of a masters degree paper on the subject of these technologies than a book for learning anything new. Almost a historic look at the development of these tools.

I use it almost daily, minces 1 clove and mutiple cloves without a problem.

But yet, they did have a UK Top 10 hit with 'United', and other tracks of theirs saw some favorable...albeit unlikely attention. Chalk it all up to the fine, aggressive period this all took place in: the late 70s, and the halcyon days of punk in bally olde England. This is an interesting sampler, which brings together some of TG's album highlights with some hard-to-find 7\\" tracks. Oddly, though, some things which should fit here are missing; 'Discipline' comes immediately to mind, for example.

The book still sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever at best.","review":"This was Bukowski's last published work before he died. It's an old-fashioned detective novel, or a parody of one, and an allegory about a man getting ready to die. It's clever at best. There are some great one-liners. At worst, it's convoluted and easy. Taken in context of Bukowski's life, it's a big middle finger to all the literary elitism Bukowski despised. But as a stand-alone book, it's little more than its title suggests: pulp. Fluff.

Right.Too many of the passages in the book, through the eyes of any person today, forty years later, would be seen as just plain racist, homophobic, pedophilic and misogynistic. This book just isn't funny, like the other Evan Tanner novels. It does not hold together, and it doesn't make any sense. Sometimes, Block's books can sag a little and then pick up.

If you have high arches and narrow feet, I'd recommend getting a whole size smaller. This style of sandal leaves about a half inch of sole surrounding the perimeter of your foot.

The \\"feel\\" was like that of a soap opera, the sound poor, and script, well... let's not go there.However, the story itself is powerful and important. At last, someone had the guts to show the bigotry, hypocrisy and outright hate of the religious right in America, which cherry-picks from the bible in order to justify homophobia, while ignoring other equally important messages in the bible. The fact that their bile can result in innocent loss of life is immaterial to them.From this point of view, \\"The Last Year\\" outclasses 90% of all other movies, including so-called \\"blockbusters\\", which are generally devoid of any real substance or meaning.

There are also alot of other new extras that you will just have to play to find out. All in all this is a great game for any hardcore fans of the original and hardcore racers.

Bette Midler can do shopping malls, with Richard Drefuss maybe, but not with Woody. By the way if one really watches what goes on in the average shopping mall one would realize that there is no time for marriage counselling, serious dinner and dancing or movie theather sex or any other kind of self-help therapy as portayed here. Or any inclination to do such things. The deal is shop until you drop. Tunnel vision is the required virtue here. If you want to see Woody where he lives watch the films Manhattan or Annie Hall. If you want to watch Bette where she lives watch Down and Out in Beverly Hills or The Rose. Don't watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"As someone who normally likes both Woody Allen and Bette Midler, this movie is a huge disappointment. The screenplay is trite, cliche, and only slightly funny; the setting is uninteresting; and the choice of music on the soundtrack is so ill-selected it becomes annoying. There is nothing creative or very funny about this movie at all--I don't even think I smiled (and this from someone who loves comedy and the two actors!). And the scenes with the mime were annoying and superfluous--even if you like mimes. Although both Midler and Allen give good performances, their on-screen chemistry together just never takes off, and their \\"couple-hood\\" is never very convincing. The truth is, their good acting just doesn't make up for the awful screenplay, and the fact that movie has no plot worth caring about.

There are many things to like about the documenary, such as the behind-the-scenes footage, the interviews, and the composition of video and sound.

There is no summary of what happened before these 4 games, and not even a mention of the big drumming Boston took in game 3. It doesn't even do a good job of summarizing these 4 games. It's largely just a bunch of nearly-random 5 second clips strung back to back (highlights from local news casts, fan comments, very short clips from the games, clubhouse interviews, etc).

In their attempt to rerecord the music in stereo the sound has become muffled with no dynamic range at all. The stereo effects are just wishful thinking. My old Metro LP sounds better.

The film was a mess but a big hit nevertheless. Isolated from the movie, the soundtrack reveals the truly lush qualities and sterling artistry in the performances. Conrad Salinger's arrangements, per usual, are amazing and unmatched. The talent represents as assemblage of peerless artists. So why is the sound here so muddy, muddled, off balance and just strange? I don't get it. The original 10-inch M-G-M L.P. sounded better! Annette Warren is a remarkable singer, but Ava Gardner's vocals are also tremendously moving. The lady who should have gotten the part of Julie is Lena Horne but the powers at M-G-M were too chicken to cast her. Still, her good friend Gardner is devastating in the role.

See what the fuss is about!I have this film and I know the track, and it is just totally inferior. It is also too happpy. Show Boat is NOT supposed to be glad tidings. It is NOT a musical.

To return is too costly.I intended it to replace a 6 drawer rolling cart, where in a move,one wheel was broken off.

Thus,whatever you have in the rear of the drawer becomes accessibleonly by moving the front items out of the way or removing completely.Also, these drawers are more difficult to completely remove if youdesire to do so to have easy access to contents if working awayfrom the cart. These drawers open out only about 8 1/2\\" or so.A much better model, and the same as my broken one, is:NMC-360-Top Black (116106).

The unit itself is pretty handsome, however, workmanship of the leather just seemed okay. There was a minor scratch in the leather edging that was covered by the hinged cover. The primary reason that I returned it however is because the unit I received appeared to be defective - the motor would not operate when I installed a fresh set of batteries. It worked fine with the supplied AC adapter... and ran pretty quiet with this power source. I wanted to have the option to use batteries for when I traveled.

I ended up finishing the book at 4 am and needed to go to work at 7:30!I haven't read all the other books in the series but I can only say this one caught my interest so much I bought my own copy. There's adventure and some humour and some really original aliens running around in the background. I hate to give away a good story, but this one had me really holding my breath during an amazing airbattle with a pilot who has been shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A (long overdue) triumphant return!","review":"After a decade long wait, I was thrilled when my copy of Plan B arrived. I promised myself that I would savor it slowly, but soon found myself totally immersed in the story, and devoured it in a single evening. Then I went back and read it again the next day. Plan B is everything that fans of Liad had hoped for and more. I'm so pleased to see that despite the long intermission, the authors have lost none of their power to create truly memorable characters and a gripping story.

No sooner do they arrive on the planet of Lytaxin, however, than they find themselves in the middle of a full-scale invasion by hostile forces. Meanwhile, Val Con's family are searching desperately for them, as are their original enemies from the Department of the Interior. With non-stop action and wonderful characters, this book should please old fans and create new ones for this continuing saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plan B rates an A","review":"I waited for 10 years for this book to be published. I have been a fan of Lee and Miller since the first three books in the series were published in the late 80's, and being left in mid-crisis at the end of Carpe Diem was torture. Finding Plan B a week or so ago was like rain in the desert. I've read it three times now, cover to cover, in 5 days, and can honestly say that the book is an excellent read. The characters are developing nicely, and the background of the universe is also starting to fill in very well. It's paced well, has a lot of humor in it, and still has all the \\"golly - gosh - gee whiz\\" that good space opera should have.If you're a fan of Moon, Weber or Brust, this should be right up your alley.If you haven't read Lee and Miller before, do it now. (I envy you your first taste!) If you do know them, but haven't read Plan B, do it now.

Because my husband made off with it, and read it in virtually one sitting. This was fortunate, as I wouldn't have been willing to wait very long to get my hands on it. It's a non-stop romp, with plenty of adventure, lots of chuckles, and a lot of hair-raising moments. Val Con and Miri are in trouble, and so is the rest of Clan Korval. As usual they deal with trouble in adept, surprising, and often amusing ways, confounding both friends and enemies along the way. More is seen of Anthora and Nova than in previous books, and some more is learned of the Yxtrang - who have been largely a cipher up until now. If you haven't run into this series before you need to start with Partners in Necessity, which is an omnibus of the first three Liaden novels. Just be warned, once you start you won't stop until you've read everything available."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Long Awaited Sequel","review":"Plan B is the long awaited sequel to Miller and Lees 80's Trilogy.

Channing Tatum is very believable as a solider (though his sidekick is not; more of a doofus and not believable as a special ops/superior fighter pilot). Enjoyed the fast-paced action sequences, excitement, love interest/romance with a twist, the gray of some characters not being all black or white (not just good & evil), etc., etc. I grew up watching \\"GI Joe...American hero\\" (can still sing the cartoon song) so really enjoyed seeing this in the theater, and it does not disappoint on DVD either. I've already watched it twice. Also, really love the back stories that give the characters depth and demonstrate their childhoods/motivations/past; gives this movie more than the typical action flick with two-dimensional characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Def Only a 2 Star Movie","review":"I love action flicks and was really, really looking forward to this movie. Very close to being a total dud, but I admit it just kept my interest enough to finish watching it. To add insult to injury, even Dennis Quaid was more a cameo role and phoned it in, and Sienna Miller was horribly miscast in it :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Great Movie, Inappropriate for Family or Children","review":"Only a complete, brain-dead moron would call this a family film. The deadly carnage begins within the first few minutes and continues nonstop for the entire film. Maybe all those civilians and cars they destroyed during the Drive through Paris were full of escape murders and child molesters so they deserved what they got. Just because it is all computer generated doesn't make it family fun. It's still just bad movie making. I feel diseased just for watching it and am ashamed of myself for even renting it. The acting was totally hideous. The only good thing I can say about this movie is it had great special effects. Unfortunately, most movies today, good or bad, can make that claim.

I grew up watching GI Joe, and playing with the action figures as a kid. This was so bad I didn't even finish the whole thing, instead fast forwarding through much of it. There were so many characters it was confusing, to the point I never really cared about any of them.This reminds me what happened to the Batman Movies in the 90's. They were so crappy for so long that when Batman Begins came out everyone was so shocked it was actually good. I think there is a good GI Joe movie out there waiting to be made by a good director with a good story but this one certainly was not it.Granted this was probably aimed at teenagers and the newer Batman movies aimed at adults but this was so bad I had to warn others to not waste their time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah and bland even with the beefcake","review":"Well, I enjoyed most of the special effects - melting structures especially the Eiffel Tower (nanomites anyone?); secret bases under the Sahara Desert and the polar ice cap. But the special effects didn't make up for a mediocre plot, uninspired acting, no connection to the original G.I. Joe premise, absolutely NO feeling of patriotism.I used to watch the G.I. Joe cartoons in the 80s and 90s with my sons. They were more inspiring than this movie. And my brothers both had G.I. Joe figures when we were kids. In fact, my Barbies always married Joes, not Kens.A big problem - I think I will be watching this movie over and over - because I have already forgotten so many of the details that I will start watching it again and be a good way through it before I realize I've already seen this drivel over and over (G.I. Groundhog Day).The only reason I gave this a rating of 2 was because of the eye candy. I might be older but...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but NOT G.I. JOE.","review":"This movie had gunfights, explosions, cool vehicles and pretty much everything an action junkie likes. Problem is, they took a mediocre \\"B\\" action movie and slapped the G.I. JOE name on it. This was NOT the G.I. JOE I grew up with. And what's with the leather jumpsuits? Does EVERY action movie hero have to sport a leather jumpsuit now? First X-MEN now G.I. JOE. Only The Baroness should have been in a leather jumpsuit, and she was, so the movie wasn't all bad. Bottom line, it's a good way to kill two hours on a saturday afternoon, when it comes on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big guns, corny guns, and hot babes","review":"I can't say I had high expectations for any movie based on GI Joe action figures. I used to love playing the figures as a kid, but it just simply isn't movie material.G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobrais probably the best they could do given the concept, but the result isn't very satisfying. It's an action movie galore, but not much else. The script gets a bit corny and cliche, with predictable lines and plot developments - like the hot GI Joe Scarlett also being the scientific nerd. I was also surprisedG.I. Joefeatures so many hot characters. I don't remember anybody like Sienna Miller's character in my action figures when I was younger! Unfortunately, it seems part of a larger problem with the movie - it is more focused on delivering eye candy (both special effects and hot actresses) than delivering a good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it ...","review":"We received this movie from Netflix by accident, so we decided to give it a try. Simply put, this movie is so weak that we had to bail out after half an hour, rather than wasting even more time by finishing it.There's plenty of action, the special effects are good, and there's eye-candy for the guys. But the plot is utterly juvenile and the acting is weak. The actor playing the lead character is particularly bad.If you're a 12-year-old boy and you like blowing things up, you might like this movie. Otherwise, be sure to skip it. I'm giving it 2 stars (rather than 1) only because of the special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cheesy, really long, really violent","review":"Really cheesy, really long, one minute doesn't go by without yet another battle sequence, lots of sci-fi high tech, low on everything else.

Every actor is horrible, the script is pointless, and the directing is the most amateurish I've ever seen in a mainstream action/adventure film.

I loved this cartoon as a kid and became very patriotic over the whole thing as a child. Having served in Iraq and watching this movie seeing the GI Joe All American Hero thing downplayed in this movie was a slap in the face. Certain things were just awkard and didn't translate from the comics and TV show very well, Tatum looked like Duke but seemed 10 years too young for Duke's rank which I think was First Seargent or something, and his acting sucks. The exo suit things were a bit much but the Army is testing stuff like that so I guess that can slide.

Can anyone tell me what purpose Dennis Quaid served in this movie? I used to watch GI Joe cartoon movie on VHS with my kids years ago and I gotta say that movie was FAR SUPERIOR.

What boys do u know who dont like gi joe???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, it really is *THAT* bad!","review":"You know it sucks when Marlon Waynes is the most convincing actor in the movie. Seriously, it was awful....Granted, there wasn't a whole lot to be done with some of the dialogue. The writers should definitely share the blame here. Every word from Duke's mouth was warmed-over cheese from better action movies. Dennis Quaid's character spoke in cliche-ese. And don't even get me started on the women...they could have literally been named \\"Redheaded Good Girl\\"...and \\"Brunette Bad Girl\\" for all the personality they had. At one point, I thought the movie was actually spoofing it's genre!Thank goodness I didn't go see this mess at the movies...It wasn't even a good rental. I would say wait until it comes on TV...or until blockbuster is giving away a free copy with every 3rd movie rental, because let's face it, there are gonna be TONS of leftover copies of \\"Rise of Cobra\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"GI NO-GO","review":"The biggest problem with this movie is its disregard with the fact that GIJOE is supposed to be fiercely American, thus the phrase \\"a real American Hero.\\" This movie makes them out to be some sort of United Nations group. I don't recall seeing one American flag in the movie, now granted I didn't pay too much attention after the first 20 minutes revealed the angle they were taking. The characters are all a bunch of paper-thin talking-head blow-hards with extremely bad dialogue. I have been waiting for a live action GIJOE since I was 10 years old. Alas, upon seeing the ads for this movie I knew then that I would have to wait another 10-15 years for Hollywood to re-load the franchise because this one was a blank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"This movie is so cartoonish and the acting is so poor that I couldn't finish watching it, which is saying something since I have a high tolerance for BS.

What Story?","review":"Sad what they did, all the budget and computing power you could want, and this is the film that gets made.

Wow was I disappointed, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This movie had it all (in a bad way), terrible acting, poorly written script, and as someone else mentioned special effects that make Jurassic Park seem state of the art.

Just horrible!!!!!","review":"Anyone who appreciates GI Joe as a Real American Hero need not waste any time with this politically correct garbage.Not only did they forcibly remove the American theme from this respected icon and childhood toy, they also radically altered the characters from the line.Because Bonaventura is an Obama fanatic, one cannot seriously expect anything patriotic from the \\"blame America first\\" crowd. They totally botch the origins of Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, and they refuse to provide anything interesting in terms of storyline.Since when were Duke and Baroness supposed to get married? Duke is Scarlett's man on the cartoon show.The CGI is terrible, and so is the acting.Not only is this stupid film a 300 million dollar box office bomb, it is a complete and total waste of your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Film","review":"Gave me a vision of what Power Rangers would have been like on crack.

The special effects contradict themselves by being really good and really bad. The acting on the other hand is constant in it's blandness. Skip this movie, and if you watch it and love it, don't tell anyone so they don't think you're 5.You know there's a sequel coming so hey \\"Hollywood people\\", please fire the director and the rest of the cast and get some real talent in there."},{"rating":"1","title":"G.I.

No; Awful.","review":"Seriously.I guess that the Baroness was good-looking, so the movie wasn't all bad. But it was close. All of the characters were ruined, the \\"real American Hero\\" is now less American, the dialogue was horrible, and the comic relief was painful. It's really as bad as people say it is.Maybe the pacing was okay? Until toward the end, when it kept going...If you like scary movies, then you'll like the end, when they strongly suggest a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I'm sorry I couldn't find anything at all to like about this film. This has to be the absolute King of those blockbuster films that love to hurl all sorts of poorly edited CGI filled action sequences at the viewer and hope that no one will notice the complete lack of coherence, character development or plot. Yep, this is WORSE than TRANSFORMERS 2, TERMINATOR 4, 2012 and all the rest of the overbudgeted underwhelming nonsense the studios love to crank out. There just wasn't anything to enjoy here. I loved GI Joe as a kid but this film has no genuine relationship to the GI joe stuff I grew up with. Thats fine if the film makers had bothered to change it into something thoughtful, interesting or entertaining. They didn't. It's just one gigantic incomprehensible action sequence after another and for me, that isn't enough to make a film worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as others say","review":"This movie isn't nearly as bad as most people are saying. The movie isn't meant to be a serious action movie. It's based on an 80's cartoon series. The acting is mostly terrible, so if this kind of thing bothers you, then the movie may not be for you. But if you like campy one-liners and impossible situations then you may enjoy this. Just watch it in the right spirit and this is a fun movie.On blu-ray, the picture quality is phenomenal! Everything is super crisp and colorful. Sound quality is also very nice. I watched the DVD version of this movie before buying the blu-ray and the difference is HUGE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the cost","review":"It was definitely non-stop fun. A little off from the cartoon and comic books but I guess some liberties can be expected. After all it was a \\"first\\" GI Joe movie. Definitely setup for sequals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yo Joe","review":"Sure it could have been better. What movie couldn't be? Where they really went wrong was those space-aged suits that were just too futuristic for my liking. The Storm Shadow/ Snake Eyes conflict was amazing and I can't wait for Storm Shadow to have his revenge. Where was Snake Eyes' dog? The baroness is a goddess and I hope to see more of her in an evil role again. This movie really sets things up for the next one when (SPOILER) Cobra Commander takes control of Cobra and delivers the pain. GI Joe is action packed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much story, not much acting, but at least it's action packed","review":"Going into this movie, I didn't expect much. Especially after watching Transformers II, my expectations was rock bottom, but when GI JOE is compared with Transformers, GI JOE is an absolute masterpiece. The acting is acceptable, action scenes are at least enjoyable. And most of all, at least the dialect doesn't insult one's intelligence. Without watching Transformers, probably give this movie a 3 star at most, it's an average action movie based on a memorable childhood cartoon. The one extra star is really because after watching probably one of the biggest stinkers ever made, it's hard to not enjoy any other movie.Don't expect a deep story and relating characters, these movies are just about action, brainless fun, and GI Joe does exactly that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duke can't act.","review":"This movie sucked. The red haired girl was hot. The guy that played Duke cannot act. Just not a good movie. Dennis Quaid even sucked. Sieanna Miller sucked too. The two good thing: looking at the red head & the suprise guest appearance by SPOILER BELOWGEORGE OF THE JUNGLE.Suck suck sucked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Action Movie Ever!","review":"Worst Action Movie for the summer of 2009, if you think that this movie goes with the G. I. Joe cartoon and Comic books of the 80's. You are dead wrong, nothing like it at all. Just don't waste your time and money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough Ray Park...","review":"Liked it that he didn't say a word and did a lot of chop-socky.Other than that, this movie was awful. Love the fact that even though Parks' character Shadow (I think that's the characters' name) didn't have much air time, he's larger than the rest of the gang on the cover. This of course shows you that the company knew that my assessment of the show was correct and are hoping that the audience who Did Not see the movie in the theater will buy this because they see a 'sorta' ninja on the cover and think that he's the actual Star of the movie!They're making a movie on silly games like 'Astroid' and 'Battleship' which shows you how desperate hollyweird is nowadays. 'GI joe' is on that weird coin too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flick","review":"First.........ANYONE that knocks Transformers Part 1 or 2 is not a movie buff, nor a sci-fi fan with any taste. Both those movies did as well as they did for a reason...............actually 500 million reasons..............because they were good. So if you hear of someone dogging this movie (or any movie for that matter) and at the same time dogging either Transformers flicks then don't take their suggestions ever. For those that don't like Transformers then go watch The Notebook or The English Patient or something and stop wasting your time writing meritless reviews. This movie is highly entertaining and fun. Certainly not an award winner but NEVER INTENDED TO BE.Man I wish people would quit bichin about \\"Hollywood putting out steaming piles\\" and all that jazz.

You will probably be as ticked off as I was. Directors and writers ruin so much these days. If I could rate it lower than what I did, I would have. The guy playing Duke shouldn't be in any movie. He's horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame Graphics","review":"The movie started fine but the middle was so cheesey and lame that I actually got up from watching it with my kids to go cook dinner. So I did not review the end. The main character might be a heartthrob to young females, and I am not hating on the guy but he cannot act. He did fine in Coach Carter but this movie sucked and he did not help matters by starring in this crap. I'm suprised at Dennis Quaid. He is a fine actor that has been in alot of good movies but lately he's been in a slump. 1st the horror flick Horseman, now this crap. I'm sorry this movie was good for children between the ages 7 and 11. Thats it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"No one is expecting much out of a film like this, you go and watch it for some actions scenes and hot girls in skin tight costumes trying to be [...]. That's fine I get that. Problem is GI Joe is just trying way too hard to be cool, the action scenes are far too over the top and require CGI for almost every single second of them, and you start to wonder why they just didn't render the whole film like it and save a lot of money. Even the dialog comes across as forced, you can tell that the actors are cringing on the inside with each syllable of nonsense they must mutter, even down to squeezing in some of the catch phrases such as \\"knowing is half the battle\\", \\"GO Joe!\\" and \\"Real American hero\\".If I didn't know any better I would say that this is a live action Team America, finish watching the Paris scene and tell me I'm wrong, I dare you.At the end of the day the movie does do what is set out to do. A minor distraction that is forgotten quickly, a B-Movie with a budget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie ever made","review":"This movie started with a good idea.Thats it.

Twaddle.By no means does this list even begin to describe it. If you ever watched the 80's cartoon, it's as ridiculous and stupid as the cartoon only this time it's live action.

This is for sure a one-time watch - so rent, don't buy. I think this movie sets the record for number of cheesy lines. Maybe 50% of the dialog is mindless predictable one-liners you've heard 100 times already in other movies. There is no character development to speak of, there are no surprises in the plot. Very tiring to watch this movie in one sitting.I gave it one star only because of the visual treat (and because you can't give it none :) )."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could they?","review":"It's like having the most amazing memories of childhood ripped from your conscience.

Seems like some overly PC nutjob wrote the script- Constant flashbacks was annoying and distractfulI could go on but long story short - Terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"You know that great movie Transformers? It's not like that.","review":"I admit it. I likes me some comic book movies and some video game movies (Iron Man and Resident Evil come to mind). I even likes me some kids toy movies (see Transformers). They're good fun, escapist entertainment. This movie was nothing more than a rip off of every recently released special effects blockbuster with much lower quality effects. Remember how cheesy Daredevil was. It's like that, only with the most painfully stupid scene I have ever witnessed in a movie. Towards the end of the film, the villians blew up the ice on the surface of the ocean, whereupon the ice came crashing down to the bottom of the sea. I'm all for willing suspension of disbelief, but if you are going to have magic ice that sinks like a rock, you gotta give me a reason to buy it. Hasn't everyone on the planet seen the ice in their glass floating on the top. Gotta go. I'm feeling nauseous from the memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh...","review":"...if u can look past the bad acting and cliche/80s-90s era action movie feel of it, it's actually a pretty entertaining flick.

Basically a movie made by Hollywood for the masses and not the original fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Teen Shoot-Em-Up Rollercoaster","review":"This a simple movie - all flash and no substance - just like the cartoon. If you're one of those pre-teens who embraced the animated version in the 80s, you'll probably enjoy this thing, because it shovels out the same formula: beefcakes, big guns, explosions, dumb dialogue, cheesy jingoism, massive property damage, and militarism without consequence.

It's worth a rent just for kicks, but honestly, it was just entertaining enough to overcome some really horrible acting from Channing Tatum. His stilted lines, rushed delivery and lifeless performance is enough to be truly distracting.

I made the mistake of a blind buy and have lived to regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good start...","review":"So I finally gained the courage to see this number, and realized it was yet another hokey take by Sommers. We are talking Van Helsing territory with this film. For some reason, the FX in Sommers' films have a made-for-tv cheese factor...along with script and acting. GI Joe, sadly, does not improve on things. Mis-castings galore with half the Joe team looking like Melrose Place drop-outs rather than seasoned warriors, along with the odd choice of Joseph Gordon-Levitte as Cobra commander.Plot? What plot? I wasn't looking for a deep movie. Just some decent entertainment, but even for that this film was a weak sauce.

If you grew up watching and loved the GI JOE cartoon, then save yourself the frustration. Worst adaptation ever and the story is way off mark. I guess we should allow for some ingenuity and redefinition of story line as it moves to the big screen, but to me overall, it was empty. Full of bad acting, cheesy one liners and overly annoying special effects. A Transformer isn't even able to do all the crazy dumb stuff they do in this movie. I love special effects, but this movie is proof that it can be done too much and in bad taste. What was up with Snake Eyes leather lips? I can only hope they will not make another.

It was bad pun after sexual innuendo that could only possibly be amusing to a 12 year old boy with an equal IQ.

And no they don't try to eat you, the just become second class citizens. I guess the book would get classified as urban fantasy, but it really is very different from anything by Jim Butcher, etc. and it's clearly not your typical apocalypse.

WTF?I almost stopped reading it, and then I got hooked. Me thinks the author dropped some acid coming up with this story line. Where or how anyone came up with this is beyond me. It's one of the oddest, most unique books I've ever read. And I haven't decided if that's a good thing or not.It's so weird that I cannot even ..If you try it, don't stop where you want to. Give it 40% of the way through to get the vibe. If you don't like it by then just remove your grease paintand delete it from your Kindle.If the book wasn't so odd, it would rate 5 starts. But really.. a semi-posessed(?) clown, detective noir, walking dead gunsel sidekick named fatso (he ain't fat), rain, bleak darkness.. Oh, and an old Chrysler, cigarettes and Canadian Club. Way too odd for 5 stars.. but hey, I liked it..

I connect the speakers to a MP3 player. The sound was disappointing. There is distortion coming from the woofer speaker! I had to turn down the volume very low before the distortion was at minimal. I return them and exchanged them for Creative Travel Speakers 200. I think it is a design flaw problem with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak sound","review":"I bought these speakers to use with my laptop while stationed in Iraq back in 2006. I liked how portable they were, since they all fit in a convenient carrying case (often too small to neatly fit everything in there and still close the velcro). My biggest complaint is the sound being too quiet to really enjoy anything. The subwoofer (if you can call it that) provided almost decent bass sound, but went through batteries quickly- in fact I often didn't even use the subwoofer. The whole system is just way too weak for enjoyment. I say spend an extra $20 and get something more worth your while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad read, but don't expect any spectacular revelations","review":"Blackjack is a game that is easy to understand and nearly impossible to master. It is also a game that is largely influenced by how people play. The odds will vary depending on compliance with basic strategy. For a new player, the basic strategy chart will be useful, as may the description of gameplay. But the suggested betting strategies and card counting techniques are nothing but snake-oil!

The lyrics are so stupid, I couldn't bear it. Jack Dangers of Meat Beat Manifesto is the most talented musician I know of. Each album is completely different and pleasant, except for this one. Jack is obviously a sample hog, collecting interesting voice samples from the strangest places and then using them wisely. He sings well, and lives up the group's name with good, meaty rhythms. I own the entire collection of MBM albums and enjoy them often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably MBM's worst album","review":"I bought this CD like four or five years ago and it has never sat quite right with me. MBM is capable of making excellent music, but I agree with George (below) - this is probably Jack Danger et al.'s worst album. The lyrics on the album are awful and the soundscapes/beats can be unlistenable at times (\\"Psyche-Out\\" probably beating any other song on the album for being obnoxious). Some tracks are good like \\"Now\\", \\"Hello Teenage America\\" and \\"Helter Skelter\\". Jack's only previous album \\"Storm the Studio\\" is far better than this, and being a huge fan of MBM (I own all their albums with the exception of their newest, RUOK?) I must say that anyone who is just recently becoming a fan of MBM should not buy this album. I would recommed Satyricon or Storm the Studio if you want to hear their old stuff - this album should only be purchased for the sake of completing a collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant piece","review":"while bordering at times to hip-hop, pop or whatever, the ridiculously harsh beats and angst-ridden growls quickly eliminate any doubts this is industrial."},{"rating":"2","title":"koRn does it one more time","review":"This album is really great. Not just the hit songs that are on mtv but the other songs are good too. If you listen to the whole cd thru all the way with no stopping you will probably end up liking most of the songs on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn's best album","review":"This album, being consistent all along with the dark, gothic atmosphere we know from \\"blind\\", is their best album for those who would go for the debut album rather than \\"follow the leader\\". The transitions between songs keep the album as a whole and though it seemingly has the mood to get you down and blues, i always find myself exhilarated and finally, the song \\"hey daddy\\" is just one of the best works of korn. The great bass and vocal's harmony is incredible, definitely my favorite song from Korn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korns Best","review":"I reckon these guys could be a good band. Maybe if Jon Davis stopped getting all these rap artists to appear on his CD's, their guitarists were a lot heavier. The drummer doesnt need to change. There are a lot of better bands out there, Please, go try Superjoint Ritual, Danzig, or Slayer. This CD is full of fake/weird/interlude songs anyway. Maybe only get it if you see it at Cash Converters for a dollar or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff!","review":"This is probobly the second to best CD by KoRn.

I would say this was the worst cd KoRn put out although it is good. On this album they go to a more softer mood and are not quite as heavy. Their are a couple of good songs on here such as Falling Away From Me, Beg For Me, Somebody Someone, Wake Up, and Dirty. If your looking to get a KoRn cd, grab the self-titled before you get any other KoRn cd out their."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful: Korn has Fallen","review":"I've been listening to KoRn since \\"Blind\\" first blared from my cassette player around a decade ago. I was thoroughly impressed with the self-titled album and the tracks on it such as \\"Daddy,\\" \\"Shoots & Ladders,\\" etc. Not too long after was the emergence of Life is Peachy which is even better in my opinion. When Follow the Leader came out I wasn't feeling the power of the first two albums. \\"Got the Life\\" just wasn't Korn to me. TRL seemed to appreciate it though. I still kept my faith in KoRn's talent... and then there was ISSUES. This album isn't worth the time. It's the same old trendy, teeny-bopper [music]. Untouchables isn't much better.

In trying to mix in some of their older stuff from Korn and Life is Peachy with the new stuff from Follow the Leader they ended up with some lame music. Korn should go back to their old stuff.

Every band produces trash so this counts as Korn's trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"THAX GUYS(KORN) FOR SAVING ME FROM MYSELF AGAIN","review":"OK, HERE'S A BAND THAT CAN REALLY EXORCISE ANYBODY'S DEMONS WITH THEIR MUSIC.

THANX GUYS FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE WHEN I NEED YOU."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Great","review":"This album is just brilliant. The classic Korn stylings are all there in all the songs. It starts off with \\"Dead\\", which is just a single plea through the entire song, \\"All I Want In Life Is To Be Happy\\". It then goes on to there normal hip-hop rock style, with the best song being \\"Make Me Bad\\". But, as alwys with Korn, they made one mistake. Just like the Stereophonics, all there songs sound exactly the same. In fact the first time I heard it I wasn't sure If I was listening to song 13 or just the extended version of their single \\"Falling Away From Me\\". If you don't like the single you'll dispise the album. However overall the album is pure rage in a can! You won't be able to stop listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn is life- life is KoRn: enough said.","review":"KoRn is the best band ever, and this cd proves it!

The best songs are Falling Away From Me, Trash, Beg For Me, Make Me Bad, Somebody Someone, Let's Get This Party Started, and Counting. That's out of 16 tracks (i don't know why amazon put 17 tracks). Of all the albums before, this one is most like Follow The Leader combined with the heavyness (only in some songs) of the first.

In an attemp to live up to their debut, they failed miserably. First of all, the sounds are too \\"poppish\\" and soft. Also, it doesn't have that \\"OOMPH!\\" essence that Follow the Leader and the debut had, or the darkness of their first 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"stick with follow the leader","review":"ok first off i dont really like this cd. i mean i like korn and everything but i was really dissapointed with issues. i guess im just used to their hard hitting sound. they should of stuck with it and not change their sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a turd this was","review":"How can anyone like this. This is the point when korn started writing terrible un-inspiring music. Jonathan Davis went from screaming to singing like a little girl.

This new approach definitely works for Korn, but they need to refine it.Overall, an excellent effort, and a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful harmonies....NOT!","review":"This band/album stinks. Korn and their manipulation of our culture and media, with their vile message and underacheiving drivel, has corrupted rock music as we know it. Music isn't music if it doesn't have a positive and thought-provoking message. That is why Korn stinks. If you want to hear mellotron the way it was meant to be played, listen to Pink Floyd, early Genesis, and other real bands. Don't waste your time listening to this. Thank God I didn't actually pay to listen to this immoral garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"this shows how todays adolescents are sheep","review":"if anyone listened to this for any reason other than \\"its sounds good,\\" they would be severely disappointed.

This album will be \\"out\\" in a year or so. Well besides that, this is absolute crap and is a main reason why metal is dying in america.

I can't say enough bad things about this album and about KoRn (sorry there is no backwards \\"R\\") KoRn is Just a bunch of KrAp of rage on the stage. I'll give them that they're original. Issues is all about how ridiculous and how many cusswords you can fit in one song. This is hardly what I'd call rock. If you're looking for rock Creed, is the only good new rock band, Pearl Jam is the old one. KoRn is really just bad singing and rapping over a really pathetic \\"guitarist\\". Hardly what I call good rock or even good music. If you're buying this CD, chances are your following the trend of KoRn freaks like my brother.

Some of my favorites are \\"Somebody Someone\\", \\"Wake Up\\", \\"Counting\\", \\"Dirty\\", the hit songs and more! If you want to get into KoRn buy this cd, don't buy Untouchables...! You won't regret buying this so just buy it or die. TIME Magazine says this album is so great \\"If you know someone who doesn't like it, KILL THEM!\\" Rolling Stones Magzine says \\"Possibly more perfect than GOD!\\"... well they didn't say that I just got that from MAD TV when it was making fun of the show \\"Felicity\\". HAHA! MAD TV is a funny show, you should watch it sometime.Some other bands I like: Ozzy/Black Sabbath, Metallica, Slayer, Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, Static-X, Rob/White Zombie, Disturbed, System Of A Down, Tool,...(stay away from Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums ever...","review":"It was fall of 1999, and my best friends were like \\"DUDE ISSUES RULES!

Head and Munky couldn't come up with a decent guitar lick to save their lives, and Jon Davis's vocal experimentations are nothing short of mortifying on this album. I give them props for being experimental, and breaking away from the 'all-metal' image they created, but this album is a total failure, and I lost hope in KoRn after using this CD as a coaster for my drinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"More proof that todays rock music sucks","review":"After reading all of the below reviews, I can finally say that todays youth wouldn't know good music if it came up and bit them. The lyrics on this album are terrible at best. THIS ALBUM SOUNDS EXACTLY LIKE FOLLOW THE LEADER (an album which sucked all most as much as this one). If Korn thinks they can throw some boring album together and expect it to sell, then they're right. Look how many people gave this a good review. John can't sing, nor write lyrics, Munky and Head are using the same dreadful guitar riffs that were on the last album, Fieldy, I can't really say anything good or bad about him, simply because it's really hard to be a bad bass player, and as for the drums, they've been going downhill since Life is Peachy. I truely doubt that anyone will actually listen to this, simply because the people who are reading this review are the same people who make Limp Bizkit and Kid Rock celebrities.

These guys are starting to become squeaky clean, hoping to convince the world that they're real musicians. WRONG! They just don't have the talent to write real songs that are as good as the guilty pleasures of Korn and Life Is Peachy. The worst culprits are the aptly titled \\"Trash\\", \\"Let's Get This Party Started\\" and \\"Dead\\".

That's not to say that this album is in any way bad (because I think it's great). It's just that the reviews haven't told of the repitition in KoRn's music (how many times do we need Johnathan Davis to tell us he \\"feels like god\\"?).

I have to say that i am very unpleased with it. I've been listening to Korn since they were unknown, and they seem to have finally let the Record company mold them into a mainstream band. There is too many different sounds being smushed together on the CD, and what the Hell is going on with the Singing nonsense. It sounds like Korn hung out with N'Sync during their recording sessions. I give the album a 2. 1 point because of their album cover contest and the 2nd point because they've totally snowed all of their real fans.

I have all four of Korn's album, and by far this album does not rock me like the first album did.

Jonathan's lyric's on this album are very personally and can are easliy related too. I think this is their best album. To me it sounds more like there first album, which alot of people say is their best album. One thing i don't understand though is how so many fans have turned on KoRn because they had one \\"bad\\" album. I love KoRn.....their music and their personalities. I think Issues is there best cd. I can listen to the whole album straight though without skipping a track and those kinds of albums are hard to find. In my opinion this is a great album. It's a very powerful album. I think this is a great album and more people should give it a chance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"[AWESOME]!","review":"Some of the best music I have heard in a long time. Just whenI thought that I was doomed to keep on Listening to BSB and britneyspears for good, I am sooooo relieved.

The biggest bang for the buck in a long time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I almost hate this album.","review":"I've been a big KoRn fan since the beginning. Their first album blows away all of their other albums. I'd put FTL second, followed by LIP. Issues is definitely the worst of the four, in my opinion.

Their next album better be better than this..."},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn, and a another good c.d.","review":"KoRn is da best, they always make good heavy metal ( and scarynes.)

Yes I am a big fan and I dont think that this was by far the best album, but they are growing and changing with time..... if you dont like this particular album......THEN DONT LISTEN TO IT! The reasons I like this album is first and formost JONATHAN CAN SING EXTREMELY WELL! I know many people dont like his vocal delivary but I do. My favorite songs are Dirty, Make Me Bad, Trash and I'ts Gonna Go away. He has an amazing voice which is heartfelt and emotional( not to mention he is really really sexy....hehe) Anyway, I wouldnt shy amay from this album because they have not sold out and that is my final word.....so deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn, not KORNY","review":"I've never thought of myself as a \\"Korn\\" fan. I do not like much of this groups first two releases, and unlike most Korn fans I like the latest two albums better. Issues was particularly a shock. Freak On a Leash I have listened to many times, and I mildly enjoy it. But this new disc \\"Issues\\" is a true testament to Korns towering shadow of orginality, and force. They are not in the packs of bands who claim to be \\"Rap Metal\\" or \\"Nu-Metal\\", no Korn leads the pack, and with this release nobody will challenge that. Although Korn will never win the most melodic award, they have achived new melodic heights on many of the songs, and they of course still know how to rock. Give them a chance, don't let trend loving 13 year olds who only listen to them because they love LIMP BIZKIT (please) scare you away from this true band, appreciate them for musical mastery, instead of the bands \\"trendy\\" coolness.

Jon has a VERY talented voice. Yet on this cd, far too often, his voice is being warbled, distored, or put through some odd effect. This only takes away from the Korn experience, and left me feeling that this was some poser band trying to sound like Korn, as the unique vocals just weren't there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Issues kicks ass!","review":"This is the first Korn album I've bought, and every song on this CD is great.

All the albums up to this one were awesome. Every song sounds like it just drifts into the next track. I think selling out to MTV has really hurt them musically. Everyday I see one of their smiling faces on TRL trying to act funny. KoRn used to be a \\"dark\\" band that didn't care what they did. Now they have accepted the ways of todays market and made the music that the producers want. Look for their album in the sellout section next to NSYNC and Spears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do people think the new korn cd stinks? I rules ....","review":"The new korn cd that came out with 4 different covers is a great new addition to your cd collection. If you dont have it yet you must get it.

And that the person just has to lisen to it for a while and they will realize that it is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this considered music?","review":"This is by far one of the many horrible attepmts at creating good heavy music from the States. This album, along with every Corn, Limp Biscuit, etc, is some of the worst music possible. I'd rather listen to the Backstreet Boys: at least they make horrible music for an already horrible style, but with these \\"heavy\\" bands, they put a bad name to great metal! It's too bad Americans support such nonsense.......real music you ask? OPETH, KATATONIA, IN FLAMES, OCTOBER TIDE, CHILDREN OF BODOM, EDGE OF SANITY, DARK TRANQUILLITY, TRISTANIA, THEATRE OF TRAGEDY, ACTURUS, DIMMU BORGIR, EMPEROR, BEETHOVEN, CHOPIN, STRAVINSKY, DEBUSSY, etc. ...... real music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not impressed","review":"Ok, i am not an avid Rap\\\\Alternative fan but I do enjoy some of the songs put out there. I heard about half of the album on shuffle while doing some wrok on the PC and then had to tunr it off; it was that bad. My rating of music is dependant on if I can understand a lot of the wordds, and to tell th truth I had a hard time. I don't even bother looking in the booklet if I can't undersatnd at at least half of the words. You avid listners will hare similarities from past albums and will like it for that, but I found the music dry and without taste. I prefer the MTV version of songs becuase they are edited and I don't have to be surrounded by cussing. If the only way you can express yourself is with cuss words instead of more tasteful words, then I pity you. I don't reccomend this album to anyone who is not an avid Alternative or Rap fan. To the rest of you, enjoy the album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage... plain and simple. Garbage.","review":"Perhaps verging on the fine line between my hatred of rap and sell-outs lies KoRn. This \\"music\\" has disillusioned millions, bought the souls of \\"Children of the Korn\\" everywhere and made a mockery of the once noble genre of Rock and Roll. If you enjoy Korn's recent releases under their corporate ownership, you are a follower. You do not know what music is. You know nothing about this band. You only like what is popular. I mean, honestly, you buy an album from a renound sell-out band, titled \\"Follow the Leader\\" (you, the niave buyer) and expect to be accepted as a fan of rock? How dare you even assosciate this trash and all you want to believe in with music that has meaning. I hate all of you.

C) see also SELLOUTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"One trick ponies give us the same garbage again........","review":"Lead singer dysfunctional and he cries about it (nothing new). Guitarists take an extra string on the guitar and with little technical skill down tune the seventh string and make weird sound (sounded somewhat new in 95 but guy's it's old by 99), disposable product here and they know their time is short so they keep putting out the flawed product. What's with the bass player? he sounds terrible is that a bass he's playing it sounds the same in every song (and to think on the cover of bass player magazine it was printed that he may be the future of bass, I doubt that very much). Also to the peanut head who thinks this sounds \\"goth\\" it doesn't it's rap rock and it's weak. Basically this albums selling at all shows how far the musical sensibilities in the youth have degenerated. Pass this one up if you have any sense/class."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the TRL crowd","review":"Korn started out as a band on the outside. I got into korn in 1995 with their self-titled album.

Unfortantely, with their popularity the band seems to have decided to keep up with the TRL crowd instead of metal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"its a shame...","review":"what happened?? korn used to be the ideal metal group. slow, hard-driving, melodic metal combined with the amazing lyrics of jon davis. now i hear this, and i just want to scream in disgust. you are probably saying \\"eh, you are one of the wanna-be's that got on the bandwagon when follow the leader was released.\\" no. i got OFF the bandwagon when follow the leader came out. i have been a korn fan for as long as they have been around, and i can safely say that the band that put out issues is NOT the same band that put out one of the most amazing rock albums ever 6 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"edwardscissorhands","review":"i guess this cd is great for those kids going through a confusing time in their life and they feel like they need to fit in.and for kids that have all this anger built up in them just because its the trendy thing to have.ANGER ANGER MORE ANGER!haha."},{"rating":"1","title":"this cd is sh- - !","review":"how can you people listen to this sh--.

Korn is very unoriginal. they're musical style(singing to bass and drums with no guitar), despite how original people will tell you it is, is nothing more than ripping off of Judas Priest(think Sad Wings of Destiny). The one thing that sets Korn apart from Judas Priest is that they cannot play, sing, or write music. It seems that Korn's lead singer always talks about how his life sucks and he wants to commit suicide. Well, GET OVER IT!!!! This album just finds Korn continuing to make subpar music with whiny lyrics about the same thing. To all you people that went out and bought this album, WHY!!??. And, to all of you who have not bought it but want to: save your money. this album ,and this band in general, is horrible. What has happened to my beloved heavy metal??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish they had 0 stars.","review":"The guy below me must be a nutjob. This \\"band\\" is the worst thing that has ever happened to rock music. They are utterly without any redeeming qualities and they have spawned countless imitators who are nearly as bad. But fear not. Korn are still the most vile excuse for music ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sob....poor me...life stinks...yada yada yada","review":"Death, rage, death, violence, depravity, death, suicide, and...erm...DEATH! (Did I already mention death?)This is so pathetic. Another band of morose [souls] screeching about the underbelly of life. Jeez, take a walk, see the blue sky, go sit by the ocean, listen to the wind rustle through the trees, talk to a friend, and get a freakin' LIFE...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old Korn, same old krap","review":"Seems kind of odd how everything on this sounds the same, doesn't it? The drummer may be the only member of the band who's even mildly accomplished. I hate Davis's vocals, particularly on songs like \\"Make me Bad\\". Fieldy comes up with a small variation on the same bassline over and over for every one of their songs here. Munky and Head have some mildly listenable parts here (the opening riff of \\"Falling Away from Me\\" is almost neat), but the majority is just awful (the two chord thing right after the opening riff of \\"Falling Away from Me\\" comes to mind). Sorry, but very little here is really likeable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so great about Korn anyway?","review":"I have followed Korn from what they put out with their first album, and I fail to see what all the fuss is about them. This album continues the downward spiral that began after their mediocre semi-heavy debut album, which was self-titled.What we have here are watered-down, poppy guitar work, that irritating bass playing, and Jonathan Davis' childish lyrics and nails-on chalkboard voice. His whining sounds totally contrived, esp. on songs like \\"Make Me Bad\\", as if he was at a loss for material and just needed to write about some fictional experiences. That is where this album is lacking the most. Despite the predictable Top 40 sound and lifeless guitar playing, it is Davis' heartless lyrics and his unintentionally nonchalant delivery which make this album weak.However, if you like MTV/TRL and wear clothes from Abercrombie & Fitch, I'm sure you will find some redeeming qualities in this album. For everyone else, I urge you to avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn really is a sell out band!","review":"I've been listening to Korn since Life is PEachy, and I just have to say, this piece of trash disapointed me. I had a feeling Korn would turn out this way after the large success of Follow the Leader, which wasn't that good hold a few songs. I am upset and disgusted, Korn is simplifying their music for a younger audience so they can reach more people, I think it's horrible. I am not against bands making it big, but when they feel that they have to release rushed products to please a mass audience they are losing it. Korn made better music when they weren't in the mainstream, and I wish at least if they were popular they could make as good music as they did back in the days of Korn and Life is Peachy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn's fourth album is fourth best one","review":"Although \\"Falling away from Me\\" was a good start, this Cd has nothing else.It doesn't compare to Korns first three. The songs are all the same and very comparable to the first three Cds. No songs stand out to me. I await for Korn's next album to outdo this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Issues","review":"Korn is one of my favorite bands out there so when the long-awaited Issues CD came out on November 16, I went to Best Buy and bought it. I played it the whole way through and I was astonished at the CD. The music was incredible and they spent a lot of time producing this release. Jonathon Davis returns with his abrasive vocals while Fieldy, Head, MunKy, and David put their entire hearts into such songs as Falling Away From Me and Counting. Each song is worth hearing even though some of them are hardly two minutes long. This isnt one of those releases where you want to say, \\"Hey, turn it to number 6\\" or something along the lines of that. Any Korn or rock fan will definitly want to check Issues out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than \\"Life Is Peachy\\"","review":"KoRn's new album \\"Issues\\" is a big dissappiontment compared to their earlier cd \\"Follow the Leader\\". It isn't nearly as hard as their other releases and most of their songs on \\"Issues\\" are lame and boring. The only good songs are \\"Make Me Bad\\", \\"Trash\\", and \\"Falling Away From Me\\". So even if you are a true, die-hard KoRn fan, don't go out and buy this piece of \\"Trash\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why can't Amazon have 100 star ratings?","review":"This is THE Cd of the year. This non-scatted disk of KoRn is sure going to take home grammys. Every guitar riff, drum beat, bass line, Bag pipe note, word of the lyrics reveals meaning and darkness. It's impossible to dislike this CD. Barely comparable to other CDs, this one is THE one. I don't know how can KoRn themselves can make another album like this. Listening to Issues for the first time is like Standing on a 5 inch ledge, staring down the grand cayon. Unless you're chicken out, buy this CD! It's worth every penny you spend on it, if not, more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best way to go","review":"This cd wasnt horrible but it damn sure isn't great.

Hopefully Korn will Do better on their new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"An O.K. album","review":"This is a good cd to own, but being a korn fan and knowing the band, i can say that this is far from what i expected from such a great band. Korn is a great band and i advise to get \\"korn\\" and \\"Life is peachy\\" both of those albums were great. follow the leader is an excellent album if you likerap/rock. issues is worth buying and havin in your collection but it is far from the excellence of there other 3 albums"},{"rating":"1","title":"To Hyped up","review":"I think that all the hype surrounding this album built it up. If it hadn't been hyped I would have given it a solid four stars but alas it couldn't live upto the hype. It's sad actutally. I'm a hardcore Korn fan and that's why it got 2 stars. There are only 4-5 good songs. \\"Falling Away From Me\\",\\"4 U\\", \\"Make Me Bad\\", \\"Somebody Someone\\" and \\"Let's Get this Party Started\\". Don't spend your money. Just download those four songs. only buy this if you're EXTREMELY obsessed w/korn if not use it to buy \\"Follow The Leader\\" arguably their best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"groovy","review":"I listened to korn's cd issues and thought it was grrrreat! even though their lyrics are kind of \\"wierd\\", their lyrics make them unique and that is what makes a good band \\"good\\". i would definately recommend this cd to those people who like this type of music. Korn is \\"Phat\\" and they are definately going to stay at #1 in my fav. list for a long long time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn back in effect","review":"Issues is the fourth album from the one of the top bands of the last decade, Korn. Fresh off their breakout album Follow The Leader, which explored their hip hop influences more(and I'm sure [...]their purist fans), Korn all but abandons their G-Funk chops for a more streamline rock sound. tracks like Falling Away From Me, Make Me Bad(my favorite), Let's Get This Party Started and Dead show that even thouugh they are MTV favorites now, they haven't wen't totally comercial. Go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What sell-outs?","review":"I have to say, right from the start, that I love \\"Issues.\\" Sure, it's different from the first 3 CDs, but that's ok. Bands are supposed to evolve and change over time. Otherwise, they would get repetative and boring. Just because the sound is a bit different and new doesn't mean that KoRn sold out. That's dumb to say.For me, \\"Issues\\" is my bad day album. I listen to it when I am down, because Jonathan Davis can say what I am feeling so well. \\"Falling Away From Me\\" is the best song in the world, it explains how I feel so often in my life. \\"Trash\\" is another good song, as many people have mentioned. I like \\"Hey Daddy\\" quite a bit too. As well as all the other songs on this CD.Overall, I adore KoRn. I love their earlier stuff, I love their newer stuff. \\"Issues\\" is one of my favourites though."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD, Id give it 10 stars if I could!","review":"I love the new album KoRn has put out, it reminds me most of their 1st album, and Issues is my second favorite KoRn album, self-titled my first. It may not be as heavy as the first one but the lyrics are just as dark, KoRn are definitely not sell-outs. Bands do in fact change over time, the change may make the band better or it could make the band worse, but for the most part I STRONGLY RECCOMEND getting KoRn's new album \\"Issues\\"! The best thing is there are no rappers on \\"Issues\\" so maybe we will lose most if not all the posers that just started liking KoRn after they heard Follow the Leader. SO GO GET ISSUES, Its a great album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, it is WAY Better than Follow The Leader","review":"That's blasphomy?..How can you say that? , everyone knows that Follow the Leader is Korns Best!...Well in reality Follow The Leader is Korn's worst effort. \\"Issues\\" is a one of a kind Korn album. It has very little in common with the gems that are \\"Korn\\", \\"The Untouchables\\", and \\"Take a look in the mirror. The best track on this album by far being \\"Make me bad\\" (my second fav Korn song ever), this song hooks you in. Other notables include the catchy \\"Somebody someone\\" and the most well known from the album, \\"Falling away from me\\". This album offers something thats hard to describe other than just, different. The sounds and different noises in many of the tracks make you wonder what Korn was doing, but it works brilliantly. Haters of this album truly have some issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn does it again!","review":"Yup KoRn made another great cd. This review is in 2004 because I just started listening to KoRn not to long ago. The only reason I didn't give this cd 5 stars is because it is not as rock-filled as the others. The cd is pretty creepy. Just listen to Let's Get This Party Started, and Falling Away From Me. I have to say I LOVE THIS CD! Any KoRn fan will love this cd.

And they sold them selfs to all those damn mindless Mtv kids! Now KoRn has killed them selfs with this album. The first few times I played it I loved it! I thought KoRn was back! But, later it proved to be annoying, and repetitive! KoRn is still a band of really cool people! and I hope they put out some real heavy music again soon! but for now, I'm going to stick with Slayer, SlipKnot, Machine Head, and PanterA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dude, okay, this is awesome!","review":"Okay, so I'll admit that I'm really new to the whole KoRn thing ...I loved the first three albums. I think that this was nice for a change and I especially liked some of they're slower songs okay? like 2, 3, 10, 13, and 16. (Yeah I know not all of those are slow) but you have to realize that it's not easy coming out with a whole CD in just about 2 years and making them just as awesome as the few before... it takes time to do good hard metal songs... you have to give KoRn credit for making the effort to put this one out. I expecially like this CD b/c of the four differnet covers. That makes it really interesting. I'm probably going to go out and get all four covers just b/c that's like so neat. For those of you who don't like it, just grin and bear it. They're next album's supposed to be all hard metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even more great KoRn music","review":"This is my new favorite KoRn album.KoRn should get much props for this 'cause the style is great.At times the lyrics get a little dumb(\\"You f@ck pu*%y\\"?) but Jonathon works with that and gets you loving them in other places, such as the break in \\"Counting\\".Feildy does a great job here and is one of the best bass players ever(the best being Les Claypool of course).Head and Munky do an awesome job here especially in \\"Let's Get This Party Started\\" .The chorus and break in the song is were they shine giving crypt-creaking riffs.David does a great job but I wish he would get off more and go faster, at least he does an amazing job in \\"Falling Away From Me\\".The best songs,in no particular order,are Tracks 2,5,6,8,10,11,12,13,15,and 16. The best being number 13 and 15.If you combine their sound from their first and third albums you'll get this one, more for the goths.One last thing why didn't they include a secret song at the end?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Album","review":"This cd is pretty good, but nothing compared to their first cd. I would say this cd ties with \\"follow the leader\\" for 2nd best korn cd. \\"life is peachy\\" being the least best. And to all those \\"supposedly\\" korn fans just because they come out with a new album doesn't mean you automatically give it 5 stars just cuz it's korn. i would defenitley agree with the band that this is an experimental album. Jonathan Davis really experiments with diferrent vocal distortions. Guitars pretty much sound the same as does feildly on bass. The best songs on here are Somebody Someone, Trash, Wake up, Let's get this party started, and Dirty. If you are a korn fan get this album , you won't be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Experimentation Shows","review":"I agree with many people the CD is issues is good but still it lacks something of the feeling and ability I have heard in some of their past Albums. Maybe they should not be changing all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for \\"Five Stars\\" Korn","review":"I think this new cd is just the beginning for Korn, the rock band of the nineties.

KoRn has dissapointed me once again...AND I AM A KORN FAN,BUT IM GETTING USED TO THIS,JON ALWAYS SAYS ITS GOING TO BE LIKE THE FIRST ALBUM,ONLY TO FIND OUT IT IS NOT LIKE THAT AT ALL.

I was incredible excited about the new KoRn album, then when i got it, i was the most dissapointed after any album i'd ever bought. What really makes me sick is that they turned their backs on their true fans to go for more money and fame. KoRn was my ultimate favorite band, not anymore. Their sound completely changed to techno stuff with all these artificial sounds. The only people who will like Issues are either posers or \\"fans\\" who just became KoRn fans because they saw ads for them. KoRn totally sold out. The only reason I'm even giving them the one star is because I have to. I'm ashamed with KoRn. Other things they've done outside the album is playing at Jingle Ball 99 with bands like brittney spears, nsync, and backstreet boys, and they are supposed to be metal? The bottom line is, if you are a true KoRn fan, who's liked them before you ever heard of this album, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"the dark side of korn...oooh spooky","review":"gimmie a break, this band couldnt suck more if it tried. over rated bag pipe crap and more interlude filler than a ludacris album makes \\"issues\\" top 10 on my Worst Albums On The Face Of The Earth catagory. not to mention i saw these guys on \\"Mtv\\" (pause for laughter) and they were b*****n and complainin about how hard it is to be a rock star. news flash guys, you have to BE rock stars before you can complain about it. what losers. only 1 star for these guys, and thats cuz some one gave me 3 bucks for their c.d...sucker"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tis a sad day.","review":"Why is it that the simplest bands seem to be the most popular? Let me clear up a common misconception here, KoRn is NOT metal. They are Neo Metal. You want REAL metal? Go get some Sepultura(older stuff), Soilwork, Dark Tranquility, Opeth, the list goes on. The fact that this simple of music is popular bewidlers me. And the instrumentals? Simple. You want complex, tight, technical instrumentals, go look at some Dream Theater,Liquid Tension Experiment, or Rush. The fact that this gets thrust into everyone's face, while possibly the greatest band of our time(Dream Theater) is left behind truly saddens me.Incase you wonder exactly what bands Ithink fall into this sad group of pathetic \\"musicians\\", heres my little list.Korn,Papa Roach, SlipKnot(although they have an excelent drummer), Limp Bizkit, System Of A Down, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album perfect for Korn","review":"Issues is one of the better Korn albums and has great songs like \\"Falling Away From Me\\", \\"Trash\\", and \\"Make Me Bad\\".

They don't shy away from any topic. They rock hard, and they're one of the more original hard rock bands out there. I love the whole album.

Jon Davis' emotional vocals is what makes this emo. This is twice as emo as Knapsack, my least favorite band in the world, but not quite as emo as Good Charlotte, my favorite band in the whole wide world. Korn is emo because I dare you to find anyone with something more intellectual, meaningful, and applicable to life than Jonathon Davis. His life and his great lyrics make me wanna cry.

When I heard 'Falling away from me' on the radio I was like, 'Cool! I gotta get this cd!' And I did, and I was sorely disappointed. I don't know what KoRn was smokin' when they thought people might actually, I dunno, ENJOY this album? Falling away from me is one of maybe three or four songs on the cd that I would catagorize as 'listenable.' If every song they did had the same eerie guitar riffs and raw emotion of that song, the cd would be awesome. So KoRn, please wait just a little longer when you have a whole cd's worth of good songs before releasing another one, okay? One last thing- Falling Away From Me was the only thing keeping my review above one star. Awesome, killer song, horrible cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"IM Disappointed","review":"i own all of koRn's albums they are all great cd's but when i got issues i was stunned thet korn my favorite rock band could produce an album this poor!

Korn has lost what they had a long time ago. The songs are poorly constructed, and get rather redundant. The fact that I like Jonathan Davis' vocals is what convinced me to give this more than one star.If you're a die hard Korn fan, then by all means buy this album, but if you're a new listener looking for a great hardcore band, this is NOT what you expect. The music is very simple, with poor beat changes.Sorry Korn, this one fails in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST BUY CD!","review":"I think this cd is on eof the best albums yet to be produced by KoRn and if you are a true fan you better buy this cd..

It has hints of Life Is Peachy and Follow the Leader and has a sound all its own. I think the stand out tracks are \\"Falling Away From Me\\" and \\"Wake Up\\".

Dead, Falling Away From Me, Trash, Beg For Me, Make Me Bad, Somebody Someone, Wish You Could Be Me, Counting, and Dirty deserve 4 or 5 stars, but the rest of the songs bring it all the way down to 2 stars. Korn, Life Is Peachy, and Follow The Leader, are all 4 or 5 star albums, but this one was mostly trash.

Alot of it reminds me of the bands second release \\"Life is Peachy\\". It has some great riffs and songs on it. The songs that really stand out as new korn classics to me are \\"Trash\\", \\"beg for me\\", \\"Wake up\\", and \\"Somebody someone\\". Although all the songs are extremely good.

You would think that a year might not be enough time to come up with something good, but that wasn't the case here. They were really smart by getting rid of all the rap that was seen on their last album, and just getting back to business. This album contains some of the best songs they've ever written, such as \\"Make Me Bad\\" and the awesome first single, \\"Falling Away From Me\\". \\"Somebody Someone\\", although the lesser single of the 3, is also an instant classic. The album deals with all kinds of topics, from child abuse, to a fight that the band had, and just a lot of Jon Davis's personal feelings. It's got a few flaws, such as the number of fillers, but overall it's a great CD and probably their best one besides their self-titled album. If you don't already own this album, then go get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Issues","review":"In Issues, Davis' vocals take on an entirely differnt and gripping mood. Not only does he develop looks new vocal designs, but implements them to get an utterly brooding effect. The heavy distortion remains throughout the album, which gives it plenty ofintense energy. Corresponding with the vocal passages, Davis' lyrics are just as psychotic in Issues. However, the instrumental music in this album is mostly the same. It seems there is no significant change, except maybe more choatic and dissonant music. Primarily, the album is still a desperately adverse show of imagination that makes korn the band they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as Good as Self-Titled \\"Korn\\"","review":"Korn has yet again proven that they are fresh, original, and always creative. \\"Issues\\" is very melodic but keeps a tight hold on their basic sound - being very heavy, heart-pounding, emotional music. While not as exceptionally powerful as their self-titled debut, Korn has shown that they know how to rock. There's tons of great songs on the CD that all have a unique sound - the single \\"Falling Away From Me\\" is creepy and contrasts between a haunted melody and heavy guitar beats that make you want to get up and jump. \\"Trash\\" is pure Korn, with great guitars and emotional lyrics from Davis. Also standing out are \\"Make Me Bad\\", \\"Somebody Someone\\", and \\"No Way\\". Finally, \\"Let's Get This Party Started,\\" which appears near the end of the CD, suprised me with the absolutely meanacing chorus that grabs your attention and screams in your face, \\"Listen!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good CD, but not KoRn's best","review":"When I listened to KoRn's 1st cd(self-titled) I was an instant fan, but I was disappointed with Life is Peachy, in my opinion their worst CD.

Since I was 12 I've listened to metal-core, progressive rock/metal, indie, post-punk, ambient, etc etc. Honestly, this disc stands somewhere between metal and post-punk; something like a mainstream Godflesh. The riffs are absolutely crushing and the melodies are eerie and infectious. I'm not sure whether these guys are \\"record company tools\\" or whatever, but everything here sounds honest and off-beat. This is a gem of mainstream-metal.P.S.

There's only one thing I don't like with this album, between some tracks they have some short songs that makes you press the next button. Why did they make those wierd songs between?

The whole idea of four different covers was a cool idea, but I'm not one of those mega-fanatics who went out and bought all four. I chose between my two favourites. Anyway, about the music... the two most stellar tracks are \\"Falling Away From Me\\" and \\"Trash\\". This stuff sounds like early Korn, and I loved it! The rest of the album is awesome too, especially \\"Make Me Bad\\", \\"Dirty\\" and of course the intro, \\"Dead\\". Jon Davis' voice and the rest of the band make this a GREAT album and a must-have for all Korn fans! I'm extremely psyched with the new CD and I can't wait for the tour. Korn is definitely one of the greatest bands of this decade and they're gonna last into the new millenium! Thanks, Korn, for making November a GREAT month for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I got this CD about a month before it was released.

I loved their self-titled debut album, it represented the outward expression of the raw emotional pain we all feel in such a tangible way...but I don't have a clue what they are doing here. They shy away from their trademark crunch, instead choosing to have Davis howl over weird house of horrors style music. No track on the album possesses the intensity and power generally associated with KoRn. What the hell happened?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than makes up for follow the leader","review":"When I first put this new cd in my cd player I new things were going to be ok. The first thing you hear on the track \\"Dead\\" are bagpipes. As any true follower of korn knows this is where they started. By far the best track on this cd is the third one entitled, \\"Trash.\\" Overall this cd shows that Korn has tried tried to please their fans that have been there since the beginning in 1994. It is still not better than their selftitled masterpiece. Personally I feel that I have to high expectations for my favorite bands new cds. I have been getting away from these types of bands but Korn is still the best rapcore band out there. This album has heavy riffs, emotional lyrics, and it shows alot of effort. But Jon Davis doesn't sound the way he used to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn Proves it does not take 5 years to make a good CD","review":"I would like to say that this is the single best Korn CD ever. Korn made this is in about 1 year. Bands that take four or five years have no excuse. Issues has dramatically powerful lyrics, great guitar which easily beat those sounds made by the \\"Guitars, drums and bass\\" in Rage Against the Machine and just plain prove that Korn is the \\"leader\\". This is one of the last great rock CDs of the century. Harsh lyrics mixed with Jonathan's voice thrown in with great beats and sweet guitar noises, Issues will blow away anyone that is both a Korn fan or a Korn hater. With songs like \\"Falling Away From Me\\" and \\"Trash\\", this CD is on a totally different level then previous entries such as \\"Follow the Leader\\" and \\"Life Is Peachy\\". This will sell millions and millions, go platinum and always be remembered."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like hard rock, you'll love this album","review":"Maybe I'm bais because I'm such a huge KoRn fan, but this album is great.

Well worth the price with some great music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Their Approach Has Turned Me Off","review":"I've heard all of their records and I'm not very impressed. I'm not saying they present horrible songs and that they have no talent. I'm sure they do. I just don't like music where a lot of songs sound the same. The lead singer is just messed up. He's always whinning about everything. I can see why. He's had a messed up life, but hey get over it. Instead of whinning about everything, change your approach. If something tragic has happened in one's life, it's very impressing to see them take positive approaches to things rather than negative ones. There are gloomy music that may sound sad but give out good messages. Good messages are better than bad or blank statements. At least that's my opinion. One good thing I have to say about Korn, they do put on a great show. Saw them in Oakland of 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHINGLIKE THE OTHER CD'S","review":"I MUST SAY THAT I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEW KoRn ALBUM ALTHOUGH, TO TELL THE TRUTH I DID NOT EXPECT MUCH SEEING AS HOW IT WAS LITTE MORE THEN A YEAR SINCE THE RELEACE OF FOLLOW THE LEADERCAME OUT.

The style was new and inventive, adn the songs were great. However, this is not the case with Issues. They deliver almost an identical record to their first one with no major changes. Usually, with a recent release, you are able to see how the band has matured over their recent fame. It is clearly evident here that Korn threw in a duplicate of their first record in order to get everyone to buy it because it's by Korn. My reccomendation is if you don't have Follow the Leader, buy one or the other. Don't waste your money on two identical records."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why cant you give it 0 stars.what this trash really deserves","review":"Come on...this is the dumbest album, Korn, (sorry I can't turn the r around) has no talent and needs to give it up.

It is hard to find a cd that you can listen to from beginning to end but this is definitely one of those rare finds. There are so many groups out there that try to recreate Korn's sound but it's impossible to do-- from Jon's amazing vocals and lyrics to fieldy's percussion style bass. They have a unique sound that never gets old. Issues has that loud, thrashing sound on tracks like \\"Beg For Me\\" and \\"Wake Up\\" that you think of when you think of Korn, but also has a great mix of slow songs like \\"4 U\\" which keeps it fresh. And of course who doesn't love the hits \\"Falling Away From Me\\", \\"Make Me Bad\\", and \\"Somebody Someone\\"?

Keep up the good work guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Issues - The album for the public","review":"This album is very good except for the fact that there are 4 completely usleless filler tracks, and 10 potential singles. I can imagine every full length song except for Wake Up being played on MTV or radio. However, there are lots of good songs like Dead (Good bagpipes), Falling Away From Me, Trash, Beg for Me, Hey Daddy, and Let's Get this Party Started.

This is a good introduction to Korn, as is FTL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"What a powerful cd. \\"Somebody Someone\\" sends off vibes so that u can actually feel it, and i actually like lyrics in their songs. \\"Make Me Bad\\" is a dark, grim, yet great.

Suicide prevention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Korn's ONLY good disc!","review":"I'm not much of a Nu-Metal fan, and really dislike most of Korn's discography. Issues is a different story! There is no hip-hop (thank God!), and the album showcases depression,angst, and sorrow in the vocals and lyrics (qualities I adore in metal!). These qualities in conjunction with the overall \\"heaviness\\" of the disc puts this recording well above all the \\"cookie cutter\\" nu-metal acts. If your a fan of good metal, don't discount this disc becuase of Korn's mainstream status. Did I mention......no rap on this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Falling away from me...","review":"is the only good song on this album, others completely failed to hold my attention for longer than a day, 'wake up' sounded uplifting at first but it got too repetitive like the whole CD.Issues is just another one-track CD by another nu-metal band."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Creed than KoRn","review":"This CD decided to put more emphasis on better lyric writing than better music. Truth is, neither one of those things are better. This CD is almost killing their style from their previous records. And as for the lyrics, these are definitely the dumbest lyrics that have come our of his mouth. Download the song \\"Trash\\" and then ignore this CD. Unless KoRn redefines their style, I hope to not be hearing from them in a while. Hands-down worst KoRn CD.Favorite songs: Trash"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, Not the best......","review":"I personally think that this album is not the best by Korn. It is in a sense, a radical departure from FOLLOW THE LEADER. With some weird sounds and primitive lyrics. In my opinion the 1st album was the best.

Maybe Korn can learn from this and make a better album next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do you want to listen to unhappy music?","review":"why do you want to listen to unhappy music. stop trying to cram yourself into the steriotyped korn boshing angry teenager. listen to something happier, trust me, you'll be happier if your happy search Happy2bHardcore (no spaces) that's some good stuff, disk three is the best"},{"rating":"2","title":"Issues Kicks","review":"Very good CD.

The hard rocking head banging ones, and now, well, choirs, and orchestral music. It seems that Korn is taking the same road as many groups, and going for the soft pop landing. This CD is just 16 very bad songs. I really like korn, and I love it, but what is wrong with the guys down there? It all started with the Follow the Leader. If you guys want good music, bring back Ross Robinson, producer of tonnes of great records (the two first korn ones, and slipknot, coalchamber), all with a beat that changed the way the music industry though. If you want music, change to a heavier group, because this one is goin kapootz"},{"rating":"1","title":"When is it EVER going to end?","review":"This album's actually the worst of the bunch.

And I thought Follow the Leader was bad! Korn was a very promising band with the release of thier 1994 debut. The music was punkish and very innovative. The lyrics sent a strong, easily understood message. But they flushed all their talent down the toilet once they gained some fame. They shed thier So-Cal punk image for a more mainstream preppie one. They're more worried about promoting their buddies Limp Bizkit than making good music. Issues has no heart to it. It came only out 14 months after Follow the Leader did! They only put it out to please thier fans. Jon Davis CANNOT sing worth squat! He should stick to his creepy growling instead. Head and Munky need to get rid of those corny effects used on Issues and think of some catchy riffs. I think it's time for Korn to get rid of the high and mighty ego and put some thought into creating some innovative and clever music, like they did back in '94."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn sux","review":"This cd is terrible. Ive never seen such a sellout band in my life. Korn has absolutely no talent at all and it shows on this cd. What dont they try actually playing their instruments?

I'd like to keep this interview simple, so I'll make my main points now:Korn started off great, and got worse with every CD they released (no acceptions to the pattern). Their first album, the self-titled, is excellent and I would reccomend the purchase of it. \\"Life Is Peachy\\" is also a necessity, but it just about ends there. \\"Follow the Leader\\" is OKAY but nothing outstanding.There is ONE decent (not great) song on \\"Issues.\\" It's called \\"Let's get this party started.\\" Get the mp3, or put it on a mix if you want, but don't waste your money on the album for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Korn, but Slipknot ate their 5th star from me...","review":"Korn is an excellent band for our generation. Although their messages in their songs are somewhat depressing at times, I have personally learned to block that out. I enjoy the harmony in the music itself. Most may not think it has a melody at all, but they are wrong. The best part in their music is the unusual gutar and occational sound effects mixed in. Although they don't have a full time DJ like Slipknot, which really would have helped them. Personally if it were between this cd and slipknot, I'd go with Slipknot, they are simply more innovative with their 9, yes, count em, 9! BAND MEMBERS! But if Slipknot is too heavy for you, Korn is the next best thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Issues\\" has Issues","review":"A typical overhyped release. Obviously Korn believes fans will put up with the constant change in music style, unfortunately some fans do. This album is simply trash. Korn has potential but wastes it on trash like this. Don't get me wrong I do own and enjoy their self labeled release \\"Korn\\". It gave metal a new dimension. It kicked and really stayed heavy, something most metal albums don't do. But after the release of \\"Korn\\" everything went downhill. Six years with three albums worth of chances and Korn has gotten worse and worse. Even with their horrible music they have still held onto fans. Their lyrics of violence has turned their fans into pre-meditating murderers, or at least most of them. Just visit the Kornweb message boards. Anyway, this album like everyother korn release (Except for \\"Korn\\" their '94 self titled album)is a waste of money and listening time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst thing I have ever heard, and I don't even own it","review":"Look, this kind of music is so old...I mean, there is no style to it at all, and it really doesn't take much talent to scream and bang on intstruments-it is just a trend...Buy some real music like Britney Spears who can really sing if you are looking for good music"},{"rating":"1","title":"no thanks","review":"I enjoyed all the other albums but this one is just plain BORING!

I bought it right away and went home to listen to it. I had to shut it off because it was so bad! The only decent song on it was \\"Falling Away From Me.\\" Korn used a lot of computerized sounds and it ruined the CD. It is a lot different from their first and second CDs, but the problem is, this CD stinks. I wouldn't recommend this unless you like that kind of stuff. Both the lyrics and the music are bad, but some songs have some decency (two or three)."},{"rating":"1","title":"John!.. What Happened!","review":"Ok it gets 2 stars. I like Korn.. I really really do. But I'msorry, I was not happy at all with this album. First of all, I realizethat a band must evolve and change, and with them, their music. However, I find that the music on this CD is not evolved at all, it is manufactured. It's like this, the first album is great, Life is Peachy was great too, follow the leader was my favorite, and Issues is, well, a disappointment. I guess the guys got caught up in the success and were in a rush. So they pumped out a sell out, ( ) rushed album. If you just love Korn, or perhaps buy music because other people think it's cool, this is a record for you. But if you actually like to 'listen', I don't think you'll be enjoying more than 2 or 3 songs. Sorry Mr. Davis. Spend a few more months next time.

Their music has no possible meaning, since the don't put any effort at all making a new record. (What did it take? A month...two?) The embarresing is that kids buy their cool attitude.

Not so on Issues. This sounds like something Creed would write.\\"Make me Bad\\" is trash. This song is the absolute *perfect* example of nu-metal pop-rock. Seriosuly, remove the deep bass sound and what are you left with? A Nickelback song, that's what.Korn jumped the shark in a big way with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker, heavier, and back to their original ways.","review":"For all those who thought that Follow the Leader was trendy, you probably will not like Issues as well. Korn goes back to their darker, heavier side, much more similiar to their master work of the original album. This album by far sounds of much improvement over the other three, with a variety of different sounds blended extremely well with Jonathan Davis' powerful voice, and voices in some songs. An extemely well done piece of art. It ranks at number one next to their first album as the best yet, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"I thought this CD was pretty cool.

They experiment with new sounds (\\"Trash\\", my favorite track on the album) as well as keeping old styles fresh (\\"Let's Get This Party Started\\"). This is a very odd album from start to finish and the little mini tracks give it a nice touch. The cool part of this album is that they tried some new stuff and didn't fail.KoRn prove themselves more inventive than most metal bands and release a stunning effort, with the best two tracks \\"Trash\\" and \\"No Way\\" to boot.....KoRn prove themselves a solid band with an album that even outdoes the self titled debut.

The film goes on like this until she meets a new guy (he's alive by the way). They go to the theater and watch a long, meaningless film about birds. They go to the zoo and to the fair and I nearly went to sleep.The live guy is fond of the girl but senses something is wrong when he finds a chopped off wang in the refrigerator!

I heard it was nowhere near as good as the first, but i didnt expect it to be THIS BAD.Just as others have said, there are a bunch of pointless scenes where nothing is being said or done. The first sex scene with the corpse is long, not shocking and just plain boring. This is supposed to be taboo i guess, but it really just puts you to sleep.I know the director wanted to do something different and not just rehash the first film, but it could have been so much better. If you edit out the few gore sequences, its more like a boring date movie than anything else.If you can find the find the first one, pick that up.

Ahhh...then comes the conflict....she is torn between the corpse and a human man. The movie was disappointing...not shocking...just somewhat pointless.

If made in China I inspect it very closely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hetty","review":"Very different from a Poirot, Lewis, frost etc. in terms of how she ends up solving/wrapping up mysteries. Some of it appears as luck and others make you go back and watch the episode to catch what elements made her conclude the way she did, which is fun because you do catch things that you missed! Hetty is, also, more of a character that ordinary people can connect with. Plus, the relationship that the main three characters, Hetty, Jeffery and Robert, have a lot of good chemistry and silly moments.

The music is boring and substandard compared to what the Wiggles have output in the past 2 years. Also, they've gone back to those cheesy sets typical of pre-2008 releases. Basically, what were the Wiggles thinking? This release has made me wonder if they are in trouble financially, and that's why they've released such cheap crap? My 15 month old, who LOVES the Wiggles and is typically up and dancing when they are on, was bored within the first 5 minutes. The highlight of the DVD is watching the guys do handstands and juggle, illustrating that they are still talented, and therefore have no excuse for how truly painful this was to watch. I just feel so let down. Wiggles, you've made a fan very sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good Wiggles video.","review":"Little kids will like this video, maybe not as much as some of their other products.

Naturally, we added this one to our collection. So imagine my surprise to see how uninspiring this production turned out. The whole show was stuck in a small circular stage, and the colorful circus atmosphere clashed with the black starry backdrop and polka-dotted black floor. The songs were rather bland. They did the same gymnastic numbers as they did on their other recent DVD release, \\"The Wiggles: Big, Big Show!\\". And at times, the camera was 10-feet high and you would be looking down on the Wiggles at an awkward camera angle. This is nothing like their computer graphic enhanced DVD's, \\"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing\\" and \\"The Wiggles Go Bananas!\\". It's more basic than \\"Hoop-Dee-Doo! It's a Wiggly Party\\", and that's going way, way back. I hate to do it, Wiggles, but I have to give it 2-stars. Here's hoping the next DVD production turns out better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Sybex version instead","review":"This book was horrible. After using it, I failed the test by 16 points.

As for the three well-known titles - Easy Rider, Five Easy Pieces, King of Marvin Gardens - these films hark back to a time when great writing, thought-provoking drama and nuanced performances mattered, and movies did not need half-a-billion dollars worth of special effects and large things blowing up to get people to the box office. The common theme through these films is alienation: the sense that \\"traditions\\" and \\"values\\" that moralizers want to force on everyone simply don't translate into happiness or fulfillment for all.

At first I thought it seemed flimsy because the fabric is very lightweight, but it is very strong and because the pack is unstructured it folds with the wheelchair. This is great because it saves me the extra step of taking it off and folding it before I put the w'chair in the back of my van. I have stuffed books, magazines, water bottles and my purse in there taking my brother to his medical appointments. The velcro flap keeps everything inside.

By rolling each item, I was able to get his airplane blanket, hooded sweatshirt, neck pillow, small waterbottle, and light jacket stuffed into the unassuming black backpack. It suits a minimalist. The velcro was an easy, handy close. When nothing is in it, it folds down to nothing. We were able to hang it on the back of the wheel chair and roll clear up to the airplane door. We used the backpack as one of his carry ons - like a briefcase. It is soft and flexible and can fit into places easily. I'd recommend it.

They are desiged to fit over the handles of the chair. However,if the chair has hand brakes, this won't work. If the loops had buckles or velcro that would allow them to be wrapped around any part of the frame, it would be great.

By it's negative nature, it gave a certain \\"mantle\\" and ungodly mission to a group of people who left our church, and after they did, began to drink, swear, lie, and attack the very fiber of our church all because they had some kind of mantra from this heritical book. Having no authority in the church as leaders or pastors, they took on the self appointed goal of rebuking us with pages of the book, and wouldn't even stand up for what they \\"believed\\" on the witness stand. After the judge charged and fined them, he gave a fitting lecture on real Christianity and how to deal with problems between people, a skill which those who used this book as their defense seriously lacked!

Several friends later left this same spiritually abusive church after reading the same book.I especially liked the checklists at the end of each chapter. It helped to have a visual list of how I had been deceived. When you are in a cult, the leaders are very convincing and often you find yourself thinking the way they talked. The lists were a great way to remind me that I wasn't insane. The appendices at the end of the book are also a great tool.

I thought he'd really enjoy this set because he was showing so much interest. After having the product for a couple weeks now, my son would still rather play with the big broom. Also, the broom lays around on the floor when he's not playing with it and gets stepped on sometimes. The long handle bent from someone stepping on it.

I felt that buying this broom would equal hours upon hours of fun, but in reality it only equaled about 2 minutes of fun. I have another broom that I keep in my closet, and it is also not neat, so I was hoping for better luck with this broom. As I've been writing this, I realized that buying a broom for fun purposes was probably not the best move on my part, because in the history of brooms, I think maybe one or 2 were actually fun...and those were magic brooms. Don't buy this broom if you're looking for hours of neat, extraordinary broom fun. You could probably just use it as a normal broom, and it would be ok.

My son has a total meltdown everytime it falls apart but I can't take it away from him right now. UGH!!! How hard is it to make a BROOM??? And at less than $10 bucks it feels like a waste of time and energy to pack up and send back. So it's a total waste of plastic, time, energy, and baby tears.

It is a fascinating story of how some of the crew managed to make their way by rowboat and on foot from Tasmania to Sydney, an unimaginable achievement. At times this book was actually 'unputdownable'! The book was brought further to life by a recent exhibition in Australia of some remnants from the wrecked boat.

I'm not sure what the Boy was thinking when he put on the first outfit. The only thing I can imagine is that he used it as a distraction from his singing. I thought something was wrong with the DVD because it sounded warped. Then I realized that the band sounded fine, it was just George's singing. He was way off key and sounded like he had a sore throat. I saw the reunion concert in Chicago and thoroughly enjoyed it-I don't know what happened here. George didn't appear to have the same enthusiasm he usually projects. Thank God this wasn't my first experience with the group or I never would have listened to them again. A better choice for others would be the Greatest Hits DVD which includes the concert A Kiss Across the Ocean."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love ya George But....","review":"This was perhaps the worst live performance I have ever seen.

He likes to distort the songs and they never come across as clear and soulful, unlike some performers. I felt the old video \\"A Kiss Across The Ocean\\" was so much more magical than this. This totally lacks the impact and power. Sad to say, I skip throughout the DVD. I wish the record company would release, instead, a definitive Culture Club/Boy George music video DVD. George has always been a chameleon and the videos were simply wonderful.

He sounds hoarse, he can't hit the high notes, he's out of breath, and he forgets when to start/stop singing on certain songs! My honest reaction was, \\"Is he on drugs?\\" Then this British singer comes out in the middle to sing this dreary ballad. It brings the concert to a screeching halt. It gives George a chance to change into a black suit, though he looks like a homeless person now, at least my eyes can rest.

The Hongs wanted desperately for their family to be entwined with the Moon family, and after arranging for one child to be wed to the first Moon daughter, they pushed Nansook to marry a Moon son. Though I don't know all the motives, the point is that there was an agenda behind her marriage and probably this book that Ms. Hong has not been honest about.

We have used it together several times now and he found it real easy to manage. The only thing I won't let him use without help are the glass slides as the edges are not polished so they can be quite sharp.

There weren't even moments of a nice guy peeking through. So even though the story was pretty good and the heroine had spunk, the hero ruined the whole thing for me.

I finally decided to skip a few chapters and read the last 1/3, it was okay but certainly not as good as \\"Mistress\\",\\"Ravished\\" or \\"Desire\\" (my favorite!).

Her dialogue is realistic, frequently witty, and sometimes very poignant. There are certain similarities among her heroines, and even more so among her heroes, yet there are sufficient differences to make any resemblances seem comforting and familiar, rather than formulaic. She also handles the requisite sex scenes with a very deft touch.\\"Seduction\\" is one of my favorites of all her books, although it is actually very hard to choose. \\"Ravished\\", \\"Mistress\\" \\"Scandal\\" - the list of great books goes on and on.If you enjoy any type of romance novel, you will absolutely love \\"Seduction\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, lighthearted read........","review":"This is my second book by Amanda Quick...DEFINITELY not my last...what a charming Story..I love a fast paced read with silliness and sexiness combined..and \\"Seduction\\" was just what I was in the mood for.

If you are familiar with the original widescreen/letterbox laserdisc that Disney released, you'll find that this DVD sports the exact same composite video transfer with all of its inherent problems intact. No new high definition master was created for this release.The only thing of merrit is that the ORIGINAL 5.1 surround track was used to encode it to Dolby Digital 5.1 audio. Yup, the packaging is in error. You're in for a treat as the split surround channels are pretty darn active considering it was mixed in the early days of 5.1 digital surround equipped cinemas.Hopefully, Disney will re-do this DVD in the near future.

Raistlin is now dealing with his physical changes, and reluctantly learning that he still has a lot to learn. Caramon is is seen as the kid who was shown how to hold a sword and thinks that he knows how to use it. Personally though, I enjoyed watching how Kit joined the dragon armies.

If you want to learn the language and have a meaningful, if simple, conversation with a Thai, I'd recommend applying your money to another medium. However, if you're desperate for a book that has Thai in it because you're going to land in Thailand in 24 hours, it might do (that's how it gets two stars)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant, noncontroversial and fun.","review":"My 3 year old boy likes this book quite a bit. He likes to have all three stories read to him before he goes to sleep each night. The stories are pleasant enough and the illustrations are colorful. I find the book a little bland but the noncontroversial nature of the characters (there's none of the meanness that characterizes some of the Thomas characters) and the simple storylines makes for good bedtime reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for Thomas fans","review":"My 3 year old has had this book almost for a year and loves reading it over and over again.

No other book has ever impacted me in such sweeping, all-encompassing fashion. Lockridge's masterpiece novel is epic in scope and feeling, utterly magnificent. Midwesterners in particularly will be struck by its magic and eloquence. There is not a prosy sentence in all of its 1,000 plus pages. Since I found \\"Raintree County\\", all discussions/debates about \\"The Great American Novel\\" have been irrelevant. This is it. Lockridge sits next to Shakespeare on my bookshelf and in my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under the spell of the Raintree","review":"Whether this novel is great literature or not I cannot say, nor can I advocate it as fodder for the college lit class. The book is just so personal. Bares comparison with Tristram Shandy, Huck Finn, The Red Badge of Courage and even Light in August. High praise, indeed. Be prepared for what it dredges up in your past. I should mention that I grew up in Branch County."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"Loved the movie; hated the book.

While it is a magnificent piece of writing, and a uniquely American epic tale, it is essentially a young man's story. It is the story of America in the later half of the 19th century, and its movement forward into our present. It is rich and complex. It is filled with intellectual games and human passions. It's a pity about the author's suicide, but he knew he would never surpass it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Good","review":"This is a great film. It is entertaining, suspenseful, and effectively produced. I didn't like the female lead, but then again, this isn't ultimately a problem. I kept this on my \\"watchlist\\" for a long time.

The movie has a great look, is well directed, beautifully filmed and has some solid performances. But one can't shake the overwhelming feeling that this is just another media attempt to bash the south and stereotype white southerners as cruel and dimwitted. My ancestors fought for the Union and if I had lived back then I would have too. But I can smell Ted Turner's attempt to brainwash viewers with his politically correct message despite the fact it has been so skillfully hidden behind the varnish of this lavish production.

The All Music Guide has rated this boxed set to be \\"Best Of Genre\\". Which means, it's a classic from the ealry 80's. This boxed pretty much captures everything from 1982 up until 1986.

I expect to become aware of the more arcane subtleties involved in persuading a salmon to take a fly, but I think I can at least begin on a solid footing--without spending a king's ransom for flies and other equipment.

When I got the hanger model # I then compared the one I ordered to the one that was broken. The one I ordered was a perfect fit and looks to be made from steel rather than aluminum. The old hanger broke when a wire rod flipped into my derailleur and broke both it and my derailleur. The only reason I didn't rate this higher was because the color was not black or silver.

The chapters felt disjointed to me. But what is more problematic is the lack of rigor in the writing.

The jack melted in the accessory plug under no strain with only one jack in one of the two inputs - an XM jack. There was no unusual demand on the unit, the XM was not on, in fact, but it blew fuse after fuse. I'm glad I put this on a standard accessory jack and not something jerry-rigged like many do to get an extra jack in their cars, one that might not have been on a fused line at all.

A sizable chunk of his suggestions have been gleaned from interviews with others and he doesn't have much personal insight to share. Also, I question his credibility. Who writes a book about frugality then talks about his $200 blazer, $100 shoes, and 3 brand new cars in a decade?Overall, if you are brand new to the idea of living within your means, this book might be a helpful primer.

They kept their arty pose, their performance artists pedigree and their weird lunatic essence, but the tunes are more accessible and traditionally melodic in its minimal fashion. This time they decided to create a listenable record without losing their integrity and indie-industrial credibility, and we have to give them credits for achieving this purpose so successfully.

While it did exactly what is was supposed to (knock down the light level so I do could long exposures in direct sunlight), it introduced a horrific magenta colour shift to parts of the image. If it had been a uniform colour shift, it would have been easily correctable in post, but because of the non-uniform shift, it was entirely uncorrectable. After doing some reading online it looks like this has something to do with IR. I bought B+W without doing any research because of my respect for the name and prior experience with their products.

I am glad I watched a Scott Kelby video before using this though. I probably would have figured out that you need to prefocus and then put the filter on, but it nice knowing ahead of time. You can't see anything with it on. I think that is the only drawback, a lot of putting on and taking off of the filter, I was worried about dropping it.

I tried to pull a ding out on the side of my car with this, and it pulled it about half way out. BUT, it actually made a new dent where the rubber of the suction cup was pulling. So... I say if you want to get a dent pulled to look like new, go to a body shop. Any other means to get dents out have been without avail."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Zambonis Rock!","review":"The Zambonis are not only a hilariously funny band that captures the essence of Hockey, but they have songs that are so good that you end up singing them to yourself for days.

Only two of the tracks have lyrics but we get a list of whom plays what on the album. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demento Country Western Style","review":"A good way to think of this disc is to think of the kind of songs Dr. Demento would play if he was having a Country Western themed show. What you get is 18 songs, mostly novelty or comedic in nature, performed by by country stars or musical satirists. Some of the songs are funny, some chuckle, but no giant winners on this disc. But then again this collection is form before we had the whole Blue Collar Comedy revival of the last 10 years or so. So if you are looking for some mild Country style humorous songs, then this may be for you. Otherwise you may want to pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality","review":"I purchased this set on Sept 2006 and while it \\"was\\" a beautiful set, it is beautiful no longer. Over the past two years, the pattern has completely worn off half the pieces. The silver rings at the top of the handles have broken on several pieces with a few having been lost, leaving me with an ugly incomplete piece. Two pieces have handles that have cracked.These have never been in a dishwasher and while used regularly, have never been abused.I am extremely disappointed with this set and after reading reviews on similar styles of flatware from Pfalzgraff, it appears they have serious production problems with these sets.I do NOT recommend you buy this or similarly made flatware items from Pfalzgraff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I used this on our deck a few years ago and it began peeling almost right away.

It worked fine for the first few books, then suddenly stopped syncing them. I had a terrible time reaching anyone at Archos; their contact link didn't work, and their phones are rarely answered. I get a message telling when their business hours are, and then it hangs up--even if it's during their business hours. When I finally did reach someone, he was unable to help, so he had me return the device for a replacement. The second one worked fine for the first few books and then did exactly the same thing as the first one.

As others have stated you can have the remote learn any button not just the 4 learning buttons. This allows it to control any device (that is IR controlled). I have a liteon DVD player (LVW-5100) that didn't have a code, it took me a bit to figure out how to program the remote but within 30 minutes it was running all my equipment including the DVD player.For this price the product is a steal, if your in the market for a universal remote this should be high on your list. Don't forget to add some AAA batteries to your order though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on pills, and no batteries","review":"I can understand people being suspicious about the 5 star reviews, but I am disabled and don't work and I think this is an excellent fabric shaver for the following reasons. 1. You can plug it in - no batteries - better for you and the environment. 2. It has a large surface area and waste capacity, so you are not constantly emptying it. 3. It works very well on pills, my sweaters look great. 4. One caveat - it won't pick up hairs, no way, no how! I am long haired and I seem to shed and so does my cat. That's my only complaint, but the product does say it's a sweater shaver not a lint roller and it does what it says it will do. I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor","review":"The shaver didn't shaver lint pills off of clothes, very dissatiffied.

It's far better to have an electric device for clothing shaving than the battery powered ones. This Smartek was fabulous, but after using about 8 or 9 times it stopped working consistantly.

Great when it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for saving your clothes!","review":"I bought this last week off Amazon and received it a couple days later (free student prime accounts, FTW!). I've already used it on two cardigans, both of which had mild to bad pills (one from moderate use for three months, the other from being washed too many times in the course of a year). I was amazed at how well the fabric shaver works: it removes the pilling and doesn't nick the fabric. Within a few minutes my cardigans were looking brand new!My only complaint is that in order to remove moderate to bad pilling, you'll have to go over the area several times, making the task of shaving the entire clothing item much longer. The first cardigan I used this on had light pilling, so the entire sweater took maybe about 20 minutes (including the recommended down time to prevent the motor from damage). The other sweater, however, took about four times longer and the lint compartment had to be emptied several times.Aside from that, I would definitely recommend this device!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smartek Deluxe Clothes Shaver","review":"I really loved this product - after reviewing several different customer reviews on clothes shaver - this one stood out among all of them. What a wonderful shaver - it quickly clean the fuzzy off of your clothes - as long as you do not press to hard - and why should you - you are not ironing your clothes. Although, this is the 1st time that I have ever purchase a product like this - I am very, very happy with it. I recommend it highly - with no complaints. As before with anything else that I have purchase from Amazon web site - the shipment was quick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned","review":"This shaver is way too bulky for my hands. It takes 'C' batteries, which might hint to the enormous size of the thing. Additionally, the 'on' switch must be turned on AND held down to operate it.

It's a must for women who want to hear it from someone who has been there.

The daily inspirational message from Tawni helps keep me putting one foot in front of another--run/walking, strength-training, and eating better.Tawni says, \\"If I can do it, you can do it!\\" And that's what's so valuable about her book. Reading about her struggles--and her successes--you see that it's NOT a matter of waiting for motivation. That \\"will\\" (as in the force of will), is the faithful force that makes for real changes.

If I bend the cable near one of the ends I can get the other channel to come in intermittently. Note that I didn't ever fiddle with the ends during normal use. I have only tried the bending game to get the lost channel to come in.If you think the price is worth about 1 year of use, this is the cable you want to get.

The quality of the product is extremely poor. The cord will stretch out within a few uses. The retractable part keeps tangling and never retracts back to normal right away.

I used them daily, and they each lasted about 4-6 months, and then they stopped working. The cables are very thin and I think they just wear out after a while.

His replacement works OK but the retracting mechanism doesn't really work as good as hoped, and his sounds better than mine. My replacement sounds worse than the first one and the retracting mechanism has never worked right. All in all I feel meh about them. BUT for $5 you can't really be too upset...

Fortunately, I had read the other reviews, so I was not surprised by the short length and it works for me. Some things you should know:* As other reviewers mention, this is not a 6' cable. The technical details have the correct 2.5' length, but the description is incorrect.* The retractor mechanism is a little cheap and I've gotten it tangled a couple of times. That being said, I've always been able to untangle it and it has recovered.* The rubber around the plug ends is a good size for iPods and most stereo inputs, but it is too wide for the audio jack in an iPhone. I took a sharp knife to one end of the cable and shaved down the sides, then it worked fine even for the recessed iPhone jack. This wasn't too hard to do, though that cable end doesn't look too pretty now.In spite of these reservations, the cable works well, the audio quality seems fine, and it is small, convenient, and nicely functional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in about a month","review":"This cable worked fine... while it worked.

The difference in sound quality is noticeably different. This Scosche sounds pretty terrible. I have to crank up the volume to hear it, and the tonal quality suffers a little. I do like the retractability, but the cable is so thin it feels like I could cut through it with my fingernails, and, as I said, the audio quality leaves a lot to be desired.

It was weakly spot-welded to the body of the cup and just fell apart one day, revealing that there was no insulating material between the inner and outer walls of the cup. Do yourself a favor and look at the Thermos E5 products. That cup is truly thermal (keeps my coffee drinkably hot for nearly five hours), and has a true uni-directional lid with no handle repositioning.

It looked just like my old starbucks mug, but I could get it in colors instead of just stainless steel! After using the mug a total of 4 times, the screw that allows the lid to close and become spill resistant loosened. It would spill all over if I barely tilted the mug, as if the lid wasn't there. After I figured out the problem, I figured I could just tighten the screw... Nope ... After each time I opened the mug, the screw would loosen again. This was a complete waste of money for me.

In all, there were only a handful of examples of signs being shown and I don't believe it is worth the money if your looking for dictionary-type or reference video.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty good","review":"My daughter uses a few signs.. and it does help at times, but I wish they had an easier to use dictionary of signs...a DVD would be great and easy to make that dictionary on.

Thank you, Thank you, Thank You."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing results from easy to follow demonstration in video","review":"Some people may think it is odd I would benefit from this program being that I am already fluent in American Sign Language. With my first child I did not utilize any resources while teaching her to sign and while she picked up a large vocabulary we had some pitfalls along the way. Plus I did not even realize all the different scenarios in which to provide new signs for my daughter. This time around with my son I've seen a difference in teaching him useful signs earlier than I would have thought he could understand their meaning, such as \\"help\\" and \\"hot\\". The years of research and knowledge provided in this complete kit definately benefits parents just starting out with signing to their baby/toddler. Parents in my workshops and classes using this kit have also stated it has made a great impact on their lives. Sign4Baby .... everyone should do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have for Parents","review":"This is a must have for parents. At six months, my son is able to sign to me when he wants milk. He can recognize many other signs when I sign them.The video has a section that will allow you to jump to any of the words so you can see how they are signed. This is a great supplement to the printed signs.This is a great way to increase the communication with your loved one that cannot speak words yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun for the kid!","review":"I got this DVD after my daughter much enjoyed learning to sign with the DVD's \\"Baby Signing Time\\". Those DVD's used kids and an adult in a fun & interactive way to learn to sign. There's baby ones and then ones for bigger kids. My daughter loved these DVD's and asked to watch them every day.This DVD is too informational for parents.. it's not really fun for kids to learn to sign from it. It's basically giving parents a tutorial on how to go about it and info about it. Not what I thought I was getting. We watched it once.. what a waste.If this is your first venture into signing, it might be helpful.. but not worth the money they're selling it for.. I reccomend checking out your local library, mine had many books and dvd's that were very helpful. (I liked \\"Signing for hearing babies\\" or somtething along those lines, good read, very helpful)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Signing is cool -- don't need the video though","review":"I like the sign language. It was pretty great when our 9 month old told me he wanted milk the first time! I don't think you need the video though. You can just start repeating certain signs on your own. Just repeat them a lot and be consistent.The problem we had is that we couldn't get our daycare providers to use the signs. So it seemed like any progress we made got undone by them. He would use the signs with them but they wouldn't recognize it. I can only imagine how that must have been frustrating and confusing for him. So make sure everyone around him is going to use the signs before you start teaching them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful","review":"This product was helpful in explaining how to start teaching my baby sign language. If I had it to do over again I would probably just get a cheaper book, because I'm not sure this was worth the extra expense. All I really need now is something to show me how to do the signs, and I found that for free online. The author does have an attractive mullet on the DVD though."},{"rating":"1","title":"You see what you want to see.","review":"Communication between babies and their parents is more complex than Indian sign language. Parents are often highly delusional in projecting what they want to see and do on their kids. This is a major case in point. Our baby had two or three \\"signs\\" it used to indicate fear, etc., but quickly she passed on to verbal language. We spent about two weeks investigating \\"baby sign language\\" and realized its futilty. BTW, we're both child professionals. Baby signing is akin to mood rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read and apply!","review":"I've read the book and watched the DVD. The book is extremely easy to read and the DVD a fast watch. The kit also has a handy reference guide that is good for a quick go-to. The ideas for applying the signs and for communicating with your baby are good. It is helpful to learn how a baby's signing transitions as they age and to watch other families success with signing. I have been signing with my infant for 2 months now and applying what I learned using this kit. I do recommend this product and plan to continue with this line when we need to move on from this kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"im not sure if my admiration for this kit stems from the fact that i love the idea of signing with baby or because this kit is that good.either way, the dvd is more than enough if you can get it on its own.I dont advise to buy the book alone since seeing the instructor acutally making the signs is best, also most of the ideas in the book are repeated on the dvd.either way, its a really helpful kit.. teaching baby to sign is fun and extremely rewarding to both of you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The book had fewer words than I expected. The drawings were sketches of a man signing. I learned to sign words from the PBS tv show \\"Signing Time\\" than this book. The \\"Signing Time\\" show also provides helpful tips to remember the signs, which this book does not provide. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone can do this!","review":"I had the opportunity to see Joseph Garcia speak and later bought this collection. He explains the philosophy behind signing with your baby and presents the information in a fun and digestible manner (something new parents really need). The signs are simple and very easy to learn. Just using a few with your child opens up a whole world of communication that is just not possible with words alone. When my daughter started to sign, (which was many months after we started showing her the signs- be patient) it was amazing. She could tell us she wanted to more to eat, something to drink, and could clarify what she was trying to say by using the sign too. I highly recommend this to other parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmm ... Nope","review":"The DVD in this book is very old (ie acid wash jeans anyone?) or maybe the folks are just stuck in the 80s/early 90s. I didnt learn very much from the dvd so you could skip on that. The chart is helpful I suppose but I don't use that either. So there isn't really much I use at all out of this set. hum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This book is nothing more than telling you things you already know (eg: weather forcasts are not accurate, you cannot predict the stock market ect). The author does not provide any rational, framework or theory for why these things can be fortold other than some vauge references to chaos and some politically correct references to the Santa Fe Institute. A real disappointment; it is written more like a newpaper narrative of what is rather than an analysis of why it is or what it should be. I was particularly dismayed since this book was an Amazon recommendation for business books.

Skechers are probably the most overpriced, lowest quality shoe ever made. You're basically just paying for the trendy name that wasn't even a name brand before 1991. If you're buying a pair of shoes to do more than just stand still and look pretty, then expect your Skechers to fall apart prematurely in some way. Stitchings come undone, eyelets break or fall off, tongues, which are often not leather, crack and flake, and on and on.

I have not been able to try everything, but what I have tried works. The book is written so that it is easy to follow. There are hundreds and hundreds of \\"recipes\\" and tips which can be used to remedy any number of situations around the house/yard/garden. The best thing is that most of the ingredients were already in my kitchen cabinet - at least for the things that I've wanted to try so far. I also appreciate that this book provides alternative methods to the use of hazardous chemicals/pesticides. Additionally, this book provides a wonderful offering of recipes for self-care (pampering) such as lotions and tonics, and hair and skin care.

They even had upgrade codes for an old Sharp professional series data projector and a new off-brand HDTV I have. But the main feature we bought this for is the RF repeater so that we could operate our equipment inside the cabinet without having the doors open. It worked great for 6 months, then the RF repeater (or maybe the RF transmitter in the remote) stopped working. Now it's just an expensive version of One-for-all's regular IR remote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited functionality","review":"The product has a very limited library and does not support most brands. Support on the website gets you no response (have sent 3 queries in the last 2 months and not one reply).The learning feature of the remote is extremely limited (it learns only about 15 buttons before memory is full), it is not even enough to program one remote (a TV remote has a minimum of 20 buttons this will learn only 15 across all devices). The remote works for only about 10 feet and if the base unit is behind a concrete wall it does not work (only works if there is a glass or wooden barrier)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful - limited RF Range, though","review":"This is a great universal remote, particularly because of the help available at the One for All customer support line. I called them twice setting this up and spent very little time on hold. The major limitations are a couple: first, the RF range is small - if you want to control something that the remote can't \\"see\\", then you will be using the RF functionality of the remote with the supplied IR/RF control box. In my wood/drywall house, the remote will not work from more than about 15 feet away through a couple of walls. This is not what I was hoping for, but perhaps I can extend the range with a better antenna. Second, when you are controlling via RF, you can't hold a button down and thereby continue transmitting the command. You have to keep pressing volume down repeatedly, for example, in order to lower the volume of the amplifier more than one notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Codes do not handle all functions of device","review":"Two bad things I didn't like about this remote are.1. The preprogrammed codes for devices are missing some critical functions. I was trying to use the remote for my DishPVR and my Tivo and seems like I have to custom program the PVR menu and 30-sec skip. :-S2. The keys layout are not PVR friendly as it seems on the picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little buggy, but once reset, works fine","review":"I had some trouble setting the unit up because it was malfunctioning. The device keys, when depressed, were not switching the remote to the correct device. Even after going through the \\"reset\\" operation listed in the manual, the device keys were malfunctioning. I had to search on the internet on how to do a true reset on the remote, and after searching for awhile, was able to complete the operation. So far, no more malfunctions, but we'll see...Otherwise, the remote works fine now. It's too bad the memory won't allow for more learning than I've programmed the remote so far. I've filled up the memory and wish I could program more..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has separate buttons, not the infamous donut","review":"Just a note to let anyone interested know. I recently purchased this item and it is the improved version with separate direction arrow buttons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this remote","review":"The cable box I'm trying to control is in my bedroom. I use an RF converter to feed the signal from that box back into rooms of the house that don't have a cable box. But even from the room right next door, the remote won't work reliably. Yes, there is a closet between the two rooms, so the signal has to go through two interior walls (with no plumbing or wiring within them). But still, this is a distance of less than 18 feet.When you add to that the fact that there seems to be no way to control any but the most typical of functions (for instance, it won't control the DVR part of the cable box), it's pretty much worthless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Universal Remote","review":"Pros: Lots of codes in book. Phone support for a/v equipment not in book and future a/v equip with IR remotes. ALL keys light up!! RF remote. Works anywhere within 150 feet of base unit.Cons: My RF Bose doesn't work with this remote. (This was the primary reason I got this remote, as opposed to other IR only remotes)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Monster!","review":"Product is excellent with new batteries. Then within a couple days of even very limited use it only works if I point it toward the box and with the closet door open, after 3-4 days you need to physically point it within 3-4 feet of the receiver, not quite what a remote with RF should need to do. I would recommend not buying this product and splurging on a better one or setting up your system with a more traditional remote system, not RF. The cost of new AAA batteries and the hassle of them running out so quickly makes this product not worth it to me. No wonder it is so cheap, it WAS too good of a deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old, heavy, clunky and hard to use","review":"I was excited to finally get a remote that is easy to use, based on the many positive reviews I read. I was very disappointed that the remote seems like it was made many years ago - it even has directions on how to set it up to control your tape deck and turntable. It didn't control any of my components the way it should have. I didn't have the patience to spend any more time programming it, so I returned it. Perhaps if I set up multiple macro commands it would have been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"URC 9910 LEARNING CAPABILITY VERY POOR","review":"I currently use the Automator URC 200 Universal Remote control (also purchased through Amazon) and wanted to try out the URC 9910. The URC 9910 is no where near in comparison to the Automator. The learning capability of the URC 9910 is absolutely rubbish. In short the URC 9910 cannot handle the learining capability on more than two remotes the most after which it gives a frustrating alert that 'Memory is Full'!So if you are looking at a more learing capable remote to that with built in codes, this is certainly not the remote for you.The Automator has no problem with memory and works wonderfully on the learning capabilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I hoped","review":"I bought this remote control based on high review rank. But I was not as lucky as everybody else. Mine worked only with TWO out of SIX devices. Supplied codes didn't work and I had to spend about 2 hrs trying to set codes manually. Plus the user's manual is not really helpful. So, I had to return it back to Amazon. I guess I'll wait for some other company to come up with something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior Product - Limited Memory","review":"This is a very frustrating product. If you only have to learn functions for a couple of remote controls, then this product may work for you. After you program a few commands, you will get a message saying the memory is full.

This remote reinforces those qualities. I haven't needed the RF receiver yet but based on the IR portion alone this remote works great. I was able to program all my A/V components into the remote via phone and everything works well. My only gripe is that this remote doesn't have DVR/PVR/Tivo functions like all my other One for All remotes. Instead of having set buttons for quick skip, return to live, etc. I had to re-assign other buttons from the VCR portion thru IR learning. Everything works but it's not as clean as the other remotes I have. All in all, I'd still suggest this remote to anyone, especially with the low price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish, but sub-par support and documentation","review":"This goreous remote is likely to fill any need you might have for controlling your entertainment center, replacing all the other remotes in your house. CD, DVD, TV, and cable are handled here, so there's no real problem...No problem, unless your device is older, or special, and requires special programming instructions. This \\"learning\\" remote fills the need, at least theoretically, but repeated calls to the maker yielded no results. Moreover, the instructions as stated had no effect on my gear, making this purchase costly and annoying. This lack of support is at odds with the broad promises. It's especially frustrating when you consider how well-built and elegant this remote is.Some programmable remotes have an auto-program feature that finds your devices for you without pressing a long series of codes for each device.

Someone is killing people by breaking their necks. In the meantime you really get into the head of the killer, who is a vulnerable, sympathetic character and you gain a different perspective on the IRA problem. All the regulars appear in this full-length episode and I was thrilled to get back to the series; so well-acted, each and every character perfectly cast, as always. Poor Mrs. Fitz; she can't get her husband to hang around and just play the grandfather! I hope they will make more Cracker episodes..!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Cracks Appear in Fitz' Family Life","review":"Fitz is so endearing because he is truly flawed. He smokes, gambles and definitely drinks too much. Just ask his daughter what she thinks about the toast he gave to her groom at their wedding. Yet, he manages to solve the latest string of murder cases by interrogating and exposing the culprit even though the police constable doesn't really listen to his ideas. And Fitz is brutally honest to his wife when he admits to her that he would rather spend time with the police officers than with his own grandchild. In response to the reviewers who thought the episode was too political and anti-American, I say that Cracker has always taken on the controversial issues of it's time. That is one of the factors which make the detective story seem realistic and intriguing to its fans. The worthwhile special features on the DVD include interviews with Robbie Coltrane, Jimmy McGovern, Barbara Flynn, Chris Eccleston and other members of the cast and creative team."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I was waiting for this one for a long time. \\"Fitz\\" is brilliant, as usual. And (as usual) he continues to be self-destructive. Having been away from England for 10 years, Fitz returns for his daughter's wedding but ends up helping the police crack open a murder investigation. The episode is truly worthwhile because it is used to highlight the differences between the \\"old\\" and the \\"new\\" i.e. the old city vs the new city, the old police department vs the new department, old crime vs new terror threat. The amazing thing is that even though everything has changed, Fitz hasn't.

Presumably he's found similar work in Australia. My only problem with the story was his embarassing performance at his daughter's wedding reception. It seems a bit of a cliche at this point. Otherwise it was an interesting turn to see the whole 9-11 issue from the outside looking in. The problem most people have with this approach lies in facing the fact that all actions (or inactions) have consequences.

Sample code available (if you can find it).However (in common with most other PHP texts)it has already been overtaken by change/developments (book (c)2002, claims to be release 4.0.5 'aware'). From releases 4.1.0/4.2.0 the (PHP.INI) register_globals directive has been set to 'off' by default, and recommended to be kept that way for security reasons. Doing so will 'break' the first practical chapter (\\"Working with PHP\\") Hour 9 (Forms), and impacts Hours 13, 20, 24 to a lesser degree (and possibly others) - per hundreds of cries for help on PHP Internet discussion lists.Either wait for a book that refers to this MAJOR change in PHP, carefully study the PHP ChangeLog (not for the faint-hearted or raw beginners!), or trawl the discussion list archives to teach yourself about the new 'superglobals'.Sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the cash...","review":"I have 8-10 years of experience with VB(A) as a hobbyist programmer (ergo no college training).

There are an unlimited number of functions both internal and user-created that handle an insane number of programming situations. I needed something to walk me through the basics... this book did that, is doing that, and will probably continue to do that. Beyond that it also touches on some important features to wet-your-whistle, so-to-speak. Smarty and XML and XSL to name a few.

This allows you to make your own permanent remote codes to be placed in the main memory and bypass the small learned section using a small free program. The remote has a heavy feel which is nice because it feels like it is well build and not flimsy (i.e. it won't fall apart when it falls off the couch or coffee table).

Actually all the keys under the VCR/DVR buttons are hard to use with one hand (fyi... I'm a petite woman with small hands so this may not be a problem for those with larger hands to balance and reach the bottom buttons). The remote is heavier than any other remote I have.

I purchased the URC 8910 and it will not work with the Direct TV nor the Toshiba units so I sadly sent it back for refund. My point is not to bash these good remotes in as much as to warn you they may not support all units and to hopefully get the manufacturer to add these units to their remotes, however in the last two years they have stubbornly left my Toshiba DVD player.

Also, you basically have to turn the water on at almost full blast for the heater to kick on. If the pressure is too low, it will just click the igniter without lighting. The warmth of the water seems to fluctuate for no reason. It will be hot for a few minutes and then get colder. I usually have to adjust the temperature in the shower at least once per shower. I live in a 2-story house with the heater in the basement. I know two other people with this heater that live in 1-story houses and do not have my issues. Keep in mind that it will be at least $50 for the parts for the re-routing of the pipes. Plan on the work taking at least 1 day, maybe 2.

Helen Mirren, of course, does as outstanding job playing Jane Tennison. This shouldn't be a shock since it's one of the major roles that made her famous. She's as sharp and classy as ever in this last installment of an amazing tv series. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As addicted as I was to the Prime Suspect series, I found number 7, the final episode, to be disappointing. Jane is depicted, not as the flawed human being we can identify with, but as a drunk only capable of solving her final murder because it was committed by a teenager. The British Swat team, which is so impressively depicted in episode 6, brings its power to bear on high school children in episode 7, which seems almost a symbolical drama depicting the loss of British greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my style","review":"I loved the Midsomer Murders series (also British), so I thought I might like this. However, the setting is in the inner city slum areas and the star actress is an alcoholic, so the film was extremely depressing.

Jane Tennyson is tough, fragile without preachy dialogue and human, without being a matyr.

This was recommended to me and so I ordered it. Pretty expensive as far as CD's go too and it was a big disappointment. This actually sounds like bad elevator music. It only puts me in the mood to get out of the elevator... quickly. It's too bad C.D.'s can't be recycled because it's trash. This one will go in the junk pile...even the library didn't want it!

I enjoyed pretty much every story and even those I didn't care for were well written and admirable. As a fan of the Dark Angels, of which the Deathwing is part of, I somewhat wish the entire novel focused on the Dark Angel Chapter instead of including only a few stories on the subject. Although Deathwing is a group reprint of older 40K fiction, a new edition with some of the modern DA stories alongside original DA stories would have been a pleasant surprise. Even though I was disappointed with that aspect, I cannot hold it against the book. The reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that some of the stories were lacking and seemed almost distant from the 40k universe most fans are used to. All and all an excellent read of die-hard fans and newcomers alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those who write or read crime novels a bonanza","review":"The Crime Writer's Reference Guide offers an organized, thorough examination of material essential to writing crime, detective and most most thriller novels.

My favorite, however, is the full page devoted to a listing of \\"Weapons Used by Criminals\\" which begins \\"Acid, Air gun, Ax, Bayonet, Bazooka, Billy Club...\\" Well, you get the idea. The portions of the book not devoted to lists tend to be laughably superficial (e.g., \\"Street gangs now battle over who sells the drugs and where.\\" Really, thanks.)

While it does encompass that, it is much more. It gives a candid view of the music industry, primarily the African American side and its impact on American culture.

The book does a very good job of introducing independence between limbs by not throwing it all at you at once. So it lets you get the hands down in a pretty significant way before throwing in the feet. Also there are some hidden gems in here. I noticed only after the fact that some of the hand exercises were excellent introductions to latin playing. So when I began to get into latin music I already had much of the coordinations needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"If you're trying to self-teach, tighten up, or expand your drumming, this book is a must.

If you can pair it with4-Way Coordination: A Method Book for the Development of Complete Independence on the Drum Setand Stick Control: For the Snare Drummer AND find time to practice all of them regularly, you'll be set for a good year or two of musical growth for a very small investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book for beginners","review":"i have really enjoyed learning out of this book! great exercises and rudiments. the only thing that it's missing are exercises to help you alternate between your right and left foot on the 1 & 3 and 2 & 4. i've had to hand-write that in myself under some of the exercises. but otherwise a great book. i wouldn't recommend learning the rudiments by yourself, though. the book doesn't give any descriptions or instructions, just music. so you will need an instructor to work through the book with you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a fan of Westerns","review":"I am not a fan of Westerns, but I heard that this one had some interesting twists, and it does!

The tone of this album swings from the very funky (B.T. Express, Brick, and Ohio Players) to very sweet, sublime soul tunes (Harold Melvin & The Bluenotes, Rufus, The Brothers Johnson, Rose Royce) to fairly mainstream Top 40 product (Lou Rawls, The Emotions), and mellow ballads (Norman Connors, Manhattans, William Bell). But even those more mellow and mainstream tracks are still pretty darn good. In that era, most of the soul music was top notch stuff, and these songs still hold up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not progrock, but it's still good","review":"The main reason I'm writing this review is that the statements made by the other reviewer exaggerate the degree to which this parts from PFM's other albums. The focus here is definitely on De Andre's songs, but PFM do make substantial contributions in the arrangements of them. I really don't think this is pop music akin to Tom Jones or Englebert Humperdink or whatever his name is, it's singer-songwriter stuff. De Andre doesn't have the best voice in the world, and not knowing Italian will reduce the amount of enjoyment you get out of the album, but it's still seriously good music. The overall feel is really not entirely dissimilar to PFM's Passpartu album- good melodic songs with occasionally complex instrumental embellishments."},{"rating":"2","title":"position and counterpoint","review":"An excellent essay and responses by numerous informed commentators to understand the very real place of tolerance in Islam - especially in theory and scripture. Worth reading thoughtfully to correct the common partial or out of context quotations and polemics by Islamphobes. Most informed on the History would recognize Islam has also been significantly more tolerant that Christianity (if not Secularism) whatever the numerous exceptions at various places and times. It would have be nice to have fuller development of some themes and some historical examples but that was not the task that authors set for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Excellent book on the place of tolerance in Islam! And yes Islam just like any religion can be either tolerant or very oppressive depending on the believers interpretations. The reader/reviewer who gave one star wishes to imply that there is no tolerance in Islam and that it is just a violent religion. What childish notions, believers of all relgions have oppressed minorities and forcibly converted them. This is not an accusation that can only be leveled at just Muslims, but to all followers of any religion. Ther is ample evidence that shows contrary to popular belief Islam was NOT spread by the sword."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"It's a confusing story. I'm in a very confusing business.\\"","review":"Deighton's debut is a decidedly sardonic (but not jokey) spy tale that delivers wit and action even while whole sections of it are simply incomprehensible. However, the very things that make it so quirky and dated are also what make it fascinating. There's almost a Beat aesthetic at work.And the plot is much more globe-trotting than the Caine movie.I'm not sure why to this day people refer to the unnamed hero of the book as \\"Harry Palmer\\" his screen name and not Aquarius his astrological sign that opens most chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ipcress File","review":"This guy Deighton was big news when I was a kid.

Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Ipcress","review":"I have no idea how I have managed to avoid reading Len Deighton's Ipcress File before this - but, boy, was it worth the wait.

It's true that Deighton appears to draw about equally from Raymond Chandler and Graham Greene, but those are great places to steal from. (Unfortunately, I think Deighton went steeply downhill after these books.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book ever written by a human being!","review":"The whole book is just like a sinking boat leaks everywhere!

However, because of the form (the madrigal) and the singing/production, I find I seldom listen to it.If you are REALLY CERTAIN that you want a full cd of madrigals, this could be your best ticket. However, I hadn't listened to 25 madrigals in a row before, and I found it to be a form that got on my nerves more quickly than expected. Additionally, while the women of Miranda Sex Garden are an intriguing and underrated goth band, their voices can't really sustain an entire cd of a capella singing. Or - perhaps the madrigal form doesn't give the singers the opportuinity to shine. Either way, I find the result ultimately unsatisfying.I admire the band and the concept, and find it quite enjoyable in short spurts.

He gets a little redundant and tries to read a little bit too much in St.John OTC, that is only my opinion. If you have been struggling with Dark Night over the last several, several years, this book will help you on your journey, but it is not one of those ahaaaaa, books so you can categorize and then shelve St. John OTC and park him into one of those slots that thinks, well I got that.

I found this book to be very revealing about the life and times of young people in the late 30's and early 40's. Like them, some of us are fascinated with aviation and love to hear stories about it. It is also a book about choices. We all make choices in life. Some take us on great adventures, yet don't turn out as we had planned. This book led me to read many books about this Battle, about people who fought in it. I had never even heard of it before I picked this book up and read it. Its a great fast read, which reveals just enough to make one appreciate those who fought in the greatest air battle in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knights of the Air","review":"Well written narrative on the young American pilots who served in the RAF suring the Battle of Britain.

Odd, really, because the FW-190 was not in Luftwaffe service during the Battle of Britain. The Germans flew BF-109Es.Should one judge a book by its cover? I did. If the author cannot do better than this inaccurate dust jacket, the book does not seem worth additional time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating","review":"Recently I listened to a speech that Alex Kershaw gave at the Pritzker Military Library.

Family and friends of the author? It's sloppily researched, unevenly edited and reads more like propaganda than history.And if that's not bad enough, much of Kershaw's writing is cringe inducing:Panzer tanks? Why not automobile cars?And why the constant quotation marks to call out terms everyone knows the meaning of: \\"piece of cake,\\" \\"jolly good sport,\\" \\"grim reaper\\" ...And do we really need to know the telephone at the airfield was made out of Bakelite every time it rings? That the Spitfire's engines were made by Rolls-Royce? The Messerschmidt's by Daimler-Benz? That the Spitfire's canopy screen was made out of a type of plastic called Perspex? It's all so much word padding and it gets annoying fast.When it comes to the Germans Kershaw is so out of his depth he should of just stuck with the RAF pilots.Hans Guderian? Really. An author writing about World War II doesn't catch something that obvious?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works","review":"The good stuff first: This remote works with most all brands out there, and the one thing I had that it didn't work with (a Sony VCR), I was able to let it find the right code itself, and it worked great. The button layout is very simple and easy to understand; however, the power button would be better placed near the device switching buttons. It also allows you to make some functions global. For example, I have mine set up to allow the volume on the tv to change for every button except the stero button.Now the bad news.

It's not often that we get to here such powerfully crafted tunes that are married to such ingeniously clever and downright funny lyrics, but with Five Sticks we certainly do. The lyrics are a marvelously rhyming patchwork of everyday psychosocial problems and joys of life. The Tonewelders musicianship is just the right mix of quirky originality and familiar styles. Anyone can relate to these tunes because their about life's wobbles and perceptions. And, Glennon's lyrics are just about as idiosyncratically weird, but as friendly as you can get. Their like meeting an Erik Fromm with a Mr. Rogers delivery. Talk Me Down and She's Either are my favorites, but 7-11 of Lovin' is bound to be a hit.

Perfect tempi, superlative playing from a very underrated orchestra, and excellent sonics result in a thoroughly idiomatic and exciting account. Until I heard this recording, I thought Horenstein owned this work. But De Waart's conducting equals and sometimes transcends the great cult conductor, while Minnesota is far better equipped stylistically and technically than either Horenstein's Vienna and London Symphony Orchestras. Let's hope this one gets rereleased soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A sleeper Mahler First that unfolds naturally","review":"Maybe it's the presence of the North Woods, but the forest music that opens the Mahler First sounds bracing and naturally bucolic on this CD. De Waart keeps the rustic feeling alive in the thoroughly enjoyable and exciting Scherzo, which is full of punch. The parody funeral march in the third movement lacks wit, but De Waart makes the music sway with unabashed sentimentality. In the finale the strings outdo themselves in making their lines clear and precise, and although the impact of the whole orchestra isn't as volcanic as one hears from, say, Bernstein, there's plenty of charge.True, taking such a straight-ahead approach as De Waart tends to feels a little naive given the ultra-refinement that Mahler style has reached in the past forty years. I was reminded of Bruno Walter's equally unflappable directness in his stereo version with the Columbia Sym. This Mahler First is a sleeper in the budget range and has good, clear sound to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiration for women in any stage of life!","review":"I loved this book as much as the others in the Chicken Soupseries.

Well, what can I say, except to register my profound disappointment over this lazy, self-indulgent drivel. The opening \\"Soli\\", begins as a harsh foreboding electronic wall-of-sound: after 5 minutes you get the general idea - a \\"confrontational\\" display of what Whitehouse and their useless imitators used to call \\"Power Electronics\\"; after 10 you're bored silly and just wish it would stop; incredibly, this nonsense then continues for another 35 minutes, a truly pointless and arrogant exercise, Gilbert's 'Metal Machine Music', and about as interesting to listen to.

It really took a lot of convincing considering the price, but with my previous experience with Shure products I was confident. Once I received them and tried them boy was I glad that I bit the bullet and purchased them. These earphones let me hear music tones that I never did with the Se110.

I had my first set replaced as it was within 20 months of the two year warranty. The replacement pair lasted 14 months, but the replacement only comes with a 1 year warranty. The cost to replace the earbuds is $145 dollars. Paying $145 dollars for a wire defect is pretty ridiculous. Especially a defect acknowledged by Shure as the new SE535's are essentially the same monitors with a replaceable cable.Do not buy these, get the 535s. Or better yet, spend less and get some q-Jays which have more bass response and cost far less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Headphones - Don't be confused by crappy foam sleeves","review":"I just got these headphones and they are, as others say, incredible. I want to listen to all my music again to discover the hidden melodies that have been drowned out by my old c-grade head phones.One important piece of advice - the black foam sleeves that are already on the headphones when you open the package are HORRIBLE. They make these lovely headphones into the worst two dollar tinny sounding crap you have ever heard. I thought that I had been ripped off and had thrown my money in the garbage until I switched them for the grey rubber sleeves - then magically I had a wonderful pair of headphones. They really are great but Shure needs to stop including the useless pieces of foam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performing earphones","review":"When you put these in your ears you they feel so comfortable you don't even know they are there. They are extremely light weight, and well designed to fit perfectly in the ear canal. Image a woofer, mids, and a tweeter being in a transparent line and that what these sound like. They have a complete range of highs and lows that creates a perfect enclosed sound stage. The cord has an abstract shape to it; to keep it from tangling. This can be annoying but at least it doesn't get knotted up. Get these if you have an ear for great sound and don't want over the head earphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate lower, I would","review":"I bought the SE530 from a local place (not amazon), and used them for a couple of years. I spent a lot of money on them and thought you get what you paid for. I was wrong. About a month after the warranty expired, the cable started to split. I didn't think much of it because it wasn't an issue with others online yet. I contacted shure for an out of warranty cable replacement, and they would have charged me for it.I have had these on my shelf now for a few years because of the split cable occasionally electrocuting me behind my ear. It's a shame that the only thing wrong with these are the cables, and I paid so much for them. This will definitely be my last shure product and would encourage others to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound","review":"Love these headphones. The only down side is that they have to be in your ears perfectly to get the bass and they are not easy to put in and take out. May want to consider getting the push to hear version so you can talk to people when they come to your desk without taking the earphones out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Headphone.......","review":"This is my first serious headphones.

The both sound great together!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A revelation","review":"These earbuds are an absolute revelation, I'm hearing elements of familiar music for the first time. The separation between instruments and the ability to pick out individual components of the mix is excellent.

I love them. I own a pair of Bose QC3 Head phones. My opinion, these earbuds out perform the Bose. Use the foam ear pieces so they form fit to your ear. The sound is spectacular! The only piece that you need to get used to is having them in your ear for extended period of time. I still use my QC3 when I want to drift off to sleep. These ear buds are an investment so keep track of them. They are worth the investment if you travel a lot or just want spectacular sound.Airbss9"},{"rating":"2","title":"Split Personality","review":"These headphones definitely have a split personality. If you can sit still and listen, they are superb. The distortion is very low, there is strong but natural low bass and you will hear amazing details you had not noticed before. However, if you are looking for a set of active headphones, forget it - the cables are bulky and heavy and they won't stay sealed in your ears when moving. It would be really great to see Shure add some type of ear surround that would hold them in place because they sure sound great otherwise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Great; Wires, Bad!","review":"The sound on the Shure 530 earbuds is very good, but the wires are very bad, especially for the price.

I would not buy these earbuds again. Very disappointing, given what I paid for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shure SE530PTH Earbuds","review":"This review is meant to be helpful to those people who are pretty much 'sold' on the SE530s. They are GREAT, but almost everyone winds up using the 530s with the silicone triple-flex sleeves (included). Be warned that the factory mounted foam sleeves can be VERY difficult to remove. The foam sleeves are formed around a hard rubber insert that becomes stuck on an unseen barb (mentioned in instructions). The harder you grasp the foam sleeves, the more they resist. I'd bet that some people have broken the earbud itself trying to remove the sleeve. I had luck by grasping the foam at the very end- then twisting and pulling. I'm sure there are other ways to remove stubborn sleeves, just be patient.Aside from that, these earbuds are a pure joy to listen to!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Headphones","review":"There is nothing to comment here.

For example, \\"Onegin's theme\\" and \\"Name day waltz\\" are both practically identical to the song \\"Na sopkah Manchjurii\\" composed in early 1900s by Ilja Shatrov. In the movie (not included on soundtrack CD) characters sing \\"Oi tsvetet kalina\\", written in 1949 for a well-known movie.

Using simple recording techniques the sound which might at times boarder on ametuerish is brilliant and dreamy.The album opens up with a ballad \\"Johnny Remember Me\\" which is a '50's country song originally. What Boyd and Rose put into it makes it a work unto its own with a strong refrain. Of course the showcase song is \\"Seasons in the Sun\\". The original material was a favorite of mine as a child but listening to Boyd's version makes the song more emotive and holds a stronger message.Overall the album is simply a dynamo. It has been over 10 years since its release and still is a favorite of mine. It is a great album for Boyd Rice and Rose McDowell fans as well as fans of singer/songwriters of the '70's. The album is extremely accessible - It does not feel like a cover album - and truly a joy to listen to.Ted Murena"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, but hard to understand","review":"It's cool.

This journal has finally done it. It has plenty of pages to put your favorite quotes from the book, a page for group discussion questions and two pages for notes or reviews. My only complaint is that it can only be used for 18 books. That's OK if you're really only using it for a reading group journal because most groups pick one book a month but if you want to use it as your regular reading journal and you read in excess of 18 books a year, you're out of luck.

The journal is uniquely organized using tabs, so it is easy to find and flip to the various sections. It has sections for: your book group members, books you're reading, books you want to read, books you have lent out, really good resources, and more. It is exceptional quality, the cover is very hard, the paper thick, has a small pocket on the inside back cover, and it is spiral bound.

It's a very cute journal you will treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"Don't waste your money on this item. You would do better to pick up a nice journal and keep you reading group notes in that. As a lover of books, this is an embarrasment to even have on my shelf. It is put together like a phone book with a spiral binding. Looks very cheap. There are so many beautiful journals that you can pick up in place of this. The contents that are supposed to help with the recording of info are very lame, and there is not enough room given to write down your thoughts.

Cooney","review":"I think Among Friends is my favorite Caroline Cooney book because it's the one Cooney book that I can relate to the most. All the main characters, from brainy Jenny to fashionable Hilary, are teenagers, and unlike most the situations in Cooney's other books, in almost all the events I can imagine myself in them. From each journal entry to the next, Cooney masterfully crafted a tale of hardship, love, ambition, and other high school emotions. The one thing I would have liked better was for the book to have been in an impersonal third person omni. point of view, because all the 1st point of views were sometimes conflicting, leading to confusion.Still all in all, it was a terrific book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it and I'm 20!","review":"I bought this book because I am trying to write teenage fiction and the books I've read on the subject say to read teen fiction so you can get familiar with the genre. Well, I still consider myself a teen anyway so I bought this book also because it looked interesting.This book seemed very realistic. There is your classic overachiever (Jennie) and the two friends in her shadow (Emily and Hillary) who are jealous of her. I've been in their place with a friend who could just do no wrong. The book is fast-paced and enjoyable. I really liked the ending. This book could really happen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read!","review":"I loved this book because of the hardship of Jennie's friendship with her closest friends. I am gifted too, and I can totally relate to how she felt that everyone was turned against her.

Thank you, Caroline Cooney for writing a book so close to home!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so book","review":"Gerd Luddeman sees Paul as responsible for what has become Christianity, far overshadowing Yeshua bar-Yosef if not completely burying his original teachings and goal. True enough. Paul certainly is responsible for the creation of the demon, Christianity, and its endless struggle to destroy God's People in order to inhabit its corpse.There are many books over the years writing of Paul and his evil, including the first I read, The First Christian, by Davies, (ages ago after finding it as a little paperback ready to fall apart). It was helpful in my escape from the church. But there are other better exposes of Paul. And so my reading of this rather pedestrian work by Luddeman was disappointing.If you have not read much criticism of Paul of Tarsus, then you might benefit from the book and not find it too earth-shattering. Try The Mythmaker: Paul and the Invention of Christianity, by the late Hyam Maccoby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Ghost Dance?","review":"Killing Custer starts out lame and limps along like a horse with three shoes! The Author has a good opportunity to present a Native American viewpoint on a great battle (Native American vs the White Anglo) but choose to wander and bounces from personal grudges to mythical happening to political agendas! As this book progress, the reader is left with the feeling that the material being presented is inadequate to make a complete book and that the author adds side-bars to flesh out the copy. Little new information is added to the existing knowledge and most of the material presented is tainted with the political subtones of the author. To bad... as this book could have been a good one for the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses the Mark","review":"If you have never read an account of the Sioux Wars and Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn, you will probably enjoy this weak attempt at history. Very early in the book it will become obvious to the trained reader that the author is not well versed on this topic. To students and scholars of this event and time period, you will be very disappointed as there is nothing new in this volume, but much has been left out and slanted for the author's own agenda. For much more objective history I recommend The Custer Reader edited by Paul Hutton and Robert Utley, Centennial Campaign: The Sioux War of 1876, Custer's Luck by Edgar Stewart and for a solid biography on Custer, try Cavalier in Buckskin by Robert Utley."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked the the perspective the author gives on Custer.","review":"A very fresh point of view on an almost mythical historical figure.

It is virtually impossible to clean the head. The shaver comes with a small brush, but the hair folicals easily get stuck into the rotors. Once they are inside past the blades and carrying space, they can't be removed.Another issue is it doesn't have that close of a shave. It always is unable to get the hair at the corner of my cheeks near my jaw. Very irritating.For the price, it's not that well made.

Some readers may cavil at the unpasteurized characters and events, but these characters and events have their very common counterparts in the non-fictional world of newsprint and TV. Ms. Park's characters are visited by the imagination, which gives a better and truer show than a 10-minute TV makeover.

Something light and cheerful, and--- funny. This book is about as far away from funny as you can get. It is sad, pitiful, irritating, and the main characters are, without exception, all pretty unlikeable. Even Darla Moon,who tells the story and whose mother is the town prostitute, comes across as hard as nails. Underneath, of course, she has a heart, but she is so tough, it's hard to have any sympathy for her. The only likable characters are Elijah, a black friend of the family, and a preacher who sweeps Darla off her feet.

She can't seem to decide if she is going for a serious piece of literature, a dead-easy mystery, or a gratuitous bodice ripper complete with the most cliched and boring sex scenes ever. If it were better written, it would be depressing as heck. As it is, it is a complete waste of time, and the editor is just as culpable as the author.The best part about this book is the title.

So when we needed some more, I didn't think twice about ordering these. What a mistake! Not only do they not wash well AT ALL but also they literally fall apart. A guest was holding a glass the other night and the bottom just dropped off it, which was ironic in that we had just been discussing the plastic champagne glasses with the snap on bases which always fall off. What an amazing waste of money this was for me and such a disappointment. Instead of a lovely collection of Christmas goblets, I have some completely useless glasses.

Before putting them in the Christmas China Cabinet, we rinsed them, 2 of them lost a part of the design. I thought to now pack them up 2 boxes and send them back is such a burden, that I'd live with it. When we set the dinner table for Christmas Eve, I noticed the tops of the stems were missing the red coloring and looked as if it was dripping off or peeling off. Complete waste of money. If I had the patience to send them back, I would, but the shipping cost would outweigh the benefit. They will all go in the garbage when the China cabinet goes back to normal China. I believe these should be sold in a dollar store. You expect that from a dollar store glass. That is where these glasses belong.

The total weight of the aircraft was probably around 1,300 lbs. The weight pulled the main gear away from the drive gear enough to cause it to slip. The sloppiness in the gears prevented it's use at all without being repaired first. My father fixed it by machining a bushing for the sloppy shaft and we used a pulley block to reduce the pulling load. After doing this it worked okay. Lastly, the spring-loaded latch doesn't always stay in place and needs to be held with a finger to ensure the winch is locked properly.

One shouldn't compair and constrast the songs and their new alterations. Many of the producers of the redone tracks are from groundbreaking groups (not some lame techno or downtempo hacks)like B.C.

The supporting material criticizes the manner of compilation of the Koran and the mischievous role of the Muslim clergy in changing the form and logic of the book to establish their own supremacy. It is the gist of Mohammed's life, social and political ideology, wars, speeches, teachings, anecdotes, plus a few pages of attractive poetry on humanitarian issues. These are the recorded memories of Mohammed's days as they were made. The books I have read on him and the Koran so far have all covered-up the conflicts that led to his murder.

At $2.70 it seemed a bargain. Shipping was $5.94...kinda high, but at $8.64 total, I figured - sure why not. It arrived in two days...super! BUT I CAN'T GET THE ADHESIVE LABEL OFF! I tried soaking it in hot soapy water - the paper came off leaving the adhesive behind. Next was Goof Off - my fingers were blackened but the sticky adhesive was still there. Straight acetone - nada. So I'm left with a cute, little, VERY STICKY scoop. I'd send it back but I'm not going to invest another penny in this thing. Drat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The damned label is a major drawback","review":"It's a decent scoop for cheap, but there's a label on it. If you scrub it with one of the yellow/green scrub sponges, the label glue won't come off at all. If you use goof-off, or some other petrochemical solvent, the glue will come off, but there's a discoloration on the scoop that is permanent. And you have to use a chemical solvent on a food serving product.Obviously this company pays no attention to either testing their products or listening to reviews on the online websites.I don't know how much you're saving, but ask yourself if breaking out the solvent is worth the savings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves to be called the Classic that it is!","review":"What's not to like?

This also has the best music of any of the Sonic games for the Genesis anyways, which is amazing because the Genesis was known for having a bad sound card, but the quality and overall structures of the songs on this game are awesome! This is a classic game and one of the best from the Sonic series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite!!!","review":"I originally found this perfume in Venezuela and had to buy some.

If you leave the power on to your modem and firewall-router, then you're O.K. If power is ever lost, you will have to log in and connect from the web browser every time. I confirmed this with D-Link Technical Support. The D-Link Technician said that this is a cost-reduced product with fewer features and lower quality.So, if like me you don't leave your broadband modem, firewall-router and/or PC on all day, you should avoid this product.

I have never set up a router in my life but these things usually come easy for me.The thing about the router that I absolutely hate is where you plug in cables. The cables do not stay put. You constantly have to plug them back in. I have multiple brands of cables and none of them stay in. The router was not even moved. I'm wondering if the router just loses the link to the cable and not lose the cable physically.And another thing, the router constantly disconnects from the DSL modem and does not reconnect to it.

Then I moved and got Cable based Internet access and that was even easier to setup. Then once when on of my ethernet cables went bad the router was able to tell me that the cable was bad and that I should replace it.Overall this device had been through thick and thin and has always come out on top.

It's been a little over a year and the thing is overheating just like the first one. You can feel the heat just rising off the cheap plastic box. It works intermittenly and will probably fail completely soon. Besides spending money twice on something that died so easily, I had ALWAYS had trouble with the advanced features such as opening up ports and even using the DMZ feature.

As an example I could setup the firewall to allow any program that requires certain ports to be open to use (i.e. WinMX, Online Games, etc.) to work on a specific IP address but only until 10pm so my kids aren't up all night playing games, and sharing files. You can also set a schedule for the parental controls so that certain URLs or URLs with keywords you designate can't be accessed until after 11pm/when the kids are asleep.

This cymbal would not fit into a rock groove, but shines with traditional jazz. Listen to some of Joe Morello's work with the Dave Brubeck Quartet and you'll get a good sense of what this cymbal sounds like.I've played this cymbal on sets and I'm tempted to sell my precious 22\\" ride and get one of these, but the older Avedis just seems to improve with age, so I won't.As a side note, while I dearly love this cymbal, my absolute favorite ride is the 19\\" Zildjian Armand Signature Ride (ASIN B0002GFNF4). If you are considering this cymbal give the Armand Signature a look (and play) first before making a final decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best general rides I've used","review":"What a gorgeous ride cymbal. I tend to prefer less overtone and more projection, but when I auditioned dozens of rides in a good drum store, this one stood out as the most pleasant general purpose ride cymbals I've ever played. I use the Vater Fusion Nylon tip stick with it, so the overtones can get a bit washy from time to time, but when I use a more gentle tipped stick, it is one of the best ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad karate video","review":"Perhaps geared towards 5 or 6 year olds but doesn't have much to do with karate.

The emphasis is on basic hand tools and while the contents are a bit dated, leather tools haven't changed much over the years either. Brief practical advice is given for each tool as well as describing its basic use. What you won't find in this book is coverage of non-American leatherworking tools (Euro tools being very different in many cases), any machinery (e.g., clickers, stitchers, etc.), or, with a few exceptions, alternative tools for the same basic function. You also won't find newer tools that are on the market. There are a lot of innovative string cutters available these days, as just one example. The book could use a thorough refresh. Still, it has good coverage, the advice is 100% usable, and it's inexpensive! Well worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This is an essential book for leatherwork.

It's unique in the fact that it's not the typical Bollywood story line.. well, in a way it is, but in a great way. It's about love and conflict, but also has a twist. The actors perform quite well, and although it, like most Indian movies, is long (about 3 hours), it still keeps your interest throughout.

MY faves are \\"Theme From The Monkees\\" (TV version! ); \\"Propinquity\\" (long a fave of mine from NEVADA FIGHTER, interesting to hear an earlier version with perhaps more sensitivity in the melody & singing); \\"She Hangs Out\\" (the Jeff Barry version), \\"Circle Sky\\" (the studio version as it \\"should\\" have sounded), \\"Love To Love\\" (Neil Diamond's song NEVER sounded better) \\"Zor And Zam\\" (the \\"spooky\\" TV version) and \\"How Insensitive\\" (Nes covers a classic). But my #1 song on the disc is \\"Steam Engine\\". This is like The Monkees' version of \\"Ticket To Ride\\" (with a similar lyrical story) and has long been one of my top favorite Monkees songs.

But that doesn't change the fact that these are largely inferior to the Hanna-Barbera theatrical Tom & Jerry cartoons.Even though Chuck Jones was a genius in working with the Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and others, for some reason he is completely out of his element here. The animation is lovely as always, but the timing and pacing are all off, the drawing is too cutesy, and the violence (what there is of it) just doesn't play right as a result.This is a worthwhile set for animation historians and Tom and Jerry completists. For those just wanting to have a good laugh with their families, stick to the original H-B theatricals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful CHUCK JONES designs!","review":"Love the fact that the extras focus on CHUCK JONES and one is narrated by my friend JUNE FORAY!

When \\"classic\\" T&J; shorts from the 40's play on TV, I find them to be visually impressive but not terribly funny.Chuck Jones, operating with limited technical budgets in the 60's, understood the limitations of his animation and put more of an emphasis on characterizations and movement of his characters--to great comedic effect. Note the small things--from Tom's frequent double takes, to \\"breaking the 3rd wall\\" and staring directly at the camera--to the way he will kind of stutter step when rounding a curve at high speeds. Just little bits of comedy business that work beautifully. Glad to see these shorts now available on DVD. I will buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chuck Jones At His Laziest And Least Inspired","review":"These cartoons are typical of the later style of Chuck Jones' animation style; lazy, derivitive and self-plagiarizing. Has anyone else noticed how similar his works were to each other?? Be it the Grinch, Tom & Jerry or the later incarnations of the iconic Bugs Bunny, they ALL begin to look like each other!! The eyes especially betray the character's similiarity. If visual evidence was ever required to demonstrate how Chuck Jones' glory days were far behind him, this is your answer. My recommendation: Avoid these dismal works, and lobby for the release of the earlier, less PC, versions of the classic Tom & Jerry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and adorable.","review":"I purchased this for my husband since he is a huge fan of Tom and Jerry.

This book, which includes the better part of his life's work, is just plain silly; the text is written in strange spirals and turns, & it's nearly impossible to figure out what he's talking about half the time. It's reminiscent in some places of the work of Robert Pinsky, but without Pinsky's characteristic cleverness, wordplay, and lyricism. It resembles, in other places, the maritime verse of Samuel Sewell, but it remains far more elusive than Sewell would ever have allowed. And, while it brushes at times towards an almost Tolstoyan eroticism, it drops swiftly into the scatalogical -- rather tastelessly, one might add. I certainly don't recommend it for the squeamish, or anyone of delicate sensibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relief for Insomniacs - The \\"Poetry\\" of Charles Olson","review":"I was forced to read this dreck for an architecture(?) class.

It's true that in the past this artist experimented with imitation R&B but this is so far off the spectrum. The album is full of melodic, entrancing, soothing, soulful music. Sakura Drops is so soothing and earthy sounding. Traveling is incredibly catchy. Deep River is one of the most beautiful ballads ever. I could go on forever about the tracks on the album.The single COLORS takes this artist to a new level of melodic music that you can get lost in. It's the kind of song that will reward the patient listener. It may sound bland and boring to some at first, but it has a way of growing on you. The song is so subtle and yet so increadibly powerful.You can't go wrong with this album, ones who label it as cheap R&B shouldn't write reviews cause they obviously haven't listened to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The latest volcanology findings.","review":"At first glance this would seem like a very simple primer for kids: larger print and a little under a pages provides a condensed approach to a topic often treated in depth for adults - but any high school library holding strong in geology will find LIVING MOUNTAINS: HOW AND WHY VOLCANOES ERUPT an important addition, providing an easy coverage of the latest volcanology findings.

You hear the thumping of heartbeats in duress.If you allow yourself to hear with an open mind, and get past Diamanda's frightening interpretations; you will appreciate and realize how well constructed and meticulously arranged \\"VENA CAVA\\" truly is.

It aims, for instance, in spots to emulate the tedium of insanity such that it will seem self-indulgently repetitive, or quiet, or extreme. One might well ask if the demands placed on the listener are justified; one might well answer, \\"No.\\" To get the most out of it, however, one must obey the command to \\"Play only at maximum volume\\"; good headphones and an hour dedicated to nothing but concentration should also be strongly recommended. In the complete opus of Galas' work, there is no choice but to buy and \\"endure\\" this recording with an open and attentive mind, but that really does little to make it seem, in some way, almost academic in spite of Galas' perfectly self-evident sincerity.

The latest issue now (November 2009): a leak developed at the top of the cylinder, possibly a bad rubber gasket(s). This time I got upset and saved the hose and valve.

This is, of course, a far different scenario than the reverse, where a person might initiate regression therapy to \\"find out\\" who they might have been in a former life.I like that the book does not heavy-handedly try to convince readers that the author is Nicholas, but rather shares with us the amazing string of experiences and coincidences that caused him to reach a reluctant understanding of who he believes he is and was.Chapter 9 is especially interesting for what the author offers as new information about the circumstances of the Tsar's murder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have naturally black hair so I decided to do a strand test.

This album took SOME getting used to, it didin't click as fast as Recieve the Flame, but that does not mean it's not a good album, in fact, it's great. The noise on this one is pretty harsh for the most part, the second track, Venus And Mars is great, the venus and mars analogy for balance works really well I think. Millstones is a sloweer track with some intresting soundscapes involving chimes(?), Tooth And Claw is pretty good, but my favorite track by far is OUT OUT OUT, Boyd's voice really adds to the tracks when he speaks or screams, I think all these elements blend together and compliment each other very well to create a great album. This album features some guest stars as well, such as Douglas P. and Rose McDowell. All in all this is a good album and more than worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best.","review":"This movie has no dancing and no singing.

I especially feel the workout in my shoulders and am liking the shape I am seeing already. Amazing what a set of three lb. weights can do. As usual, Ellen delivers an energetic and motivating work out. I like the mat workout at the end also because Ellen introduced some moves that I had not seen before in her other dvds. I remain a big fan of Ellen's and especially like her studio series (PS: I like the new carpet in the studio too - looks great). My only minor complaint is that during the second half of the dvd, the music seems to get louder and I struggle to hear Ellen's instruction so I turn up the volume but then the music is even louder and so on. This might just be the copy of the dvd I have. Overall, I highly recommended Skinny Skulpt. It's enjoyable. How often can you say that about a workout dvd?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable workout","review":"If you are looking for a video that helps tone your arms, I would recommend this DVD. I don't consider it a great workout for abs or legs, but definitely feel the burn in the arm and shoulder muscles. Ellen Barrett is cheerful and encouraging without seeming annoying, and working out barefoot is very appealing. You won't find serious cardio here, but my heart rate was elevated and I worked up a slight sweat. I notice after this workout, I feel very flexible and relaxed, instead of the exhaustion I normally feel after working out. The other reviewers are correct: the background music is annoying and strange. Once you have the workout down pat, mute it and just follow along with your own music!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shoulders, shoulders and more shoulders","review":"I use three pound weights and I have not been able to get through the full standing segment without putting the weights down at least once for a break. The arms are consistently moving so I feel this more in the shoulders than anywhere else in the upper body. A lot less intense on the cardio front, but you definitely get the arm toning. If you do have shoulder or neck issues, you may want to take it easy if you plan on using weights with this one. I enjoy this workout but not as much as the other two I have by Ellen (Burn and Firm Pilates and Fat Burning Pilates). Outside of the tiring shoulders, this is a good workout for recovery days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best overall workout!!!","review":"I first saw Ellen on Fit TV and loved the workout that I tried so I searched or a DVD right away.I absolutely love this workout!!!

I just tried this workout this morning and I have to say I just love it! This really is a toning and sculpting workout.

Dino introduces Cecilia to his blonde, Suthin'-accented American mother (Bette Davis, in a wig) and tries to impress her with his wealth. When Catherine leaves Dino for another man, Mama soothes her boy and encourages him to resume his artwork. A bad, pompous film which is only redeemed by watching the campy playing of Davis.

I am sad I can't return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout!","review":"This is a good workout if you want to combine cardio, kickboxing with lower body core work. It's nice because 45 minutes is the cardio/kickboxing and the remaining 30 minutes is the lower body core work.

But, around the middle of the game for a level or two, the game gets a little into the trial-and-error deal. Otherwise, you must get this game no matter what."},{"rating":"1","title":"i cant play it.","review":"although i'm 14, my mom wont let me play this game because the screenshots show people using guns. what should i tell her to get me to let me play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Challenging Espionage Thriller!","review":"I love playing this game. Granted, it's sometimes tedious, and is a nightmare for trial and error haters. I however, find this game challenging, fun, and really intense. It is not for small kids, because of the violence, intensity, and occasional language, but I as a Christian am not way too upset with the content in this game.

Overall, this game rates extremely high in my book, and I hope you all get the pleasure of enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it!","review":"The desk holder for my Franklin worked great in my office.

Now I'm down to 10 bags. Also the hominy looks red not blue. I live in an area that has many Hispanic grocers. Red hominy while not common is available. I have not ever seen blue corn available as hominy which is why I wanted to try it. I haven't tried to cook any yet so I don't know if this is the way blue corn looks before its cooked or not.

It's the kind of pop music that was popular in the pre-rock and roll era, as sung by the likes of Bing Crosby.

I think it is important to know that this is the CD version of the first Plastikman release, the double 12\\" of \\"Sheet One\\" (which contained Spastik) that came out in 1993 and along with Acperience 1 by Hardfloor was one of the main forces behind the acid explosion of 1993 and 1994 that unfortuntely lead to many lesser records featuring drum rolls and 303s. That being said, \\"Sheet One\\" is one of Richie's best and most focused records. It is a meditation on acid house stripped bare and laid clean. As far as whether or not it's from Detroit or Windsor... you can't separate the two communities... Richie used to spin on 96.3 in Detroit and at the Shelter (in Detroit) when he was young enough his mother had to drive him over the bridge. This is a seminal record from the early years of the peak of the Detroit scene, 1993-1996."},{"rating":"2","title":"hypnotic beats","review":"This album is fantastic for chilled out listening especially the 2nd track, which is amazing.

The delicacy of \\"solo me\\" at the end of Tuba Mirum and the power of the Confutatis make this my favourite recording of the Requiem - not too fast and not too slow.

However, this latest lacked the humor of \\"Rewrites\\" and I felt myself without much incentive to keep turning pages other than to get some insights to some of his lesser-known works."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Whiner!","review":"\\"Rewrites\\" was better than this effort because Neil Simon shared more insights into his creative process than this volume. In \\"The Play Goes On,\\" he concentrates on whining over the breakup of his serial marriages -- while asking us to believe that nobody was ever responsible for his string of divorces. His explanation? That there's some kind of genetic marker that determines how long people stay married. PLEASE!Simon also spends a good deal of time asking us to believe other whoppers; that his plays are not all autobiographical (I guess this is true... most -- but not all -- of his plays are that way); and that he has no memory of writing most of his plays, that they just came out of him in some kind of auto-pilot-like trance.Anyone wanting to learn about Simon and his creative process is better off studying his plays."},{"rating":"2","title":"me","review":"My husband bought this dvd for me because I loved this show.

The songs on this record were full of tempo changes, long buildups and plenty of melodic riffing that i felt were nothing but awesome. They were brutal yet melodic. The only complaint that I had was the length of the album and the songs. I felt that they were too long but still interesting. To put this all in a nutshell, this , i feel, is a mix between the european and american styles of death metal.

From what I've heard, these guys are pretty young, they sound like veterans.The dude's voice is DEEP. It sounds like maybe he had a pitchbending effect on his voice (only a few times, not for the whole cd) but regardless I really don't care.I think the highlights of this album are when they have the acoustic guitar passages that add a beautiful atmosphere to the already epic sound.I'm not into the whole Christ-bashing thing.

They are very lyrically retarded and when it comes to music, it's not for the masses but it's not that good either for the small groups who listen to bands that no one has ever heard of but I have to admit they do have memorable songs.

It doesnt explain very well about secrets and the whole purpose of \\"good touch and bad touch\\" it says \\"you know the differnece\\" and doesnt really explain that even parents may want you to keep bad secrets. Except for the small note that its confusing if a parent wants you to keep something from the other parent.

This makes it awfully difficult for a novice. Although there are admittedly colored pictures of each craft, I don't consider them sufficiently detailed/large/clear to suffice by themselves with the often sketchy directions.(2) I, myself, was unimpressed with most of the items shown. I perused the book hoping to find *something* worthwhile to justify keeping it, but just couldn't do so.Particularly in light of the high price, I was greatly disappointed. There are many sensational craft books available, many of them dealing with nature crafts (and many of them pretty quick).

Piper limits himself to the scriptures in his treatment of an unlimited subject matter.Piper is a champion of the God-centered world view, and this book is his tour de force. Any reader (myself included) who finds him/herself recoiling against the conclusions drawn in this book are likely experiencing the same disconcerting paradigm shift of the church in Galileo's day--we are not the focus of the universe.

Admittedly, I can have trouble with books that are theologically \\"deep.\\" I'm guessing that is the reason for my having problems reading this book.With that said, I can't disagree with what I understand of the message of this book. I know God takes pleasure in many things: Jesus, in us, in hearing our prayers and worship, and others. I had looked forward to reading this book when I first got it, and learning about what God finds pleasure in.I do wish that I could have gotten more from it, perhaps I will at another time.

We spent months on it, not setting any time limit so we could go through all the questions and down all the rabbit-trails we needed to.I had a very hard time reading this book. It was not the subject matter, but rather the dryness and lifelessness of the book. I had to force myself to trudge through each paragraph, and became increasingly bothered and irritated, not really knowing why, and very puzzled by my reaction, which I describe as almost an aversion. Finally, at the final session, I was struck with the reason: THERE IS NO MENTION OF THE HOLY SPIRIT IN THIS BOOK.The Holy Spirit is the life of God in us. It is how God convicts and guides us. It is, in basic terms, God in us. Without a treatment of the work of the Holy Spirit, the book is not only incomplete, but uninspired and dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross distortion of the character of God.","review":"I read this for a theology class and found is crass, speculative, and self-serving.

There are so many deep truths in this book and it will at times make you stop right where you are at and take time to soak and ponder what's been shared. Larson's personal stories also add the realness that helps you to relate and share God's truth and love for you at a personal level.

The graphics in it are (...)!!! Well, many Game Boy games' graphics (...), but this one is just HORRIBLE! Second, the plot is boring. You feel like you are going to grow old and die when you get done with something, becuase it took so long. Everyone says the ending is just sooooooo fantastic, but its not, it's just like other games. I would tell you all what it was, but then the losers who like the game and want to finish it will be mad. I reccoment not buying this game, and sticking to games on other sysyems. Ex)Playstation/2,X-Boy and GameCube. Even Super Nintendo is a better way to expirience Final Fantasy than on a teeny tiny screen of a Game Boy. A game i recomment is Final Fantasy Mystic Quest(Super nintendo), it's a sweet game and it ends awesome!!!

There's lots of desert scenery and insights into Native American life. Unlike other books, this book is focused entirely within the Navajoes but even then we learn that there are 58 clans, 57 who keep Navajo time and then this clan that's slow even by Navajo standards. Of course, much of the mystery takes place on their turf.Joe is investigating a variety of backburner cases as an excuse to be in an area where a motorist had nearly hit him. As he digs deeper, a missing helicopter and an FBI investigation seem to be involved in whatever is going on. Enter the Dirk Pitt side of Joe's personality. I won't spoil the surprise but suffice it to say that Joe endures flame, flood and a host of other harrowing experiences as he solves the crime and saves the day.Bottom line: Less religion and culture, more action than the other Hillerman's I've read. Still, a fun, entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Leapthorn excels at Lore","review":"This early Leapthorn novel must have passed me by before now. Later novels, both with Leapthorn and Chee, tend to emphasize the problems of dual cultures, but Leapthorn here is Navajo first, cop second. Since the case is about the alleged desecration of a ritual site, Joe interviews a traditional medicine woman attending ceremonial gathering. I enjoyed a glimpse of these rites as much as the solution to a cracking mystery involving Native American activists, straying Catholic priests and kidnapped Boy Scouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best, but ...","review":"This is generally a wonderful book, with a memorable opening scene, an intriguing set of characters, and a magnificent (and beautifully described) setting. The plot is well thought out and full of surprises, especially the explosive (literally and figuratively) climax. However, Joe Leaphorn is a little too Man of Steel for me near the end: he hikes a dozen miles across the desert, gets bitten by a dog, falls down a cliff, etc., etc., and still has the energy left to perform a heroic rescue ... GIVE me a break!! In general, though, this is a great story, and I'd put it among the top four or five of Hillerman's mysteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening Woman","review":"Tony Hillerman puts the reader in the Four Corners region in every one of his novels. His stories are better than a course in Native American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blind Shaman Sees","review":"Tony Hillerman's THE LISTENING WOMAN is one of my favorite Hillerman's maybe because of the delft combination of strident philosopher and man-of-action that he creates in the character of Joe Leaphorn.An old man and a teenager are savagely slaughtered, an ancient shaman tells of evil and witches. Joe may listen to the stories, but he is sure the killer is worse than human.An finely plotted fast read that is one of Hillerman's best.Nash Black, author of WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS"},{"rating":"2","title":"Setting Entices Readers","review":"I strongly believe that Tony Hillerman uses setting in his books to entice readers into reading his books. LISTENING WOMAN happens to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. I learned so much about the land and the Navajo way of life. The strong use of setting really attracted my attention. - H.

I have been looking for it forever...The Indian version has the Curtis Mayfield song, while the UK version has the Basement Jaxx song. Pick which you like better. I also recommend buying the imports used, or new from another seller, because they are much cheaper!For anyone who wants to continue their exploration of Bhangra and Indian pop after this wonderful exposure (like I did!)

I have not tried it in regular tea but I'll do that next. Because it is in a solid cone shape I imagine that I will have to experiment to figure out how much to use in a cup of tea.

Solo artist albums sometimes get a bit samey (note the otherwise excellent James Ruskin's 'Point 2') and eventually exhausting.Landstrumm, though, throws so much into the mix that it stays fresh all the way through, without ever really letting up on the intensity. Realising that you can't just hammer away for 50-odd minutes on a record meant for home rather than dancefloor, he redraws the template slightly along hip-hop and electro lines, with more ear-teasing sounds and effects than you can shake a stick at. It's still techno, but with more variety and wit than you'd normally associate with the genre.Highly recommended for lovers of techno who find their 12\\"s a bit heavy for armchair listening, or even non-techno fans who want to appreciate the sound without brain damage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of ground covered, but boring and undecisive","review":"The best thing about the book is the title. The author discusses in length some obvious limitations on forecasting which exist simply because we are finite beings. But Rescher's formulation of this quite trivial fact sounds as follows: \\"the predictive venture of securing rationally warranted foresight into the future therefore faces rather equivocal prospects.\\" (p.245) Now, this quote is representative of Mr. Rescher's heavy academic style.I completely agree with the Finnish reviewer regarding the lack of depth in any subject and example discussed. Rescher's books on Idealism are much better -- my guess is because he is an Idealist and enjoys writing on the subject. Reading this book however I felt that the author just had to finish writing it as a business duty to his publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.....","review":"I am a VMI alumnus who was a cadet at the time of assimilation (accomodation, as I call it), and someone who was, and still is, against women being at VMI, and I would have to say the Dr. Brodie's book is not bad. She covered almost all the bases and did a very good job of laying everything out on the table and telling it like it is. The book does, however, have somewhat of a sympathetic connotation towards females, and neglects to mention the many instances where double standards were used in punishments (or lack thereof) dished out by the Commandant's Office, among the many other double standards that did and do take place. Overall, though, I would say that the book paints a good picture of what it was like with minimal bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply trying to make a buck","review":"I am a recent graduate of VMI(class of 2000) and I experienced the events covered by the book first hand. I had the fortunate opportunity of being able to experience the corps when it was all-male and then see the transition, so I have a little credibility on the subject. I find Mrs. Brodie's book to be a good example of an outsider's view of a complex, obtuse and guarded military society. She writes of accounts where she portrays the corps of cadets as a whole as knuckle dragging misogynists in a very derogatory way, while making the females out to be some sort of crusader. My main point is this, the wife of the Band Leader (who by the way did not attend VMI either) wrote a book about her outsider's view of what she sees as a black and white story simply to monopolize on the destruction of one of the country's most coveted traditions, the southern all male military school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic Point of View","review":"This is a nice book though it overlooks the basic differences between men and women. As a graduate of the Air Force Academy I know from personal experience that men and women are not the same. Of course, they are equal in the eyes of God, but they aren't the same. This book glosses over the fact that women can't keep up to the standards of men. In my experience I found that women are always a little weaker and slower than the male cadets. So there is always a double standard. Women can be a great asset to the military and society. However, there are somethings that women can not do as well as men. This book pretends that there are no double standards. This is a happyland, feminist fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big \\"apology\\" for a school hopelessly out of touch","review":"While Brodie's book is well written and quite enjoyable to read I do not agree with her conclusions or observations. In essence, this book is a, like a previous reviewer wrote, a PR coup for VMI. Acts of violence and unethical behavior is played down by Brodie as \\"cadets just messing around and having a good time\\".Although Brodie mentions some of the more conservative alumni and their opinions they are not discussed or observed in a very rational fashion. The comments made by alumni that \\"women should not come to VMI\\", or \\"Women who wants to be part of VMI should marry a VMI man\\" are not seen as examples of a view of society that is lagging behind. It is instead seen by Brodie as a charming antic from the South.If one wants a more balanced and academic account of VMI going co-ed one should read \\"Women in the Barracks\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spin Machine Fails Again","review":"Let me first say that I'm not against feminism, or women being equal to men.

So powerful are the lyrics to this nonexistent tune, that they actually suggest their own notes in your head, and they stay there for three decades or longer.I won't quote the lyrics for copyright reasons, other than to mention that Depravo hasn't changed his underpants in a very, very long time.There were other things in the book that should be mentioned, but I don't remember any of them, except for the center spread featuring a dragon creature with very sharp talons scratching itself in an inadvisable fashion."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're a very knowledgable family","review":"Having discovered \\"Dr. Fegg\\" several years ago, I find that it has not lost its brashness and humor.

The lessons are also buttressed by a review and quiz (with answers) at the end of each chapter.Hopefully, you should not find anything too difficult here. MS Word fundamentally deals with stuff (text and images) that are WYSIWIG. Relatively few abstractions. The lessons have the virtue that you can perform an operation and usually see its effect immediately in front of you.The most advanced and abstract idea is at the end - writing and running macros.

For the average user with light use, such as washing your car on the weekends, this will work just great. I used a 75 ft hose and the reel seems pretty full, I would not suggest a 100 ft hose on this. It reels in and out pretty easily - when reeling the hose up you generally have to guide the hose a little bit with your hand so it wraps up evenly.I have seen reviews where people say the fittings leak over time, but due to my short usage I cannot comment on this.

Mounting holes in the base are not slotted allowing the screws be only loosened to lift it off for cleaning out the spiders, crud, etc. Gotta take the screws completely out of the wall, meaning after a few times the holes will expand or strip and need larger screws or new holes.4. No hose guide means you have to be careful winding the hose so it doesn't pile up; takes two hands.5. The locking piece that holds the reel on the spindle seems awfully thin and light.

Bear in mind I have owned a similar hose reel from this company for over 20 years before it stopped working.Yesterday I went to use the garden hose and the inner and outer wheels of the hose reel are severely warped to the extend the inner wheel rubs on the house. I will be returning this item but am very skeptical about accepting another product as I feel this is a manufacturing defect which will be consistent with another hose wheel.I could not under any circumstances recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"hose reel","review":"Good reel and easy to install.

Some recipes seem to be authentic. Many were not. I though I'd see some of the very things Lewis writes about in her novels. Very few.

I also, love the variety of good home cooking recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not authentic Amish cooking!","review":"Oh, no no NO. I had such high hopes for this cookbook, and I'm so glad I checked it out from the library before purchasing it. I was looking for a good, old fashioned cookbook with \\"made from scratch\\" recipes, and this is most definitely not that. The very first recipe in the cookbook called for canned refried beans and salsa from the jar. The first ingredient in the fritter recipe is dry pancake mix, the blueberry pie recipe includes no actual fresh or frozen blueberries, just cans of blueberry pie filling, and other recipes include things such as canned soups and miracle whip. I'm sure Beverly Lewis is a good novelist, but I'm sorry, this cookbook is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"Great cookbook with information into the lives of the Amish cultureand meals they prepare.

Wonderful period sets, intelligently written and well-acted. Does a fine job of depicting human nature and the passions that drive that behavior. If you like a good mystery, I recommend this series highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"offensively awful","review":"Bad acting, dreadful writing, annoying camera work. Were it not for the title, it would be unrecognizable as a work based on Christie's Miss Marple. Tasteless adaptations full of silly anachronisms. Buy the Joan Hickson classics instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming - Loved It","review":"I've watched the Joan Hickson version of this episode, and liked it a lot. But this one is much more lively and I liked the setting and music better. It was a little more modern. I love all of Agatha Christie's work. This is not my absolute favorite,but I did enjoy it. A true \\"cozy\\" mystery with a little romance sprinkled in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Characters","review":"One of Agatha Christies strenths is her interesting and diverse characters, watching more realistic crime drama can be depressing Agatha Christie is definately an escape from the dullness of life not that my life is dull. I think fiction should excite entertain and extend our lives and give us a hope for the future, otherwise why bother I think shows like Ground Zero do this, another favorite of mine is the crazy whodunnit Bigfoot Littlefoot and West. An interesting point about Agatha Christie is once she was considered rubbish just light reading for the uneducated but dear old Agatha has travelled well down the corridors of time and left her more serious compeditors behind. Definately one to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Bertram's Hotel","review":"I was very disappointed with this version of At Bertram's Hotel. Other than similar character names and the Bertram Hotel setting, this version was VERY different from the book, and thus, quite disappointing. Additionally, I had to order 2x (and be charged 2x) to get the correct episode, even though the correct episode was on-screen when I clicked the 1-click icon to make the purchase.NOTE: Amazon credited my account for the incorrect episode.

I don't love the book because it dives right into tutorials, and doesn't always give me enough of a big picture. But this big picture can be a difficult one to convey. When I needed to deploy an app and get the JNDI names right for getting to my data source, this book had a chapter that explains exactly that. It explains both the steps to get it done in the GUI, and a bit of how and why it works like it does.I looked at some other books from IBM press, like Enterprise Java Programming with IBM Websphere, and they were a bit too much, too soon for me. I might, however, recommend the Redbooks, if you can get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors Galore!","review":"On page one it states that it is \\"aimed at beginners who want to quickly and easily learn to use Rational Application Developer\\". Beginners beware. I can't remember reading a textbook-like book that has as many errors as this one does. I'm only up to page 65 and I've found 23 errors or inconsistencies. And, eight of the 65 pages I did not read. How many errors are there in the next 539 pages. I question whether this book was \\"proofed\\". I am amazed and disappointed that the IBM Press published a book with this level of quality. My experience with this book so far makes me wonder whether I should purchase any more books from IBM Press in the future. I'd sure like to get my money back on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"There is next to nothing useful in this book. Consider purchasing it only if you have a medium weight door that needs holding ajar, and no other use for $50."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tutorial on target, but a lack of technical proofing","review":"I admit that this book is right on target for how it is structured for people to learn the fundamentals from the ground up. It follows a natural learning format from beginning to end. However, the book is riddled with programming inconsistences and errors. For example, you are left to figure out parameters that are named one way, but are written differently on another page for the same program (see page 48 => arg2.doFilter should be chain.doFilter). Also, there are instances where the book tells you that you will find certain things within a perspective, but when using the IDE, you find the book is not accurate (see page 57=>cannot see Servlets tab when double-clicking on the Web Perspective Deployment Descriptor, but it is in the Java Perspective when you double-click the Web.xml file). The book was written in a hurry, it appears, and is really for a developer who can see the mistakes and correct them on the fly when going through the tutorials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best deal I've seen on this game","review":"A terrific price on this travel Boggle game.

I called and was told that I would have to place a new order to fix it. CSR was not helpful and seemed to not care. I was then told that they no longer had any sizes available to fill my order and that is why I recieved a different sweatshirt. This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. What a let down! It even makes it worse to hear the same thing is happening to others. This was not a mistake, but intentional. I should have been contacted and given the option to change my order!

I bought the book for ideas for our major remodelling. In particular, I was looking for great pictures of clever, contemporary ideas for our sons' bedrooms and for our family room. The pictures in the book are very poor quality, grainy and faded, and most appear to have been taken well before the mid-Nineties. This book was published in 1997; it's now 2000. Why would I want to look at a room clearly designed for and in the 70's? What's with the crocheted pillow (p. 149)? I suspect that room has long since been RE-modeled. While I did enjoy the historical background on Gusbav Stickley's Structural Furnishings, I certainly didn't feel inspired by the already-dated examples of \\"contemporary\\" interpretations.

It's a book of executed ideas that one may use for your own designs. I have the soft cover, which is better than the hardcover, if judged by the reviews. I love the history of built-ins and the great pictures. The text is wrapped around the pictures and great pleasure reading. He does show some things, such as: how to create a pattern to ensure the piece fits, how to scribe a foundation so the piece rests levelly on an imperfect floor, how to use trim to hide gaps of varying width, or make a strong joint. This book will help you come up with your own pieces or adapt the designs in the book to your space but you will need another book, or a woodworker, to build them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just some nice pictures","review":"Lots of terrific ideas if I owned a million dollar home, but hardly applicable to simple housing with less than expansion rooms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture book","review":"The subtitle say's it all.

Not a true book on woodworking but a picture book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I was extrememly dissapointed by this novel. I actually found myself rooting for the bad guys when they finally caught the good guy! The plot had potential -- US & Chinese politics, WMDs, a Mideast connection, etc., but the characters are really hard to believe. It seems like the bad guys are everywhere, watching everything, and only the hero is clueless. Narrow escape after narrow escape, the reader isn't inspired by the hero's dedication, instead, you are left stunned by his stupidity.If you are a Ludlum fan, pass this one up. There are better choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Ludlum Gem","review":"Although I am just in the early stages of this book, it seems as though it will be another quality piece my Robert Ludlum (or whoever is writing for him now-a-days).

Absolutely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Ludlum's Best Work","review":"This has got to be one of Ludlum's worst. Gayle Lynds must have written most of it. It's hard to beleive that there would be an agent in the field as inept as Jon Smith. This agent's performance is so bad, he shouldn't be in any covert organization, even the fictional ones! If it wasn't for luck and the skills of other agents (including one really smart female), he'd been dead in chapter one!! It should be criminal to create a covert agent with such ineptness. He can't retrieve documents without getting caught or beat half to death. He couldn't subdue one guard while helping the President's estranged father escape. The whole novel is about the star character screwing up! Shame on you RL for putting your name on this novel. This is the last time I buy a novel based on the author's reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of this substandard effort.","review":"If you're a Ludlum fan, like I am, you will be acutely disappointed in this bomb. After the likes of The Sigma Protocol and The Janson Directive, this one is about as interesting as watching the tide come in. It starts with a hackneyed premise of terrorist weapon materials being transported to China, then comes to a grinding halt as the \\"story\\" stagnates for hundreds of pages, going on and on, with no advancement of the plot whatsoever, like a car stuck in the mud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spy thriller? try Snooze fest","review":"This was my first Robert Ludlum novel and I am seriously disappointed. I don't know that I'll even finish it. Characters have literally had the same conversations multiple times, as if the author isnt sure we were paying attention and they better summarize the plot again, just to be safe. The writing itself just tries to hard and is, in a word, lame. Sample line: \\"He crossed the room to the sink and picked up the dish liquid, Dawn, and poured some in the sink.\\" Like we need to what brand of dish soap it is(!)?From the summary on the jacket, this novel sounded promising. Instead, I'm fighting to stay awake, not caring if they ever catch the bad guys. 2 out 5 stars because I've managed to hang on more than half way."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is a MUST HAVE for anyone planning a wedding!","review":"This book provided me with tons of inspiration as I planned my own wedding. The hundreds of ideas got my creative juices flowing and we had an incredible wedding that just blew out guests away. Some of her ideas we adapted right out of the book and others we used as a starting point as we adjusted the ideas to suit our own wedding style (and budget.) Some have claimed that her ideas are too expensive for brides today, but they can really be adapted to suit any budget. I used this book for my wedding and I gave it to my two sisters when they got married (no-I did not lend them my copy - it is sitting on my coffee table!)You must not miss this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Material seems very dated.","review":"There is a reason this book is shrink-wrapped - to prevent you from finding out that most of the photos are from the 1980's. The pictures in here are like travelling in a time warp. Anyone planning a wedding today would find limited fodder for inspiration, given the fact that the highlighted weddings are 10 years old. The text is OK, but not very creative. I found myself double checking the publication date to see if it said 1986 instead of 1996. Definitely not worth the high price. Colin Cowie's book is much more current and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"many great ideas for creating a stylish wedding","review":"Beverly Clark shares so many wonderful ideas that can be adapted to suit even the modest budget like ours.

I own both this book and Colin Cowie's and both are equally stunning; yes, some of Clark's pictures are dated, but by no more than 5 years - the wedding industry has changed dramatically. She has modern invitation suggestions, awesome pictorials of reception venues, and overall, it's an interesting book to flip through.

Perhaps it's not a suitable introduction, but from what I gather, this is the sound of a pioneer who lost pace with the imitators. Especially for 1996, the tracks are painfully repetitive and formulaic. Maybe I'm just desensitized, expecting every track to build to a break, but none of these seem to go anywhere. Too many sounds, most highly electronic, span entire tracks unchanged, like a higher-energy Plastikman sound that trips over itself. My usual vinyl complaint applies here: there is a paltry 45 minutes of material here. \\"Loose kick\\" and \\"The view\\" were the most listenable to me, but the standard five-minute track gets close to grating. Sadly, this nearly nullifies the likelihood of my seeking anything else.

This album has some good tracks, but also a number of tracks that are pretty trite. Some of the uptempo tracks come off as more noisy and less smooth than was the case in All Mixed Up. Sound effects appear in some songs that kind of break those songs up, make a disconnect. So overall this album doesn't grab the listener as much as did their first album.

Didn't turn out as well as they thought.And neither has this album. Without a top 10 single in sight, SheDaisy has no need to Knock On The Sky.. it's quite obvious the people are knocking on the music store doors for something other than this album!One star for a disappointment.

And unfortunately, I have yet to hear a song from this album on the airwaves. It's a crying shame because this album is incredible and has elevated SheDaisy to my favorite musical group...period.

Some highlights of the disc are \\"Mine All Mine\\", \\"I Wish I Were the Rain\\", \\"The First to Let Go\\", and my personal favorite, the positive and uplifting \\"Now\\".

I'm not one of those complaining traditionalists or anything I love Today's Country Music but SheDaisy really needs to put some pure down home country sound in their music. The album has not produced any hits on the radio my radio station refuses to play these gals and I do not blame them. They are a very attractive cute group of girls though but they have a chance to fix themselves to put some country in there music and that is all they really need to do they should sound like another Highway 101 or Trick Pony then their videos would get played and they would have hits. Knock on the Sky is full of lousy songs with bad beat and it sounds like they are headed in a Britney Spears/Leann Rimes/Shania Twain road please girls do not do that we have enough of silly music out there right now what we really need is some real southern style music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knock On The Sky was Knocked Out!","review":"SheDaisy vs. Dixie ChicksAnd I only bring this up since SheDaisy were the ones to have claimed to have enough talent and power to blow the Chicks away with this new album, Knock on the Sky.The boxing match lasted a total of 3 or 4 weeks. Here's why:Releasing this album the same season as the Chick's new album was a bad move. Not only did the Chicks' album outsell KNOCK ON THE SKY by astronomical amounts, but this album hasn't even generated a Top 10 single since it's initial release (which was a few weeks before the Chicks released their new album)!The Chicks went back to their Bluegrass roots, while SheDaisy spun into a very obscurly self-defined pop-country, which at times, doesn't even sound country. Nothing wrong with that.. however, their choice to cross over puts them up to the pop-artists, to whom they are left in the dust.Better luck next time, Osborns.

I took the CD back for a refund but the plastic was already broken, so I took it to a used CD store to recover some of my money. There is not even (1) track on the entire CD that resembles country music. If SheDaisy wants to be pop stars, then they need to release their future CD's as pop, because this CD is surely not country in any shape, form or fashion.

This sounds much too poppy to be considered country at all.(Kassidy, why did you dye your hair again?)Also, a new Dixie Chicks album will be released in August (their single is hot and still holding steady in the Billboard Top 10).SheDaisy should admit this project to be a disappointment to fans and bad timing when it comes to record release.. to go against a rival like the Chicks.. I mean, hello... I for one am taking this to the used CD store for a credit to buy the next Chicks album.And SheDaisy will not blow the Chicks out of the water. Get real!

The ranches in the area are on the dry side of the mountains (e.g. rain shadow) an experiencing a long term draught. While the entire series is slow paced, I found the DVD did an amazing job in developing the characters and depicting what a tremedous struggle it is for the local ranchers and their families. Not everyone will enjoy this series, but all I can say is I did.

There are some other good tracks on this , half a dozen acceptable ones, and an awful lot of fluff that shows what happens when you keep trying to dig in a tapped out mine. ( the later Busby Berkley musicals illustrate this well , and the music lost its fire as the focus went on more and more elaborate productions rather than the original spark ).

The casting is marvelous and the cinematography is good, but it is Dylan Thomas's words and Elliott's narration of them that lifts this film into the ranks of Christmas classics.

It will make you nostalgic for your snowy childhood Welsh Christmases, even if you never had one.For UK residents, you may be able to watch American DVDs on your computer. We are able to do it with no problem. You might wish to try it out with a borrowed American DVD if you can, before purchasing.

Uncles and aunts of memory, hard candies and useless presents, Mrs Prothero's fire, snowballing the cats, crocheted nose covers and more.

It has considerable value as an illustrated overview of this subject; but you will need to look elsewhere to see a truer depiction of the beauty of these paintings.This book's reproductions are not necessarily worse than those found in many other (most other?) art books. I'm just bemoaning that this book, like far too many others, does not display paintings in any way close to true color, depth of color, or brilliance, etc.There must be valid reasons for such low-quality reproductions (e.g., higher quality might translate into too-high book prices); regardless of the reason, though, it is fair to point out the low quality.

It's too sensitive.Also, I think the laser is underpowered or something becuase if any CDRW or DVRDW has any scratches on it, it has a hard time handling them.My Philips DVP642 never had any of these problems and I wish I hadn't sold it."},{"rating":"2","title":"firmware solution","review":"True does need firmware upgrade, doubt toshiba will be supplying one as unit has been archived by manufacturer, anythow since i only paid $40 for it at a discount store why not take a chance. went to toshiba website, download firmware and created update disc. power on unit and incert disc, replied start update and could hear disc reading, disc stopped reading after a min or two. update message still on screen, gave it a couple of minutes, popped out disc, power off/power on put in move alien, palyed perfect, tried a divx movie, perfect again, no features lost and picture is graet through HDMI connector. ooops forgot to mention the firmware used was for thd sd-4000 which is available on toshiba site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad DivX","review":"I am returning it after trying for several hours.

I did not try to burn 650M CDs to check that statement - my files are usually 700M, and in any case I need DVDs.Even when I was able to play some files, twice 20 min later player was frozen (and I found a lot of complains about it online)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This player is junk!","review":"The Toshiba SD-4990 DVD player is junk!

It was cheap. That all about whats good with it.The unit seems to freeze on multiple dvds. So annoying when watching a movie and you have to eject the disk and restart. Im going to return it ASAP.

It freezes multiple times on mostly all DVDs. I thought the unit I received was defective, so I sent in to Toshiba for replacement. The new machine they sent me has the same issues. The only work around is to reset the box by unplugging it for 5+ minutes, which temporarily resolves the freezes. So far Toshiba has not released a firmware update to fix the problems.Overall, this player has great features for the money, but the freezes make me want to throw it out the window!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The first unit I purchased did nothing - no picture no sound. It took nearly a month to get it replaced (local dealer). The second unit works - sort of. It will not play any DVD-R disks, reporting them as bad, even when they play fine on my 4 year old Pioneer unit. Even commercial disks show frequent dropouts and freeze occasionally.

As a physicist, I like that the physics ideas are not simplified or glossed over. For example, Born realized that the electron had to occupy a 3D space within the atom (rather than, for example, a circular Keplerian orbit), because of the compression of solids.

In addition to wonderfully written text, you get photos of from each artist's life and many many images of the artwork. This could have been one of those hardback biographies printed on cheap paper, some grainy photos, and a middle section with maybe 6 pages of glossy artwork.

I did manage to pop a few flies off but the accuracy is not all there. You have to aim it a bit lower (right on the top of the circular projectile screen) because the projectile screen tends to travel upwards. It is difficult to get the flies, especially when they are on a corner or edge of something as the projectile can only hit a 2-3 inch radius when flat. This is not why I gave it 2 stars, because perhaps I needed some practice or just to get the hang of the right angles/distances, but because after the 2nd day of having this, it broke on me. The projectile is 2 pieces, the circular flat hitting surface and a plastic threaded tube which cracked in half. Says made in the USA, and for 7 dollars I'd rather get a few regular fly swatters.

I expected it to provide more comic relief than actual fly killing ability and I was actually quite mistaken. The spring in the launching section is actually quite strong, launching the disc powerfully enough to squish most flies easily. The problem however is with the disk. If you do not shoot the disc at a 90 degree angle to the surface the fly is on, most of the time it will not squish them and they fly off. With some practice with positioning though, it ended up being an effective tool for me that actually managed to kill quite a few flies without any misses.

This is addressed in the manual. Overall, this is an exceptional coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID TRAGEDY","review":"At this time of giving PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!I have sent my pot with the US safety commission and it has started on fire. 2 different pots.

Makes 14 cups in less than 5 min. We've tried several different coffeemakers over the years, but this is our favorite by far!! Very easy and quick to make smaller (4 - 8 cup) pots also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst scam of a coffee maker!","review":"The carafe broke after a week, second one broke after two weeks, third carafe broke after 4 weeks of being VERY careful. If I didn't know better, I'd have to say that Cuisinart designed this for maximum profit. We would have purchases a stainless steel one, but we're so angry about the cost, we don't even want to deal with Cuisinart. TOTAL SCAM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Caught on fire","review":"Length:: 0:28 MinsI think this video says it all...and this was after I unplugged the coffee pot. Best part was Cuisinart didn't even offer up a replacement unit because mine was beyond the 3 year warranty.

I wish I would have searched the on-line consumer reports before purchasing this coffee maker; my experience is certainly not the first. I now realize not to just rely on customer reviews attached to on-line shopping websites because prior to this morning, I too would have rated this coffee maker 5 stars. PS. Make sure you have working smoke detectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is a great coffee maker! It makes lots of hot hot coffee without the mess that some makers can cause. Plus you get the reuseable filter. Great purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love, love this coffeemaker!","review":"Rec'd this coffeemaker in a timely manner and it was just as described.Can't share enough about how much we love it.

Features are great and directions are easy to follow.We definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible customer service","review":"First, this is an excellent coffee maker, best we've ever had. Makes super hot great tasting coffee every time and keeps it hot for as long as you want. We've had the machine for just over a year and the filter basket broke where there's a spring that allows you to take out the pot during brewing (a feature we never use). I tried to order a replacement, but they don't offer it from Cuisinart and when I tried to contact them I get absolutely no response. As much as I like the machine, I will never purchase from Cuisinart again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Coffee Capacity","review":"I bought the 14-cup assuming it would have the capacity to handle more coffee beans ground (I like strong coffee). But no. It takes a typical 12-cup #4 cone filter, and there's no room for spillover. The filter holder is the same size as the filter. My previous $30 Mr. Coffee machine at least has room for filling the filter up to the brim. You can't do that with this machine. Moreover, this design flaw defeats the manufacturer's selling proposition that a 14-cup capacity is suited for entertaining. Well, if you do that, those cups of coffee are probably weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"$100 for a 18-mo. Coffee Maker","review":"The 14c. maker attracted us because of how much coffee we drink and how much we entertain. It was a bit pricy at $100.00 compared to our usual $50-60 coffemakers, but we thought that also meant it would last better than the average 2-3 years we get from the lesser priced units. Well, we got about 1-1/2 years out of this coffee maker. We're absolutely disgusted, and have sent a comment to Cuisinart and received absolutely no reply what-so-ever. We'll be getting the new Kitchenaid 14 c. coffeemaker, and hopefully that is a better made machine.SignedCan't Go Back To 12c."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"The water indicator is indeed difficult to read - but not as difficult to read as the lcd display, which is tiny and unlit - you need to get face to face with it.The water resevoir has a relatively small and awkwardly shaped opening - care is required when filling to avoid spillage.The control knob is impossible to turn if your hands are wet.The filter ripped soon after I purchased it.You have to take extra care to keep the internal plastic cone clean, or you will get grind overflow when you make the full 14 cups - this has happened to me twice - a mess.Brewing is relatively slow.The lid does not hinge, but can only be removed.The auto-off system turns off way too soon for me and is not adjustable.The unit is overpriced.The coffee it makes is fine - I'm no expert, and the unit is attractive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you like lukewarm coffee","review":"I have used this coffeemaker now for three months and I've tried varying amounts of coffee and tried many settings to make a satisfying brew. Happy to say that this coffeemaker is performing well to produce lukewarm coffee. Certainly not hot coffee. The metal carafe does well to keep the cofee lukewarm for several hours. I just wish it would make the coffee hotter. It would also probably improve the taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"caught on fire","review":"I had this coffee maker for 10 months and loved the large 14 cup capacity. But, this morning as I was reading the paper, fortunately in the same room as the coffee maker, it started to smoke and caught on fire. This is very dangerous. Will never buy another Cuisinart. I hate to think of what would have happened if I had not been right there. Do not buy this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fire yet - just bad coffee","review":"I have had my Cuisinart 14-cup Brew Central Coffee Maker for about 6 months. It hasn't caught fire yet, but I just don't like the taste of the coffee. I had a Krups for about 10 years which made wonderful coffee. I have used HEB's Taste of San Antonio coffee in both coffee makers and you cannot taste the fine flavors of the coffee in the Cuisinart. I will replace it, especially now that I have read it might just spontaneously combust. I wanted to buy another Krups,but the lady at Macy's said Krups aren't good anymore. Will have to do more research on that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost caught fire","review":"Sorry to be negative but thought people should know... we loved our Cuisinart coffee maker but this morning it shorted out and almost caught fire after the coffee was through making. We are so thankful we were home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water dumps everywhere!!! Ugh!!!","review":"We received this coffee maker as a wedding gift to match our stainless steel kitchen look. It was $140 on sale. Well, our previous coffee maker (Krups) was going on it's 10th straight year with no problems, so I waited until it finally died to open my \\"new in the box\\" Cuisinart coffee maker.From the very first day it dumped water from the condensation above the coffee filter and water reservoir all over the counter top. It isn't a trickle, it's a pool of water.I called Cuisinart about it and they said they couldn't do anything about it since the 3 year warranty had expired. I explained it was a wedding gift I had just opened and it was clearly a design flaw. Didn't matter to them! They were not willing to do anything about it. Terrible customer service.I'm waiting for it to catch on fire like so many others have. Maybe they'll do something then."},{"rating":"1","title":"coffeemaker","review":"The coffee is extremely hot from this coffeemaker. Beware! I find the product adequate but not outstanding.

I have a little flashlight beside it so I am able to see down inside to read how many cups of water I've poured in. The lid is a hassle to snap back on. I don't bother anymore. The only good thing is that the coffee is very hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Size Does Matter","review":"I have been very happy with this coffee pot. My husband and I are both coffee drinkers and this machine eliminates the \\"empty pot syndrome\\". Programming is simple and the quality of the coffee taste is excellent. I do agree the lid is awkward and I would much prefer the lid that flips up with one motion over the current lid that must be lifted off and snapped back on to the carafe. As for the resevoir not being visible, the carafe is clearly marked for 4, 6 or 8 cups etc. If you utilize the carafe as a measure, rather than trying to eyeball an internal measure, you will resolve your concerns about the amount of water you are using.We are very pleased with this product and were it not for the lid, I would give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"CUSINART FEATURES LESS THAN OLDER MODELS","review":"WE HAVE OWNED THE 12 CUP MAKER AND WE REALLY NEEDED THE 14 CUP FEATURE SO BOUGHT THIS MODEL.WE HAVE ONLY OWNED CUISNART BRAND COFFEE MAKERS FOR THE PAST 8 YEARS.

We loved the first two, but they broke quickly (right after warranty expired, of course). So we bought this model recommended by a family member. It has worked well for 6-8 months and just the other morning performed just as the other reviewers have said. Started making a funny noise and then smoking terribly! My husband unplugged it and took it outside, but if we had not been close by (as we usually are not at that time of the morning), I feel sure we would have had a serious fire to deal with. I have reported this to Cuisinart, but so far, no reply. Do not buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"caught fire","review":"Don't buy this coffee maker!

If I could I would not even give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recomend the book","review":"I read all of Harry Potter's book, they were great. But I don't like this book because is a little bit stupid. I really didin't understand the problem of Belladoma and the boy. The book was very very out of real world. And the end was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"COMPARED TO HARRY POTTER.......","review":"A cute story, but let's face it. Released in 1979, you shouldn't expect anything very original or refreshing. A writer of today could do a lot more with the wizard world. Look at Harry Potter....."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this better than the 1st HARRY POTTER book","review":"This book is really great. The hero, Arriman the Awful, is funny and charming and just the right amount of evil. I'm not a big fantasy fan, but I enjoyed this comedy of errors--full of cases of mistaken identities, misconjured spells, misunderstandings--that was also full of suspense and a little bit of terror. While some of the witches are sort of gross, they are also very humorous. While I wish the heroine wasn't such the stereotypical blonde, blue-eyed goody-goody, that she wants to be an evil viper-making witch is good--it's like Sandy in GREASE wanting to turn bad. The story touches on the fact that most people want to be liked and will go to extremes to achieve that goal, even if it means not being true to one's nature. But the book isn't preachy--I'm just reading into things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which Witch?","review":"I have to say that I read this book in 2 nights easily, and it was pretty good. As you probably have figured out, the ending was VERY predictable, but there were a few surprises. Arriman the Aweful must get married and decides to hold a competition for the darkest witch to be his bride. Of course, all the wiches are crazy and ugly except for Belladonna, who is beatiful, nice, perfect, and in love with Arriman, but she is a white witch (not evil). The ending can already be predicted from here, but the book takes you on a wild ride to get there. I would say that it is a great read fr those who, like me, enjoy magic and comedy. I am pleased to say, though, that it is not a sleazy fantasy book but a cute fariy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which Witch?","review":"I would recommend this book to people that like fairy Tales.

Happy trails!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful!","review":"I was happy to find this wonderfully witty book back in print after having been nearly lost in obscurity. Having read Which Witch before J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter books, I found the latter to be quite derivative in style and tone. Which Witch has very likeable, idiosyncratic characters and a quickly moving story line. If you found the Harry Potter books to be enjoyable, you'll probably like this one, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ for Harry Potter fans!","review":"If you love Harry Potter, you will love Which Witch. It hads the same humor and lovable characters. 'Keeps characters on a human scale, even when the supernatural is popping out all over'-quote from Harry Potter, that completely relates to this book as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic read","review":"I read this book for the first time back in elementary school. I always adored it, and I reread it multiple times all the way into middle shcool. I generally read several grade levels above my actual grade, though, so kids as young as elementary and possibly as old as high school would still enjoy it. Great for Harry Potter fans, or just general fantasy fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun-filled fantasy","review":"Eva Ibbotson delivers another fun-filled fantasy, this one featuring a most eccentric assortment of witches, plus a wizard in search of a wife, a 16th-century ghost who murdered all seven of his wives, a one-eyed ogre, a gypsy fortuneteller, an earthworm named Rover, and a likable young boy who has escaped from a dismal orphanage. The witches, who are competing in a contest of sinister deeds to marry the wizard Arriman the Awful, include one who is half mermaid, a pair of quarrelsome twins who have chickens for familiars, a truly evil enchantress, and Belladonna, a good witch who seems unable to do anything wicked no matter how hard she tries. If you liked \\"The Secret of Platform 13,\\" you'll like this one too. I also recommend Ms. Ibbotson's \\"Island of the Aunts\\" (British title: \\"Monster Mission\\"), plus her ghost books, available in U.K. editions."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AT ALL LIKE HARRY POTTER - Just plain terrible!","review":"I'm not sure what all the reviewers who said this story was akin to Harry Potter were talking about. It's terrible. It's in the genre of children's lit that relies on shock and grossness, instead of plot and good writing. One example: a witch who conjures 1,000 rats and forces them to eat each other, and the final rat to eat itself. It is nothing like the fast-paced, well-plotted Harry Potter, nor does it resemble the writings of Roald Dahl. It goes on and on and on ... and the message for young girls is atrocious. The whole \\"women doing terrible deeds to get a husband\\" theme is straight from the 1970s, when the book was first written. My daughter (and I!) love Roald Dahl and Harry Potter; this is neither of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wonder how this novel will end? (sarcasm)","review":"Yes, that's right, it's the most predictable book I have ever read, which covers an immense spectrum of literature. I, being a member of a book group, had to digress from my normal readings of the Dune series and etc. to read this. I will hand it to it Ibbotson for the mild entertainment, but the story has no unexpected twists. For those of you in suspense at how the novel is going to end, I hope you graduate from this 5th grade reading level soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"With a distinct Ibbotson style, this book is quite enjoyable","review":"After reading \\"SECRET OF PLATFORM 13\\" this summer, I thought that I would continue, by reading \\"Which Witch?\\" Though some may disagree with me, I think that it was a very sweet book. It was not\\"David Copperfield,\\" but was anyone really expecting Charles Dickens? This story had believable characters, an interesting plot and good (if not predictable) turns of events. Ibbotson is on a roll of good books, and they are her first! So, congratulations Ms. Ibbotson for the marvelous stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iva Ibbotson's book Which Witch","review":"I liked Eva Ibottson's book called Which Witch. It's about a dark magician who needs a wife in order to keep his title as the darkest magician in the world. All of these wacky witches show up for the contest with their familiars (their pets).

The beating illusion is created by some piece of wire circling around inside the rubber heart: it does not look like a beating heart, it looked like a miniature mixer going around inside. At least I think it did but it did not last long, a few \\"beats\\" and there was a permanent cardiac arrest no matter how much I played with the cheap contacts in the battery holder.

Tommy Stuart has taken over the vocals, Stacy Anderson is gone. The hooky songwriting/riffwriting is also gone. There are 2, maybe 3, decent songs, but nothing like the quality of their old stuff.

To use as an introduction for someone who was going to maintain the WebObjects application, it may be fine, but for someone learning the tool and using it to develop dynamic sites, the value is limited.It seems that there was more effort put into making cute chaper titles than on the content of the book. The cute titles are not really amusing to me, not because they are not cute, but because in most cases, they do not convey the contents of the chapters.

My 19 mo. daughter has stood and sat on them quite a bit and they show no wear so I am sure they will hold up fine for several years. The only thing I don't like is paying this much money for decorated cardboard!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kids love these!","review":"These blocks are just awesome!!! My kids have so much fun building forts, and castles etc with them. They are very sturdy and colorful. This was a great find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids of all ages","review":"I originally bought this game at a second hand store only to get it home and discover that too many pieces were missing. At the time, my 2 1/2 year old loved playing it and still plays it now at 4 1/2. It's easy to play but has advanced levels as a child grows. if you love to get down on the floor and play with your kids - both of you will love this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool lights but worthless battery!","review":"These lights are the coolest I've seen or used yet...for two rides at about 1.5 hours each. After that the battery would not charge at all. No status light at all and even after being charged for days I had no juice. I've been trying to call Blackburn customer service to see if I have any chance of making these lights workable again, but after five calls and being on hold for more than 10 minutes each call I still have not had anybody pick up the phone. Is anybody at Blackburn listening? Your product looks great but totally sucks for what its supposed to do. VERY DISAPPOINTING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MASH Season 9","review":"This is another great MASH DVD - we have almost the entire set now. The only problem is that it was ordered in early December and wasn't received until February 10th. This is most unusual for Amazon since products are almost always shipped immediately. The good part of that is that the price was lowered."},{"rating":"1","title":"fast and fantastic!","review":"Mash season 9 arrived much faster than expected and is in perfect condition. Extremely satisfied!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short but Very Entertaining!","review":"After reading this book you'll figure out why GG Allin had over ten back up bands thru out his career as a performing artist. How memorable was GG? I heard radio jock Howard Stern mention him a few times on his radio show. Definately the most outrageous performance artist to hit a stage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"As somone who knew GG and who knows Evan Cohen, I can vouch for Evan's credibilty. The book was a great read. A must for anyone interested in the history of rock&roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRAUD","review":"this book is a waste of time to read (all 15 minutes that it would take) what ever you do don't bother evan cohen didn't really know gg allin HE IS A FRAUD"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Days of G.G. Allin","review":"I'm glad to see a book (finally) on G.G. Allin. But I was expecting a whole lot more from this 30 minute read. I've got all the videotape and then some. Where is Liz? - besides a thank-you on the very back page - she's not even acknowledged! She went on to live with Merle Allin for the next several months following the death of G.G. If you're going to put out a book on G.G., Please! Do it right! You would think with the infamous following he managed to create, someone such as Bob Woodward would be lining up to write THE STORY! But it is not going to happen. The BOOK is still out there! This book is still highly reccomended though if you want to get a look into the last days of GOOD OLE' G.G. ALLIN! 5 Stars! Thanks for your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting subject, awful writing","review":"Not even a subject as interesting and controversial as GG Allin could make the effort of reading this worthwhile. The writing is limp, scattered and self-serving. The author spends more time describing the symptoms of the cold he caught while on tour with the Murder Junkies than he does describing their adventures or giving us insight into the personalities of the relevant characters. Reading this is a...waste of time. Buy the book, but just look at the pictures. They'll tell you as much as the author did, and you'll save yourself two hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staying Power","review":"Quinn has a great talent for sending the listener to a bygone era, one where music reflected the times and entertaining was about more than just flashy lights and loud thumping. I found Quinn's music to be enjoyable, up lifting, and wonderfully entertaining. With four CD's to her name Quinn has shown she has real staying power."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wannabe Broadway Ingenue \\"Swings\\" And Stumbles","review":"Yet another attractive young woman hops on the retro bandwagon, only to fall off. What do these cutesy mannerisms and affected stylings have to do with swing? She ought to be doing commercials or community theatre musicals. One of the tunes on the CD sums it up: \\"Thanks But No Thanks\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead Battery","review":"Battery would not charge times two batteries sent from this seller. Bought another brand from different seller and had no further problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fine introduction to lesser-heard material","review":"There is no reason to buy this disc, really, if you have MUSK AT DUSK/IMPOSSIBLE HOLIDAYS by Irmin Schmidt, DELUGE by Karoli and Estes, NOWHERE by Jaki's Phantomband, and ON THE WAY TO THE PEAK OF NORMAL by Czukay; the best tracks on the album are taken from these discs. If you DON'T know these albums -- all substantial solo works by members of one of the most interesting bands of the 1970s, then this disc will be a LOT of fun for you, and a great excuse to go out and buy at the very least the Karoli and Schmidt recordings -- after which you can sell Cannibalism III and forget about it, which is what I did, though I bought Phantomband, too, and liked it more than some folks. Czukay once again is the archival force behind the project. Strangely, the weakest moments on the disc are his -- I really HATE \\"Cool in the Pool\\" and would routinely program my CD player AROUND it. The \\"Witches' Multiplication Table\\" stuff is pretty cool, tho'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Solo Compilation","review":"Although at times the song selection of Cannibalism III comes across a bit disjointed due to this being a solo compilation of the band members it's still a very very cool record and well worth adding to your collection if you don't have all the solo stuff (which I don't). Very different than a Can record but not a weak track in the bunch. I say go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THAT'S Funk!","review":"Finally, a CD that delivers the funk how it's meant to be played, danced and listened to. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Old School","review":"Used to have this in vinyl...so happy to have it in cd format. Great album. Great pice.
