It has trouble receiving local and HD stations, so that the sound goes in and out constantly. It has far too much bass (which cannot be adjusted)so that it is almost useless as a radio unless you are listening to something that is all about the bass line. And it doesn't always work - sometimes it turns itself off without warning (no, I am not setting it to sleep mode by accident), and loses the presets regularly. I highly recommend you stay away from this overpriced, very disappointing radio. I will certainly never buy another BA product after this experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initial high hopes, but very disappointed","review":"Having seen this radio advertised in so many places, I was excited about trying it. However, I am very disappointed and will be taking it back to the store today. The reception is horrible, there is no seek option, you cannot change the amount of base (which is too much for me), it requires AC power, and it is way overpriced. The little wire antenna it comes with is laughably bad for such an expensive unit. Honestly, my 20 dollar boombox can get way more stations. one HD signal I was able to pick up kept going in and out every two seconds, and what I heard wasn't worth it anyway. Maybe this technology will get better in the future, but it is clearly not yet ready for prime time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Call of the Dolphin CD","review":"A little pricey.

What rates it a one star, however, is the inane writing. The descriptions of the AppleScript functions are flat and uninteresting, and the book itself is poorly organized and bears no trace of even the most minor editing. Even worse, the author has this infuriating habit of inserting feeble little jokes at the start of almost every paragraph. It makes for some of the worst writing I have ever encountered.

This is highly recommended for anyone interested in sociolinguistics and nationalism, those studying BCS (i.e. Bosnian-Croatian-Serbian) / Serbo-Croatian and would like some background information on the controversies that have arisen when using the language(s), or for people from the former Yugoslavia who are receptive to outsiders' analysis and willing to go beyond the nationalist preconceptions that they have grown up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Deborah who previously rated product with 5 Stars","review":"I feel just awful that my review of this product probably caused others to have purchased it.What I said before was true, the day I rated it. A pair of nylons holds up better than this product. It makes no sense that a company with so much going for it would choose to lose so much for so little. The styling of all their cookware is so very attractive. This set is no exception. It's beautiful, until you look a little more closely. The non-stick material just doesn't hold up at all. If it's cared for precisely as indicated in the use and care it just comes off. I feared when I read the warranty that they never intended to stand behind it-still, it was so beautiful.

I purchased my set, brought it home from the store, unpacked it and washed it. Noticed the next morning there were already scratches on the red exterior from simple hand washing and setting on the counter. In their information page enclosed in the packaging they recommend storing it with sheet of paper towel in between so that they don't scratch! I've used a set of Revere Ware copper clad cookware for nearly 12 years and it still looks nice. Needless to say, I packed it up and returned it to the store. If it can't handle hand washing, how will it handle cooking? Too bad....I really love the look of this set, and it had *all* the features I was looking for in a cookware set.

I give credit to the designers and people who made the game. Cossacks has gorgeous backgrounds, beautiful buildings, and units, unfortunatly I was disappointed with how it played. The game played very slow and it takes forever to build things. More than anything I was frustrated and recieved no satisfaction from playing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE VERY BAD GAME","review":"Cassocks barly lives up to its expectations. It does not teach you to play.The built in teacher and manual don't teach.Im sure if I knew how to play I would like it,but let's face the facts, it stinks.I may be 10 years old, but I know a good game from a bad one.So it derserves a 1 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a worthy competitor to AoK II","review":"I got Cossacks because I was tired of AoK II and wanted a new game in the RTS genre. I am not impressed. The big advantage that many people cite is that you can have larger armies, up to 8,000 units in the game. Unfortunately, this decision has two negative results: 1) The cannon-fodder mentality, instead of throwing dozens of units at an opponnent, you can now throw hundreds. As an example of how the game caters to this mentality, you can create 5 units in a click by holding down shift. 2) Graphics obviously must suffer as the computer is drawing 10 times as many objects. I'd say stick with AoK II."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be fun...but too much resource management","review":"I bought this game anticipating a very fun and enjoyable experience. How wrong did I turn out to be! This game has great graphics and a wonderful premise but the emphasis is on resource management and that detracts from the game. You have to have resources (food, gold, etc...) to create units but also to MAINTAIN them. So your resources are constantly being drained. The more units you have the faster the resources are drained. The game claims to let you have up to 8,000 units on screen (divided by the # of players) but I can't imagine how bad it would be if you had 500 or so units. The game has wonderful possibilities but this emphasis on resources takes away from what could be an enjoyable game. This game is only for those who have plenty of time (4 or so hours) to spend on a single game. It is too tedious for me to be considered fun. For this reason, I can't recommend this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be great but BUGGY","review":"This game has so much potential, but it is filled with fatal bugs and no patches have yet been announced to fix them. It constantly seizes and freezes, forcing you to reboot your whole system each time so saving often is key. However, in one hour of gaming, it froze 5 times on me, making it hardly an enjoyable experience. It is a shame that it does this, for it looks like it will be better than AOK. Nevertheless, the constant reboots are infuriating and will make me question ever buying a game from this company until I see the patches are out.For those who wonder... I have a 700 Mhz Athlon with the latest 3dFX and 128 Mgs of ram. It is less than year old and is able to easily handle such games as Baldur's Gate II, Deus Ex and Mech Warrior 4. Hence, I can only blame the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome gmae bad draw backs","review":"the game is amazing and i used to play it on my old exp, but when my family upgraded from our 2 XP's to vista home and premium plus a vista compaq laptop, it wouldnt play. every time you try to play it after installation it says that dmcr is not working. i heard you could download differnt patches or change the video directory name to video 1 but i havent really had any success. also do not buy the game that is seven dollars from gogamer because they sll the xplosive company edition which is a company outside the us and the cdv tech support cant help you. the game is great but it has problems with vista and teh xp service pack 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much work equals so much defeat","review":"When I first got this game I thought it would be just like a pre-colonial version of Age of Empires 2. One brutal defeat after another told me one thing: that this game was not nearly as good as AOE2. I consider myself a very good AOE player, (I can beat 4 hard enemys in less than 2 hours) but this is simply an hard. The main reason is that it's simply unrealistic. I build a whole army of soldiers and they get gunned down before they get half way to the enemy town. At the beginning this game can be fun building and gathering. Some of the missions are good also (including combat ones.) But like another reviewer said, \\"This isn't strategy it's a race.\\" And I couldn't agree more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great game .... if it worked.","review":"The demo was great, and so I bought the US version.

I would tell everyone to get this CD. You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent acapella music","review":"I've seen the Alley Cats sing in person and absolutely love their music. One of their signature songs is \\"The Lion Sleeps Tonight\\" - I've not seen anyone who can bring that song to life quite like they do. Many of the classic songs on the CD are favorites by individual preference. I loved \\"Come Go With Me\\" so much that I had it played just after my husband and I were pronounced man and wife. It's a darling love song that is great for celebrating a new beginning. This is simply fun music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not what I expected","review":"This CD is okay. Some tracks are quite good and cachy, such as At The Hop, but others, such as Sh-Boom, really seem to have no intelligeble meaning or beat.

I have read all of his books and thought they were all great. This one was the exception, it was slow paced with little if any action. I know this was an early work. I had read the others before getting back to this one, so I was used to the fast pace action packed novels. Outside of Kirk the characters were bland. I guess i expected a bit more from Baronov and company. I'm just going to forget about this one. I don't think one rotten apple will spoil the bunch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Typical Hagberg!","review":"This book was certainly a letdown from other Hagberg books that I have read in the past.Not even aaltime McGarvey villain Baranov could save this book. There was little or no action in this book. This book consisted of a great deal of dialogue between McGarvey and the other characters. There are little or no action sequences that have been a trademark in other Hagberg books. This definitely must have been one of his first books.He got much better in his later writings. I know why this book is unavaliable for purchaese. It is to boring to read. Buy his other books.

Ken is well on his way to being one of the top B3 artists around with groovin bass lines and some heavy duty footwork on the pedals. The Title track \\"Eternal Funk\\" and \\"The Doctor is In\\" are just too cool for words. Steve on drums is an integral part of the band, always aware of how he is interacting within the music, and Mike on guitar is a talented soloist. While one of the tunes may show its inspirational source a bit, the others more than make up for it. If you are on the North Shore or in Cambridge, check this group out live.

It was designed by idiots. Many of the control buttons have multiple functions. You have to remember which secondary functions each button has, and how many times you have to push it to activate the secondary functions, or how long you have to hold down the buttons to change features. It's completely non-intuitive. I have to review the manual every time I try to use this thing. Even sections of the manual will leave you saying \\"huh?\\" on the first few reads. Then, when you do finally get it turned on and configured and head out on the highway, the ambient noise keeps turning on the voice-activated mic, even at its least sensitive setting.

I bought a pair of these units for a 4 month motorcycle trip in Indochina (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos).As most others have noted, the actual use of functions is awkward, and requires constant reference to the manual to figure out how many times to push each button and for how long.Range was fairly pathetic; I'd say 250 metres was about the best we achieved even with direct line-of-sight.Each day seemed to bring a new idiosyncrasy out of one of the units. Battery life wildly varied with each set of batteries, range seemed to drop to about 10 metres sometimes even with fresh batteries, and frequently the units refused to even switch on or broadcast properly.Eventually we binned them out of sheer frustration, which was a shame since it really was fantastic to be able to communicate when things were (on the very rare occasion) working correctly.Next time I'll invest the money for a decent set that I can get proper usage out of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy sound makes them useless","review":"Got these because they seemed good for the price.

Earplugs would work but there is no set up for this. Without sound, might as well not have this as I could get the same thing from a cheap set of walkie-talkies from WalMart.

The annoyances are that the handle does get hot and the whistle needs to be removed before pouring. The flaws are that if you do not fill the kettle completely before boiling water, the spout gets very hot and when you pour, boiling water spatters all over the place. On one occasion, so much steam had built up as a result of the hot spout, that the lid popped off and burned my hand. Be very careful when you use this kettle and make sure to fill it to the edge of the spout before using."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of the spout . . .","review":"I received the tea kettle as a gift. It is nice looking and the tea pot seems well-made except for the cheap plastic spout. The plastic spout wears out rapidly and eventually the whistle falls out.

So you end up with a $50 stainless steel tea pot compromised by a 25 cent part . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken spout and no response from Chantal","review":"We received this teapot months ago off our wedding registry and were so excited because it is a great design and from a reputable company. But the metal ring on the spout pulls off with the plastic cap so we are pouring boiling water out of a raw metal edge. After calling Chantal's customer service and being told to email photos and doing so, then repeating the call and email after a couple months and no response, it's now six months later and still no response. This is a no longer reputable company in my view.Had same problems as other reviewers with hot handle, hot plastic cap that needs removing with cloth, and boiling water exploding out of spout if it's too hot. Honestly, I could live with all these things, though. It's the broken spout that gets me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought this for its lovely style, and presumed that Eva Zeisel would guard her reputation as an industrial designer. It looks good, and the stainless finish holds up and cleans up beautifully. But, it has major problems. The handle gets too hot to use without a potholder, and in the three years we have had it, the handle began to deform and finally to begin breaking apart. The whistle, which others have mentioned is long gone. More significantly than those defects, however, is the problem mentioned above of the water bursting out of the spout all over the place. That is a design flaw that makes me wonder about Zeisel's concern for functionality. Oh, well, she lasted a very long time. Form counts for a lot in my view, and she did many wonderful looking things. So, I'm moving on to another Eva for my next kettle--Eva Solo. It's gorgeous, I'll let you know how it works.Eva Solo XO Stainless Steel Kettle, 1-1/2-Liter"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic spout ruins otherwise nice kettle","review":"I echo the other comments.

He views life through equally rose-colored glasses, and seeks to encourage us to mend our spiritually deprived Western lives with an infusion of Far Eastern beliefs.His gee-whiz writing betrays a considerable lack of depth and a profound belief in his abilities as a spiritual leader. \\"In writing this book, I have stripped away more than two thousand years of material that has clouded the original wisdom of the great thinkers of Asia,\\" he proclaims.

Until I discovered the word I honestly didn't know that there were so many other souls that find loving and being sexually intimate with more than one person simulateously a natural occurance, and I struggled constantly with feelings of guilt and confusion. Mystic's take on polyamory from a spiritual perspective is right on target for my own experiences, but the book did not really help me learn anything that I didn't already know or feel. If you're looking for a book to educate you about polyamory, this isn't the book.

The \\"tricks\\" themselves aren't that spectacular: women and men may be uncomfortable watching them, but for very different reasons. The guys themselves are nothing special to look at and their equipment, apart from its (hmmm) elasticity, is nothing remarkable either. For a commercial release, the stage show video is poorly filmed and directed. The picture is subpar, the music is annoying jokey and the direction usually cuts to the audience before it shows you the dick trick everyone's laughing at uproariously. Slightly more interesting, but only slightly, is an added documentary on how the show was put together and the casting for a replacement company."},{"rating":"1","title":"puppets suffer from boredom","review":"Although some of the gags are kind of cute, overall the film lacks a decent patter.

There's a nice focus on the effect of GG Allin, and would have worked well as a documentary about those around him (band and fans), but this film offers you little on GG Allin himself, though it seems to want to make him its focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for imagination and creativity","review":"My 4 yr. old son got this for his birthday.

He was giggling while he's doing it and he stuck his face deeper telling me it's what I should do to make it work. Well his conclusion is, if you stick your face so much deeper, you could burn your nose.I'd give it credit maybe for sinus...but then again, I can't even be sure since I don't have that condition.

This inexpensive steamer worked pretty well for about six months. The receptacle for water was quite small and I didn't feel like the steam was dispensing at as wide a range as I would like. It took a long time to heat up and the steam wasn't all that hot.

I found that the chin/mouth area got extremely hot for a few seconds and when it became unbearable I moved my face. It does do its job for sure which is to open your pores.

What I received instead was model number FM3C. This difference is critical. The handheld microdermabrasion unit I received (model FM3C) mounts attachments about a quarter of an inch away from the base; it feels wobbly when applied to my skin. The MDF2R microdermabrasion unit appears to be longer, which would be a better fit for my hand and presumably easier to control. The MDF2R attachments in the photograph appear to be mounted in a flush fashion and probably spin with more stability. I'm thoroughly disappointed with the FM3C.

The result of using this facial sauna was my face being un-evenly steamed - well on my nose, between my eyes, and on my cheeks (closest to my nose), but crap everywhere else. Much like another user pointed out, you have to tilt your head different directions to steam other parts of your face. No fun when you are trying to relax. And while you are tilting, the pores are closing on the parts of your face that are turned away from the steam. Pretty useless.I also tried Revlon's Facial Sauna, and found the same thing. Does anyone know of a good facial sauna that has a face piece that allows your whole face to get steam??!Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"I am not happy with these products. The steamer doesn't create enough steam for a facial, even with holding a towel over my head. I can hear & see the water bubbling and can't help but wonder if it's going to bubble boiling water onto my face. The facial scrubber it comes with is a peice of crap as well.

My favorite is the band peoplemover, with thier intense, radiohead-like sound. The surprise on the CD is the band Lady Mayhem, with thier off-the wall romanticsim. Deep Mosey and trespassers william deliver exceptional and emotional peices in the same vien as the Lilith Fair artists. Highly reccomended to those looking for some new talent.

Less than a year later, she showed me that the strap is coming off. I tried contacting Timex about this but got no response. In regular use of her active lifestyle the watch didn't last long. It's too bad because all other designs of sporty Timex watches that I've had before are much more durable.So yes, it's a nice watch, but don't expect it to last.

If I mistakenly press \\"Start\\" too early, I have no idea how to reset it quickly and start it again, so the whole workout is a complete blank. At first I thought being able to set more than one interval timer was a great idea, but it took so long (and would be impossible to do in the dark, as is pretty much everything else) that I am committed to 3 mins., 1 min. intervals and would never be able to change it at my speedwork class when presented with a different workout!

NO Band Available.I know because I have 5 watches (so obviously I liked the watch mechanism) - At first I thought it was just a fluke that the wristbands broke.

I wear a watch like this all the time, so I may wear it more than some of you might, but I am going to try and find another watch now as Timex doesn't warranty their poor band design.

But . . . after a few months, one of the plastic pads on the main function button fell off, leaving the metal pin underneath exposed, but still working.After a few more months, all 4 pads fell off, leaving 4 exposed pins that would catch on everything and gave me a few nasty scratches. When the battery died, I took the watch to a watch shop to have the battery replaced. Since I swim, I wanted a knowledgeable person to replace the battery to keep the watch waterproof. Well, after the seal was broken, all the functions stopped working, audible alarms, stopwatch, timer, and light. Only the time still functioned. Then I took a trip to a river with my family. Even though I wasn't submerged, just playing in the water, the face developed condensation and the next day everything died.

The first one was still going strong after 12 years of moderate use before it was stolen. It is annoying that there is no tool case with this saw. I purchased a steel Milwaukee worm drive saw case, which works well, but it is another $55. I have also used Skill worm drive saws and I prefer the feel of the Makita. It has plenty of power and will cut through anything as long as the blade is reasonably sharp and not pinched/binded in the kerf. Both saws (and all worm/hypoid saws) are heavy and thus not easy to use in awkward positions (overhead, sideways, etc.)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey Stickiness","review":"The glue seems decent enough (as far as I can tell).

It was my privilege to interview Kristy Starling for an upcoming show... Kristy impressed me with her deep thoughts, her caring heart and her music talent. Her current top twenty hit, \\"Water\\" is worth the price of the CD by itself. My other favorite cuts from the CD include the upbeat \\"All For You\\" and the tender \\"I Need You.\\" This CD is full of songs of inspiration, uplifting and encouragement. This project will garner Kristy a nomination at next year's Dove Awards for New Artist of the Year.

And this CD is one of the BEST that I've heard in awhile. I saw her on the Today Show and I was impressed by her and when her CD came out, I couldn't wait to get it. My favorite track is \\"Broken\\" but I love the CD from beginning to end. Her voice is so rich and crystal clear. And the range that she has---it's unbelievable! I listen to mainly Christian music and it's hard to find vocalists that have the talent that she does as well as songs that show the depth of her relationship with Christ. You will not be disappointed by this CD. It's worth every penny and you will be blessed by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Effort","review":"Kristy has a wonderful and rich voice. She sings with passion and conviction. The one hesitation I would voice is that too many of her songs are trite and devoid of deep meaning, i.e. too much bubble gum lyrics. The one notable exception is the wonderfully moving ballad entitled \\"Broken.\\" You have got to hear that song. It is a song about trusting God in one's moments of deepest despair. Look for that song to be nominated for song of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"EVERY song....","review":"Each and every song on this CD is absolutely beautiful!

This is one of the best debut cd's from any artist that i've heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure that this is a Christian album","review":"This was disappointing for me - the lyrics are watery to the point that it's only possible to use this as light background music.Can you believe that the name Jesus is not mentioned even once in any of the songs? Neither is the cross for that matter. Muslims and Hindus can doubtless listen to this without fear of being offended.There is no question of Kristy's talent - she has a wonderful voice, and the arrangements are good, but the message is nearly non-existent. This is essentially inspirational chewing gum; there is flavour, but no significant nutrients.That said, considering how dangerous much of today's music is, this is not bad as a \\"pop\\" replacement for families concerned about what their younger members listen to.I'd suggest Jamie Jamgochian, Charlie Hall, Vicky Beeching and Kara Williamson as alternatives with a good blend of message and music quality. These performers leave zero doubt who their God is.Sorry Kristy, try again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new artist!","review":"She has such a wonderful and refreshing pop voice! Her single \\"Water\\" is so beautiful. You should all check out this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What could be better","review":"Personally, I am a hip-hop head, but there was something about this CD that really caught my interest.

But my main comlaint is with the vampire and the heroine who I did not like or enjoy reading about. He was too cavalier, distant, uptight and she was too annoying with her prudish, bookish, rather stilted attitude. I also disliked the tedious descriptions that went on and on. I really had trouble finishing this book, because none of the characters rang true or even fantastic, either would have worked for me. By the style of the cover you might think this book is humorous, but alas that angle doesn't work either. Some might find the characters funny, but I just found them ridiculous. Any humor was tasteless and at the expense of the characters. I could have cared less if Emily and Val got together. They seemed so disconnected and distant and their passions so weak and dimwitted, no pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah, Blah, Blah","review":"Like other reviewers I had a very hard time getting through this book. The Author gave both too much information and not enough. She would describe the placement of a lamp on a table but not the passage of time. Suddenly characters would be in a new locale, which was expounded upon, but gave little reason or lead up as to how they got there.Also frustrating was the use of accented writing. A little bit of native speech is fine to flavor the writing but the Author went overboard. It got to the point where I had absolutely no idea what was being said.I am glad to see more and more Paranormal Romances being written, but not in this sloppy fashion. Do not pay full price for this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fashonistas deluded down on the family farm","review":"Perfect for hanging out at Starbucks, acting condescending towards the poor working stiffs down on the farm, and the best part, you don't have to get your hands dirty!

It not then I got ripped off. I have worn Iron Man watches for most of my life. The is the first one that I didn't beat into submission. It apparently croaked on its own.

I use it to time my work-outs, and running.I've only used it briefly, and when I picked it up, one side of the band just fell off!It's a tight fit to get it back on, and the watch case appears to be some plastic material. Can't get the pin holding the band back in, and I just keep scratching the case.Ended up buying a nylon strap band for $8, and that works fine.

These watches normally will last 3 or 4 years, so I probably just got a lemon. I would like to return it because it's still under warranty, but the return policy for this is not worth the trouble. They may or may not replace it or fix it, and you'll have to send them $7 with the watch just to see what happens.

I was very pleasantly surprised.What you get from this Swedish duo, is fabulous sunny pop, wry humour and a bucket load of instantly catchy melodies. There really is not a duff track on the album. I guess you'd have to place this in the 'indie ghetto' but I wish so-called main stream pop could be this effortlessly enjoyable.Go on take a gamble, like I did. If you like your music with some rough edges left unpolished, and full of joyous melodic sunshine, I don't think you'll regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An encyclopedia","review":"This book is really dense, and not recommended for the first encounter with Lie algebras.

Murray Abraham stole an Oscar away from Tom Hulce for AMADEUS and hasn't done anything worthwhile since. Prime example is the horrifyingly bad dud, THE THIRD SOLUTION. Incredibly slow and amazingly confusing, the script is so disjointed that even when you've finished the movie, you're not sure what the whole thing was about. Suffice to say involves some kind of secret organization trying to stifle the Pope's visit to Moscow. But that's just the only thing I could figure out. Who are the heroes and who are the villains is up in the air. Treat Williams, who can be very good (Prince of the City) is awful in this role; Danny Aiello (Goodfellas) is likewise terrible; in fact, the whole cast bites the big one.Don't waste your time on this early Thanksgiving turkey!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I need room to breathe after listening to this album :(","review":"Hmmm I like Reba, so I got this album.

I really believe she should REALLY go back to her roots and revitalize the \\"traditional\\" country music movement again. She could do it too! I can pick up a CD of Martina McBride's, Faith Hill or Shania Twain and find the same sounding stuff on theirs as what is on here."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD DOES NOT LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS","review":"REBA should have allowed herself some more room to breathe. I tried very hard to like this CD but I just couldn't. The CD is a mixture of pop sounding tunes with one real country song on it. McEntire isn't winning many raves from this CD. She has done a lot better in the past. I'm giving up on country music because when stars like McEntire compromise themselves just to do what sells to the masses, that tells me there is no integrity in that individual. I agree with the review below that success changed one who was once a humble, country girl before she \\"went hollywood\\" and decided that she was the best country singer and actress on the planet. Not! This is the last CD of hers I'll ever buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster CD; Typical Country Pop","review":"If you like today's make believe country then this is the CD for you.

This CD was touted as Reba's return from a recording hiatus and that she was going back to recording traditional country. I either bought the wrong CD or I was misled. I didn't enjoy this at all and I wish I could return it and get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG, BIG DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"Eagerly anticipating the release of this CD, Reba's first release in a number of years (she's too busy playing pretend in Hollywood) I rushed out to buy it on the day of its release. I played it and I was so heartsick it almost made me sick. What a disappointment. She has done so much better in the past. To recover, I had to get out some of her earlier CDs and play them to try to forget about the big, big disappointment I had when I heard her latest."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 songs of traditional country are not worth it if the rest is fluff!","review":"This CD is mostly fluff. Even the traditional sounding tunes don't have the substance and are not produced the way traditional country tunes are supposed to be.

I give this one D-."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT GETS WORSE WITH EACH LISTEN","review":"As quite a number of reviewers here have noted, I bought this CD with great anticipation only to be thoroughly disappointed. This CD has very little credence and is definitely not one of McEntire's more creative efforts. Her talent is wasted. I thought that it would get better as most music does, the more it is played. Well, I've listened and listened to it but just the opposite is true with this. It does NOT get better. It gets worse. A disappointed listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA NEEDS TO TRY SOMETHING NEW!!","review":"Lets face it. All her CDs sound alike. There is nothing new here that she has not attempted before in better projects.

THANK YOU REBA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD IS NOT THE REBA I GREW TO LOVE !","review":"This CD is just more of Reba McEntire's attempt to appeal to the masses that buy music today.

The songs are pretty much the same sounding and I think its time Reba tried something new because there is nothing new or fresh in this collection. She has done this before and has done it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kathryn's Room To Breathe Review","review":"Reba has definitely out done herself this time. Room to Breathe is the best album in my collection of Reba albums. With slow sad songs that make you think like Secret and He Gets That From Me to the fast up beat songs like Love Revivaland Sister. She really gets into the mood of the song with her voice and takes the listener to a whole new level of feelings.If I had to rate this album I would rate it 6 out of 5 stars. This album has meant so much to me, being a single mother going to school, that I can always count on Reba to make me feel good when I am down. It is wonderful to know that Reba's music will forever be around.~Kathryn Walker"},{"rating":"1","title":"BYPASS PLEASE!","review":"If I were you, I'd skip this one folks.

What is inside is simply more of the formulaic, pop wannabe sounds that McEntire has been recording since 1988. The CD cover shows a very unflattering picture of Reba and the photographer should be sued!! But the music inside the CD isn't much better unless you are truly a REBA fan and like what is represented as today's \\"country\\" music, which is not country!! This is for die hard Reba fans only and if you're looking for older Reba stuff check out \\"My Kind of Country\\", \\"Have I Got a Deal For You\\" or the outstanding \\"Unlimited\\" CD from her \\"Mercury\\" years! Those are vintage Reba. \\"Room to Breathe\\" is mediocre Reba."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Reba!","review":"This album is beautiful and full of soul. The songs all tell a story of pain, love, and friendship. I have always been a Reba fan, but don't own every album so I can't say if this is the best or not.

I am sure they knew about it before they sold it to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVERYTHING IS STILL THE SAME","review":"This is the same formulaic pop stuff Reba has continued to record for years now. The song \\"Moving Oleta\\" is almost a carbon copy of \\"All Dressed Up and Nowhere to Go\\" from her \\"For My Broken Heart\\" album. I'm Gonna Climb That Mountain is exactly like \\"Climb that Mountain Higher\\" from her \\"Rumor Has It Album. \\"Somebody\\" is along the lines of \\"How Was I to KNow\\"and \\"What if Its You\\" from the album of the same title. The rest are similar to the things she has always done. I have heard worse from her but also better. She's so wrapped up in the HOllywood scene to make adequate differentiation in her music. Bland stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTHING NEW HERE!","review":"I hate to say this but after listening to this CD several times, I've have found it more and more boring with each listen. Reba adds nothing new here...nothing that she hasn't covered in the past. None of the songs here, with the possible exception of \\"Moving Oleta\\" will garner \\"classic\\" status in my opinion. No song of the year candidates in this bunch. Reba has done way better in the past. Even the bluegrass country tunes lack substance because Reba is just not able to pass them off convincingly. It almost sounds as if she's being forced to do them. I'm talking about \\"I'm Gonna Climb that Mountain\\" and \\"Sky Full of Angels\\". The ballads are o.k. (Room to Breathe, If I Had Any Sense Left at All, Once You've Learned to Be Lonely\\") but Reba offers nothing new here on them that you haven't heard before. Most of the stuff is just like the stuff she always puts out....a mixture of country/pop tunes with a severence emphasis on crossover.

I dont know what is missing with this album, it just doesnt seem like the Reba I have always known and loved."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Queen of Country Music","review":"I love this new CD. I like how she mixes sad songs and fast songs on this album so you get a variety. There was a few songs in which she talks fast in parts of the song instead of singing. This is new for Reba's music and I don't like it as much, but the other songs on the album make it a wonderful addition to your Reba collection. Her voice sounds more clear than it has in her last few albums. I was happy to see that Vince Gill was a part of the album again. There voices match good together. I would highly recommend this album to every Reba fan. If you buy it, you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW ABOUT A BREATH OF FRESH AIR???","review":"I'm willing to give McEntire the benefit of the doubt in most cases but I sure needed a breath of fresh air after listening to this twaddle!!

Its just an ordinary country/pop collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO PAR","review":"First the good songs: \\"Moving Oleta\\" as others have singled out is a standout. I also like \\"Room to Breathe\\" but its melody is almost identical to that of \\"Moving Oleta\\". Only the lyrics are different. I don't like the bluegrass stuff mostly because its too overdone. \\"Love REvival\\" is terrible. \\"My SIster is o.k....the lyric is great but its just too contemporary. \\"If I Had Any Sense Left At All\\", \\"Once You've Learned to Be Lonely\\" and \\"He Gets that From Me\\" are all similar in tempo and sometimes melody. \\"Secret\\" is crossover stuff that doesn't do a thing for me. If you get this CD get it for one song...\\"Moving Oleta\\". Otherwise this is another one to pass by. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"REBA IS CAPABLE OF BETTER!!","review":"In retrospect, this CD of Reba's where she incorporates all styles of her music (according to her) is a statement that is subject to conjecture? I remember her recording of country waltzes and shuffle tunes which yielded some of her biggest hits: \\"I'M Not That Lonely Yet\\", \\"You're the First Time I've THought About Leaving\\", \\"Have I Got a Deal for You\\"....so why aren't any of these styles on here? We've got plenty of her pop sounding tunes......and maybe one traditional sounding tune but it certainly wouldn't be something you could dance to! The ballads sound alike. No, Reba is capable of a lot better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointment!","review":"When I read in TV guide a couple of weeks ago that Reba was returning to her roots (meaning recording real country...not the mish/mash hodge podge that makes her sound like everyone else out there...) I rushed right out to buy this CD when it was released. I should have known better just by looking at the cover. Reba McEntire may sound country when she talks but the songs she picks to sing tell another story. Reba was born to sing 'traditional' country!! Aside from \\"Gonna Climb that Mountain\\" which is great, the rest of the CD is a disappointment! Reba tries to outdo herself but in so doing let's herself and us down. Just like her television show. Reba cannot act, and as is evidenced by this CD...she cannot sing...at least like she used to...a long time ago when she was 'real' country before she sold out to do as she herself put it...'what sells'. What a shame. I should have known better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THERE IS ONLY ONE COUNTRY QUEEN AND ITS NOT REBA!!!","review":"I am sick of reading reviews calling Reba the Queen of Country Music. Anyone who knows anything about country music knows that there is only ONE QUEEN and that person is Kitty Wells. Reba herself will attest to that...if her ego lets her.As for this CD, I hadn't bought a REBA CD since the disastrous \\"Rumor Has It\\" years ago. I thought I'd give her another chance after reading some of these reviews. Wrong. The CD contains only one true bona-fide country tune but the rest is no different than the 'awful' country music of today.But that's o.k. Everyone has different tastes. But quit calling Reba the \\"Queen\\". She will never compare with Kitty, Loretta, Tammy or the best female singer ever to rock this planet.....\\"Patsy Cline\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST ALBUM OF THE YEAR","review":"This is the WORST album from Reba ever. The songs are drab and dopey. The album is depressing and has NO flavor. I have every Reba album ever released and have seen her in concert 96 times. I know her potential as an artist and she has totally missed her mark. Perhaps she's so busy finding her mark in Hollywood that she's forgotten her grass roots self in the studio with country music. She's notorious for cute, sassy, fun, hip songs, none of which appear in this album. If you're looking to be incredibly bored then this is the album for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Conair Gel/Lather Machine - HGL 1","review":"I TRIED TO LOAD A CAN OF GILLETTE FUSION GEL INTO THE MACHINE.

This release is a little more direct than the \\"Give Them Rope\\" Cd, while still showing traces of the experimental bent that would flower on the \\"Functioning on Impatience\\" EP. \\"Simulcast\\" is a stand-out, a relentless mid-tempo onslaught with pounding drumming, noisy guitars and intense vocals. The version of this release on Second Nature records also includes \\"A Safe Place\\" and \\"Blend as Well\\" from the Edison Recordings 7\\". The latter song is a particularly nasty piece of AmRep-inspired metal-core. Well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs some work","review":"Overall, Liber des Ghouls fails to meet par with other MET books. It is riddled with errors ranging from typos and bad editing to out right contradictions from one chapter to the next. It is very, very short, with almost no new information at all.

The antenna also is not very good and gets very poor reception with many drop outs. I replaced it with a stanadrad sirius micro dot antenna and the reception improved greatly. I also swapped this docking station with the one in my car since i am not worried about the raiod flying off in my car. IMHO save your money and buy a sirius radio with car kit and then purchase an after market gadget mount to mount it on your bike. You will get a better docking station and antenna and the after market mounts are better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Antenna sucks","review":"You will have to buy a different satellite antenna if you buy this kit. I could never get more than 2/3 signal and the signal I could get cuts in and out a lot. The radio works fine in the other applications I use it for. This may be due to the fact that the radio mount obstruct the antenna on the mount the give you.

Flava proves to be the premier hype man; he's the juice, boyee. Plus, the remake of Bring tha Noize with Anthrax rocks!Apocalypse 91 is the top PE album in a string of three very classic releases.

What does this have to do with the book? Nothing, except that it is one of the texts we are reading. I found Dr. Lotchin's book to be informative at best, and cluttered, poorly written/edited, and uninteresting at worst. While the history of San Francisco and its rapid growth are astonishing and fascinating, Lotchin's rendering of the city's life from 1848-1856 is something short of spectacular. Most of the problems I have found with the text--including copious grammatical errors which create hard to read passages--could have been remedied with a better editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great history of a great city","review":"I was once a student of Roger Lotchin's; I took his classes on the history of the American West and the history of American Urbanization, and in one of those classes we read this book.

It did not really put me on the edge of my seat or anything. I did not feel any suspense because I felt like the writing was too simple, and I found a few mistakes in grammar, which should have been caught before being published. I expected better after reading \\"The Skinjacker Trilogy\\" by Neal Shusterman. However, the story is not what really bothered me; it was the price. $8.99 for a mere 180 pages and for a story that does not really WOW you at any point. I think it is over priced by at least $5. An okay read if you want to waste 2-3 hours because that is all it takes to read the whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"MP3","review":"It is great for making MP3s ... the only problem is that it only allows one to make 20 MP3s before it asks you to go to their web site to buy an unlimited MP3 maker plug-in for the program. At the MP3 site, you have to give all of your information, including credit card number, before you find out what you are paying for the plug-in. Also, I think that they will release your private data to others, or at least that is the way that it appears. It does, however, restore older music very well ... but is it really worth the additional unknown cost when there are other similar products available that are complete when you buy them? I avoided buying the MP3 plug-in come-on and use other programs where the consumer is not duped into thinking he bought a complete product, only to find out that what he bought was not what he thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good intention, but...","review":"This software has some very nice features, easy recording and cleaning of the digital files, everything appears to work great -- until I tried to burn a CD.

We find ourselves singing \\"I'm just a tiny mosquito\\" all the time which is the kids favorite. Madsen's lyrics are hilarious for the ault listeners, and inventive and comical for children. He is like the Jim Carey of children's music. Some songs are making fun of opera, others jazz, still others are wistful. He should win some award for this one. A must if you have to have children's music! And guess what, you can throw away all those other dreadful tapes away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Digital Camera","review":"While camera brands such as Canon, and Nikon, get most of the media play, Panasonic also has an excellent line up of top grade cameras.

The body utilizes Panasonics world leading stabilization system as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic DMC-FZ50","review":"Great Camera, Easy to use without a confusing array of buttons. If you are familiar with a manual focus or zoom SLR's you will find this camera easy to use and to like. The focus and exposure setting can be manually changed by twisting the rings on the lens barrel. I found this much easier to do quickly as opposed to using push buttons as found on other non DSLR cameras.The flash was much better than expected and produces very acceptable pictures under average household lighting. I was also surprised with the quality of the nonflash pictures I took indoor at a family gathering and at a no flash allowed volleyball game.The surface texture ,shape and balance of this camera gave it a surehanded feel or natural grip. Unlike other ( smoothed and rounded) cameras I never felt the need to worry about keeping a secure handhold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for a great price.","review":"Everyone seems to be shocked when I say I bought a Panasonic camera.

I really like the camera a lot and i rate it A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow- VERY impressed!","review":"I just received this camera as a gift.I love the idiot-proof menu.The instruction guide was actually readable.It feels like a film SLR, and the size is perfect for smaller hands (my boyfriend finds the buttons and controls a bit too cramped).Image quality is great, though I've not used it in a wide variety of settings (yet).Another feature which I LOVE about this camera is the flip screen. This appears to be the most \\"advanced\\" digital camera with this feature. As an artist and model, I shoot myself alot. The flexible flip-screen allows me to get odd angles and self portraits.My only complaint is that the auto-release is a maximum of 10 seconds (making complex self-portaits difficult). I got the remote shutter accessory, so hopefully this won't pose too much of a challenge in my self-portraiture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So far...","review":"I've had the camera for 5 days now.It's worked perfectly. The zoom is something really impressive, the definition on the pictures with 10.1MP it's just outstanding.it's a great camera and really easy to use.So far the only thing i've disliked is the flash. Will review some more later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Ado About Nothing (Noise Levels)","review":"If you read the various reviews of the DMC-FZ50 on the 'Net, you will see many remarks about the high noise level of the Panasonic sensor at high ISO settings. The same reviewers will post sample photographs for your perusal -- pay close attention to them. First, on many of them the noise is not objectionable at all. Second, they are JPEGs produced by the Venus III engine. Yet, this superlative camera can produce RAW images. With the SilkyPix software included with the camera kit, you can bypass the Venus III noise reduction (RAW images do not use the camera's noise reduction circuitry). The SilkyPix noise reduction software (or that available in Adobe RAW Capture) is superior to the Venus III, and will produce final images that equal those produced by the Canon Rebel XTi or the Nikon D80.With the debate over noise levels now moot, I challenge anyone to find a comparable camera with similar features at ANY price that can best the DMC-FZ50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Canon Rebel XS or XSi","review":"Quick Review. This is for the intro photographer to RAW and Manual Settings. Why? Cause you dont have to give up the big zoom of other panasonic cameras (this is 12x-21x depending on resolution). Also, this one has RAW capabilities, and a free RAW editor (wiki it if you dont know what it is, its amazing). Also, the Video with zoom and sound, make this a HD widescreen camcorder (800x450 pixels).Canon Rebel, yeah, its $700, and yeah, its another $200-300 for lenses, which already puts it double the price of this.You think these pics arent as amazing, check out my customer images."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic camera","review":"A great camera.

It is a definite winner and a massive upgrade for me. The pictures are sharp, the camera feels great in the hand, full manual controls are wonderful and it packs more in a small package than you can likely get anywhere else. My only gripe is that they REDUCED the frame rate from the previous two releases of the high-end FZ series. I'm sure there's a good reason but for me it makes no sense. I think it's max speed now is 1-2 frames per second. Other than that though, I seriously can't imagine a better camera for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after less than 2 months :(","review":"This camera went dead on me less than two monts light use. Sent to Panasonic Service Center last August 22nd(received there) and until now(Sept 7th) they are still waiting for the part from Japan being shipped by boat!! I can not believe that Panasonic does not have this critical part in stock. Be very careful with this camera. At any rate, i was not also really totally satisfied with the quality of the pictures due to its over-bearing noise reduction system. I will just be happy if they can not be repaired as promised and just give me a refund. I think this will be my 2nd and last Panasonic camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Camera for many Purposes","review":"The FZ-50 is an amazing camera, the use is quite intuitive and the functions/programs really do well. The lens is superior. At high speeds the pictures get a lot less noisy than I have seen it in other cameras. Due to the stabilization I took picture in dark setting with lower isos and got very good results.I totally recommend this camera. There is no flaw that I would know of after about 2.5 months of extensive use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bridge Camera In The Market","review":"I have it for 1 year now, and it is a awesome camera. If you forget the lens is attached to it, then it is as good as a DSLR. And the lens is may be better than the most of bridge cameras in the market!. A very good semi-professional camera, you will definitely get the feel of a DSLR. I really like the fact that the zoom is manual and there is manual focus too, which you will not get in most of the bridge cameras out there. Its big, but if you want a lens system like this, camera will be big! It is very easy to handle and has a very user friendly system. I like its system more than the canon ones. The battery life is decent!As a whole, it is a very nice camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Camera","review":"So far I have had no complaints with this camera. It gives me all the manual options I like to have. I love the way it recycles so quickly so I am ready to take another picture. Somtimes the camera is out of focus and I can't quite figure out the problem. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. I'm sure it's a setting that I'm not quite of. With all the options, I sometimes forget what setting I have it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but not as great as a DSLR","review":"This is a wonderful camera if you want a light weight, walk around camera that has a huge zoom range. However, for the same price of this camera you can also get a low end DSLR that will have better picture quality and the ability to switch lenses. There is a great deal of noise, especially at the higher ISOs with this Panasonic. With DSLR, depending on which you purchase, there is definitely less noise. Also this camera will take filters, which is huge because it allows you to be even more creative just like with DSLRs. It really comes down to if you want a point and click, or a camera that will allow you to continuesly grow with it in photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to Perfect","review":"I bought this camera used. I had a few 12X cameras, I will be happy with this camera for a long time. It is a work of art to hold and use. I got use to the manual zoom pretty fast. The image quality is excellent. I hear about noise and noise reduction. I can see it, but only at full size on a large lcd monitor. Pixel peepers may see flaws, but in the real world, images from this camera make excellent 11X14 prints, maybe even larger. Colors are accurate, and images are sharp, and performance is pretty fast. It is a beast to carry around, like a family size can of beans around your neck. Still lighter than a SLR with equiv zoom.The bottom line, this is the best you can get (in my opinion) in a 12X zoom or more, digital camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just love my DMC FZ50","review":"This is just a great product.

My husbands $1000 Nikon with nice lens takes better pics for just a little more. I got my stolen and was coming back to see if I could pic one up cheaper because it is an old model.

As a child growing up in a Baptist church, I heard most of these songs almost every Sunday..but I never really HEARD the words until I became an adult. Listening to Donnie sing them not only took me back but it gave me a deeper apprecation of the meaning behind each hymn, psalm and spiritual song.There are so many great gospel singers out there, but very few are truly anointed and spirit-filled, Donnie is one of them. He makes you feel each song and you know that God is present.

I enjoyed it tremendously. Donnie's voice cannot be matched to any other singer's voice. His voice is so anointed until tears just automatically flowed from my eyes and chills moved up and down my body as I listened to all of that anointing caught up in those hymns, Psalms, and Spiritual songs. This CD brought to my memory many hymns that I had almost forgotten because many of these hymns are not sung in many of our churches today. This CD is a \\"Must-Have\\" for all of God's people. It is a keepsake for me and I hold it as more valuable than gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Donnie McClurkin Taking It Back!","review":"This DVD was awesome!

But to be fair no one really writes well about the sex games and the company's don't give too much info away. I didn't like this game because it has too much to do and not enough intimacy.

Another thing I would like to say about the series is that it is a bad influnce. I read swear words and encountered a so-called popular girl smoking her self to death in which it says nothing about how bad it is for your health. I'm very sure 7 year olds have a better knowledge on the causes than smoking than the author does. And please, spare me, but kids in Jr. High do not act like this.

The day my order arrived in the mail, I sat down to start reading and I did not get up until the book was done. Peter Watts does a great job here of setting up a believable group of misfits, biologically enhanced so they can survive underwater and at great depths. Through some trial-and-error, it is discovered that only those who have some sort of mental imbalance can survive in such a hostile atmosphere. Coupled with the marvelous descriptions of the weird and grotesque life forms which thrive in the deep, this novel really creates a grim, believable portrait of the world. About the only drawback I noted was the conclusion, which, ironically, one of the other reviewers holds up as the book's high point. I'm looking forward to more thoughtful science fiction from Mr. Watts."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"It's All Bad\\"","review":"A group of people who are mentally unstable are placed deep under water by an energy company for a special project.

I told one of our members after reading it that it was a perfect example of why book clubs are good. I would not have otherwise read it and I enjoyed it very much.

It describes that strange feeling, sooth, loneliness, and dread to you the way you always try to describe it to yourself. You also realize you might be more deranged or freaky then you think you are. While you read it, play Sarah Mclachlan's Possession, as sugguested my Watts. I tried it; boy, there was something. I suggest that you play something from Portishead as you read this novel.

The place where the neoprene joins with the strap is very bulky and hit me right on the collar bone.

The only trouble is that with this strap the ends are too thick to fit through the lugs on my Canon 30D. I tried using a screw driver to push them through and needle-nose pliers to pull them through, but they are just too thick. The lugs on my 30D are pretty standard, so I'm guessing that my strap came from a bad batch.

I think that Emma Thompson did a wonderful job and the that she was the best person to play Nanny McPhee. This movie is for kids but I think some adults may like the movie.It is about a woman who comes in to take care of some naughty children who's father is a single parent.

I read the books first, which weren't easy to track down (I had to use Interlibrary Loans to find and get them). The books were atrocious to say the least. It was not difficult to reason why they were out of print and almost impossible to find. Why Emma Thompson would pick them to make into films is unfathomable.

What could have been a frothy confection of a movie is pulled together into a lovely fairy tale by Thompson's and the director's attention to detail: the use of color, Nanny McPhee's increasing beauty, the children's distinct personalities, etc. Thompson, Colin Firth, Kelly MacDonald (Evangeline), and Angela Lansbury (Aunt Adelaide) give touching and hilarious performances. Not the best movie of the year, of course, but certainly a brilliant little story worth a rental and perhaps a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nanny McPhee","review":"While the movie does not even resemble the books 'Nurse Matilda', it is still enchanting.

When my son was smaller and in the infant seat it covered the infant seat and most of the stroller. Now that my little one is out of the infant seat, it works even better for the times when you have to leave the house but the rain is really bad. It is INCREDIBLY quick to just throw on in a parking lot. It's not that expensive, and to me it has served super handy. Would totally recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Sturdy","review":"This rain hood is a great concept but the cheap plastic tears easily with normal use.

Only song that really catches my ear is \\"Still in Love Song\\".. looks like it was the only song recorded at a different studio, it definitely has a more progressive (maybe that the wrong word) sound to it, and the mix is way better too. The rest of the mixes have way too much ear bleeding top end, back off the treble guys, it doesn't make your music sound exciting. Most of the other songs are rather generic. I'd classify it in the not too many chords school of guitar rock /w uninteresting vocals.. same tempo, same chords, uninteresting lyrics.. don't even think to compare them to Radiohead, argh.. that person should be flogged."},{"rating":"2","title":"-","review":"The Stills tried to stay as far away as possible from modern pop music but at times were a little too close for comfort. A lot of the songs sounded very similar to each other and some didn't flow very smoothly from the begining of the song to the end. Overall the cd was passionate and displayed strong ingenuity throughout. Tracks 2, 3, 5, 10, and 12 were, I think, the best by far. Deffinately worth a look but I'll wait to pass my final judgment on the Stills until their next album release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dissecting The Sound","review":"The Stills - Logic Will Break Your HeartIt's hard to find words for a release this fresh and intelligent, let's just say this is absolutely essential, and meant for those who wish to embrace both beauty and sadness. Welcome to the sound of the \\"new\\" New Romantics. Hailing from Montreal, this four-piece takes the Smith-fronted guitar approach, and apply all the necessary dark-romance, to make a beautifully lush album. Their morose and alienated sound owes more to New York, their new home, than to their Canadian hometown. \\"Love and Death,\\" \\"Still in Love Song,\\" and \\"Changes are no Good,\\" made my iPOD's Top Rated Playlist after only one listen - three great songs in one album, is quite unheard of now days. This strangely-familiar sound has a way to crawl inside your heart; and its soppy, emotional disgust, allows the listener an avenue to air out their sorrows. This is music used as an escape."},{"rating":"2","title":"and if the first song doesn't get you ...","review":"I'll have to nominate \\"Lola Stars and Stripes\\" as one of the best first song.

Great Canadian album from both Montreal ... both The Stills and Vice Recordings ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"This album is alright, it's got a lot of potential in the band. Lola Stars and Stripes is worth it, for its sincere melancholy and atmosphere but the rest of the songs are a bit bland and blend into each other. A few stand out, and a few don't. Standard rock music in this age fare, you won't miss too much if you don't get it but once again, Lola Stars and Stripes is a nifty song. IT seems that they seem to lack inspiration for some of their songs, although this is certainly a lot better than many of the things coming out. If you have some money to spare and like their peer bands, buy it but don't expect them to sound exactly like Interpol/new Interpol band because they don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Retro Hybrid","review":"The Stills. What can be said? Like Kurt, i think many are far too quick to put them into the Interpol category. Yes, the retroactive New Wave vibe is definitely there (with excellent bass lines, and artificial as well as lo-fi/loose drum lines), but these guys have built a far superior guitar foundation. With reverberated, off time, and often times puzzling with major/minor combinations, we see just how talented these guys are. Would it be too far even to say that these guys could even be compared with Doves \\"The Last Broadcast\\" or even New Order? i'll leave it to you. but none the less, some highlight tracks that slip through many ears are: \\"Animals and Insects\\" as well as \\"Love and Death\\" both, quality songs in their own right. Pick this album up, open your mind to a new hybrid, and let it grow on you through multiple listenings. You will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah...its that good.","review":"Logic will break your heart is so incredible. The sounds that the band make are so clean and efficient, yet have a real sense of personality. It starts out with a bang and keeps it up for the final count. I really enjoy some of their breakdowns.

This machine has worked very well without a hitch since i got it. It was efficient enough to make several brews a morning or night for those all along my hall. I like the way the handle is not super close to the side of the coffee pot becuase nothing is worse then hitting a knuckle on a steaming hot coffee pot in the morning. Also, it is small and relativly elegant as most coffee machines are not. AND THE COFFEE DOESN'T SPILL EVERYWHERE WHEN YOU POUR IT. This is a rare commodity and something not to be missed.

As I read more detailed works of theology, I would constantly return to this book for context. Placher deals with the most complex points of theology and makes them crystal clear. The chapters are short and to the point. I think I have read the chapters on the Trinitarian and Christological controversies 10 times.

Just thought I'd kill some time while having lunch. But an hour and a half later, I hadn't eaten a thing because I got so into this movie. I have not been so involved with a movie, so concerned with the characters, nor left speechless at the end, as I was with this movie. This movie is so real, you know the scenes from this movie are playing out all over the big cities in the US. As I Latin, I particularly felt for this family, angry at how no matter how hard you try, you can't escape your roots. You ask yourself why life can be so unfair, and of course there are no answers. This is one you cannot miss, and I recommend it to everyone. It makes you realize that \\"one wrong move\\" is all it takes to change a life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Film","review":"The handheld DV cameras contributed much to the look/feel/mood of the film. No it wasn't a Hollywood production by far but still told its' story very well. No the acting was by no major Hollywood stars but because the faces were unrecognizable, it made the story much more believable than seeing JLo or Marc Anthony in the lead roles. The editing of the film was another factor that contributed GREATLY to the impact this film had on me. I'm looking at it first, from a film maker's point of view THEN, a movie goer's POV. It's a film you can compare to Martin Scoresse's Mean Streets; gritty with no Hollywood razzle/dazzle, raw in all categories but enjoyable nonetheless. If you're into cinema verite, film noir, neorealism, and nouvelle vogue, this film is for you. If you're into the glossy Hollywood OVERPRODUCTIONS, this film won't grab you because it ain't pretty. Hat's off to everyone involved in this little gem. I thank you for the enjoyment it provided."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie ever","review":"PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS FILM.

I did not really like the characters (Franky G...), how it ended, or the acting by the \\"actors\\" portrayed in this movie. You can really tell that many of them have little to no previous acting experience whatsoever. The only thing I liked about this film was that you can hear different versions of Spanish being spoken in a somewhat realistic manner. I was a Spanish major in college and thought this was cool. There are subtitles when they are speaking in Spanish so you can follow along. I would advise anyone who is considering buying this to rent it instead. It is not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This delightful collection of a very high caliber strip does not disappoint.

Public Enemy introduced their version of hip-hop in 1990 with \\"Fear of A Black Planet\\". The world is different because of it. The bass&drum forms a funky rhythm that benefits from volume. Each of the songs finds a uniquely satisfying groove. I find myself compelled to move when I listen to this CD. The \\"ministers\\" enunciate with clarity and lock-step with the beat. This is a talent which separates the great ones from the also-rans, and too few in this genre hit the mark. For me the most compelling aspect of this performance is the serious lyrical content. They are intelligent and socially conscious. \\"911\\" is the hit. I also like POLLYWANACRAKA, and BURN HOLLYWOOD BURN.

As recently as the 1940's there was genuine musical talent in the western world -- what have we come to?

I did notice a slight paint smell but didn't think it was too strong. However, after putting it in my son's room overnight, we could smell it upon entering his room. So we put it in the family room for now with the hope that once it airs out for a while, we can put it back in his room.

The beginning wasa little confusing because it told you about things withoutexplaining, but it told you enough to make you want to understand the rest, which made my want to keep reading. It has strong characters, especially Aerin. I loved Luthe and wish I knew more about his past. That would make a great book!! Mrs. McKinley should tell the story of Luthe. Anyway this was a great book and excellent for anyone who likes book about places that only exist in the imagination!! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Robin McKinley Book","review":"This book is Robin McKinley's finest work. Start with this title if you read any of her other books.

Except for those gripes, I enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"I found this book a really interesting story, i have read a lot of fantasy and i read alot, her writing tended to become confusing and at times it was hard to picture what she was saying but it was well written. 14 yrs old"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Fantasy","review":"A classic of girl power fantasy - ever now and then we take out one of the books of this trilogy and start reading again..."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful and haunting","review":"This book is for someone who likes beautiful, lyrical prose and complex character development. Aerin's battle with Maur and the psychological battle later with his skull pull you into the action. I could hear the crashes and grating bone as Aerin and Tor roll the dragon skull out of the castle!I recommend this book for people who want to be swept away into a vibrant world of loss, beauty, and honor. The Blue Sword, its sequel, is good as well, but very different."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good, really, really","review":"I just read the book again like two days ago. I read it before, but wanted to refresh my memory, and see if my past opinion changed. It didn't. I still found it good to read the second time.I won't bother to tell the summary, because it's obviously written up there (Aerin, face an evil dragon, save Damar). The book itself has little touches of humor at the most unlikely moments which made me crack up because...in strange situations the strangest thoughts can pop up. This is a fantasy book, so it's all strange...yet, believable. This world that's been created...it seems possible, just like Pern or a school of wizardry hidden somewhere.So enjoy it, because it's really really really good. :D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"In my opinion this book was very strange. The story was unusual, but the thing that bothered me the most was the lack of character development. The first half of the book somewhat develops Aerin's character and as the reader you feel like you are beginning to understand her. Then, as you read the second half of the book, it's almost as if you are reading about an entirely different person. Her personality is so significantly changed, if it weren't for the same writing style, I would swear the book was written by two different authors using no collaboration.Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very special book","review":"I read this book when I was a kid, translated to swedish of course. During my pre-teen and teenage years I re-read it many times, so maybe it's no wonder it feels like I know it by heart. Still, I loved and re-read a great many books as a child, and I cherish the memory of them even if I don't always remember all the details and data about them, so if I do remember their names and author that means they were special favourites. Still, this book is extra special, since I not only remember it so well, I've also craved re-reading it several times. And here's the amazing part; it's still as good as I remember it every time I re-read it! (In my experience very few things can live up to one's happy memories of them) And the book is a bit different when I read it these days (and in english) from when I read it as a kid, but in a good way, wich is rare. So I'm gonna stop raving about the book, wich's swedish cover I can still visualize, and go re-read it again. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain wonderful","review":"I first picked this book up when I was eleven and I couldn't put it down. It was overdue from the library for 2 months before I returned it. I thought Aerin was a wonderful character and she was the type of princess I would want to be. I thought Tor was actually a decent guy and I hated Galanna. My copy is now very wellworn and now every book that Robin McKinley writes I eagerly pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing story and plot to keep you enthralled every time.","review":"The Hero and the Crown is an absolutely amazing story. The book and its plot are so intriguing that you can almost never put it down, whether it be your first or 2oth time reading it. Aerin becomes a live person in McKinley's creation of a wonderful and almost lifelike tale with her story telling magic and expertise. I recommend this book to anyone. Not only fantasy lovers, but all readers in general"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fantasy book I've ever read, period.","review":"I read \\"Beauty\\" four years ago, and only last year found out Robin McKinley had written more... and I'm so thankful she has! Believable characters and an imaginative storyline coupled with McKinley's wonderful gift of description make this fairy tale a modern classic. Aerin fights dragons and goes on a quest for the Hero's Crown, but that's just the beginning. Read it if you're young, so you can return to it for your own kids. Read it if you're old, so you can share it with someone else. Read it if you're in between, just for yourself. You'll be thankful for Robin McKinley too"},{"rating":"2","title":"An original fairy tale...","review":"The Hero and the Crown is an extraordinary book that's bound to be a classic!The main character, Aerin, is a strong female with perserverance that eventually leads her into a new corridor in her life where she must learn to develop her powers as well as rid her kingdom of fierce dragons.The kingdom where the story takes place is so imaginative and their customs are well developed. I especially love this book because I'm a fan of culture, history, adventure, and hard-hitting females who make it big in the world.The story becomes a legend to me and seems so real after you've read the book. It's almost as if the place where the book takes place existed and their battles were real. The legend wove its way into my heart making it a more than worthwhile read. I highyl reccomend this book to ALL young adults and teens looking for an intriguing read you'll never be able to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites!","review":"The story of Aerin follows the life of a half witch born into a royal family but she seeks something more, she then becomes a Royal Knight and creates a chemical that can withstand flames and dragonbreath, so she goes dragon hunting.

Thank you very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Success for Any Girl","review":"Robin McKinley gives us a brilliant heroine in the form of Aerin. She does it all, fights dragons, wins wars, and picks up a guy. She has amazing self dependence, and a thirst to prove herself, which gets her into some sticky situations. The plot was well weaved, as there were many things going on, and it seemed countless climaxes. Aerin doesn't just get one adventure, she has enough to keep the reader enthralled throughout the entire book. You won't regret reading this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my all time favorite fantasy books","review":"I read this book for the first time in middle school and over the years I've re-read it numerous times (um, its been a long while since middle school).

I think it's a very good fantasy & good characterization. I'm 27 now & still read it once in a while. Love the dragon! And it's nice to have a heroine killing a dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"Going by all of the awsome reviews for this book as well as the many awards it won, I feel like some sort of froot loop.But I am two thirds of the way through and just cant take it any more. I find the prose chunky and laboured and hard to read. I have read dense, lyrical prose before and managed to get on board but this is not like that. I'ts just stiff and the sentences are way too long.The story is likewise annoying to me. So many pages are spent on the descovery of the fire-proofing balm. Then the main chick goes to hunt dragons and bla bla bla-dy bla. It's boring. Nothing much happens and that which does is'nt interesting. I'm sorry bit its so so soooo boring!I just can't finish it and really that is a big deal for me. I laboured through A Descovery of Witches right to the bitter end. Short as this book is, I honestly just can't face it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"What can I say about this book? It was the first fantasy-sci fi type novel I'd ever read, before \\"Lord of the Rings,\\" before anything. For my impressionable mind this is more than a book, it is the standard by which I judge all other books of the genre that I've read.A standard few have equalled and fewer still have surpassed, and I often re-read it.I still have my first copy of \\"Hero and the Crown,\\" its pages are a little yellowed and ragged around the edges, but it still occupies the place of honor on my bookshelf, and it always will."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an awesome book!","review":"I have read alot of fantasy books and this one is definantly THE BEST. Aerin is the kings daughter and she was hated because her mother was a witchwoman after she slays dragons and becomes the greatest hero ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mckinily has done it.... created the ultimite series.","review":"It's like a cake... The fantasy makes the cake, the way you're thrown into the story is the frosting, and the sprinkles are a touch of romance. I do agree with the below reader, that Luthe would have made a better match than Tor. But she wrote the Blue Sword, where she mentioned the marraiage of Aerin and Tor, BEFORE she wrote this book, so she couldn't really help it. But man, it tore at my heart when she left Luthe. I wonder if Aerin never really died, and when Tor died, she left her position as Queen to join Luthe in his forest haven... now that's something to think about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best by all Means","review":"I'm an eleven year old and I've been reading since age four and adult-level books since second grade. I read the entire Redwall series in a span of four months when I was eight. Now I personally love fantasy but I've picked up this book a few times to read but have set it back down after the first fifty or so pages because it was just too confusing and slow to start. This year I had no choice about reading it because I had to use it for a book report. Now I'm not saying it's totally bad, it does have its high points, but it is in my opinion extremely boring and confusing and tedious. Not exactly the type of book that I'd go around saying how wonderful it was by all means. I don't think this was a very good book and I don't know how some people can stand it. Although Mrs. McKinley does do a very good job writing her stories I think I'd suggest trying something a tad bit faster-paced and less confusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not so great story","review":"This book is a routine fantasy story for me. Many avid readers of fantasy just loved and praised this book a lot but I don't think this book is worth for it. The people say this book has great descriptive expressions, but I think the author wrote too much useless information. This is one reason I didn't really like this book. The story is really normal and expectable. This book has about 360 pages, but in the first 100pages don't really have any interesting events at all. The out line of story is like this; there are Dragons, which harm people. One day, the king asked to his people to kill the dragons, but no one showed up. As you can expect, Aerin, the daughter of king, came forward to kill the dragons. As usual, she got help from a wizard, and killed the dragons one by one. I think this book don't really have a creative and unique story. This is another reason I didn't like this story. You might like this book, but I don't recommend you to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!","review":"This book was very depressing and very dark. It was sad throughout and nothing impressed me. I have read other books by Robin McKinley and have found that almost all have a pessimistic twist to them. I have read many books in many different genres by many different authors and I absolutely refuse to read any more books written by her than the ones I already did. This is not a good read and you're wasting your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a book?","review":"Is this actually a book???

She goes on to be one of the greatest dragon slayers in the country of Damar. I did not really like this book because it was a little out of date. If it were more modern like \\"Harry Potter\\" I probably would have liked it more. But overall it was an OK book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is sooooooooooooooooo cool!!!","review":"I love this book. the characters are believable, the setting intriguing, and the plot suspensful. this is one of my fave books.i recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book of strength and resilience","review":"This book is my favorite, of favorites, I have a copy that is worn to bits, reading after reading, I have read it once every year, for the past 8 years, this book transcends the idea of a tale, immerses the reader and makes them feel greatness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for all fantasy fans!","review":"This book was great!

The characters were very real, almost to the extent of popping off the page. I loved Aerin, and all her bravery and loneliness; Tor, with his sensibility and love for Aerin; and of course Luthe, the man who saved Aerin's life. I very often wonder what will happen with Luthe and Aerin, and hope that it comes to a happy ending. This story was well-written, and well thought out. It is beautiful, although slightly gory, and I wouldn't change a thing about it. It, and The Blue Sword, lived up to the expectations I hold for Ms. McKinley. ~RK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, But With A Flaw","review":"The reason I rate this book a 9 is because when I first read \\"The Blue Sword\\", I was enthralled in the superb reading.I expected the same thing from \\"The Hero and the Crown\\", but was denied. I feel that the first time I read it, I was totally absorbed in the book. But I was in third grade at the time. When I reread it about 2 years later, I found more depth and forgotten detail, but I noticed a flaw. Its a simple flaw to make for sequels and prequels. It is that the detail, explaining and and more mysterious feeling of Damar was gone. It was in \\"The Blue Sword\\", the first book of hers I read, it was there. But the more magical and mysterious feeling of Damar was gone. I felt it almost necessary to have read \\"The Blue Sword\\" recently to be able to fully comprehend it. This upset me, but did not detur me at all. I would love to see more Damar books published. But reading this book slow is much better than rushing through the book like a wildfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining read.","review":"Like some other readers, I just have to keep coming back to this book; I usually read it and The Blue Sword about once a year (usually shortly after I finish rereading the Anne of Green Gables books or Lloyd Alexander's Prydain Chronicles).McKinley's non-chronological arrangement of events does make the first read a little confusing but it's worth it; once you know the general outline of the story it's a great read, so stick with it. There are dark parts of the book, certainly, but dark isn't always bad and it can be thrilling.The Hero and the Crown isn't meant (I think) to be the Great American Novel. It's an adventure story with some heart and some brain and a heroine who discovers strength she didn't know she possessed, and it's always entertaining. Highly recommended, as is The Blue Sword. I didn't care for Deerskin and am impatiently awaiting McKinley's next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Robin McKinley Book","review":"This is the best book Robin McKinley has written, even though I love her other ones also. Her telling of the story is masterful, and the story is not told in chronological order, but through a series of flashbacks in Part I that shifts to the present in Part II. Aerin, the main character, is the daughter of a king and a \\"witchwoman\\" who was only tolerated as the king's wife because the country needed an heir. Because Aerin was a woman, and the lack of respect given to her mother, she was not allowed to ascend the throne. Through a series of intricate and spectacular events, she creates a life for herself unlike anything anyone ever expected. Throughout the book, memorable and lively characters are introduced-- Tor, her one true friend, who will one day be king; Luthe, the mage who helps her discover her destiny; Galanna, whose only mission is to thwart her; and Talat, her loyal, brave horse with whom all of her adventures, sorrows, and triumphs are shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review of hero and the crown","review":"This is a adventure of a young woman named Aerin. She lives in the country of Damar, supposedly the home of the ancient crown. Aerin is picked on by the rest of the townfolk because everyone says her mother was a witch.They call her things like \\"witch woman.\\" Aerin is very strong-hearted and does her best to concur all that stands in her way. Dont be intimadated by the confusing plot, once you are through the beggining it becomes an easier read. This is a interesting book! I recommend this book to an more advanced reader, because of the far-out plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"Overall a very enjoyable read. The pace was very swift and really brought you into the action. However, I do agree with NAJ that there were many \\"missed opportunities.\\" Even though the main female character is very strong, she still somehow allows the romances in her life to define her nearer to the end and gives up power seemingly on the sole reason that it is traditional for females to take the lesser roles. Additionally, this edition seems to have quite a few distracting typos. In spite of these misgivings, I still highly enjoyed this book and would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goode's review","review":"I had a hard time relating to the heroine at first but as the story progressed I became more sympathetic to her fate.By the end of the book I became very involved in her adventures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This is truly a wonderful book. The language is crisp and vivid, the dialogue witty, the environment is very life-like and real, considering it's a fantasy. This is a very entertaining book that all fans and non-fans of fantasy should read. It is one of the best and most entertaining Newbery books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The adventures of a Lady Dragonslayer","review":"Aerin is the often despised daughter of a well-loved king. Rumors and speculations have followed her all her life. The people say that her mother was a witch who enchanted the king in order to marry him and place a child of her own on the throne. They also say that the lady died as soon as she learned that she had born a girl.The rumors are the least of Aerin's problems. She struggles to be ladylike and make a place for herself in the court. But it is not in her nature to be a dutiful and idle court decoration. Instead, she turns to swordplay, riding, and herbal experiments and finds her true talent...for dragonslaying.There's so much more to the story than that, but I don't want to completely ruin the book for you. If you are a Robin McKinley fan, give this book a try. It is romantic and adventuresome and I doubt that you will be disapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-over great book!","review":"I actually discovered this book 4 years ago at my school's library. I thought it looked interesting, but at the time it was a little thick, and quite frankly, I didn't understand any of it. Now, that I'm a little older I decided to read it again, and OHMYGOD! It's a great book that really gives your imagination a good ride. Aerin is the ultimate in female heros, and Talat, her horse, well, he's just cool. If you liked Tamora Pierce's \\"Alanna,\\" then you should enjoy Aerin, because they're a lot alike. So settle in on a weekend, buckle your seatbelts, and get ready to go to Damar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"This has to be the best book I have ever read...I first read it when I was 13, and still find myself re-reading it now after 4 years. I have found counsil to my life through this book, for many of these things have happened to me, and I have had to make many of the same choices as Aerin. I found it a well-written thriller that has stayed in my mind, and I still find myself reading it often.I think that I rather liked The Hero and the Crown more than The Blue Sword. Perhaps it is because I am a lover of the past, of when there were supposedly dragons and knights, kings and queens, ect ect. But in both tales the characters are realistic along with their life situations, especially Aerin being torn between the two loves of her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"ME FAV BOOK!","review":"i love this book it was full of power and love. don't feel bad i cried to. it was so sad but funny at the same time it kept me turning the pages and i couldn't stop even when i was so tired i could not keep my eyes open i read on. if you liked this book read \\"Alanna the first adventure\\" by Tomra Pirce. a book about a young girl in discusie as a boy in order to be a knight.

Thus, I am very disappointed to have to give it only two stars. There are no good role models in the story and there is little stated difference between right and wrong. Some people are flirtatious, vain, and petty and the other people scorn them for it and are proud. Aerin disobeys her father on several occasions, if not directly she still does what she knows he wouldn't want.

The novel is mainly character driven, and that is good for some, but nothing exciting happens. Yes, she confronts a wizard and dragon, but there is no reason for it. Not to mention that Ms. McKinley seems to have forgotten how to write after the Blue Sword. Deerskin was awful too, but back to the subject, Aerin is not a likable character. I don't know why, but it was impossible to connect with her. Ms. McKinely went on for pages stating and restating how awful Aerin's life was, when those pages would have better been spent of plot development. Two big events carry the entire novel. Other than that, it is just Aerin sitting around doing nothing. She for no reason decides to start killing dragons. There was not much to Aerin, she was a two dimensional character despite McKinely's attempts to bore us stupid with about 5 chapters that have nothing to do with the plot except to let us know over and over again that Aerin had a miserable life as a princess."},{"rating":"2","title":"I could read it over and over again! :0)","review":"I read this book in sixth grade and then just recently and I still feel the same way about it as I did when i was in sixth grade.

This CD is very original, even if it does allude to other pieces from Yes and Asia in a couple of tracks. It is not too experimental, nor is it too conventional; it is a nice mix. Now for the bad news: It does suffer from being a little too unpolished and amateurish. I agree with another reviewer that this may be a result of his sons playing on most of the albums tracks. Certainly the blame cannot be placed on Tony Levin (whose contribution is not as bold as I would have liked, but solid nonetheless) or Steve. I would not say, however, that the music is emotionless. It is anything but that. It's just unpolished in places, but this isn't even bad enough to bypass the CD.

If you don't plan on swimming in the ocean at all, this is a great watch. I really enjoyed the FLIX technology while it lasted. The other big drawback is the belt is proprietary and to replace, you have to order online or send the watch back. Real pain in the arse."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS 2 months later","review":"I had one of these for about 2 years (not great in my book). Went bad so bought a new one 2 months ago b/c I love the large display. Went swimming last weekend in salt water and it leaked immediately. By the time I left the beach, the salt had corroded the inside and no saving it. Looking for a new brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I'm an RN in intensive care and wear this watch to work about 40-60 hours per week. I love it! I've had it 3 months and it's been very sturdy, no scratches or dings yet. The face is simple, easy to read, and thorough. The band has a tab that keeps excess from flopping around. I like having the option of a 24H viewing format. It has held up to my 50 times per day handwashing. I am thin and have smaller arms than the larger average male and was afraid the face would be too large, but it isn't at all. It's not small however either. You can lose the intructions if you want because the functions are very easy to read. Changing the time and date when needed can be figured out easily without having to keep the booklet for the rest of your life. Great watch for the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"button stop working and wrist band broke","review":"The middle grey button stopped working after 3 years of daily wear. Tts metallic color coating began to discolor and reveal cheap black plastic underneath. Eventually, the wrist band broke off the watch and the battery died.Too much plastic and questionable components durability made this watch average, even though it does deserve 3 stars for simple and large time display."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was garbage.","review":"I wore this watch for around two years. The buttons will eventually stick and one even stuck permanently. At that point pushing any one of the buttons would cause the watch to reset. This was the third Ironman I've owned since 1996 and two of the three were complete junk. Timex's newest Ironman looks like a cool watch, but I want something more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The watch is good, the band is not","review":"No complaints with the watch, but the band... It's cheap plastic/rubber. It is uncomfortable. It pulls my arm hair. It causes me to sweat underneath. I changed the band for a canvas band and it is a great improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowned after 19 months","review":"I loved this watch up until the time it died last week while snorkelling on st. John.The features are great and the face is very easy to read in most lighting conditions. Lots of alarms.I've owned several Ironman watches over the past 20 years but this is the first one that failed in water. This is very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch not so good band","review":"This is my fifth Ironman watch, same model. The band(see below) breaks about 1 year after purchase. The part that breaks is the half moon shaped rubber piece that holds the end of the adjustable side of the band against the side of the band with the buckle. Super glue doesn't repair it so I just buy a new watch. It's not worth the hassle to send it in to Timex for a new band. Maybe that is the strategy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great watch for swimming!","review":"I purchased this solely for swimming laps at the gym. The watch is very easy to use with a large display and easy to find buttons when wet. So far I have not had one problem with the lap counter or memory recall for my split times. Since I usually swim more that 1500yds each session, the 100 lap counter comes in handy as I count every other lap. And there is this cool little tab to keep the band in place. For the price this watch can't be beat."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"I received it with a dead battery. After replacing the battery, none of the buttons worked except the indiglo button."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective display","review":"Just got this watch and its now back in the box to be driven to the post office for return. The display is defective. The middle horizontal lines for the main display and the hundreds display is missing. In other words 8's look like 0's, 3's look like backward C's etc. OK so its defective, it happens, but what causes me to write the review is I don't see the slight darkening where the horizontal lines should be. I can see in the LCD the circuit traces that make all the lines that do display but no ciruit traces for the missing horizontal lines. Clearly, I could be wrong but this doesn't seem like an instance of a wirebond breaking on my paticular watch, it seems like they printed the LCD wrong. If that's true they might have made thousands with this defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Long Do These Things Sit on the Shelf?","review":"My new watch showed up dead. The battery was already worn out. To open the watch and replace the battery will cause the seal to leak and the watch is no longer water tight.

Tells time, date, timer, laps, etc.... I like the weight and size of this watch and will likely replace it with another eventually. I've gone from wearing bulky fancy-ish watches everyday to the Timex and haven't looked back. My only real complaint about this watch is that the colored lettering inside the white lettering on TIMEX and other words around the dial are falling out - mine now says MEX. It's not a deal breaker but it's a little annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product","review":"Overall it's a very good watch, does everything as described. Excellent big display, makes viewing splits etc.... on the run very easy. Only negative for me is that the buttons are very sensitive, even a brish past the body adds an unwanted press of the button.....Water proofing works well :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I wanted.","review":"I have used this watch for many years. It has all the features I need and is very durable. Would like to have one more feminine, but not at the expense of durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of features, works well","review":"An excellent choice. The only small negative is that the start/lap button is a bit strange, so I've occasionally hit it by accident while adjusting the watch on my wrist, or hit it twice while completing a lap when running hard. Overall, though, this is a great watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I am stunned that so many rate this watch so highly. One reviewer said \\"\\"The beeps are very audible and hard to miss in a normal street environment\\"\\"\\" this is extremely exaggerated. I returned the watch because the beeps are so low volume you can barely hear them. The alarm is ok, but the beeps between intervals are pathetically low volume.Watch programs are 1989 all over again. Timex needs to get into this century and put real software on their devices"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strap is poor quality","review":"The watch arrived quickly and in excellent condition however having used the product for a while now, I can honestly say I'm not happy with it.The band is very loose. I frequently have the strap slipping off and hanging out in the air where it catches on clothing paper etc. In theory the latch on the band should stop it from doing that but it doesn't really hold down the loose strap well.I'm definitely suffering from buyers remorse. At this point, any old $20 watch at Walmart would be an improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"I use it for lap swimming.","review":"In the pool , every time I reach the wall I press the middle button, so the lap is counted.I have learned that often even when pushing it it does not register the lap.Only when it beeps it counts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this watch","review":"At times I have tried other watches when this has been too expensive, but I keep going back to this watch. It provides everything that I need, and I can hear the beeps under the water when I swim and click for the laps at the turnarounds. In a triathlon, it can be kind of bulky when you are trying to get your wetsuit off, but that's the only downside that I can think of. And it's not as flimsy as some of the other Ironman watches out there. For a long distance triathlete, having 100 laps on your watch is really nice to have. I would consider 50 to be the minimum, but I have really gotten to like having the 100."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Men's Ironman Triathlon 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E231","review":"Timex Men's Ironman Triathlon 100-Lap FLIX System Watch #T5E231is the best watch I have ever had.

I can't emphasize just how crappy it is to replace the band. The jewelers in my town will not even touch this watch. The worst of it is that you need to take off the watch band to replace the battery. I would give this watch a 10 for how great it is and a -10 for the idiots who designed the watch band.NOT WORTH IT JUST BECAUSE OF THE WATCH BAND. TRUST ME, GO WITH ANOTHER ONE!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Face is too big & FLIX turns off each day.","review":"I like the watch just wish it didn't have such a bulky look and feel; the watch face is about 1 3/4\\". My major complaint is the FLIX mode turns off each day when the Night-Mode resets/turns off each day. You have to remember to turn on Night-Mode before you can use the FLIX action; these two modes should be independent. It's irritating to try and use the FLIX action at night to find it disabled!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great watch!","review":"Great watch! Fits well and looks good. I got the watch as a sporty alternative to my dress watch. I also got it for triathlon training. The Flix lighting system takes a little getting used to, but it convenient once you do.

This one is great! Large, easy to read display is probably what I like the most about this model. The \\"Flix\\" feature works fine and is handy.

Loved 'em all. I don't if amazon sent me one with an almost dead battery, or if it's a flaw in the watch. However, when punching through the modes, everything is REALLY SLOW. If I go to alarm, I have to wait a few seconds for it to appear, then wait a few more when I choose to modify it. Not quick an easy like my other ironmans. Great features though, if it wasn't for this annoying delay, 5 stars easy.So I don't know to blame amazon or timex for this. Either way, it is a problem that dropped the score for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned - Twice!","review":"I have been a loyal Timex customer for years.

All of it's features work as they should. The watch is comfortable and the dual time feature works great when I'm traveling to a differnt time zone.The only reason that I've had to replace them is that usually around the 2yr mark, it dies and I figure that I'll just get a new one rather than send it in or get a battery or whatever.I hope that if and when they quit making this model, that they continue with a new model that still included the interval timers and dual time.Like many forms of their watches, I really think that if Timex is smart about their decission making on what watches get what features, they'll find that this one is needed in the line-up...good work so far..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great watch for swimmers","review":"This is my 3rd Ironman watch, and by far the best.

The address where I wanted the watch shipped ONLY gets mail USPS at the post office NOT at their physical address. I had BOTH postal and physical addresses shown for the recipient BUT the system would NOT accept delivery to a post office box address ONLY a physical address. On top of that, the order must be coming from China since it's not scheduled to arrive until two-weeks AFTER I ordered it. It's a GIFT Amazon? I'd like it delivered but that's not likely to happen and it will be WEEKS before you get the watch back from the post office and get it redirected.

I was snorkeling in the Virgin Islands and noticed there was some water in the face. I thought maybe there was another compartment to protect the inner workings... I was wrong, it died within a couple minutes. I did notice the back of the watch says, \\"Water resisant to 100 meters\\", maybe they added a couple extra zeros by mistake. I liked the big display for working out, and the alarm for camping, but the paint had started to chip on the start/stop button. Can't say I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prefer other Timex Ironman watches","review":"I have owned various styles of Timex Ironman watches over the years and this is my least favorite for three reasons. First, the START SPLIT button sticks out so far that it often is accidentally pressed long enough to switch the watch to Time 2. Other models don't suffer from this design flaw. Second, the INDIGLO on the watch is far less visible at night than previous versions I've had. Third, the clasp that holds the end of the watch band is too loose and I often find that the end of the watch band is getting caught on things.Even though I just purchased this watch three months ago, I am purchasing a replacement for it already because the design flaws are too annoying. My next watch will be a Timex Ironman but a different model."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT WATCH","review":"Easy to set, easy to see, lightweight, water doesn't affect it, I fly for a living and need a dual time zone watch one set to local time in a 12 hour format and I use the second time zone set in the 24 hour format for my aviation time (zulu).The recent return to daylight savings time was easy to set.

The watchband is lousy. It does not stay in place as the little loop for holding the loose end of the watchband down is flimsy, not very secure and will break after a year or so. I replace the watchband with a generic nylon watchband held with velcro that never breaks. I keep buying it because it is perfect for refereeing soccer where I wear 2 watches, one for countdown and one for count up. I replace the batteries when they run out, but this is not the easiest thing to do and I am sure that the watch is not as waterproof after battery replacement because the watch uses a gasket between the 2 halves that is difficult to get exactly back into place in the tiny groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"water resistant my...","review":"I had this product for a little while and it was working great. However, one day when I was spearfishing the screen cracked and water got into it. It was all down hill from there.

Now this watch is somewhere in the Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Ironman","review":"This must be my 3rd Ironman. I love the watch. It is easy to set--all the buttons are straight forward.

Letting them do it assures that it remains waterproof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity","review":"I conduct psychological experiments and need a watch with large digits. This is it. It is easy to synchronize it with the official USA clock on the internet, which is a necessity for me.

This watch delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ironman watch with bigger numbers","review":"I have had many versions of the Timex Ironman over the past 15 or so years, and have been very happy with them. I did a short detour with a sleek Nike watch but found the button operation to be less intuitive and when the Nike band broke the watch was finished.The primary benefit of this watch is the larger numbers, which I can read without reading glasses.

It is easy to use and love the dual-time function. Great watch, good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Watch, where are the replacement bands?","review":"I have ZERO complaint about the watch. I replaced my 30 lap timex with this one since Marathons in Japan are in KM, so I needed something with over 30 lap max.My deployment in Iraq ended up cracking the band and I couldn't find an exact duplicate of the rubber wristband...i had to settle for a nylon/velcro band...and I still had to alter it a bit for it fit in there right.Even with my Polar heartrate monitor watch, I still like this one for its simplicity for Timing and alarms.

I could first see moisture under the glass and the indiglo light quit working, but it would actually dry out after a few days, so I tried to live with it. Unfortunately the leak got worse and now it is mostly full of water and none of the digits are legible, but worst of all the warranty is now expired.

Two timezones available, where you just push one button to see the other zone temporarily, or hold it down to switch.This is the second one of these I have had. The loop holding excess strap broke on my old one, and my brother has one that had the same problem. A replacement band is $15 which seems pretty excessive, and the band comes with the wrong size pins. Replacing the band is tricky, but doable, but a jeweler will do it for a few bucks, and will probably have spare pins lying around that will fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in durability","review":"I was pretty confident getting this watch after seeing several friends use it. It has a very easy to use alarm, the indiglo is great, and the timers and countdowns work easily.My disappointment with the product surrounds the warranty and durability. The watch comes with a 1 year warranty and thirteen months after purchase it is dead. I only wore the watch about 5 hours a week while cycling. Pretty gentle wear and tear. When it died I replaced the battery and it clearly has power now, but it is toast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I love this watch.

I think the FLIX deal is a bit of a gimmick and I don't use it much (since it doesn't take a whole lot to just push the button) and I like that the display is nice and big.

I spent $425 on a Luminox, wish I just went with tried and true Timex.

I've been wearing this watch almost daily, since I bought it in 2010. The worst thing to happen so far, is that the paint has worn off the plastic in a couple places. I like that you can customize what modes you want to see and the large face makes it much easier to read that other digital watches.

I like it because of the large digits and the features. It has worked well for the 4 months I've had it. The other 2 lasted about 2 years each and then the display lost some lines making them useless (no warning). I love the strength and durability of the watch band EXCEPT the loop that holds the end of the band in place - it breaks very easily and both of my other watched needed a second band at $15 each, and then they were ready for another one when the displays failed. The old Timex Ironman watches went through watch bands every few months.The watch is very easy to use and to see, making it ideal for running when you don't need the advanced functions like GPS or heart rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great, practical watch!","review":"A great watch for a fair price.

One significant exception to this assessment comes from the poor record of Barker's identification of existing and coming trends for the 1990s. By now, we can see the weakness of \\"gambling instead of taxes\\", \\"national health care\\" (surely the result of Barker himself falling into a paradigm trap), \\"solar, hydrogen, fission\\" (at least ten years too early), \\"time taxes\\", \\"virtual reality\\", and others that didn't make it very far. Barker, however, is not a prophet but a guide to a more expansive way of thinking about the present and the future. Barker brings philosopher Thomas Kuhn's work on paradigms into focus with clear applications to business and any form of strategic thinking. Definitely merits a quick read by anyone interested in thinking more effectively about the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradigm shift","review":"Barker's book is informative but his stilted and halting style of writing is difficult to stick with. There were points when I thought, \\"Is this just a commercial for Barker's supposed genius?\\". There seemed to be alot of self-promotion. But again, the information was good.

First, I don't like the idea of this strain being placed on the phone right at the seam of two pieces coming together (eventually it's gotta split the thing open, right?). Secondly, can you say projectile RAZR???

This exposes it to scratches.The second flaw is that it does not hold the phone very tightly. The phone seams to never correctly clip in. The third one I purchased was for a friend.

It clamps securely onto the back of the phone and will not fall out. If I place the phone with face in, it is loose in the holster and can fall out, if I lean over. Perhaps the design changed since these other reviews were made. A minor problem is that if you open the phone all the way with the holster attached, the camera lens is partially blocked.

Because the pits are removed, the olives soak up far, far more of the brine. Instead of a firm, meaty bite, you end up with most of the olives being shriveled and soft - like a fruit that has started to go bad. And, while no one expects olives to be low-sodium, the pitted ones soak up so much that some of them actually taste as though you placed a teaspoon of salt in your mouth. I think this brand has some of the highest quality and flavored olives - when you buy them whole. The pitted ones were such a disappointment I threw the remainder away.

(My cups/lids are: lrg-pink/teal, med-green/yellow, sml-orange/yellow.) I like the look and sizes, but...The medium and large flip tops snap in three places, so you have to push a couple times to get them closed flat. Also, I'm afraid the \\"hinge\\" will crack before long, since it's white after one use.The small lid doesn't seem tight enough to stay on if it was rubbing against things in a diaper bag.These are fun, but you're probably better of using regular Tupperware or Take n Toss type containers."},{"rating":"1","title":"lids did not close","review":"One of the few things I have returned.

They go through the dishwasher just fine. One of my lids cracked a year ago (after 8 years of use!), but I kept on using it without any trouble.I tried the Take-n-Toss because they were cheap and the red store didn't carry these Sassy ones. The toss ones don't work for us because my toddler can't get his hand in the opening (and knows better than to turn it upside down and poor it out- goes everywhere!), and I have trouble getting the lids off.So, I'm coming back for more of these. I only wish there was one large and two medium in the set. I hardly ever use the small one which has the lid that doesn't open. I am ordering another set for my younger kids. These have been great with my kids from 1 to 5 years.

I would like to disagree. \\"The purpose of propaganda is to control actions by influencing attitudes\\" (p15). This is true not only of the art in Assyrian palaces, it was true during the Second World War, and is true today. Propaganda is not just lies; during WWII one of the greatest pieces of propaganda that the US had was the publication of US manufacturing. Since it was true, the Axis Powers had no way to refute it. At the same time, courses in propaganda were cancelled in the US because people began to understand the propaganda of their own government.This book explains what propaganda is, how it was developed, and how it was used. Though first written some years ago, it is not just about something sometime during World War Two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for fans of the music in the movie ...","review":"Sure, maybe some of the songs in this collection were tacked on in edited forms into the closing credits, but the majority of the music in the film is not here. Great tracks by Rachid Taha (off his Made in Medina album) figure prominently through out and aren't here. Jasmine Tabatabai not only contributes a memorable song to the film, but can be seen performing it live in an early club scene. Also not on the cd.If you like the darker, richer, exotic music of the film, pick up albums by Taha and Tabatabai.If you like mediocre compilations of absolutely horrifying covers of once great songs (I actually got physically ill hearing the versions of Venus in Furs and Killing Moon) then maybe pick this up.The one or two decent tracks (ok, one) like Collide's just aren't worth the buy in.The art of soundtracking and film scoring has reached an all time low here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Cash Machine!","review":"First off, I loved this movie!

That's a 240 point increase. Boy, was my Mom impressed.The exercises and information in the book were laid out in such a way that I could easily understand the material and keep \\"on task\\". It was very logical and easy to comprehend. I have recommended this book to many of my friends. One of them refuses to give it back!!On a 5-star scale, I would definitely give this book a 5.

The math section especially and the section on vocabulary were the most helpful. The math problems are often very similar to the ones on the actual SAT. Also, learning the vocab is tedious, but even just learning as much as you can or making yourself vaguely familiar with the words really helps. The words are often on the SAT and makes the sentence completion and reading passages alot easier. It breaks them down.

It's a major piece of history that many probably never knew about. Besides the \\"Snoopy and the Red Baron\\" songs. Growing up, I thought those were just cute songs.

The camaraderie between the troops during the holiday season is inspiring. Despite the realism of war, the movie focuses on more individual emotions.The point of the movie is very relevant to the grand scheme of life and a universal theme. It is interesting that each character speaks his/her own language and that everybody can understand one another. The movie nicely promotes diversity and acceptance. It is ironic that people fighting a war could come together so nicely. Even in a war situation, people are people and the basic needs for compassion are still there. This movie celebrates the similarities of cultures instead of their differences. I recommend this film to those seeking a good story line and an accurate historical background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Film","review":"Though rated a 3.5 on NetFlix, I found this film both sensitive and exceptionally well crafted.

Frankly, I think it beats films such as \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" or \\"Platoon\\" (or even \\"Saving Private Ryan\\")by a long shot, particularly the first two since the Great War was just about as pointless as was Viet Nam. This was a very poignant time to have released such a film. I've bought several copies for gifts for next Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is worth purchasing","review":"Excellent movie!

But this movie, being one of the best anti-war movie I've watched is not depressing, it's simply beautiful, and conveys a strong message about human values. The plot is very simple but powerful and emotional. Except for the part with the opera singers which I think is a bit too much - without them (or without the wife) the movie can be just fine - this is one of the best movies I've ever watched. I highly recommend it to everyone, even the people who don't often watch war movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitles with Amazon Unbox.","review":"Great movie, poor service.Joyeux Noel is an amazing movie, and I loved it the first time I saw it.

However, it took a great story and then played loose and free with the facts. If they had stuck with the actual events, the film would have been just as interesting as any fictitious stories invented by the producers. O.k., that addresses the plot and story....... The technical advisor really screwed up with the uniforms. Every German general is shown with an open collar. Wrong, wrong, wrong. All German tunics in this period buttoned to the neck --- period! They never wore open tunic collars. You cannot find a photo of an open collar on a general who was properly dressed. Not only does it look sloppy, it is factually incorrect. A simple check with a competent military historical advisor would have solved this error. Bottom Line: This film is slightly entertaining but could have been an excellent film with a little more effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"Good Things: Well made. Well acted. Professional work. Properly funded.Bad Things: The film is propaganda for the Left. The main message can be boiled down to this: Man is good. Government is bad. The Christian Church is evil. Also there is an unecessary sex scene in the film - which is why it should have kept an R rating. If you are thinking of showing this film to young people as an example of what took place in 1914 then you should look for something else. This film is simply revisionist history - well made propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"Der kleine Frieden im grosse Krieg","review":"A very emotional movie.

It is so easy to use. We have bought a wok to go with it so that the rest of the food can catch up to the speed of the rice cooker. We have rice 2 to 3 times a week now. We cook several different types of rice just as easily as standard white rice. Jasmin is our favorite and cooks perfectly in our Zojirushi NS-ZCC18 10cup rice cooker!! Keeps our rice warm and moist during the entire meal and later. I forgot to put the rice in the fridge one night but to my relief the cooker was still maintaining the rice quality several hours later. I had another bowl and put the rest in the fridge.IF YOU WANT A REALLY GOOD RICE COOKER THIS IS THE ONE YOU WANT!!! WE EVEN TAKE IT WITH US TO USE AT MY PARENTS"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I love the Zojirushi rice cooker. I never was able to make rice this good on the stove.

The book is worth it to me because it gives me a lot of ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"can not replace battery","review":"We've had this for about five years. The battery went dead but THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THE BATTERY. The battery is soldered to the circuit board! They expect you to ship it back to the factory which will probably cost $20 each way! I opened it up, cut out the old battery, and duct-taped a new battery in there but it just comes loose every few months. Cooks rice great, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"1. What a disappointment! The rice tastes just like any $20 rice cooker, and what is that dreadful smell towards the end of the cooking cycle? It smells like burning plastic.2. 10-cup rice cooker is too big for us.

It cooks up wonderful aromatic sushi rice, which is all I eat. You can set it for regular, soft, and hard sushi rice, or a ton of the other possible rice settings. I prefer sushi rice though, even on the soft white rice setting, my sushi rice was still a little el dente. However, I got used to it and am absolutely in love with my springy sushi rice. Much like the kind you can get at Japanese restaurants. Oh, I recommend the Kokuho Rose sushi rice, which comes in a hot pink and white package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just works","review":"I think we have the same one but the Japanese model. ZH-LS18. Description (neuro fuzzy/10 cup) is the same and it looks exactly the same except that the writing is all Japanese. We got it when we were in Japan in 2003 visiting my wifes's family. We've had it for about 6 1/2 years and it just keeps on ticking. It makes the best rice I have ever had and can be used for more than just plain rice. The feature I personally like best is that you can leave it in warming mode for many hours and the rice stays nice and moist and warm and does not dry out."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality non-stick interior pot","review":"The non-stick interior pot started bubbling after a few months and chipping after 9 months.

When I recieved it, I was dismayed to see that the detachable inner lid was made of aluminum! It's my understanding that it's very unhealthy to cook foods in direct contact with aluminum. I called the seller who told me that all of the Chinese-made fuzzy logic models are made this way.I ended up getting the higher quality, Japanese-made induction fuzzy rice cooker by Zojirushi which has a stainless steel detachable inner lid. Which I love! It makes the absolute best rice (brown and white) that I've ever had! It was pricy, but I think worth it as a long term cooking and health investment.Bottom line -- if having your rice cook with direct aluminum contact is a concern for you, just remember -Zojirushi Japanese-made fuzzy logic INDUCTION rice cookers GOOD...Zojirushi Chinese-made fuzzy logic NON-INDUCTION rice cookers BAD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than advertised","review":"Makes the best rice, oatmeal and meals.

Best make sure you have a friend or 2 or 3 who will play against you because single-player is pretty repetitive. You'll keep playing to unlock more and more armor and weapons for the standard characters and the ones you can create (which is pretty fun. I spent more time creating characters than actually playing the game I think.) You'll play and play and play and then suddenly you'll lose interest. My 4 star rating can go up or down one depending on how able you are to find people to play against. Personally, I had only 2 other people I could play that wouldn't quit (they own the game as well, thus they don't suck at it). I learned annoying ways to dominate with 3 or 4 of the characters, so most people just give up after I stomp them 5 times in a row. But if you have siblings or someone that will play as much as you, you can probably get a lot of play out of this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gameplay and graphics","review":"I loved Soul Calibur 2 for the Xbox and for all the same reasons, I love SC 3 for the PS2. It has great replay value both as a single player and playing against friends. It has great gameplay with smooth framerates and some new characters. It is only 480p, so it is not quite as sharp as the 720p Xbox version of SC 2, but it still looks great. If you loved SC 2, then it is worth getting SC 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh..","review":"I have this, but it's so NOT memorable, that I can't even remember enough about it to review it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was good while it lasted.","review":"When I got home I poped in this game and I played and played and played,and I had fun.

After playing a few matches with most of the characters, a friend and I started playing Soul Cal 2 again for XBox. The graphics are worse, the sounds/speech is worse, the movements are slower...I could go on forever, baby. I really want to know what Namco was thinking when they were making this. We were joking, but being serious, that if we had been told this game was for PSOne, we would believe them. Any advanced Soul Cal player should say that this game blows. If they had taken Soul Cal 2, and used the new characters, made a new Weapon Master, and used the new outfits, then I would actually be pleased with spending $50 on this game.

It does have this mode (versus mode) but it also has other things as well. My two boys enjoy the fact that they can create and arm characters. You choose what type of character you want to create, be it a male or female character, and then add all the attire (armor, helmets, weapons, etc.) You can even choose the voice, the hair color and the eye colors for the character, and the colors of their attire, which my sons have found fun to do. Aside from that, there is a mode where you have different quests, and they can send their newly created character on that quest, to conquer the enemy strongholds.

I really loved that game. But that was 6 years ago!There is nothing new about Soul Cabibur 3. It's just the same old stuff that you had already played for hundreds of hours years ago.There are a few new moves and combos, but the new moves just turn the game into a \\"Button Masher\\". Which means you can easily beat the game by rapidly mashing the attack button. The previous games made you think a little about your strategy, but now there is NO strategy or real skill involved.Plus it's on Playstation, so you know what type of graphics your getting (the worst graphics out of the 3 systems)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks Ass!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"One word horrible.

I think what makes this game so incredible is that it never gets old. You can play for months and you will still have something to unlock or best in this game, be it a new costume, weapon, mission, video or anything. The mode Chronicles of the Sword is absolutely amaizing, you can improve your character up to level 99, work with tactical maneuvers to beat the opposing army, and even customize the pregenerated characters they give you.The graphics are beautiful, the modes of play are varied and fun, and the amount of characters (25) is just enough to give you from where to choose.In short: it's a great game, worth buying if you like good fighting games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Literatura ligera","review":"Este libro es una compilaci��n de cuantos cortos de Asimov, que muestran como fue evolucionado en sus primeros a?os.

All in all this album is hot, go get it if u dont have it, u wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard plastic becomes brittle through ordinary use, then breaks","review":"You're probably here because the the safety mechanism broke off through ordinary care, the same thing that happened to me for this part and the bowl that accompanied my Cuisinart less than a year ago.

Leave this one on the shelf","review":"Alan Jackson has done it! He ran out of fresh material. These songs are classics and deserve to be heard again. But they deserve to be heard the by the legends that made them famous. Leave this one alone and go get the originals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a particularly inspired set of songs","review":"Alan Jackson's \\"Under the influence\\" is yet another roots attempt by a new country act that doesn't revive true country. While the album has some great choices, such as the excellent George Jones classic \\"Once you've had the best\\", the vast majority of the songs come from novelty sources (\\"Pop a top\\") or from country acts that invented the countrypolitan style that now dominates country music (Don Williams).There are no songs on this album that were originally done by such true legends of country music such as Moon Mullican, Jimmie Rodgers, Hank Williams Sr., Jerry Lee Lewis, Bill Monroe or Hank Snow. Any worthwhile 'going back to my roots' album should primarily focus on real country from the stylists. Regarding that, this album only honours George Jones while the other songs are mainly by countrypolitan acts of a modern heritage."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE FEW REAL COUNTRY RECORDINGS RELEASED THIS YEAR!","review":"Alan Jackson is primarily traditional. He's gone the other way on a few recordings, but only slightly. However, I hope that everything he records which follows this album, is as traditional is \\"Under the Influence\\". I think this is great, although the originals are still the best when the artists who made them famous, sing them. Still, I am so happy that in this day and age of \\"country\\" music, there are a few younger artists, like Alan, who know what country REALLY is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not meet my High expectations of Alan Jackson","review":"I enjoy a lot of what Alan has done. I enjoy modern and older country music. Despite a few good songs tracks the complete CD leaves a bit to be desired. Do buy this CD if to continue a collection of some type. Do not buy this CD if you are looking for the best of Alan nor if you want a history of country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old-fashioned country music","review":"Almost alone among today's top country stars, Alan Jackson can be counted on to provide traditional country music. I absolutley abhor virtually all that passes for country music nowadays. Anyway, this is an excellent CD. Of Alan's regular releases, the first 3 were great and the last 3 were just so-so; this one is one of his best. I especially like \\"Right In The Palm Of Your Hand\\", \\"Farewell Party\\", and most of all, \\"Pop A Top\\". I know Mr. Kienzle is a respected and astute reviewer, but I can't agree with him regarding this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Respect of his country elders","review":"Alan does a nice job with song's he has been singing for years.

She's tough and independent but has her vulnerabilities. In this second book, we learn more about Charlie's past so she's taking on more dimensions.

Money) has his own unique style and it's untouchable. The man is one of the most gifted in the R&B scene, plain and simple. It's not only his amazing voice, but it's also his awesome production skills and his ability to mix new-school style with older style of R&B. His verses are fresh and many of the songs have a strong hip hop feel in them. Montell even raps on a few of the songs and he does it well. And don't think that the party anthem \\"This is How We Do It\\" is the only song to love on the album. There's a lot of other GREAT songs you'll love to hear again and again. Montell is so talented, whether it's singing or producing the songs. That's something real rare and combined with his charisma it makes MJ untouchable. This is his first album...

I have read oodles of Mercedes Lackey and like it as light, comforting reading. But I'm running out of her Valdemaran titles, which are my favorites, and I hoped this book would give me some new authors to peruse. Michelle West's <i>The Memory of Stone</i> is worth the book by itself. I suppose that the book could make you feel like an outsider to some of the authors' worlds presented within, but I felt that almost all of the stories were easy to get a handle on and great fun to read.

The Got the Life mix is the reason this album gets the extra star, easily the best track on here.

The cd first starts out with the radio version of \\"A.D.I.D.A.S.\\", which isn't bad, often humorous because of the awful overdubs, but I prefer the original which can be found on the \\"Life Is Peachy\\" album. Also originally off \\"Life Is Peachy\\" comes a remix of \\"Good God\\", which is pretty cool, but really doesn't have any elements of the original song except for the singing, which there is very little of, still a cool remix. Then there's a remix of \\"Got The Life\\" which is great. Then there's a live version of \\"Twist/Chi\\" which is special if you didn't buy the Family Values Tour cd like I didn't, then there's the previously unreleased \\"Jingle Balls\\" which is really amusing and cool. Really heavy too, Jon goes really low. Almost death metal sounding.

Then the things they explained about JavaScript were either cryptic, badly written, or just plain wrong.Then, thankfully, the third time was the charm. I had bought the 2nd edition of this book, and it was everything I could have hoped for. The 3rd edition has only improved on the previous one.Now I can look up any element of JavaScript and know which browsers it will and won't work with. I get lots of concrete examples that I can take, combine, mutate, and play around with until I get what I'm looking for in my scripts. And any time I need to double-check how something works, it's a quick page flip away.If you only have the money to buy one book about this language, and you're not already a heavy-duty programmer, then buy this book! It's worth every penny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to follow","review":"I'm a frustrated beginner at Javascript. This book is part of what frustrated me. It's not very clear, with not enough examples and not enough details all at the same time.

If only I had started with that book instead of this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference if you know what you're doing","review":"After having read the first thousand or so pages, I'm finally getting the hang of it. I've read all the good reviews on this one and I'm almost afraid to slam it, but it took me a long time to appreciate this book. It was recommended as the best reference on JavaScript, and now that I know what I'm doing, I would have to say it's a pretty good reference. I guess I was expecting javascript to be as easy to pick up as HTML. Wrong! I didn't realize how much closer javascript is to actual programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Reference!","review":"I've gone through many a thick tome of Internet and related knowledge and this is one of my favorites. Admittedly, many beginning Javascript users will be turned off by both the size and the language the book uses, but for the intermediate user or the advanced user, this book proves to be an excellent reference. Almost all the the supported (and a couple of the non-supported) methods and properties are listed here, as well as some nice examples of practical and useful scripts. To make a long story short: If you're an 'expert' JS scripter, go to W3C or the ISO for the latest news. If, however, you are just starting out or need a good reference, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT a cross-browser reference","review":"This book should not claim that it covers both Netscape Navigator and Internet Explorer - this is false advertising. It reads like a Netscape manual for Navigator programming with few occasional references to IE.

This is probably the best work on the topic of JavaScript so far. However, in some instances the author gets too general and redundant. On the whole, it is recommended reading for JavaScript programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too general for Intermediate programmers","review":"The Books does a good job of explaining Javascript and designing simple function.

Your best bet is surfing on the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Step by step guide to all you need to know about JavaScript","review":"The book is an excellent review and teaching aid on JavaScript.

The organization and systematic approach to everything you could possibly want to know about JavaScript is absolutely beautiful. Not only is this book a totally breath-taking reference, but it is also absolutely marvelous to read cover-to-cover. I found myself with more knowledge than I could ever imagine gaining from a book. And hey, we all seem to forget things when we've read a book as long as this. Solution: the index. This book's index points you to exactly where you need to be.

It also provides examples to further illustrate concepts. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding tutorial and reference","review":"Danny Goodman actually teaches you how to program -- his explanation of concepts is clear and concise, his examples are relevant and reusable, and if you've never written any kind of program before, he demystifies the process. He also provides excellent ongoing support online -- all errors are noted, examples updated, etc., a feature that really adds value to this purchase. If you buy only one JavaScript book, buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with worst index I've seen","review":"I've been reading this book on and off for about a year now. It seems easier to be used as a quick reference than Flanagan's Definitive Guide. But the index of this book is neither complete nor well-indented. If saving space is a concern, use smaller fonts. Yes, I found quite a few errors as other did. The good thing about the book is (I think) Goodman is a clear writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i expected","review":"This book is 100% not for any beginner programmer or for reference use. Its big, and confusing. Should be used as a door holder.The only good thing is it explores all the aspects of Javascript which is good, you can find almost everything in here, but would take you a long time to find it. For reference use an Oreilly book and if you are a bignner use something like Visual Quickstart Guide to Javascript or Javascript in 24 hours.Bottom line for the money ad size there are better books out there!Hope I could of help you out...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but this book Sucks!","review":"We're using this in my JavaScript class now and it's the worst book to learn from. Goodman doesn't explain well and when he is explaining he goes on about things not really relevant. The book could have used a really good editor or ghost WRITER. Goodman is certainly no writer. If I could've I'd have given this book a minus 1 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Started Off Great, Downhill From There......","review":"Javascript Bible is a huge paradox, and a huge disappointment. I'm the typical purchaser of the book--HTML-literate looking to learn Javascript. It came highly recommended, so I immediately purchased it. In retrospect, I should have bought Javascript Sourcebook instead--I learned HTML with that superb \\"Sourcebook\\" series, and i should have stuck with it. The Javascript Bible starts off promising for the beginner, and introduces JS well. But it then jumps into hundreds of objects and functions and doesnt explain their context and placement. I was lost. Another reviewer here said you'll get lost after Chap4--boy, is he ever right! After Chap4, the inexperienced JS programmer will be absolutely befuddled and clueless. To its credit, the book offers lots of code examples; but it doesn't explain how and why the code was written. I'm very disappointed. In short, if you've never programmed in JS before, this book won't teach you. No way."},{"rating":"1","title":"You wont learn Javascript from this","review":"This is my third Javascript book.Like the others,the author teaches you some very basic scripts,then expects you to be able to write and comprehend some huge script with things you haven't learned yet.It's like someone showing you how to check the oil in a car, then saying \\"Ok, now rebuild the engine with what I've shown you\\" Very dissapointing as it started out ok then launched into way advanced things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Javascript Bible, 3rd Edition","review":"I am a newbie to JavaScript. This book got off to a good start, but then proved disappointing from Chapter 4 onward. Examples were given that used syntax that were not yet explained and I could not understand what the author was trying to say or comprehend the concept. It is pretty bad when you read an chapter, attempt an exercise, review the answer in the appendixes and still can't understand out what the author is trying to convey."},{"rating":"1","title":"The CD-ROM examples do not work.","review":"I cannot believe how many good reviews there are for this book. How are you people learning the material seeing as most of the programs in the book do not work? That is the worst thing a programming book can do in my opinion. The writer suggests programming practices he does not follow. Most of the programs don't contain the proper syntax and you'll spend a lot of time fixing that. A better book to use is JavaScript 1.3 in 24 hrs. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Javascript Bible","review":"I was able to find all the technical information for the JavaScript Objects.

It is not very helpful if you already know some javascript. JUNK!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best.","review":"Simply put, this is the best book available on JavaScript. The organization is just awesome. They group programming fundamentals first and they're covered thoroughly to give you a firm grasp on the syntax of JavaScript. Then you move on to the reference part of the book with full explanations of all the commands and functions built into JavaScript. I find myself constantly referring to this section when I'm scripting. And then you get to take everything you learned and apply it to real world examples. Once you've made it through this beast of a book, you'll have mastered JavaScript and be able to code it in your sleep. In response to those who said the technology covered in this book is outdated, ignore them. There has already been an updated version of 3rd edition published and now there's even a 4th edition. So if you're serious about JavaScript, take your hard-earned ...[cash] and go out and by this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simplistic; Poor Reference","review":"Judging from all of the positive reviews here, this book must have its place. However, as an experienced VB programmer, I was looking for a tutorial AND reference. The tutorial is rather simplistic and focuses primarily on Netscape, a browser which is quickly becoming the minority. My biggest gripe though, is the lack of any sort of command reference. For me, a good reference is as important to the learning process as a clearly written tutorial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic debut","review":"For someone who was only about 16 years old and made his own beats with an electronic drum machine given to him by his grandfather, this is one heck of an album. The rhymes give the impression that LL is someone who is wise beyond his years, as his storytelling abilities would make a listener believe that he wasn't just a minor at the time. \\"I Can't Live Without My Radio\\" is a self-explanatory song, but it is great nonetheless. From there, the album remains strong with stories of a girl going down the wrong path (\\"Dear Yvette\\"), teenage crushes (\\"I Can Give You More\\" and \\"I Want You\\"), and straight-up boasting (\\"Rock the Bells\\"). This album is highly reccommended, as this is arguably the best LL album out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wanna be like Cool J ya gotta wait your turn\\"......","review":"Remember this? I sure do. In 1985, a young, brash , handsome 16 year old named James Todd Smith took our breaths away ans established a long and fruitful rap career. We first got a glimpse of him in the 1985 hip hop classic \\"Krush Groove\\" (\\"BOX\\"!). and since it's beeen a great ride. His debut album, Radio, sounds as good as it did those many summers ago. It's pure ols school hip hop; from the thumping bass of \\"I Can't Live Without My Radio\\", the DJ fury of \\"Rock The Bells\\", the transfixed trickery of \\"I Need A Beat\\". Even some of the lesser known songs are good; the verbal scolding of the neightboor tramp(\\"Dear Yvette\\") to the neighborhood braggart(\\"You're A Liar\\") and LL's first many hip hop's love song(\\"I Want You\\").

The album actually was released in the mid eighties... prior to CDs becoming used. Even 10+ years later this album still rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahh, the simpler times of rap music.","review":"I remember when this first came out. We used to do our basketball warmup routines to some of these songs. Isn't it funny how simple and un-overproduced these songs sound compared to what comes out these days. And how 'bout that sweet boom box on the cover. LL was a master rapper.

After their set Trapt (aka the preppy kids rock band)came out and couldnt hold a candle to 3 days grace or Smile Empty Soul.I bought the CD a few weeks ago after i got sick of trying to download music, It hasnt left my CD player yet. As a member of a band myself I can see my music now reflecting 3days grace, the Pauses in their songs are so powerful and the lyrics are very very good too.

After playing guitar for about a month I was able to play everything on this terrible album forwards and backwards. Of the 3 hits the worst was \\"home\\". What an awful uncreative song. The other two songs are nearly as bad. The songs are all about bitter feelings most likely toward girls...What a group of posers. The sad thing is this awful uncreative excuse for a band is that they will probably make a good chunk of money in there terrible career where great newer bands like Shadows Fall or Mastodon won't make a quarter of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok...","review":"So maybe it doesn't deserve 1 star, but the average should not be more than stars! The lyrics are just so terribly repetitive and pointless. These guys are trying to copy Finger Eleven and are sucking at it. I am very dissapointed to see that bands like this are outshining true talent from bands such as Matthew Good, The Mars Volta, and Dredg. It's a really big shame to see that bands that can make one catchy song can become huge. I'm not saying catchy is bad, but when that's the only thing going for it, it's not good. So, I'm going to say that if you are one of the very many who enjoy the steady decline of true talent and excellence in music, then buy this piece of crap. I'm sure you'll like it. But if you are one of the people left in America who still knows real music when you hear it, pass this garbage on to your 12 year old cousin."},{"rating":"2","title":"~I am flummoxed~","review":"I am not quite sure why, but I absolutely love this CD. While my tastes have been migrating farther and farther from the nu/metal, top 40 rock scene during the last couple of years, when I first heard \\"I Hate Everything About You\\" on a local radio station, I bought this CD on a whim. I was really surprised at the overall quality of this release. While the first single, the aforementioned \\"IHEAY\\" is riddled with hooks that demand multiple listens, the rest of this self-titled debut is surprisingly strong. Two songs in particular, the gut wrenching \\"Home,\\" and the cathartic \\"Let You Down,\\" are perfect examples of nu/metal done right. The vocals are impressive, and musically these guys are much sharper than I thought at first listen.

The lyrics are very direct and somewhat personnel, you can tell that the band has been through some hard times. The vocals are strong and edgy, a perfect blend of anger, sorrow, and sincerity. The entire album sort of explores the human mind and the aspects of this world and our relationships as people, taking you down into a dark soul that surges with beauty. It gets down into the dark places of life, the cold truth and reality of the world, while leaving you with a small sense of hope. it is music that you can listen to all the time, no matter what mood you happen to be in.

This album doesn't hold anything back, it lets it all out which is good because it sucks when people try to sugar coat things and it just ends up sounding fake.

It seems like every other rock band these days contains marble-mouthed, pseudo, angst-ridden vocals that are a clone between grunge rock and EMO garbage! 'Animal I Have Become' is one of their very few good songs, but that is on another 'album'. In the more musically creative 70's and 80's, crap like this would be laughed at by A&R execs, because it sounds so simplistic and basic! These guys sound like they are 12 or 13 year old amateurish kids, trying real hard to sound like a 'real rock band'. But then again, kids today have much lower standards, and are 'dumbed down' compared to previous generations.

I'll give them credit that its better then all the pop punk bullcrap, but its still not very good. People have to start looking past these bands, to other ones that have some originality or talent.

I really identify with some of the lyrics: \\"I'll be coming home just to be alone... no matter how hard I try, you're never satisfied... I can hardly wait til you get off my case!!\\" Relatively easy to learn on guitar, too.2) Just Like You: Second-best TDG song ever. Also, the only song I can do halfway good on drums.3) Burn: Average, but still good.4) (I Hate) Everything About You: Way too overplayed, but still a good song; I really like the video.Other than tracks 1-4, you really don't need to get this debut CD. It's good, yeah, but it can be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome New Band","review":"I just recently started listening to Three Days Grace, and I've alrady bought the CD, tickets to the concert, and any merchandise I could find. The band is amazing and Adam has the perfect mix of harmony and metal in his voice and he uses it to enhance the range of the band. I would recommend anyone looking for some good rock to pick this cd up."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've heard one song you've heard them all","review":"I heard the song, \\"I Hate Everything About You\\" on the radio and didn't like it at first, until I listened later and it grew on me. I thought I might actually like this band, whom I'd at first thought would be like all the other bands on modern rock radio, and I was right. I just do not latch on to any other tracks and even though I admit they are slightly better than most other cookie cutter rock bands, for me, they just don't do much, musically.I would suggest to anyone who feels the same way about modern rock radio and it's bands to just steer clear of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd and dvd!!","review":"Great cd for anyone who likes alternative rock. Bonus dvd comes with a lot of extra features on it and a bonus track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rockin'","review":"Three Days Grace is one of, if not the best new band out there. These guys came from nowhere and exploded onto the scene with one of the best rock albums of 2003. Definitely a good album to pick up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickin Album","review":"3DG is one of the best bands out there. These guys have musical genus running through them. I listen to their CD all day, including while I am in class or studying (which by the way my grades have improved since)."},{"rating":"1","title":"computerized","review":"ill vouch that i havent heard the qhole album, but i dont really have any desire to. everything ive heard from it is so computerized and fake and overproduced it makes me sick. if you want to listen to a band that sounds like this, but actually vouches its credibility, get Orgy. at least they admit theyre computerized and theyre a million times better than 3 days grace could ever be. i can only imagine how much 3DG must suck live. unless they lipsynch. oh well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Days Grace - Best Band in my views.","review":"O.K., first to start off my review, I've been listening to Three Days Grace since 2003 when they made their debut, and at frist, I wasn't sure, I just wasn't feeling their music or lyrics. But as months went by, I started listening to all of their songs and I amazed at their skills in writing their music. Sure, people bring them down on their three chord playing and simple drumming, but that doesnt make Three Days Grace a \\"simple band\\". It just shows that they must want their music to be a little heavier. Anyway, if you are looking for a c.d. to listen to when you're having problems, I'd say there is at least 1 song thats going to be about your problem, and I know thats what I do, because every song on this 12 song album is about having problems with someone or something. Then again, if your looking for a c.d. with a band with a lot of talent, Three Days Grace is definitely one of the ways to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Funny how the lead singer of this futile band thinks Eddie Vedder clones are unoriginal. Is he unaware that his band reeks of the very unoriginality he's whining about? The premise of this band is quite simple: get a guy whose voice will make your ears bleed, followed by the ability to play three chords on guitar. We haven't heard of a band like that before, right? It's such a pity when a band like this is taking away the spotlight from talented and original musicians. Avoid this at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It all sounds the same","review":"I bought this Cd because it was 13.99 and I really like the song \\"I Hate Everything About You\\". I listened to it a few times, and it was really hard to get through. Most of the songs sound similar, and they have the same structure, very pretictable. I do however like the songs \\"Home\\" and \\"Just Like You\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"1 good song for 3 days grace","review":"They have one good song... I HATE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU... but I HATE EVERYTHING ELSE ON THIS CD.... everything sounds the same and everything sounds like every other rock band trying to sound \\"edgy\\" sounds like a copy of nickelback and a mix in of system of a down. I don't know about you but I wouldn't waste 15 bucks on a cd with 1 good song your probably better off just buying a single from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"THREE DAYS GRACE ROCK!","review":"All I gotta say is these guys are absolutly incredible and you can get a great taste of that on this CD... they are AMAZING!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you hear what I hear?","review":"Wow, this band definitely did not stand up to my expectations. Besides the fact that they sound like all the other hard rock bands currently in the mainstream, they also lack any kind of X factor. The first, and only, time I listened to them, I felt like I was in a low budget horror movie from the mid 90's with a sadly unhopeful soundtrack. If you want excellent Canadian talent, check out Our Lady Peace, especially their older stuff. You can lend your ear to Three Days Grace if you choose, but you'd be better off wasting your time sitting on the toilet. Because, with Three Days Grace, it's just like constipation: you sit there waiting for something great to pop out, but you just end up with some regular old crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Are they going to have another cd?","review":"on 3 Day Graces Cd there only good sons are Just like you, I hate everything about you and Now & Never. I think they should have a nother cd because this cd is about a few years old, You can't get sick of them though just like Blink 182, Red Hot Chili Peppers and other \\"Old\\" bands from 1990's to 2005."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Real","review":"Well first off I'll address the guy who was going on about how three days grace gives canadian music a bad name. You may be write and I was hoping you were going to be some what intelligent but then saying that sum 41 are great and everything lost you all credibility points. The decent pop punk at best. You want to talk about good canadian music then mention names like hot hot heat, billy talent, alexisonfire, the new pornographers, peachers, godspeed black emperor, the stills. All these bands and artists push the boundaries and they are the bands we canadians should be proud of, these bands push the envelope and for a country known for regergatating american trends Canada has always had a steady hand of good indie talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Days of Almost A Disgrace","review":"As Three Days Grace came out with I Hate Everything About You, I was interested to hear the rest of the album. But has it, it wasnt what I thought it would be. I thought it would be harder, and once I read the lyrics, I was a little dissapointed. The lyrics arent too great.1.Burn- It was a good starter song- 3/52.Just Like You- It was also a song, a lil hard- 4/53.I Hate...-Lyrics sucked, but catchy beat- 4/54.Home- shows a lil hardness, but alright- 4/55.Scared- Good beat, could have been harder- 3/56.Let You Down- Good mix of hard and slow- 4/57.Now or Never- Shows there hard side- 3/58.Born Like This- Great beat, good guitar- 4/59.Down- another good hard and slow song- 4/510.Wake Up- Strong guitar, good beat- 4/511.Take Me Under- Lyrics need some serious help, but good guitar- 3/512.Overrated- Seriously, get some better lyrics, and a lil bit harder and maybe they can get a 5/5- 3/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Days Great!","review":"Three Days Grace's music is amazing, this is the kind of music that blows people away and you never would see this kind of singer/band on American Idol. I think that Three Days Grace is an awesome band and when I listen to it, it just makes me think,WOW! and only a great singer and band could do that. They really get you to think how they can be so good at something that most people cannot master. It's really a blessing to have Three Days Grace at my fingertips and the fact they are really good at what they do; like I said, this is no ordinary band, this is something that you shouldn't take for granted. Three Days Grace is the band of a lifetime!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"psssst.... Home, I hate everything about you, and just like you... are nothing compared to what this band can do... please don't do something stupid like miss out on this, there next album (it just come out) is different just like this band... it doesn't suck... how often you see a band do that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TDG","review":"Im sorry, but I just have no understanding of what people see in this band. I have listened to this album a few times, and every time it just seems more boring and shallow. They give you very straight forward and generic messages that other bands send better. The music has no meaning or emotion and really just feels like a band created by a record label for disenfranchised teens and the MTV \\"rock\\" sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three (...)

And I must say this is a great album through and through. 3 Days Grace are great musicians. I new they were playing a couple of their songs on Octane, but there were other songs Octane was playing that I didn't know was 3DG until I bought the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I would have given Three Days Grace 5 stars, but I do agree with the other person who said that if all your songs are about hating someone or something, you need therapy. However, when you yourself ar ein a pissed mood, you sometimes need to know there are others that feel the same way. It helps you get over it. do think they should make some happy songs though. Anyways, I would definitely recommend this album to anyone. It has very powerful lyrics that give relatable meanings. Pick it up today, and you'll never regret it. The only mistake I made was not waiting so I could get the Bonus DVD version. So better yet, buy THAT! :) Ciao"},{"rating":"2","title":"I was surprised... it's really good...!","review":"I started off downloading the songs in mp3 format because I was thinking all this stuff kinda sounds the same, but I really liked the I Hate Everything song I thought I would sample all the songs... so as I was downloading the songs I really liked Track #1 then loved #2... and I ended up liking each song in the album. It really is great. So I ended up buying the album and it is one of my favorites of the summer. Each song sounds different from the other. Not like other cd's where you cant really tell one trach from the other. My fav song is probably #5. Scared But i love them all! Get the cd! you wont regret it!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"three days grace rock!","review":"Three Days Grace's self titled debut album is AMAZING. It features 12 awesome tracks with great lyrics! I encourage everyone to go out and pick up this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"To the dragon guy the first reviewer","review":"Your not very smart. The slower songs on this cd are what are gonna make this cd. They definetly are stronger in the slow mellow rock sound Let you down, and Now or never are probably the best songs on the cd, Thhey also have the best beginnings anybody who knows anything about guitar can just blast away you have to learn to harness it and let everyone know your good and be artistic, wake up is also and awesome song. For some reason the song burn just seemed like a intro to me i didnt really like. The other good thing about this cd is that they have hard music and softer music which makes a great album. If anyone has heard Disturbed's second cd they bombed it because you cant which songs which. I also think they should strongely lean on the slower rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catchy tunes but...","review":"Musically I think this is actually a pretty good CD. The music grabs you and makes you want to listen...good musical hooks, grinding guitars, good vocals, good drumming...it's the repetitive and shallow lyrics that makes you want to throw the CD out the window.I think another reviewer nailed it when he mentioned that he thought this band was just thrown together by the record label to pick the pockets of what he described as \\"disenfranchised youth\\". I believe it. Look at the insert to find out who wrote the songs. They were all written by the CD's producer.To sum things up...musically, I would give this CD a 3.5 it's not the most original thing I've ever heard but it's catchy. It's the lyrics that ruin it for me...they are just so mediocre and uninspiring I can't give it above a 2. So, if you can tune out the lyrics and ignore the fact that this band is just a record company's puppet you'll probably like the CD, otherwise find something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Days Grace unlike no other","review":"Burn- Awsome Intro even better lifeJust Like You- Great lyrics and meaning but radio overplayedI Hate Everything about you- Awsome guitar during chorus great songHome- Awsome Vocals very angry songScared- Kool upbeat song with unbelievable vocalsLet you Down- Def. cool kick drum during chorus good beat alsoNow or Never- The best on the cd great lyrics first line in chorus is awsomeBorn like This- cool intro and vocals and great soundDrown- awsome riff very depressing lets u get it all outWake up- Sweet verse and vocalsOverated- Some of the best lyrics i have ever seen AWSOME SONG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical equivalent of white label beer.","review":"Is it just me, or does ALL of this sound the same?

All the s**tty rock ends up on the pop stations, stuff by Linkin Park, Hoobastank, Yellowcard and all those other gay bands. Three Days Grace's generic attempt at nu-metal is what caused them to hit the mainstream. The only songs I consider \\"good\\" are \\"Just Like You\\" and \\"Home\\". Otherwise, piss on this CD and buy yourself an Avenged Sevenfold or an Evergreen Terrace album instead. It's generic nu-metal by dilinquints like Three Days Grace and Hoobastank that cause the death of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her best yet","review":"Longeur d'Ondes is Natasha St-Pier's best yet. More mature than her previous recordings, it features interesting lyrics and stronger melodies coupled with that incomparable voice.

The production is so time typical it might be hard to find a better example of the sound and production back in the 1980's. With hindsight it's no wonder this was the original line up's last album because the song writing just isn't there anymore. After so many years of excellent songs no one can blame Holder/Lea for running low on inspiration. But I wouldn't say that this album totally stinks and should be avoided at any costs because under the massive layer of keyboards you can actually hear some references to the old happy days, for example in \\"Me and the boys\\". Maybe 1 star is a bit cheap but in comparison to other Slade albums this is not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm, Rich Sound with Clear Articulation","review":"If you prefer modern instrument interpretations of Baroque music, then the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra conducted by Janos Rolla will give great satisfaction. They have a richer, more articulate sound than I Musici and remind me of the wonderful Archiv DG LP set conducted by Ettore Gracis, full of \\"nobilmente,\\" that is lacking in the Capella Istropolitana version on Naxos. This has now edged slightly ahead of the wonderful Guildhall String Ensemble (an admittedly smaller group) version on RCA in my collection. Warmly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful matching of music to imagery.","review":"The New York documentary by Ric Burns is an outstanding achievement on so many levels. The information presented is dramatically conveyed by David Ogden Stiers, leaving you informed, impressed, saddened at times, and ultimately lifted by the resiliance of the city itself. The documentary is approxiamtely 15 hours long. The soundtrack is what carries you effortlessly through this seemingly long series. All of the elements work fluidly here and help to romantically express the history of this relatively young city. The music is a must-have for all who view this terrific documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"another CD with little relation to the film","review":"Time was, the recording from a film consisted of the music track of the actual film. Now, producers think it has to be its own piece. And in this case (as another reviewer has noted) it doesn't hold together. People trying to find a piece of music they particularly liked in the documentary may luck out and get it. But the largest portion of the CD just consists in the documentary's (un)original, and insipid, compositions by Brian Keane."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great but its sound is no so great, the shoulder-rest is terrible, and weights a lot","review":"The Fender has a hollow body that produces a tunnel-like sound and it's sound is not the greatest.It's really over priced. This violin is a good value if you pay no more than 400-500 bucks.It looks beautiful tho, and that's so misleading!The name Fender is misleading as well, it's a Korean violin with a Fengling or one of those Korean pickups, and weighs way too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"add this one your history collection...","review":"This beautifully illustrated book tells the story of Paul Revere's ride to warn the colonists of the British army's attack.

Our church uses these personal monitors on a 120' cable run back to the board and they work great. The construction of the unit itself is sturdy, and the knobs have a decent feel to them. The stand clamps are super useful. I would recommend them. Remember to buy a stereo cable extension.

But in a time where alliances among the powerful nations of Europe are important, Mary is sent away from her home at age five to live in the court of King Henry II of France, where she will be educated and live as one of the family until she old enough to marry Henry's son, Francis. The year is 1553, and Mary is eleven. She longs for her homeland, and for her mother, but is good friends with nine-year-old Francis and the other royal children. In her diary, Mary describes her daily life over one year. She may be a queen, but in many ways Mary is just like any eleven-year-old girl, enjoying fun and games. but at the same time longing to return to her home and mother. I really enjoyed this wonderful new Royal Diaries book, and I recommend it to all fans of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary, Queen of Scots: Queen Without a Country","review":"Although she is living in France, Mary, Queen of Scots, is extremely patriotic towards Scotland and longs to return to the country of her birth. Her four best friends and ladies-in-waiting, all named Mary, are all as passionately Scottish as she is.This book is the story of Mary's life at the French court. She reflects on her impending marriage to the French Dauphin (crown prince) Francis, who is one of her best friends. However, Mary despises his mother, Queen Catherine de Medici, and Catherine's henchmen. She admires the French king, Henry II, and his mistress, Diane de Poitiers (somewhat excessively). The book is entertaining, and the characters are lively and realistic (but sometimes one-dimensional, like Diane de Poitiers and Catherine de Medici)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hana's Review","review":"I loved the book, but I thought it could have been better.

Several days later, after a ball, they found the culprit, and then his purple handprints on Mary Livingston's breast. Mary went to tell Queen Catherine, who also had purple hands, said,\\"I found purple handprints on Mary's face and breast.Then, after that the King asked Mary if the other Mary had in any way lost her honor. I know what that means, but maybe a little eight year old reading this might not. How do you explain that to a child?Also, the plot itself was uninteresting. After 1 year, it felt like nothing had happened at all. It was just a series of events.Save your time and don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Positively Wonderful!","review":"This has got to be one of the best Royal Diary books ever written.

So the author is equating all soft energies with just solar. Amory Lovins soft energy paths wasn't just talking about solar, it was talking about all soft energies (all different types of renewables AND co-generation!) in that 36%, which turned out to be very close to projection. This is an example of the lack of thoroughness, or possibly, intentional misleading by the author.I agree that solar is an expensive technology for the efficiency rates it achieves, but consider this: If we had the same subsidies in renewable technologies as coal and oil do, how much better would they be now?

Or other people dogs? And the logical connection to spending any more time is that you agree that dogs reflect the owner, soooooo.... you can come to a meaningful relationship with the dog-owner by looking into the dogs face?

Like the previous film, DECADENT EVIL 2 is utter garbage, and barely passable even as a cheesy B-movie. Some may say that the insufferable characters, unimaginative plot, and artless direction should all be expected from a Full Moon film of the time, but Charles Band generally brings some fun form of exploitation to even the worst of his features.

Now that it is out there I am so pleased. It has a high NRG dance sensibility paired with moving lyrics. Erin is a great singer and the production values are top-notch. Fans of CHER, THE PET SHOP BOYS, and DONNA SUMMER will find this album satisfying. It's up-lifting, and moves you in several ways. Nobody I've played it for has anything but good things to say! I waiver on buying dance albums for fear that they may not live up to the singles, but this album stands up to the great work she's already done with the singles. I can't say enough about how much it has touched me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance artist who can actually sing","review":"More consistent level of quality than other dance CDs- not just one hit with 9 filler songs.Better voice, too- nice and full in the upper range (and she's got some great high notes); she doesn't switch to a breathy Brittney whisper. She belts it out like a real woman.Some good white-girl soul feeling, too. The real thing, not the overdone Celine vocal antics. Not a souless mannequin. Growling in the low range, she reminds me a few times of Annie Lennox, and that's a huge compliment.I read her interview in Advocate (or was it Out?) and it was good to read that she had gotten herself together, so I bought her CD.

I bought the album this year although I had listened to some songs through Internet, but the entire album it's for me in the kingdom of the 10 best hardcore rap albums of all time.

Sure, I got the cork out of the bottle, but when I tried to remove the cork from the corkscrew I could not. Trying to twist the cork off the device only accomplished one thing, the whole 'screw' part of the tool kept falling out and I was left with the cork and the screw in my hand. As I could not change the direction of the threading as the designer should have done in the first place, my only recourse was to cut the cork away and store my leftover wine with a makeshift cover. Who makes an item like this? At least some of my fellow reviewers here got one use out of it.

I saw it at the Tivoli Theater in St. Louis. One of my favorite obscure movies of all time. Noddy Holder played a different version of \\"How Does it Feel\\" in the movie, as I recall.. I went to the record store and bought this album the next day. I also saw Slade in Concert here in St. Louis 4 times over a 2 year period. They could never draw any attention in LA because the coast was into punk at the time. They remain the (literally) unsung heroes of hard rockers of the '70s everywhere. Quiet Riot wouldn't have made it into the '80s without SLADE.. and I wouldn't have, either! This CD has a couple selections the album did not, so I'm going to buy it.. every track of the original release is phenominal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slade - of course!","review":"Slade is a party rock band that critics never liked. I can't decide if the guys in Slade had a good time during the 1970's but it sure as hell sounds like they were. But be aware that maybe this record is the bands most \\"serious\\" release. Outstanding songs are \\"How does it feel?\\", \\"So far, so good\\" and \\"Far away\\" - three of Slade's best songs ever!Almost every Slade album has its share of top quality songs. It's hard to choose the very best studio album but \\"In flames\\" should be included in the top 4 together with \\"Old, new, borrowed and blue\\", \\"Nobody's fool\\" and \\"Whatever happened to Slade?\\"My suggestion is that you start with \\"In flame\\" and if you like it - go ahead and buy all the rest..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute learning toy","review":"I bought this toy for my 5-year-old.

It is wooden, so it is pretty durable. Mostly, she likes that she can \\"hand sew\\" like me and her big sister. I always wanted one when my oldest was younger, but Amazon had it at an incredible price, so now we have it in our house! The only downside is that the case it comes in requires the bear to be stripped down to her panties again and the pieces must be arranged specifically.

The music is original and is composed by Gontiti.I find that any plucked instrument sounds harmoniously with string orchestra and this CD contains peaceful, heartwarming, relaxing music of acoustic guitars and strings.Music was recorded in Tokyo, Los Angeles and Rio de Janeiro. Three compostions on this CD were arranged by the famous Japanese cellist and composer - Hajime Mizoguchi.I recommend this album to all fans of Neo-Classical music.CD is furnished with a 20-page colour booklet. You can listen to a couple of sound samples from this CD at Gontiti's official web-site.Please note, that this CD was also released in Korea.

It turns out to be a wannabe Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon style movie but with no plot and flashback scenes that get confusing. While there was a certain artistry to it, the plot was weak and centers around a story that never really makes sense or comes together in any climactic way.

After viewing the cartridges I have to say I'm pretty dissappointed in the graphics and intend on putting the whole thing in the trash!If you and your child have watched any of the Baby Einstein DVDs this product will not hold your interest.I can recommend Leap Frog Baby's Little Leaps. My grandson loves this toy and never tires of playing with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this toy","review":"I absolutely love the v-smile baby. It is very educational. My son is 17 months old, so he doesn't really have any attention span yet, but when he gets older, it will be very useful. I especially like the sign language part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"My toddler refuses to play with this toy. I bought this for her when she was nine months old and she showed no interest. The quality of this product was much poorer than I expected. The Leapfrog system looks much cuter. My daughter is now almost two and since we bought it I have tried it about once a month. Even though she loves the toddler computer games, she still shows no interest in this. To be fair, the toy does have alot of educational value if you can get your child to play it. I'll keep trying, but I'm beginning to think that this toy just isn't for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Our 10 month old son LOVES to bang on the computer. We tried giving him a keyboard but he wasn't satisfied with just banging--he wanted to see what was happening on the screen, so we bought him this toy. He liked playing with the 'keyboard' while in the car, which initially I thought the 'play alone' option was a nice feature, but I was disappointed the buttons didn't light up in addition to making sounds. He got tired of the toy after about 10 minutes in the car. We brought it home and hooked it up to the TV and he was not impressed. He was quickly bored with the limited capabilities of the buttons and was not interested in the graphics on the TV. We decided to return this and try the giggles software for the computer instead (offers kids a safe way to push the keyboard buttons without putting files at risk) and rely on good, old fashioned toys and books to educate our child instead of relying on technology."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow","review":"My 23 month old son recieved this for Christmas. I was really excited about it until we plugged it in... It barely hold his attention for more than a couple of minutes. It is so slow and boring.

I am not impressed for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, not this one...","review":"My 6 yo son has a VSmile for big kids, so, well, we bought a VSmile Baby for and an additional cartridge - no problems. My 16 months old daughter has no interest in it al all. The voices are very soft, and there is nothing to grab child's attention with, very plain colors and - believe it or not - it is very confusing to operate. Well, we did not spend too much time with the thing and now it is sitting on top of the bookshelf, and no one pays attention to it). Really-truly -a waste of money. She (my daughter) has a lot of fun with LeapFrog books, that were sent to my older son (6 yo) by his Grandma."},{"rating":"1","title":"V.Smile not interactive","review":"We have had this unit for not quite a month. You can no longer use it with the TV as it appears the infrared in either the base or the remote is out. The color and video quality are fair to poor. The base being able to be independent is nice, the portability is nice, but overall, it is not something I think I would buy again primarily for the video quality and usability. THe video is about as good as the original Atari 2600 games were 25 years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I am frustrated by this system. I suppose when compared to one of those other systems (like Wii or DS) it is a bargain but I resent the fact that if you want to upgrade, the cartridges for older kids are not compatible with this system.First, for those of us who didn't want our children to watch TV until they were 2, it's pointless. We received this as a gift for our son's first b-day and before I could stop my husband from tearing into it, he had opened it up and made it impossible to return.Now that we are comfortable with our two-year-old using it, I am not impressed with the graphics OR the audio.All the cartridges compatible with the system are labeled for 18-36 months so now, my son would only get a years worth of usefulness out of it IF we chose to keep it and use it.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR","review":"This product might as well have been created 20 years ago.

HORRIBLE COMPANY. HORRIBLE PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"System quit working after 3 months","review":"My daughter LOVED this system. She couldn't get enough of it. But 3 months after purchasing the system, it quit working. The remote part quit responding with the actual system. I called Vtech and although they are willing to fix or replace it, I have to pay for the shipping for it and they require you to also purchase shipping insurance. So it's going to end up costing me about $10 to have the system fixed when in my opinion, it shouln't have broken that quickly in the 1st place. To me the graphics weren't super great but good enough for babies and young toddlers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The game is junk","review":"i buyed this game it work fine then a week later it stop working i toke it back and brand new the touch pade dont work and all it come on tv screen is vtech when game is on the system.

The resolution is terrible, and the words are mispronounced. MY daughter loses interest very quickly in it, and much rather look at her books than the screen. I think it has a lot to do with the quality of the picture. I wouldn't buy this as a gift, even on sale at a great price. I'm hoping the new leapfrog baby/toddler product is better than this one. This was a very disappointing purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing is a JOKE! Needs a lot of work!","review":"This product does not hold my toddler's attention in the least. She would rather play with her toy piano, riding car, blocks, stuffed animals, and look at her books than even bat an eye at this thing. The concept of this baby learning station is excellent, however the graphics and content are rather crude and ineffective. Either V.Smile needs to can this product altogether, or they need to improve the graphics and content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Bought for my 19mo old daughter. She was vaguely entertained, but not for long. Was looking for something she could play with more on her own as she loves interactive toddler websites. Plugging the cables into the TV proved most interesting. As another review mentions, many of the words are not pronounced correctly, and the language is very \\"choppy\\" -- sounds like a computer talking! Songs only sing for a single verse. Much less than I expected for Vtech, and especially for Baby Einstein. Disapointed, and returning for something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"V Smile Baby","review":"My daughter is almost 3 but continues to love this system, it gives her a game to play similar to big brothers VSmile system. Graphics are poor but the system teaches recognition of colors, shapes, and numbers. My only real negative as this is a replacement for the first one which broke within the first year, is they don't seem as sturdy as other mainstream video consoles for older kids. My son's VSmile was also replaced recently after it stopped working, though I have not seen a lot of complaints we have not had much luck with their quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with a big screen tv","review":"I bought this and a couple of the cartridges for my grandaughter's first birthday. My son only has a large screen tv--I mean really one of the huge ones. The graphics are just an awful blur, and I think it's because the tv screen is so large. It would probably look better on a small screen but wish I had known its limitations before I bought the thing.It was hooked up for about 2 days and then thrown out in the garage so this was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's definitely for babies","review":"My 4 month old son loves using my laptop to play the baby \\"games\\" on fisherprice's website. This system really isn't much more advanced than those, however, with the v.smile baby, I no longer have to loan him my laptop/deal with the aftermath of him changing random settings from hitting function keys/shortcuts/etc (got tired of my homepage being http://,jl,njjjjjjjjjjjjj/).I don't think this would hold the attention of anyone older than 18 months or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just \\"ok\\"","review":"Trying to get my daughter (whom is pretty smart) to view the television at the same time she pressed buttons in the console was almost impossible. Graphics are terrible, better than Atari, but worse than the first Nintendo. Not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I bought this toy for my 9 month old daughter at christmas last year. In almost a year the most fun she has had with it is pushing the on buttong to see the blue light. It is incredibly durable and has been thrown around many times without being broken or even scratched. I like that the cushioned wrist rest comes off and can be thrown in the washing machine but it comes off too easily and my daughter likes to take it off and carry it around the house. The resoloution is horrendous which was not what I was expecting and it was probably my biggest dissapointment. It didnt cost too much money so I guess I got what I paid for but I cant say that I will buy another vtech product in the near future. I would much rather spend a little more for leap frog and know the quality will be good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"My in laws got this for our daughter and I hate it.Complete waste of money, and the game cartridges are too expensive.My daughter played with the keyboard for a little while butshe was not interested in the \\"interactive\\" TV learning part.She'd rather go outside and play.

The cords barely connected to either of our TVs and we constantly had to get up and fix them. They were constantly sliding around and making the screen blurry and making buzzing noises.

Really a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have been better.","review":"We bought this at my daughters request for our only grandchild. It was a huge disappointment. Five adults tried to make the item work based on the directions.

I would say the intellectual collective should have been able to make the unit work for a two year old with the advanced mental ability of a four year old but it just ended up being a \\"fake\\" computer toy for the grandchild's dolls to \\"play with.\\" Unless this item has been upgraded and the directions which were translated from the manufacturers location have been re-written, I would suggest you buy flash cards for 99 cents at Walmart or give the child the box and throw away the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased","review":"my daughter really enjoys this product and is learning for preschool with it.she is learning to count,her colors,and shapes.since playing with this product she can count to 15 knows all her colors and shapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"May cause a Mobius loop in your home theater","review":"Sure the music sounds awesome through these cables but due to an extremely low common mode rejection ration, my neighbors fluorescent lights set up a standing wave in my rack that opened a mobius loop in my basement.

It gave my old printer a whole new lease of life.Unfortunately, I was woken up by a commotion later that night and turned the light on to discover the cable in bed with my wife. She claims that she must have caught her foot on it on the way to bed, but I'm not exactly sure. It certainly doesn't explain how the cable ended up wearing one of my best ties.

In the old days when everything was analog, using a better wire to connect devices might indeed have some benefits. Even now, the connection between the receiver and the speakers is analog so using better wire can have some sonic effects.However, when the transmission is _digital_ (as in HDMI), all the receiving end needs to be able to do is to tell whether a bit is a 1 or a 0. It doesn't matter at _all_ whether the bit is 1% beyond the detection threshold or completely at the limit for the medium (i.e truly at zero volts or at 5.00 volts if that is the max allowed). If the detector sees a \\"1\\", it sees a \\"1\\".

The procedure for pre use wear in of digital cables is significantly different to analog cables. They should be worn in for a period of 24 hours in each direction. Use a unidirectional protocol! _Never_ use TCP for wearing in digital cables, as TCP uses return packets for acknowledging, causing interference in the uplink channel being pre worn. Use UDP or ICMP (no ping) for wearing. Preferable use a payload of 64Kb with a datapacket consisting of consecutive 1's and 0's to settle the electrons. After 24 hours, reverse the cable and repeat. Always make sure that the cable is connected to a sender and a receiver, as Layer 2 will prevent data transmission if there is no positive ARP response from the receiver.This process is quite delicate and difficult, and I would have expected it to be performed by the manufacturer for this pricetag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly powerful.

Apparently the result of an improper connection and the cable's high data transfer speed, I mistakenly caused the collision of a pair of positrons (i.e. leptons) at several hundred GeV. While the resulting mini black hole theoretically proved the validity of superstring theory and may result in endless new perpetual energy sources, it also stained our Berber carpet.

As long as you don't try to fight during the transition period, it will not hurt.The only disadvantage to this cable over, say, one that normal people would buy, is the wasps.

Small demon spawn cables began shooting out of it and terrorizing the neighborhood. I read the box but couldn't find a warning about the water spilling, that was until I vaguely remembered the old guy that sold it to me saying something weird in Alienese. I Googled the gargle he blurted out and found that he did warn me, albeit in a third world dead language. His welcome call still haunts me \\"Bonjour\\", crazy dead language.

But... you have Gza-the roughest, ODB-the craziest, and RZA-the sharpest and in my opinion a damn sick M.C. But the most prominent and clever is the Method Man. This, his first solo was produced by the RZA. If you liked no. 9(Method Man) on 36 Chambers you will love this album. Not only are the beats rough and eerie(like I like 'em),the lyrics are a brilliant mixture of clever wordplay and down right sickness. On this album, Meth is the twisted guy buried deep within us all. For example-\\"I'll stab my own moms in the back for a sack, n!ggas like 'Damn, why you on it like that?' 'cuz I'm a dog and I got no love for the cat!\\" That's just an example of the man crossing the line, but you know you love it. My favorite joint is \\"Mr. Sandman.\\" And \\"PLO Style\\" is delightfully politically incorrect. Also reccomended: \\"Gravediggaz: Six Feet Deep.\\" Have you had your meth today?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tical Part.1 Pretty Tight.","review":"Meth's first album is good,but Meth rapping skills is tight. Don't get me wrong, I like the album, tracks 3,6,8,9&13 are tight and Carlton Fisk is a great newcomer. But the flaw is the cd is too damn short. We want more Meth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"method man!!!!","review":"method man is by far one of the best rappers ever to walk the face of the earth and he proves it yet once again on tical. i love this cd so much. ive always heard him on the wu tang cds and thought he was great but i never realized how great he was till i litsened to his solo albums. theyre amazing. all the songs are great on the cd from start to finish. so if you want to support some real hip hop...buy this album...you wont be disappointed trust me, its really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number of Standouts","review":"This whole album was produced by the RZA and as usuall he does not dissapoint.Method id probally my least favorite Wu rapper but he does not disapoint on this him he shows one hot Flow on here as I said there are a number of standout tracks on here there is also some more Grimey songs on this LP from 1994Standouts are \\"Busquites\\",\\"All I need\\", \\"What the Blood clot\\"\\"Release yo delf\\",\\"PLO Style\\" and \\"Mr Sandman\\".Lyrics-10/10 Production-10/10 X Factor-9/10 Classic-10/10 Replay-10/10 Total=10 out of 10 Fingers"},{"rating":"2","title":"what that ish you smokin?tical","review":"amazing album.classic wu tang one of the hottest cds ever created.best songs are tical,biscuits,relesase yo delf,meth vs chef,all i need,plo style and every other song on the album get this cd immediatly.top three wu tang w/ liquid swords and cuban linx"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Method Man Solo Album","review":"After taking the time to listen to this album recently I found myslef disliking Tical 2000 all the more because Method Man is definitely capable of groundbreaking work. I would have given this album 4.5 stars if I could because it is nearly perfect but not quite. The RZA influence is evident in the grimy but appealing production style. All of the tracks are solid but Bring the Pain, What the Blood Clot, and especially Release Yo' Delf stood out to me. Buy this album but please do not get confused and buy that Tical 2000...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing debut from a Wu Member","review":"Method Man isn't up there with my favorite Wu-Tang MC's so I was kind of hesitant to buy this but my gut said it'd pay off. It's a good thing I listened to my gut because Method Man totally blows you away on this.The first song kind of feels like a warm-up but the rest of the album has that excellent Wu-Tang production, other members are on here and do amazing with their rhymes. I really can't find much bad to say about this CD.I guess the one major thing to point out is that \\"All I Need\\" isn't the same song you're probably used to hearing on the radio with Mary J. Blige. \\"All I Need\\" on this album is Method Man going it alone and doing a really good job of it. If you like the Mary J. Blige version, you can get the single.Definitely recommended to fans of the Wu-Tang Clan and good rap music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't Happy","review":"Ordered on Christmas it still isnt here, guess Im not getting it...or anything else from there.definitly not satisfied at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buggin' on Bacardi and acid","review":"I think that this is the best Wu-Tang and Method Man solo album. This is when Meth and RZA were in their prime. I believe this album is very underrated. I admit the first time I listened to it I wasn't feeling it. After another spin I realize that this is a classic. Every track on here is stellar. My personal favorite song is \\"Sub Crazy\\", I noticed I haven't seen anyone else mention it. All of Method Man's other solo albums don't come close to this record. They are too mainstream, too many freatured artists, too poppy, etc. This album is more grimey and hardcore. When you are listening to it you can just picture the streets, violence, crime and drugs. Other stand out tracks are Meth vs. Chef, What the Blood Clot?, and Mr. Sandman. This is one of my favorite hip hop albums, and I am really picky when it comes to hip hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wu-Banga","review":"Another classic from the golden age of Wu-Tang, that being from 93-97.

Although they were descent on that album, they certainly weren't anything to jump up and down about. Two years later, they release The Self Science and move up another rung on the hip-hop ladder. DJ Khalil has done numerous projects for the underground and I must say that he's a genius with the production on this album. Undeniably, this album exposes the talents of DJ Khalil and MC Chace Infinite to the fullest. Give credit where credit is due, this album is diffently deserving of a double take. The whole album is something you can chill to and reflect upon the science.

I am a big underground hip hop fan. Some of my favorites are Del, Dialated Peoples, Kool Keith, J5, PB Wolf, Jeru the Damaja, and Cut Chemist. All of those artists are good becuase they like to have fun and they try different things to set themselves apart from the pack. I just found Self Science to bee too boring.

Of course my 4 year old daughter likes them and they are sturdy and light up, so whoa is me - I can't get rid of them (yet). No wonder they were free, I would want to get rid of all of them too.

Her drawings are unique and to put it simply, beautiful.Daddy's Girl is a collection of comic stories following a young girl as she tries to cope with her father's molestations and her relationships with her peers.The awkwardness of childhood is so perfectly re-created in this work.

I would have liked to know what happened next once she left her abusive house and went off on her own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book","review":"I've never been much for the underground comics style (purposefully ugly, almost Picasso-esque character designs with very hard lines, etc), but I didn't mind this one so much, since the underground style fit better with the story (two stories actually, the longer one about a girl who is molested by her father, the other about a girl who is raped by a pot-head) than, say, the cute character designs of Rumiko Takahashi's in her \\"Laughing Target\\" comic.As far as the story goes, it seems a little too familiar at times, but then there's always something in common in stories about abuse. The ending of the longer story is what sets this apart from the others, the author having come up with a way for the character to rise above the abuse and to become her own person again in an original way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harmonica Shah Got The Mojo!","review":"This is the first album that Harmonica Shah put out and does not get much feedback like the later ones.I have them all except for the latest one and they are all good in different ways.Motor City Mojo I would describe as a no frills blues album played with a lovely simplicity of style and absolutely no pyrotechnics or over flashy modern playing. It's the real deal low down and dirty blues.Don't be put off by the rather extreme lyrics of track one but don't play it for your mother in law or local priest !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too pricey","review":"I have mixed reviews on this Cranium product. Purchased after reading it was a \\"hot toy\\" for this season but found I'm rather luke-warm on it. First off, there is NO box to store this in! And the zip lock bag it comes in is a joke so be prepared to find something else to put all the parts and the SUV in. Secondly, ours doesn't always work properly. The trunk doesn't always register (even if you only put one item in and close it) and therefore says you have to try again. Thirdly, after a few rounds it becomes rather boring b/c you can quickly find out how to pack the items each time. Lastly, the price for this is way too high!I'm hoping the folks at Cranium get back on track. I bought the Sounds of Seashore Game before this one and it also is a big DUD. Don't buy that one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun for everyone","review":"I bought this for my 7 year old for Christmas. She wasn't that excited about it just seeing it in the box, but once I got her to play she hasn't wanted to stop! We have played it several times a day for the past 3 days and she doesn't seem to get bored with it. It is one that I don't mind playing over and over again with her, and it doesn't take long to play. It is alot of fun for the whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken?","review":"My 5 year old got this toy for Christmas. She was excited to get it, but right from the box we couldn't understand the excitement of the game. Maybe ours is broken? The trunk doesn't pop out every time. Maybe only 4 out of 10 times it actually works. Otherwise, it just starts over telling us to push the button to start packing. I am not impressed with the game. I also think for the amount of money paid, it should come with it's own storage system. Right now we have it stored in an old shoe box. Right now we have plans to return the game and pick out something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand this price...","review":"I bought this game off a shelf at a closing toy store for about $10...and I think I got ripped off paying that. This game is just bad...it might have started with a good idea but that was lost somewhere. The trunk is very small, so there's really only a limited number of configurations you can make with the items you're suppose to pack. Once you've mastered them, what's the point of the game? My kids never really played the game the right way, they were more interested in playing with the pieces separately...and for the price amazon is quoting, I'd be really annoyed if this game is what I got for that money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jam Pack Jam is loads of fun!","review":"I bought this toy as a gift for my 4 year old for him and his 6 year old brother to play. Well, the entire family got in on the action and it was lots of fun. The car is durable, but make sure you keep the enclosed bag for the cards and the items to pack or else.... Not a superior learning game but it does require some concentration and fine motor skills to pack all of the items in the trunk before time runs out. Overall, I would recommend this toy! It got lots of laughs on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute & fun","review":"I bought this last night for my kids and they had a blast!

It's chopped up so badly you can't even listen to it unless you really don't mind the scratching every time a curse word comes up, which is often enough to bother me.

At it's worst, some of the songs do share a recurring theme and backbeat-which is sadly similar to the way music is done today.

A must have album for any Slade Fans!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy","review":"I really wish this was available on DVD.

It is light years away from the old standard Lives of the Saints. The biographies are insightful, well-researched and by far the best that is out there right now. I have given it as a gift to many friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Interesting Mix of Exceptional People","review":"ALL SAINTS is similar in style to well known collection of saints biographies such as BUTLER'S LIVES OF THE SAINTS. His book, like Butler's, designates a saint for each day and has a biography that follows, but set up is where the similarity ends. The people in Ellsberg's collection of short biographies are not all canonized saints. While he includes many familiar saints such as Mary the Mother of God, St. Anthony of Egypt, St. Agnes, St. Patrick, St. Monica, and St. Augustine, he also includes non canonized people such as Dorothy Day, Dom Helder Camera, and Thomas Merton. Some of the people included are from religious traditions other than Christianity. Ellsberg includes them because their exceptional lives teach us virtue. Each biography gives the reader something to think about and can be a tool for both teaching and prayer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting book, misleading title","review":"As the subtitle indicates these are NOT \\"All Saints\\". So if you are looking for a book of biographical sketches of saints look elsewhere. If you consider Ghandi, Dr King and Dostoyevsky \\"saints\\" this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book disappoints","review":"On the rave reviews above, I made the mistake of buying this book thinking it could inspire me too. Despite all the talk, this book is NOT inclusive. There is no profile of anyone traditional in their faith, no Max Kolbe (who gave his life to save that of a Jew in Auschwitz), no Bernadette of Lourdes, no Blessed Kateri. But we do get Galileo, who in his spiritual life was sincere but not inspiring. He's included because he's a victim of the evil represented by the traditional Church. The author goes out of his way to stress his perceived narrowmindedness of the church. His bits on Biblical figures are very weak. I am surprised to find Stalin was not in this book. On the whole the thing reads like the manifesto of someone with a particular agenda and is tiresome beyond its trivial biographical detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting collection for the contemporary reader!","review":"Ellsberg has not only made wise choices, he has presented his saints, witnesses and modern day prophets in a concise readable format. We gather insights from the lives of contemporary greats such as Karl Rahner and Karl Barth, and spirituality from Chief Seattle whose wisdom has much to teach us (as do all the highlighted lives). Ellsberg gives us glimpses of holiness in people like Flannery O'Connor who commented, \\"There won't be any biographies of me because... life spent between the house and the chicken yard do not make exciting copy.\\" Each story begins with a quotation for those of us who appreciate a quote a day along with a short biographical sketch and ends with a reference at the bottom of each section. Ellsberg has truly compiled a \\"communion of saints\\" from all traditions that may very well be his contribution to a continuing ecumenical dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seller complaint","review":"The seller, TNT Nutrition, fraudulently misrepresented the product. The price for the 10-dose pack is nearly twice the cost of the 20-dose pack available from another Amazon seller.

The first third of this work follows the lead of the previous, it shows the four seasons and a decent number of example containers along with the dimensions and what it would take at the nursery to put it together. The final two thirds though is where it shines, the author provides a compact encyclopedia of container plants arranged by scientific name. The plus here is that they include information for each and every one on overwintering. Starting my garden in November in Zone 8 I found this information extremely useful when picking out my next project. Overall a very good offering, especially for the reference information contained therein. For further reading, I suggest Hillier's book [for great ideas/examples], and David Joyce's for classification based on color."},{"rating":"1","title":"MATRIX PLUS WEST WORLD","review":"A group of people dressed as slaves find themselves suddenly transferred to an old west town with no memory of who they are. They have cards which claim they are killers. They are captured and placed in scenarios where they must kill to survive. Killing is done under rules. Michael Lewis ( Keir Dullea ) is the main character. He emerges from the group and the controllers of the game take a special interest in him.Mean while the real body of Michael Lewis is laying down and is wired up. Considering that movies have come out with similar themes, better effects, and better scripts, I wouldn't waste a lot of money on this one. It is available on poorly transferred DVD sci-fi collections.Parental Guide: No f-bombs or nudity. One quick on screen love scene and one off screen rape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could we have some evidence please?","review":"However warm, enlightened and positive you feel about villifying men while placing mother, as always, on a pedestal, the fact is these cases should not be based on anything at all to do with the sex of the accused or the accuser. It should be decided on the merits. And to say that the female/mother is a tragic victim and the male a brutal abuser is all the evidence I need you can't get a fair trial in America today.Evidence would be nice, save the emotionalism, those would be my thoughts should I be the accused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women are not saints","review":"I have a tremendous amount of difficulty with Phyllis Chesler. It's true that abusive fathers do get custody because they manipulate the court system however not all fathers are that way. She refuses to acknowledge that there are abusive mothers who manipulate the system to get custody. After reading this book and her book about Mary Beth Whitehead she sees women as saints and men as evil. Unfortunately the family court system when I was a kid had that attitude and I was forced to live with a manipulative, narcissistic mother who did a tremendous amount of damage when I would have been better off with my father getting custody. While the family court system does need to be repaired people need to realize that some children are better off with their fathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading this book is an example of time dilation","review":"The style: a clever high-school student's essay. Formulaic. Exhaustive. The writing: from one professor to another. Cold. Impressive unnecessary vocabulary usage. Goal: to reinforce in five hundred examples what you already know about time duration. It's like a pointless term paper posing as a breakthrough academic study. I guess I was expecting something stimulating about how our brain creates \\"time\\" through processes and orders. Turns out the title was the only thing clever about the book. But it is relatively short, so if you're bored and want to personally experience the warping of minutes into hours..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a nice try!","review":"The proofs are sketchy and the text contains many mistakes and typos.

These guys continue to push the boundaries of hip-hop and electronic music to great new heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent collection of instrumentals from Company Flow","review":"Bee aware (sorry, couldn't resist) that this is an instrumental album, but don't let that scare you away. Folks who give poor reviews of this release must have a short attention span--lyrics are nice, but they're not everything. How many producers can relate a story--even one as short and simple as Little Johnny's--to the listener through almost nothing but beats and scattered vocal samples? El-P and Mr. Len certainly can. Various elements of each track enter into the picture at different times, sometimes sounding discordant and misplaced, until they all fall into a context that works as a whole. El-P further develops this technique in his production of Cannibal Ox's The Cold Vein (which you should also pick up).Standout tracks are \\"Bee Aware\\", the spacey but painfully short \\"# Nine\\", and the hellish \\"Happy Happy Joy Kill.\\" Any fans of the production on Funcrusher Plus should thorougly enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a shame","review":"What we must all realize is that one of the most important reasons people loved Co-Flow's \\"Funcrusher\\" was because of the lyrics. The never-ending one liners were what really made it a classic, though the beats were undeniably funky, dark, and all around great. That being said, when one sees an all instrumental album from Co-Flow you know you won't be able to hear any jewels of hip-hop wisdom, but you do expect a certain level of bang on the beats. These instrumentals for the most part seem boring and tired, as if they were beats not deemed good enough for the \\"Funcrusher\\" album. I expected alot from this album and instead got rather boring tracks that went on for too long. Normally I could excuse this, but these are too lazy to even freestyle to, which is the main reason I pick up instrumental albums. \\"Little Johnny\\" is a big disappointment, if its instrumentals you want, pick up El-P's \\"Fan Dam Plus\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought this album used without realizing it was an instrumental cd. So when I got it home I was expecting soo much more. The beats are NOT good enough to lay down the cash on this cd. Theyre good, dont get me wrong, but I wouldn't pay money to hear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DISAPPIONTMENT","review":"I happen to think that \\"Funcrusherplus\\" may be the best hip-hop album ever. For those of you who are fans of Company Flow, the \\"Little Johnny From...\\" album, will be a huge disappointment. For those of you wanting to MC, pick it up and get some good beats. Don't waste you time other wise. Without the tight lyrics from El-P and Bigg Jus the album is nothing more then a reminder that Co. Flow has a strong original sound. Don't waste your money, get something you'll actually listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calendula Oil","review":"I like the calendula oil.

Nothing new here. It mostly consists of advice on how to get up and running on a poker site, with constant plugs of the site that Doyle endorses.

There is no knowledge here that is unique or will help your game at all. It teaches you things like how to download software, what online poker is, etc. etc.. I got nothing out of it. To add insult to injury, there is a CD ROM for his own website's poker room at the end to advertise his own site.

If you are experienced at all with online poker, however, there is not much that it has to offer. There is nothing in the book that one cannot learn in a short time by simply getting online and playing. Mr. Brunson has a folksy charm that comes through in his book, yet he tends to repeat the same message time and again in slightly different ways when he is trying to make a point. Although a pleasant and interesting read by a former two-time world champion, it lacks the necessary ingredients to help you bring your game along to a strong competitive level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what a bad book!","review":"It's a good thing I got this at the library, because I'd be mad if I paid money for this book.

A scene at the airport where Emily was going to go away for a couple of months... She hugged her friends, cried, walked a few steps, came back and hugged them again telling them how much she loved them. She acted as if she was never coming back. Get real!

As a runner of over 27 years it is hard to comprehend how Mr. Stark accomplished his incredible feat.However, this just wasn't about running. This was a true tale of Americana that you just cannot put down. My husband, also an avid runner picked up on a Sunday and finished it the same day, stopping only to eat dinner.I am also a frequent flier and have shared this story with fellow passengers. I won't let anyone borrow it though. They have to buy it for themselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! This is an awesome book!","review":"Ok, so as the author of the book I'm a little biased.

Along the way I got lost, got chased, and found America through a life-changing trip across the country at six miles per hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"An anatomy of love","review":"This is a most wonderful, erudite exploration.

I ordered it 2 weeks ago and it was supposed to ship after 1-2 weeks. Well I got an e-mail from Amazon saying the delivery estimate was being pushed back another 2 weeks. 1 month just to get a magazine. No company should be that slow. If they are saying the have inventory and do not and are basing these estimates on when new inventory is coming in then they should be listing it as OUT OF STOCK!!!! So likely I will wait another 2 weeks to get another e-mail saying they are pushing back the ship date again. I will never try ordering a magazine here again. I wonder how bad the subscriptions are?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some laid-back West Coast beauty...","review":"The Dove Shack come correct, no doubt about it. Laid-back vocals and R&B crooning, Warren G producing some of his best work, and rarely any filler. Coming out on the late end of the g-funk spectrum, BoRoc, C-Knight and 2 Scoops released an album that was tight, rideable and at times even danceable. Between the friendly, dance-floor grooves of \\"This is the Shack\\" and \\"Summertime in the LBC,\\" they put gangsta blues like \\"There'll Come a Day\\" and hardcore tracks like \\"Bomb Drop.\\" There's something on this album to satisfy just about anyone, even if it's the skit near the middle... all I'll say is it's entitled, \\"Slap-a-Hoe.\\" Funny stuff... check this album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"creme de le creme...","review":"i too grew up in long beach on 20th and remember these guys talkin about gettin big on warrens label. it really is a good album and i think they summed up what east long beach life is in an album. listenin to this record reminds me of growin up on the eastside and all the fun that came with it like drinkin old english in king park. it relaxes you yet pumps you up, its g-funk, and its pure."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Shack","review":"This album dropped at the perfect time. The LBC was blowin up thanks to Snoop & GW during this time, and the spotlight happened to catch a glimpse of the Dove Shack. They put together a very solid album.

And yet, while the others are handing out the stars they say such things as: \\"quiet\\", \\"subdued\\", \\"not live\\", \\"not their best work\\". I am very disappointed in this album. The symphonic arrangements do not swing, and it feels like the quartet are holding back, to an extreme degree.I attribute a lot of this subdued and \\"not live\\" feeling to the fact that the symphony orchestra was recorded half way around the world from the singers, who then sang karaoke to the recorded tracks. I wonder if they had any input at all to how the orchestra played.I have no interest in ever hearing this album again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"1. The only thing that's more disappointing than this complete dud are those who actually think this is a good album. I've seen these guys several times and they are the premire vocal jazz group.

I just can't believe it because it's so bad and such an embarrassment.2. A warning to all serious fans, avoid this dud at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety of Latin music","review":"Contrary to what one might think from the title, this is not exclusively a collection of Cuban music that one usually associates with stereotypical, frenetic, Afro-Caribbean rhythms. To the contrary, this CD covers a wide range of tempos from the fast to the contemplative, and everything in between.The disc turned out to be better than I had hoped. The music ranges from the upbeat (such as \\"Cumbanchera\\") through the classic jazz styled \\"Siboney\\" by Ruben Gonzalez to the unusual: \\"Gaucho\\" by Gustavo Santolalla, played exclusively on what sounds like a harp and guitar, plucked high on the neck.In short, this is easy on the ear, with enough variety and artistic skill to make it a worthwhile addition to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No power in semi","review":"Maybe mine is not working properly, but the semi barely has enough power to go on the floor, never mind climbing up over the dirt hill, the idea is cute and the barrels exploding off the dirt hill works well, if you can get the truck to go up and over.

Then it just got repetitive. While you do breakm a sweat, she only teaches you eight moves and the background music is not fly. They seem to repeat moves over and over and then surprise: its over.

When I first heard the record, I was blown away how all the songs sounded so different, yet still worked together. \\"Mr. Charm\\" is this hyper upbeat track that reminds me of Futureheads or the Jam. \\"Life's Cornucopia\\" is this very introspective haunting track that sounds like no other band I've heard. There's not a bad track on this record. It goes from hazy, clowdy day music to super-blue-sky pop. You could put each track on a different mixtape. Later, I got online and learned that they were all 20 and recorded all the tracks themselves. I have spent years recording my own music and can't get the clarity and effect these guys have. I've heard they are awesome live, unfortunately I live in California and they haven't made their way out here yet.

Sounds great, doesn't it ? One would think so, however, this album falls short of a solid, quality LP from this East coast funklord. Despite the standout tracks \\"Tell em'\\", \\"Set it Off\\", \\"Focus\\", and a fantastic appearance by Redman on \\"Move on\\", the remainder of the album is just filler and not-so-fresh crossover attempts. Although great for mixtape compilations, \\"Double or Nothing\\" leaves an empty feeling inside your soul, dissapointed by not getting what you expected. Ask yourself, \\"Did I really know in the first place?\\" Probably not. Peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"exceptional...","review":"\\"Double Or Nothing\\" has some of the deepest production sound of any hip hop album of the nineties.

Well-balanced, strong characters, vicious bad guys, and a sexy lead man. Aunt Louise, with her platoon of stray youngsters, is a feisty, determined character. Ella is a strong-minded, independant, determined young woman. I had a problem with Harrigan's lack of trust, but this is clarified quite neatly later on. The love scenes are steamy, poignant and tender. I would definitely buy another of Hannah Howell's novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One","review":"I'm usually a big fan of Hannah Howell's books, but I found this one to be a waste of money and time.

I will think long and hard before buying any more books from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"I am a big fan of Hannah Howell's, but this book is just terrible. I find books where the romance is love at first sight unsatisfying at best and completely out of the realm of possibility at worst. This book is the latter.

This book seems like it's intended for people who are looking to visit the city, so it has the depth of a AAA travel guide. It does get rather in depth to what the people of Syracuse look like, which is pretty stupid, since people from Syracuse look pretty much the same as people in other cities. It does show some landmarks of the city, but does little to explain their reason for being. To top it off, most of the photos in this book will be dated in 5 years - the list of companies in the end already is.

The collection contains many traditional folk stories and several poems from Ireland. The stories are entertaining, and some contain folk wisdom in their morals. Many are told in dialect, with some Irish words left intact. The similarities between these tales and folk tales around the world is striking, though of course characters such as the banshee and leprachaun are distinctly Irish. There is a strong Christian influence in these stories, which makes an interesting blend with the older Druidic elements. I found them entertaining, and they definately are distinctly Irish.

Even more interesting were the attitudes of other Muslim women to the choices made by the converts.I loved Deen's book \`Broken Bangles', where she journeyed from her home of Perth in Western Australia to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, investigating the place of women in those societies.

Bianchi's black and white photography of exceptional men and women is worthy of gracing the polished tops of coffee tables in the most sophisticated, progressive living rooms. My wife and I return to Bianchi's stills every so often to day dream about what a life must be like where friends are beautiful, without shame and guilt, open and honest, and relaxed enough to exhibit their sexuality in both light and shadow. This book is highly recommended for collectors of fine figure photography. Be prepared: Mr. Bianchi is a Michaelangelo in the medium of silver nitrate; he, too, is unashamed of celebrating the human body--regardless of being man or woman. Be prepared for a trip to the borderlands of erotic and personal freedom, gender and sexual expression.-- Louis Varricchi"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gut-wrenching yet remarkable book","review":"This is the kind of well-written book you'll read in 24 hours but think about for weeks.

The author, Jedwin Smith, gives us a rare insight into the long-term effects a family endures and also allows us to go along on his painful and emotional journey toward some sense of healing. Without disclosing elements of the book, be advised there is a reconciliation late in the book that is unique, remarkable and inspirational.We must never forget the sacrifices veterans made for our country, but this book also reminds us to never forget the sacrifices the families of these veterans made as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Haunting, Healing Journey","review":"Our Brother's Keeper is a riveting saga about the universal struggle of loss and redemption, albeit on a tragic, war-ravaged scale. The author's writing is so brutally honest, his grief so palpable, and his personality so humbly engaging that the reader finds himself willingly accompanying the author into his hellish pit of anger and addiction. Yet it's this same brutal honesty that keeps a tight grip on the reader's hand, pulling author and reader alike to safety. The end of the journey is so remarkable it has only one explanation--and each reader must discover this for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"Since I believe the 30's are the new 20's, I generally like to wear as little as possible for a night on the town.The strapless, off-the shoulder or low necked attire that I prefer usually requires some sort of \\"hidden\\" support. Especially with a thirty year old bosom! I like the fact that this bra has a very low back, stays up perfectly, even after a night of sweaty dancing, and has boning that stays in shape even after being washed repeatedly for a year.I totally love this bra. It fits great and is perfect, especially under sweaters. The only issues I have with this bra are the high price, and the excess of padding in the cups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly thought out","review":"I would have to agree with a previous \\"reviewer\\" and say that the book itself is written quite well, but Merril states certain things that are obviously not true and can be picked up by almost any sunday school student. For instance, he states that three, maybe four, of the twelve tribes of Israel left Egypt at once and met up later, before the Ten Commandments were given. This, obviously cannot be true because the book of Exodus itself that all twelve tribes left together. His Biblical flaws aside, his writing was good, making the book easy to read and I believe that most of his dates were right on target. It could be hard for some people to ignore his Biblical ignorance, however, and I suggest that those people do not read this book looking for an indepth study, survey and education of the Old Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biblically contradicting","review":"I found the writing style in this book very well developed but the theology and Biblical ideas of it were glaring contradictions of specific things in the Bible.

The author does relay dozens and dozens of scary stories about Hubbard but doesn't offer any believable explanation as to the huge following for Hubbard and Scientology.The book is primarily some kind of reprisal from the author against Scientology and Hubbard personally. The author gives horror stories about his own experience but doesn't give us any view into why he apparently was an adherent to this religion for so long. Ultimately, it comes off like a 60 Minutes attack piece - just one side of a story and no indication of what the victim actually did to deserve the attack.I would give it at least a 2 because it is partially autobiographical and I would assume that the author got the stuff about his own life correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Target: Funded Black Propeganda to snare Intellectualists","review":"I reviewed the sources of the material and information depicted in this book; an independent investigation agency. My results, which I feel is my duty to share, is that of a funded effort to undermine an orginization who might be able to give those with intellectual talents to much freedom. Who ever funded this book, had intrests in intellectualists gaining to much control in their own activities. This obviously scares the \\"investors\\". By doing so, the \\"investors\\" know what they are more likely to believe by what they have fed intellectualists in the past by dissinformaiton campains. Therefore, it is not my recomendation that you believe what is in this book, it hints at some new anti-self-impovement campain."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have ever come across","review":"Any time or money wasted in this book would be better spentlooking at an empty wall. For this book is empty of any truths orrealisms. This is made up stuff and is a work of fiction. Anyone that wants the truth needs to pick up the book Dianetics and use it, they will see that it works to better your life without fail. The name of the author fits, it is an \\"Atack\\" on a book that has helped millions of people to run there lives better. Any more said on Atack's book would be more waste of my time. If anybody wants it for there collection I will sell it to them for 10 cents, hurry before I though it away.with the rest of the rotten trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias and bile never make for good reading","review":"I found the book so one-sided and self-serving after a cursory glance that I decided not to read it. That the book was found to defame someone is of little surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another useless book about Scientology","review":"I read this book already some years ago. It is - as the many others on the subject - full of biased \\"information\\" and seems to serve only one purpose: The childish revenge of a certain Mr. Atack on an organization which didn't want to deal with his bad manners and deceitful character and threw him out. What else can be expected by apostates?! To get an idea of the scriptures of Scientology I recommend to check for primary literature in libraries, any Scientology organization (There is plenty of them and they can be found in the phone book) or at amazon.com using keyword search \\"L. Ron Hubbard\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth A Read For Anyone Interested","review":"I read and enjoyed this book. It's a must-read for anyone interested in or involved with Scientology. I have a lot of respect for Atack's courage in speaking his mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scientology exposed","review":"Atack exposes Hubbard's bizarre imagination and behavior, tracing the creation of Scientology in the years following World War II to perhaps its final schism following Hubbard's death in 1986. A shocking book that reveals all: the abuses, falsehoods, paranoia, and greed of Hubbard and his pseudo-military Scientologist henchmen.(The above is the publisher's synopsis, which I fully agree with)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Courageous Book, Fascinating & Sad","review":"This is a wonderful book by a brave man. If you really want to know about this subject this book has a very wide range of information. This is a most important book and could be the best investment you ever make if you want to protect your loved ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written.","review":"The author should go back to doing whatever it was he was doing before attempting to write. Poorly researched and poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Piece of Blue Sky","review":"This from an impartial look at this book. I checked out both side, I saw what the book wanted to do and was curious. I was quite disappointed, a waste of time, sorry but I am frank. The message is hard to get at and none of the facts, after I did my own investigations turn out to be true. A let down folks. If you want the truth about something, the best source is always the source."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little piece of insanity written down.","review":"One day it was suggested to Jon that he take a little responsibility for his life and bad effects he had ever brought to the world and low-and-behold, it suddenly became L. Ron Hubbard's fault for his lot in life. This book is full of false information and very unintelligent conclusions. Good ol' Jon didn't do much homework on the subject before writting this (...).If you want to know about L. Ron Hubbard or Scientology, go find out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"This book exposes Scientology and Dianetics, L. Ron Hubbard'sreligion, for what they are. I should know, I was once aScientologist. I had read Dianetics and What is Scientology? and I wanted to try it out. What a mistake! I now wish I had never even gone to their organization. As soon as I realized that this \\"religion\\" was nothing more than a fantasy that could never happen, I never had anything ot do with it again besides reading books like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A chilling but well-written book...","review":"I found this book incredibly well-documented, and exremely unsettling. I feel sorry for anyone who becomes involved with this highly litigious, chillingly Orwellian-reminiscent, avaricious group. And am grateful for the people brave enough to write or say anything against it, as these people begin a smear campaign (amongst other things) on anyone who they perceive as an enemy (see: anyone who criticizes Scientology in any way).This book gives proof, meticulous proof, of L. Ron Hubbard's tendency toward paranoia and pathological lying. But, he was a clever liar, he made sure to sprinkle little truths in every lie to make it believable. As a future scientist I find it an abomination that this cult be referred to as a science in any way.If you are interested at an in depth, and truthful look at the cult of Scientology, look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"A disturbing look into the \\"religion\\" of Scientology","review":"This is a must read for anyone wondering what Scientology is all about. It is obvious why Scientology tried their best to keep this book from being published; I applaud Atack for his courage in getting this information to the public.Another good book to read on this subject is \\"Bare-Faced Messiah\\" by Russell Miller who does the preface for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent expose","review":"An excellent expose of an insidious and dangerous cult which bases its \\"religion\\" upon the paranoia and self glorification of a proven charlatan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched and written, an essential for cult critics","review":"Mr. Atack has written a very informative and well researched book about the Scientology Cult, exposing crimes and haressement of critics. The book gives a coherent understanding of the discussion going on in the news-group alt.religion.scientology. What is not covered though is the infamous OT III material, describing the Space Emperor Xenu and how he solved the overpopulation problem on earth some 75 million years ago. It is quite telling that scientologist often state that the book is full of errors and misconceptions, yet they fail to point these errors out. Not very surprising, as what is published in the book, fully referenced, are official Scientology documents that have appeared unchallanged in several court cases. Buy it and support a good cause (or rather buy two, and give one to a friend). And, by all means read (but don't buy) some of Hubbards works as well. You'll be amused.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent expose' on the evil cult of Scientology","review":"By far one of the best investigative literature on one ofthe most diabolical criminal cults in existance today.I highly recomend this book to everyone who is interestedin finding out what Scientology is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"This was a very interesting book. Someone in my life was (maybe still is) involved in [...] and that's what piqued my interest in the subject. I love the Scientologists reviewing this book here. Are there grammar and spelling lessons in Dianetics? Just wondering.Self-help? Fine. Charging money for the service? By all means! I love capitalism. But don't call it a religion. The book was a bit slow in spots, but very eye-opening."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big turd.","review":"One would think, from all the negative portrayals of Scientology in the reviews, that there must be a bunch of dead bodies laying around in Scientology. But...nothing more interesting is revealed in this book than accusations of greed. And please note that all the former \\"Scientologists\\" commenting here were kicked out of the church for unethical behavior--some of them for sexual misbehavior. People usually attack their accusers, in an attempt to descredit the charges against them. Remember the guy who said, \\"I did not have sex with that woman, that Miss Lewinsky\\"? Hmmm..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Build your own oppinion of Scientology, not this one!!!","review":"I read this book before I read What is Scientology, written by L.Ronald Hubbard. I will make an analogy to compare the difference in information that I found:If you want to know about Christianity would you read books written by someone who attacks it or would you read the original texts like the bible and then build your own oppinion?I strongly suggest you read books by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. See what it is, and decide for yourself. If I had not read any original books from L. Ron Hubbard, I would have missed a lot of great information.Again, see what it is for real, and then build your own oppinion. This book doesn't help you find out what Scientology is."},{"rating":"1","title":"my personal experience","review":"I have been a Scientologist for many years now. I have had parts of this book read to me by \\"concerned\\" relatives. Even if the thing this book brings up are true, which I have yet to be able to confirm any, I don't see the searing hatred justified. For example, the news about the GO's office having problems within it and Hubbard's ex-wife being in that office. So what? My life is far better off from Hubbard's works. What about the claim that people experienced in Scientology have gone through confessionals and are warning people that the point of the confessionals is to bribe people. Honestly, how could someone go through rigorous confessionals and publically issue crazy warnings like that? It doesn't make sense if you think about it. I could walk away from any or all of it any time I wish. True statement. I would not trade the wins I have had from Scientology for anything. True statement."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like this book.","review":"It reads like a vendetta. There should be some balance of good with the bad in any biography. L. Ron obviously had SOME good ideas, or rational people like Travolta and Cruise wouldn't admire him so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time and energy! YACK!","review":"I didn't get anything useful out of this book at all! It felt more like just sitting there and listening to a person justifying to himself and others that he was expelled from a group. I have read \\"A new slant on life\\" and \\"Fundamentals of thought\\" in order to get a better idea of what Hubbard and Scientology is all about. That makes a lot more sense to me and I can recommend others to do the same if they want to get a better understanding. These books have helped me a lot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Discreditable Intentions","review":"This book should be entitled \\"A Flight of Wild Hallucination\\". It would appropriately describe the state of mind of its writers. Their intentions are none but discreditable.I have examined the actual materials of Scientology, and what I found left my mouth hanging agape. Scientology is a religion because it addresses man as a spiritual being, but within that framework of religion the subject consists of technology, technology that restores to the individual his native abilities. Scientology is about the recovery of ability. This technology is quick, precise, exact, and invariable in result. Such thing has never existed before in the history of the world.Scientology completely obsoletes and makes unnecessary such earlier failed subjects as psychology and psychiatry.The technology of Scientology works.Of course the writers of this book smear Scientology. They would attack any betterment activity. That is their essential nature. They are cowards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorance","review":"I have been checking Scientology for over 20 years.

When it arrived we discovered the inside had quite a bit of silicone sealant in it in addition to plastic parts. I refused to use it so husband took it to work.In the end we bought the $30 Aroma model at Target and so far love it. I washed it and boiled a couple of pots of water to prep it.

Heats water at the speed of light, holds a lot and it looks good to boot. Great product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good While it Lasted","review":"I am a tea-a-holic. This was a great way to avoid the tea kettle on the stove or watching a pot boil, plus, this item is small enough to take with you; I used it at my parent's house and in a hotel. My problem, however, is that it just quit working; I had the unit less than 3 months. All contacts were clean and the light indicator would come on, but, the kettle wouldn't heat. WHile I say I drink a lot of tea, the unit was only getting used in the morning for my first cup and then occasionally at night for another cup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops working in 6 months","review":"While I liked the tea kettle, I was disappointed that it stopped working in less than six months. Amazon provided a partial refund since the appliance included a one-year warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it.","review":"I drink a lot of iced tea and use a plunger to make coffee. This kettle is terrific. Heats up fast, has an automatic shutoff mechanism so I don't worry about overboiling or fire, and being cordless, it's easy to fill and pour. I've had mine for almost a year and no sign of trouble yet. The exterior does get hot, but the handle stays cool. One thing: I live in an area with extremely hard water, so it's a good idea to boil white vinegar diluted with a little tap water in the kettle once in a while to get rid of mineral buildup. I highly recommend this kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"This was a perfectly acceptable unit until it quit heating one morning just after the one year warranty was up. According to the service center, it would cost me more for shipping and repairs than to buy a new one. Hate to see things just go in the dump. I will replace, but not with a Chef's Choice product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chef's Choice Is Not My Choice","review":"I'm now starting my third quest to find a well made,long lasting electric kettle. I've had 2 of the Chef's Choice 677. Figured the 1st one was a fluke as it barely lasted a year. I did not purchase it on Amazon. The spout drips as you pour and scale does collect around the bottom. I'm going to spend a bit more time researching and hope to come up with the best cup of tea around yet! I think Krups is going to be the winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short a life-span...not happy about the online purchase...","review":"The kettle was great while it lasted, which was about a year and a half. Off late I noticed quite a bit of rust at the bottom of the kettle. Unfortunately the manufacturer only extends a one year warranty, which in my opinion is weak. Since it is a direct purchase from the manufacturer (through Amazon) replacing the kettle has been a problem. The manufacturer's customer service keeps harping about how to clean the kettle and refers to pages in the owners manual. I wish I had purchased this from a retailer, who would typically either replace it, or would at least would have the decency to offer a promotion to help me replace the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted...","review":"The kettle was good while it lasted in that it boiled water quickly and reliably. I didn't notice any silicon taste to the water that others have reported, but then again, I'm not very sensitive about those issues.The problem is that one and a half years after purchasing this device, small bits of the black plastic that the trim is made of started breaking off of the interior and falling into the water. I have no idea how many pieces of this plastic I had ingested before I noticed a particularly large one: 1/8\\" square.It is out of warranty so I have to buy a new one and it certainly wont be Chef's Choice (the brand) or anything else made by EdgeCraft (the actual manufacturer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended-I've Bought Two","review":"I use my kettle at least once per day. I have purchased two of these Chef's Choice kettles and have taken good care of them both. Neither of the two has lasted longer than two years. The warranty is only good for one year. This is pretty annoying, as these kettles are rather expensive. The kettle is attractive and sturdy and I liked the cordless feature. My next kettle will not be a Chef's Choice due to the short product life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a dud","review":"Defective right out of the box, would not heat up at all. Now have to spend 20 bucks returning this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"No staying power","review":"I loved this kettle for 13 months. Just one month longer than the warranty. Now it lights up and nothing. No heat. I thought one of the advantages of an electric kettle would be that I wouldn't have to replace it every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Garbage","review":"I had initially reviewed this kettle after I bought it and gave it 4 stars because it worked. After about a year of use the switch died. It doesn't turn itself off after the water boils making it a worthless bit of trash. It's unfortunate that a company can charge nearly $50 dollars for a tea kettle that dies after a ridiculously short amount of time. Don't waste your money on this kettle. There are cheaper ones out there that do the same and work and don't become land fill sooner than it should. If this is an indication of the quality this company puts put, stay away from anything called Chef's Choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNSATISFACTORY ODOR PRODUCED","review":"I received this tea kettle as a Christmas present from my daughter. I immediately noticed that it produced a foul odor and taste to my tea. No amount of cleaning with detergent, vinegar, baking soda, you name it, has been able to reduce the odor and taste. In fact, you can smell the same odor inside the kettle even when empty. In comparison, I have an older GE kettle which makes an excellent cup of tea. If you are particular regarding the taste of your tea, don't buy the Chef'sChoice 677!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky and heavy!","review":"I've had several electric kettles over the years, and this is the first one I felt compelled to send back. The handle was hard to grip, as it is too wide and ackwardly shaped--even my husband, who has average size hands--thought so. And it was heavy, even without the water in it. Also, the sensor that tells it to shut off when the water boils, was slow to activate so it boiled for almost a minute before shutting off. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Concerns","review":"I received this as a gift about a year ago. It has had rather light use but has recently developed a substantial leak through the bottom of the heating unit. Water also pools around the electric switch pad on the counter and also around the top of the electric switch pad. I think that this is unsafe and will get another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post Mortem Chef's Choice Review (10 + years of awesome)","review":"I don't do a lot of reviews, but today I had to give my five star memorial to this awesome tea kettle. Sure, if it had worked flawlessly forever that would be better, but how can you honestly ask for that these days? 10+ years of tea on demand (and I drink a lot of tea) is enough for me to eulogize and even consider repurchasing (but will check out upgrade possibilities first, sorry Chef's Choice but I am leaving this review :-)If the product has not changed since I bought this beauty, then I can say with 100% certainty, yes, buy this tea kettle. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Failures","review":"I have owned two Chef's Choice Teakettles, one for home, and one for a summer cottage. Both failed miserably. The first one developed a leak at the plastic switch, so I replaced it with a Breville model, and am completely satisfied. Yesterday, on my second Chef's Choice kettle, the plastic (very cheap!) lever suddenly stopped working. After removing the bottom of the kettle, I discovered that the plastic lever had snapped in half. (Two seniors carefully using both of them!) I ordered a new Breville two days ago, and it was delivered today. How could Chef's Choice make such a beautiful stainless steel teakettle, then add such a cheap plastic lever? I loved the Chef's Choice, but would never again buy one of their products. If you want quality, buy a Breville product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Fast Hot Water Kettle","review":"The unit was as advertised and does a rapid job of heating to boiling water. The product was delivered rapidly and in excellent condition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electric plug failure","review":"This electric kettle worked just fine for a little over a year. Then the plug overheated and started melting and smoking at the outlet. The outlet was ruined. This failure could have caused serious damage or a fire. Extremely disappointing!! THIS ITEM SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE MARKET!!!!!! I would like to hear from the manufacturer!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Item","review":"I first ran into a hot pot while deployed in the middle east. It was great because it heated water in seconds because of the 220 volts. When I returned back to the states I had to see if I could find one and I did. Not as quick to heat up water as the one in the middle east, but it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Teakettle is not acceptable","review":"The major problem is after boiling water the metal sides are so hot and you can easily burn yourself if you touch them. This is dangerous. In addition, the top does not open wide enough to pour the water straight in from a faucet, the water level viewer is not on the side where it can be seen easily, but in back of the handle and it is not clear plastic ( hard to see level). The quantity level is in liters, not cups, even though it is called a 1-3/4-Quart teakettle. The numbers are hard to read behind the handle. Minor point: the model I ordered showed chrome color with black trim. I was sent one with gray trim and a silver top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad but true!","review":"I was so sad to see that the reviews that I read were very true. I liked the style of the kettle, so I threw the reviews to the wind and got it anyways. Mine didn't even work for 6 weeks and it started to not shut off consistently. One day it does, one day it doesn't. You can't trust a kettle that way. We still use it because I spent a lot on it and I can't find a pot that I like the shape of better but now we have to stand and wait for it to boil or constantly check back. And by the way it boils VERY slow. All in all I can't possibly give it a good review."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lid falls off after about 3 months","review":"I bought this kettle. Love it EXCEPT, the lid is attached to the kettle with plastic so the heat from boiling/steam finally broke the attachments on each side of the lid.

I've had this over two years and used daily.CONS: The inside has started to RUST (so I'm throwing it out). As other reviewers noted, the mechanism for opening the lid is somewhat flimsy. The mechanism on mine BROKE after 1.5 years, so I had to manually open to add water and hold lid when pouring (not good as lid gets hot!)There is also pitting around the top (I've only used water in this unit).The interior rusting is a health issue. Who knows how long it was rusting before I saw the rust-- terrible!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a shame","review":"When i got this, i was very excited. It worked wonderfully for like six months. Then the honeymoon period wore off. First the on/off button wouldnt work. Fortunatley, it broke in the on position. Then later, the lid latch wouldnt stay closed, so now its always open. Finally, leaks are appearing along the base. It was a quick and torid romance, but now I'm back to shopping around for the perfect electric tea kettle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major con: blisteringly hot","review":"A major con is that insulation is insufficient. The metal exterior is blisteringly hot. (I have had similar kettles made of plastic before - they also are hot to the touch when water is heated, but not so hot that you can almost blister your skin if you accidentally touch it - like touching a metal pan right on the stove). It is a pity, because otherwise the design is very nice. (I returned my kettle because I couldn't live with this problem)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Kettle, misleading specs","review":"This kettle is a decent one, saves time on boiling liquids for whatever purpose. However the specs say 1700 watts, and the actual rating is 1500. I had bought this kettle primarily because of the higher wattage on the spec for hopefully faster speed, but no dice. Its the same as all the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but Expensive","review":"Nice functional design, fast heating. A lot to like.Got mine in 2008.

Has not been an issue.Spout Dribble: Rarely. Maybe 2 drops onto kettle side if it's full.Defects: We have one issue after 2.5 years.

See my review of that kettle ( http://www.amazon.com/review/R1AEZ24PC1PZXS/ ) for a detailed comparison. The Hamilton Beach is very similar, a little less nice, but a much better value.

It works - there's not a lot of difference in the way any of these models operate. Pros - separate base, capacity window, attractive styling. Cons - lid opening is 4\\", which is a good size, but it does not separate from body (like my old Cuisinart), outside surfaces are hot (like my old Cuisinart; does somebody actually make an electric kettle where the outside DOES NOT get hot?)

When I misplaced it during a move I reordered the identical kettle for all the same reasons.

Given the ease of the mechanics it can ONLY be the kettle itself. I cleaned the filter etc. etc. but no go. It's like listening to nails on a chalkboard and even my cat runs from the room in horror when it's on.

I like the look of this kettle, but there are three problems that make it not worth the price. 1) It occasionally has a high-pitched wistle when it's heating water. Loud and annoying. 2) The area were you fill it with water is narrow and makes it difficult to fill up. 3) The sides of the pot get very hot. Individually, these are all problematic. Together, it makes it a pretty disappointing purchase.My old non-metallic kettle was cheaper and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted...","review":"This kettle is great for atleast a year. If you use it as much as I do (boiling water at least twice to three times a day), then you can be assured that the hinge at the lid will break, which causes the lid to not close which causes the kettle to happily keep boiling away because the automatic shut-off relies on the lid being closed completely, the partially broken hinge gives you false assurance that the lid is closed, but not close enough.. ! This is after a year and a half of use. Whereas my husbands old screw cap kettle works a charm even after 8 years of use.The good thing about this is that you can remove it from the base and it works like a cordless kettle.I will probably not buy this product again.FAIL on - Automatic shut-off, boil-dry safety protection, and secure locking lid"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing - Cheap construction","review":"I bought the Chef's Choice for its size and speed at heating water - which the product does do. What I did not expect was the handle to detach from the base of the unit - creating a job for Gorilla glue - which did not work either. So, each time we pick up the unit (as in the picture) the handle separates from the unit creating moments of anticipation - wondering when it will come apart once and for all.This is my second Chef's Choice water boiler, and my last.

Whichever nasty chemicals make up silicone, I'm pretty sure I don't want to drink them.So it's going back to the store. Shame on Chef's Choice for making a shoddy product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a new (and different) kettle after a year","review":"I bought this a year or so ago. Initially happy, and small things like the lid opening up only half way were unusual but not annoying. There is a mesh insert to the nozzle that quickly wore out - not sure what that was all about, but the kettle was still working, so I had little to complain about. Did notice that it would come to a boil and then not shut off for 20 seconds even though the kettle was pouring steam - a bit annoying since it was wasteful on electricity.After a year the quirky lid opening mechanism has failed and the lid stays open all the time. Even if you boil water with the lid open, it will not shut off. To make it shut off you have to weigh the lid down with a dishtowel that covers the spout. When you pour you have to hold the lid closed with your hand or the steam will cause you to burn your hand, and even that maneuver is tricky.Obviously, I don't recommend. I'll be buying another, but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It tastes like poison","review":"Bought this as a Christmas gift.

If you pick up this book, it's hard to put down. That didn't prove to be a challenge for me, as it was about a five hour read. It's written in a sort of television thriller style. The only down side of the book for me is that it's an example of a male author writing women from the way a woman would be if only women were men vantage point.

She is a hunter of stalkers. She insinuates herself into their lives and collects information that will bring them down before they can claim a victim. Abby is bright, extremely competent and amazingly resourceful. Prescott's villian, Raymond Hickle, is believable and well written, as is Hickle's quarry, a beautiful TV news reporter.

Prescott writes well without alot of \\"fluff\\" or tired cliques. I also enjoy his unexpected twists and surprise endings.

Some were a little put off by the repetition and the \\"I'm just one of you\\" tone of the author, but most felt the information was valuable, and, for some, it was brand new. It's one of the few books that speaks to plagiarism in terms of the value of honesty instead of the threat of punishment.

The old footage is understandably grainy, but the cheesygraphics and tickertape seizure-inducing text along the bottom, look like something a high school kid would have thought upback in the 80s when computers first became standard in schools. Not only that, it looks like it was made by a high schoolkid, in the 80s, who had also discovered mind-altering substances. I do not recommend this video in any way, shapeor form. If you get it for free, then the price would be right. If you can find someone to pay you to take it off theirhands, that would be even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get everything on the internet","review":"Don't pay for a book on resumes. Google it.

A real tear jerker @ times a must see movie. AWESOME"},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB (except for most of the acting)","review":"Memorial day is well-planned, poignant, and has communal relevance. Further, it would appeal to multiple generations, making it a crowd-pleaser.The problem here is the acting. James and John Cromwell (who I now know to be father and son) are a delight, and James Cromwell delivers (as always). Aside from these two, the only other well-acted part in the film was played by the woman who was Cromwell's wife in the film (the grandmother).The rest of the acting sounded like it was being read, and the relationship between the LT and the SGT in the SGT is completely unbelievable. No war-time medic/nurse/doctor can spend all day trying to pry open the closed clamshell that is her wounded soldier. The fact that she was so pushy (and such a poor actress) really made me struggle through much of the film.A few of the actors and the awesome plot really carried this film. Despite the acting, I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorial Day","review":"I attended a premier of the movie today in Mpls. It is a awesome movie that should be seen by all.

This movie made me proud to be a Minnesotan and also even more grateful to the Military men, women and familes. What a sacrifice the all give to protect us and our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Film!","review":"I have seen the pilot as a family member was involved in the filming. They have been very careful of authenticity -- had current Red Bull senior officers on hand to assure the accuracy of details. Pay attention to the WWII planes and the weapons, both American and German, and the German half-track! If you're not from Minnesota, you may miss the significance in a conversation about \\"The Twinkies\\" and Santana. It's an emotional film, and you will like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not miss this movie","review":"Memorial Day takes you inside the lives and deepest emotions of a family that has served in the military for generations. The quiet power of this movie resonates long after the credits roll. A beautiful film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not a good movie.","review":"Simply not a good movie. I stopped watching after 45 minutes and I was just killing time and it was playing in the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"An important message, but terrible acting","review":"1. It's amazing to me how well meaning and patriotic people can give this movie 5 stars. Where's the intellectual honesty? Isn't there any integrity when reviewing things these days?2. Here's the bottomline: This movie had great potential with his story/ message but the reason most people out there have never heard of this film is because it simply stinks based on the subpar acting; it's really painful to watch, I mean really terrible acting (of course James Cromwell is good as usual... because he's actually a professional actor). Thus, I would highly recommend passing on this movie. If you want to get filled with patriotism, with the various offerings out there, you're going to have to stick to books for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"usmc03","review":"Maybe I didn't give it enough time, but 20 mins into this movie and I was bored.

I just could'nt take any more. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Moving Movie","review":"I did not like this movie, but my wife and son thought it was okay.

Slow-moving, awful acting, and a confusing/wandering storyline result in a one-star rating. The only thing that would have made this film better was cutting it to less than an hour and 15 minutes. The \\"war scenes\\" were basically 10 guys versus 10 guys with computer-animated bombs that would go off with a lot of smoke.My favorite part was when there were a bunch of Middle Eastern guys signing up for ISF, you see this one clearly non-Middle Eastern guy screaming and yelling. Come on, this movie was awful.Whoever gave it five stars is either a family member of somebody in the film or somebody that gets paid based on how many Amazon users watch the video online.Seriously, save yourself nearly two hours and pick something worthwhile. This movie was a glorious waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring...","review":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen, not to mention the battle scenes: cheap budget, poor performances (those kids, awful actors!) and unconvincing special effects. Ah, last but not least: the script is plagued of common places and cliches..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow - boring, subpar.","review":"Any 5 star rating of this film is simply not an honest rating - it is the rating of someone wanting you to see this film - like a poorly made religious film with nothing but 5 star ratings from people with an agenda.The film is slow, boring and subpar on all levels with the exception of the one professional actor whose face is on the cover - no doubt to legitimize this bush league film.If it were anywhere near as good as all the 5 star ratings would indicate - ask yourself - why had you never heard about it? In country wide polls taken when this movie came out it had a rating of about 2.5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorial Day","review":"I have just returned from a Home-Town viewing of \\"Memorial Day\\".

Good movie with some quality lessons on life for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Hallmark type film made a Vietnam Vet cry","review":"My husband, a Vietnam Vet, cried during the movie. He is still silent about those days, but the movie affected him deeply. Memorial Day is not an expensively produced Hollywood flick so don't expect all the bells and whistles of a high budget film. After saying that I still recommended it highly for its ability to draw you in and keep you. It has features that echo a Hallmark type film. You meet and bond with the characters and see the conflict in their lives about generations of wars and at the end you are still thinking about how war affects those you know and love. A great movie made with innovative Minnesota landscapes and a wonderful storyline. Don't miss this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE!!!!!","review":"This movie was amazing. I was lucky enough to see a special viewing of this movie and have a live video chat with our soldiers in Kuwait. My brother is currently there serving our country.

Battle scenes have a real feel of authenticity to them, but they seemed to miss the mark on getting the weapons and firing audio better mixed. It sounded way to low in volume compared to the rest of the movie.I very muchly liked the way they cast John and James Cromwell (the grandson plays the youthful James)..It's also one that makes it ok for a guy to have a tear come up. Well... one tear only... and 1 one eye only. :)If my review seems a bit vague, it is only because part of the joy of this film is the evolution that occurs, and I don't want to spoil that for you.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the budget","review":"I'm a little partial, having grown up about 20 minutes from the filming location and being a Red Bull allum, but it was a really good story. A little slow at times and a few of the peripheral actors were not the best, but good where and when it counted. Amazing they did it for a budget of only 1 million. Definately worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ho hum story, but great photography and weapons","review":"The story was ok, but was a great vehicle for great photography, editing, sound, and, effects. The producers had super participation from the both the state National Guard and WWII re-enactors. So, the military chatter was all real as was weapon handling and tactics. All of this went to making a very visually pleasing event. The audio was very good as well.My only nit was everything in the WWII scenes was pristine. Weapons, uniforms, and, gear, all appeared to have been issued the day before - not the case for units in the field. Still, this DVD is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mutual Funds Explained!","review":"In the large market of mutual funds, there is a good chance that you can choose the wrong fund.

This Dorati performance is the ideal toget the whole idea of this spiritual and sound experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hat, but be careful about sizing","review":"I bought this hat for my seven month old because we live in Arizona and hats are a must here regardless of the season. It is made of knitted cotton jersey so it is pretty light, which is great.One thing one should be careful about is the sizing - make sure you know your child's head circumference before buying, do not rely just on age. My daughter is 7 months old and the 24mo size fits her perfectly with just a little bit of space left to grow. She is in the 90th percentile regarding head circumference if that tells you anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return....did not work properly.","review":"The watch is very attractive, but it did not work properly.

For example, the proofs for geometrical volumes or surface areas are laughable at best,if existent at all.

It breaks down the concepts so that they can be better understood, without simplifying them beyond use. Good for a high school review, and preparation for pre-calculus. The style of the prose is easy going, upbeat and contains even a hint of humor, which makes understanding the sections more enjoyable. It should be noted that a mathematical background, pre-algebra, is assumed, and answers are not given for all questions. Not meant for those interested in reviewing pre-calc or calculus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From This Book!!!!!!","review":"This book is HORRIBLE! Almost 70% of the answers provided in the back of each chapter for checking your work are wrong. I have even checked the book's wrong answers through an independent tutor who confirmed that the book's answers were wrong in almost all instances.

The two Powerpoint keys imitate the page-up and page-down functionss on your keyboard and this is fine for many uses. However, presenter mode in Powerpoint uses the right and left arrows. This makes the device completely useless in presenter mode, something I am unable to do without because of the uses that typically precede my own presentation. This makes the device, which is wonderfully built and designed, useless for me at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work - Had to Return!","review":"I ordered this item and put a rush on the delivery because I needed it for an upcoming presentation that I was giving. Thankfully I tested it out before hand - this is a peripheral that should be plug and play and it flat out did not work. It was defective and I had to go through the hassle of returning. I should have just gone to the store 5 minutes down the road to purchase a similar device that actually worked - which is what I ended up doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Presentation Remote","review":"Works great!

Based on that I bought one for myself and it worked the same way right out of the box. Really well thought out feature of storage for the plug in unit. Simple controls that work well each time and the black out feature is handy also. The pointer works fine and is visible in regular light situations. Really no more to say other than it works perfectly,has all the features and is well priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"I use this in my classroom and it is so easy!

Great for PowerPoint, I havent tried it for any other programs.I would definitely recommend this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pointer","review":"We purchased several of these for faculty in our department. Our school has computers and projectors in the corner of classrooms. Not very convenient to give lectures if you want to connect with the students or move around the room. These units work great. I haven't compared them to a whole bunch of other models, just found this one and it works great for a fairly reasonable price. It is simple enough that any guest speaker or student can use it without any issues. The laser pointer is a great plus and projects a bright enough dot to be visible in large rooms. I also take the presenter on trips to use with a laptop. It never fails. If you are looking for one of these units, give this one a serious look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works flawlessly","review":"I needed a device that would let me advance my PowerPoint presentation as I roamed a workshop, speaking. This one from Kensington works flawlessly on my MacBook. It has a nice, ergonomic grip. And the USB antenna tucks neatly into the handle of the wand. Its only minor drawback? I didn't award 5 stars because the laser pointer projects a tiny dot, not a big dot; it's a bit hard to detect. Not really a complaint: I hardly ever use the laser pointer and didn't buy the device for that feature. I'm traveling and speaking several times a month and now rely on this wireless presenter as essential equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Accessory for Power Point Presentations","review":"The unique shape of this wireless \\"remote\\" slide changer for your presentations will give you such confidence that you will never doubt which button moves your slides forward or backward even in a totally darkened room.

It has less than half the range of the Satechi and lacks several features I use. The Satechi has a button for blanking the screen and a separate button for changing the presentation mode as well as a switch which lets you use it as a remote mouse. The Kensington advanced slides eratically when 25 feet from the computer and failed completely at 35 feet. The range was unsatisfactory in our auditorium. The Satechi SP-400 operates fine from 75 feet away. I returned the Kensington and bought another Satechi SP-400. The Satechi is well worth the extra $5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Remote!","review":"I am a high school science teacher and bought this particular remote to replace a more economical but far inferior product from TARGUS. I've used it almost daily for an entire school year to present Power Point lecture material to my students and it has performed flawlessly. The rubber case provides good grip and is comfortable to hold, the buttons are responsive and durable (unlike the TARGUS) and it interfaces with my computer well. The laser pointer is a great feature which I use often. I also like the way the USB receiver fits into the base of the remote when not in use. It turns the unit off to conserve battery life and also stores the USB device so it's harder to lose. It's a well designed remote that I'd strongly recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its a good tool to have","review":"i like the Kensington wireless presenter, its simple, not very expensive and does its job. The laser also works pretty well, you can use the laser even if you dont plug in the Usb receiver into the computer. The fact the the Usb receiver is also stored inside the remote and acts as a switch, makes you not lose it. Overall, recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice","review":"Works perfectly.

This listing needs to be modified to make that clearer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"The Kensington wireless remote with laser pointer works exactly as advertised. Put the USB receiver into a PC's USB port, give it a few seconds to be recognized (we tested this with Windows XP SP2), fire up a PowerPoint presentation (we use PowerPoint 2003), and the buttons move the presentation forward, backward, or hide it. We had no problem using it from the back of our lunchroom, about 50' to the laptop.Caveat: putting the receiver back in the main unit turns it off, which is good, unless someone wants to use just the laser pointer. The receiver is very small and could get lost easily (even if someone puts it in a pocket, it would be easy to forget). If you pop out the receiver slightly but leave it in the unit, the laser is on but the receiver won't get lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kensington 33374... Don't waste your money!","review":"The Kensington 33374 looks very high-tech and is easily installed but lacks in some very important areas. First off, I present to large groups of people and do not like to stand in one spot when I present. The Kensington will not change the slides on the laptop if you are more than 20 feet away or if there is obstructions between myself and the USB plug in. The pointer also projects a very small red dot, which is almost impossible to see from further distances. I recommend the PowerPresenter from StreetSmart. It is a little bit more expensive but has been worth every penny. The slides will change every time whether I am 10 feet away or 110 feet away."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding work - technically informing and accurate","review":"This was the first time I had read John Weisman's work and I would recommend \\"Jack in the Box\\" to anyone who wants a three dimensional chess match to solve. The characters are very well developed and have their flaws,but without the \\"super-human\\" characteristics of some other kinds of espionage novels. I would place this book alongside \\"The Spy Who Came In From The Cold\\", only for its informative and highly interesting look at the tradecraft used in the world of spies.

The CIA has been taken over by the new type of non-risk takers, The Romanoff's. Sam Waterman,age 49, has been put out to pasture because he was a member of the old-style action oriented agency. The reader is taken thru some very interesting twists and turns as Waterman who was brought back in for a mission,looks for a highly placed mole in our government. The plot moves along realistically which is a pleasure since many action books these days seem to go over the top.One disconcerting thing though is that parts of some pages are blacked out as though having been censored. This is unnecessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Spy Book I've Read In Years","review":"Jack in the Box is one of the most enjoyable espionage thrillers I've read in years -- I read the book in a single sitting.

This is one of those songs that catch you off guard because the lyrics are way out there. Mokenstef is one of the many groups during the time were record labels tried to push so many R&B groups into mainstream.

It seems that Caprice can do it all: sing, model, act.Once Around The Sun is an absolutely beautiful song. Sad, yet still beautiful thanks to Caprice's vocals. I instantly fell in love with it. For people who say that Caprice cannot sing, they are just being mean. Caprice has a wonderful voice to match her beautiful body. Another song of hers, Oh Yeah, is also fun to listen to.

On initial inspection it appears to be great; it's visually attractive, easy to read, and the keys feel good. Unfortunately, it didn't take too long for me to realize that, at least in RPN mode, the calculator consistently misses keystrokes. Keying in 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 rarely gives the correct answer (45). Additionally, I found that the tan function gives slightly incorrect answers at values very close to 90 degrees. Try taking the tan of 90.0000001 and comparing the result you get to what your computer tells you. The tan error is a minor issue for me, but the missed keystrokes makes this calculator unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"scientific calculator","review":"This is a good product.

The HP calculator's of my youth felt solid, hefty.3) The 2 lines of display is just confusing. Who's idea was that??4) Where's the slipcase? The zippered pouch blows.5) Algebraic mode? You have to be kidding! This was probably dreamed up by the guy who suggested the 2 line display.Although I occasionally use the 35s, my main calculator continues to be the 32sII.

In a lot of ways, it does just fine. I really like having the ENTER key where it has been on previous HP calculators. The layout of the functions seems to make good sense. My only complaint is the lack of multi-letter alpha-numeric input. This limits your input and output prompts to one-letter labels. This is a step back from what the good HP calculators used to have - too bad.But it's good, small, light, not too expensive.

After looking around for a calculator that had the same features and keyboard layout as the old trusty HP 41CV, I decided to purchase the HP35s. After a couple of weeks of use, I can say that HP has a calculator that operates almost exactly like the older version that I used for so long. The keyboard feel and the reverse polish notation (RPN) logic are what I am accustomed to with my old calculator. The only drawback is that the keypad buttons on the HP35s are not in the same location as on my old calculator, so it will take a little getting used to before I am proficient in using the new device. But if it lasts as long as my first and only HP product, then I'm sure that I figure out the slight changes and will be a pleased HP customer for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated HP's customer","review":"This is the 3rd HP calculator I bought (the other 2 were the hp 33s).

They finally moved the \\"ENTER\\" key back to where it is supposed to be. Minor quibbles.First quibble: I don't know if its me, but occasionally it will miss a key press when I'm inputting stuff and when I'm going fast and get to the end of a rather complex set of operations, it is annoying to realize that it recorded 12.35 instead of 102.35 several steps ago.Second quibble: Its not the 90s anymore, HP really could have made the stack bigger than 4 numbers. My HP 48G's nearly infinite stack really spoiled me. Unfortunately, you can't get a 48/49/50 with a decent keyboard layout anymore, and key placement is more important to me than stack size. Only have a stack of 4 is a little annoying, but not the end of the world.Final quibble: Watch batteries? Really? HP couldn't make it use AAA batteries?

It features all the normal scientific functions one would expect. The only down side with this calculator is the available unit conversions are more limited than the HP48.I don't use the programming features at all, as I prefer to use the computer for anything complex. One of the higher end HPs with a large graphics screen would be better for any serious programming.Overall I'm quite pleased with this unit, and feel it's a very good value.

The display does not show the function key you pressed unlike the HP-32s I own. Better yet the HP-41 showed the function and if you made a mistake in hitting the wrong function key, you simply held the key down for 2 seconds the function was nulled.UPDATE: Day 2.

It's called RPN, it means Reverse Polish Notaion, and it's amazing once you learn how it works. Enter the first number, hit enter. Enter the second number, then press what function you would like to preform between the two numbers. If you want 4/5: 4 - ENTER - 5 - DIVIDE - .8.

The HP-35s seemed to fit the bill reasonably well enough and it had two display lines instead of just one. However, the keyboard is of very poor quality and it cannot keep up with my typing speed, frequently resulting in incorrect calculations. I get frustrated every single time I use the calculator as a result. In addition, the keyboard layout is extremely poor and a huge step back from the HP-15C. Common functions often require more key stokes than the 15C and the keys or not placed in intuitive/optimal positions.Argh!!!!

I like the features of the hp35s, especially the statistics functions. Great value for the price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!!!","review":"It is a shame that HP has released such a ergonomically poor design, although the calculator has the look and feel of the older classic calculators; that is about the only thing you get for your money. The functionality of this calculator can be described as confusing and very poorly thought out, it is hard to believe that HP has released this model with its present flaws. As an example; simple things like numerical base conversions which should be a straight forward function using a few key strokes, will leave you wondering. However, when you try such conversion in this calculator it will leave you scratching your head for an answer and don't bother looking for the answer in the user's manual, because the so called \\"user's manual\\" has very little information about anything and it is pretty much useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap imitaion of a classic","review":"A classic maligned, this. This is NOT the HP-35s Scientific Calculator, much beloved since its debut in 1972: this is a cheap imitation, made in China. The minus key on mine is defective: I have to press it twice to register a minus. It's so cheap, though, it probably isn't worth the bother of replacing it. I wouldn't mind spending $400 for a good calculator, like the HP-35s in 1972. It's -so- sad that HP has come to this. I'd give it one star for being such a piece of junk, except the basic idea was wonderful, so it gets two. Still, this does not cut it. As I've told more than one undergraduate: a good idea shoddily done doesn't impress anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP RPN Still Got It","review":"Worth the money... any engineer born before 1960 can appreciate the true versatility and quality of an HP calculator and even tolerate a TI. Good quality, works effortlessly and in the backwards world of a mechanical engineer! The keystroke is not of the predecessor feel, the lettering is a speck size smaller and you had better spend time learning where the keys are due to the amount of labels on the keypad. But it might be my eyesight more than the keys! If you are in the mood for a reverse pol notation calculator, this is the one... and only. Buy it; no complaints here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"For someone who's an old HP user from the 70s, this is a good machine.

Excellent quality and price.","review":"Let me start with WOW. Considering that the last couple of calculators that HP has produced left much to be desired in quality and performance. This little calculator harkens back to the days when HP was tops in quality and performance when it came to Programmable Scientific Calculators. The keyboard is much closer to the HP 41C in feel and performance. The layout of the keys and the look of the calculator has gone back to a more traditional looking HP calculator. It is a full featured Scientific Programmable and the price point is outstanding.Way to go HP ! Finally, you guys seem to be moving in the right direction in the calculator division."},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistically, it's the best RPN calculator you are going to buy.","review":"Let's be real; most people are not going to spend $200+ on a used calculator from the 80's. I think everyone is in agreement, HP does not make the same quality calculators that they used to. I love RPN calculators, but I am definitely not going to spend that kind of money on a used one. So you are left with the option to buy a new one, and this is a perfectly good calculator. It does have it's issues, like many of the other reviews have pointed out. But you learn to live with them, and life goes on. I have the HP 33s, and this is a better calculator. I find the display easier to read, I like the buttons better, and the general feel of it better. Like others have said, it does not come with the clamshell case, which would have been nice. It's simply a slip-on case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but still not good as the old ones","review":"This is probably the best scientific calculator avaliable new today. But it is not as good as the older HP calculators, such as for example, HP-42s. It is of course much better than 33S, but is still missing matrix algebra an a better way to work with complex numbers. In 42s, for example, to take the square root of -1 is just type 1 +/- and sqrt key. I also prefer the old system of alpha, i.e., ABCDE, FGHI, etc, menus. 42s worked even with complex matrices and 35S does not work even with simple matrices. The only thing better than 42s is the batteries and the equation editor. And I wished it was smaller. Also missing a decent printed manual. Algebraic model sucks. I don't want to make \\"sin(30)\\" by doing \\"sin 30 =\\" even in algebraic mode. I had one, and gave it together with my 33S as part of the payment of my present day 42S, but despite of all, I will buy another soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Calculator!","review":"The HP 35s is everything that we were wishing for over the last 10 year calculator drought: quality display, quality buttons, programability and RPN."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP Power","review":"I had an HP for over 20 years and loved the RPN. No problem there, but the calculator buttons began to get less dependable. Replacing it with a newer HP was the right answer. Lots more power here than I will ever use, even though I'm an engineer. The instruction manual is on a CD - finally got beyond the situation where the instruction manual was bigger than the calculator. I love it. Very easy to read, very well spaced keyboard. Clear labeling. Good Luck"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless for a professional","review":"I got this because I'm going back to school and it's one of the few calulators you are allowed to use for the Surveying exam. As soon as I pass that exam it's off to the thrift store because it's a complete piece of garbage. It only has 10 built in unit conversions, so say for example you need to convert Miles to meters you will have to convert your miles to inches manually then use the calulator to convert to cm then you have to conver the centemeters to meters manually. Complete waste of time, I could build spread sheets to do the math faster than doing things using this calculator.Hopefully HP will start re-building the old 48's one day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buttons are improved","review":"The calculator is vastly improved over the 33S. However, the polar to rectangular coordinate conversion is different from all the other HP calcs and required a rewrite of the surveying programs that we use.

I purchased the HP-35s because my HP-48GX in not allowed for the Professional Engineering exam. Initially it was a step back from my more powerful machine, however, I actually prefer the 35s now. It has all necessary features for my daily aerospace work and it is sleek, intuitive, and compact. I have it fully programmed with custom algorithms for my work and I am happy with my purchase.My only complaint is the predefined variable / program names. I would much prefer the ability to assign multiple characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best HP calculator in years... don't settle for TI","review":"This purchase was as much for nostalgia as it was for function. I'm an engineer from way back and still remember when the original HP35 and HP45 were in their heyday back in the 70's. I myself started with an HP25C and once I experienced RPN, I never looked back. My last HP was a HP15C, part of the last well designed and esthetically pleasing series before they started looking and feeling like TI calculators (cheap). It was disheartening to learn later that HP discontinued the 15C when Carly Fiorina became CEO of HP (one of the many reasons she did not get my vote for California governor). I purchased this for my great niece for Christmas since she is starting high school this fall (I also gave her mom her first calculator when she was in high school... HP of course). The new HP35s is a step back in the right direction... hoping they resurrect the HP15C (I would buy 2)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it but wish it handled imaginary numbers better","review":"I mostly like the calculator.

I have missed the RPN calculators the last few years, having used them for almost 40 years. This was like greeting an old friend. Thank you Hewlett-Packard.

It has some tactile feedback on the keys, but much less than the older HP calculators. It also has wider spaced keys that enables my larger finger tips to navigate without accidently striking an adjacent key. It also supports my favorite RPN operation sequence. I would have given this a 5 rating except for the display. It is very dim and lacks significant contrast in almost anything other than brightly lit areas.

This book doesn't really make sense with a lot of mumbo jumbo and not as interesting as the previous ones. I just lost interested after reading a hundred pages, but forced myself to finish it as quick as I can. It would be nice if Mr. Wilson put more variety in his novels without using Pine Barrens in each story, for ex. Also, writing about supernatural in this Repairman Jack novel, please.

I hope the next novels will be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the old Jack?","review":"\\"Conspiracies\\" was a hollow read and a lame sequel to \\"The Tomb\\". I loved \\"The Tomb\\", read it 2 or 3 times since 1986. However, in \\"Conspiracies\\", too much time was spent on developing (or rather underdeveloping) characters that lacked any dimension, and in presenting too many dead-end subplots.I felt it lacked the tension, excitement, and action from \\"The Tomb\\". And I didn't like the tease of a \\"grand conspiracy theory\\" that left me with more questions than answers. The ultimate revelation was disappointing.I hope the next (final?) Repairman Jack novel will revive the character developed in the first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legacies Was Better","review":"While I love 'repairman jack', Conspiracies was too over the edge with supernatural mumbo jumbo.

However, this is a good book and I actually enjoyed the variety of conspiracy theories that are put forth.There are parts where it seems a little disjointed and I will agree with another reviewer that the SESOUP Sunday schedule being placed on the last page is a bit odd and could be an editorial error. However, I consider that a minor issue.Bottom line, if you enjoy books that are a little far-out, you should enjoy this one. I can definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Repairman Jack book!","review":"Without getting too much into the story, Jack spends a majority of this book with a group of conspiracy theorists (aliens, CIA, New World Order, etc.) looking for a missing woman. Hence the title. Turns out there's something else at play that makes these conspiracies childs play.This is another great Repairman Jack book! I loved The Tomb and Legacies. Repairman Jack is such a unique character. Totally \\"off the grid\\" so to speak. I like how he isn't a typical badass (he's not 6'4\\", ex-military, etc.). He's basically an urban mercenary, he \\"fixes\\" things. I kind of think of him as Jack Reacher meets Elvis Cole with a supernatural twist.

But what did not impress me was the box that it was shipped in. The box was so many times bigger than the contents which means that it was so loose inside and was banged around during shipping. Also, the box was badly dammaged and the parts for the ab scissor are in bad shape, it's as though they were defective parts put together to sell for a cheeper price. The parts may indeed be brand new but defective. Now to top that all off (which did not supprise me the least bit) when I e-mailed the co., at the first they sent me some replacement parts (which also were shipped the same way as they shipped the first time, in a huge box and in poor condition) but they would never responded to my request to exchange the equipment for another one.

Crowley and John Dee alone were two very different people and had two very different approaches to the subject. While I tend to be a purist I can't actually see how this book would help a beginning student grow in the subject matter (unless they are only reading the Schueller's other books) and as for an advanced student it really useless.

I would recommend this book to any developing project manager. (I think that covers all of us!)

But for a child who cannot stay entertained for longer than about 3 minutes it is great! He will sit and color using this for about 10 minutes straight! That is a big time record for him! I guess in a way it's educational because it is showing him 'cause and affect' with colors. He knows now that if he picks up a blue crayon and makes a mark on the coloring book he understands that the mark will be blue beforehand. Which is something I tried to teach him of course but he never really understood until now.

So when I dropped a few sizes I decided to order this 501. It arrived promptly and well-packaged. Though it was a little roomy - I'm happy to report - it looked the part. Unfortunately it did not \\"feel\\" the part. Compared to my older jeans it was very, very light. After a few weeks one seam broke, actually not the seam, but the fabric next to the seam. After having this was fixed the fabric broke next to one of the back pockets, then next to the fly buttons and yesterday, whilst kneeling down to take a photograph, the entire back ripped. After reading the other reviews pertaining to these jeans it would seem many were right in stating the jeans fabric used by Levis nowadays is of an inferior quality. So, after nearly 20 years of buying 501's I can safely say I'll never buy one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happen to 501 Quality Control","review":"What the happen to levi's quality control.

That's about it. I'm happy with my purchase. But! I usually buy 505's, but with the great variables in sizing I wont buy that style without trying them on first. Consistency is lost more or less, except with the 501's. The 501 style at least is going to fit the same way each time,no matter if they are made in Egypt or Mexico, Brazil or wherever they originate from. I always bought my jeans at Sears, but when you buy Levi 501's and see Egypt on the tags, well there's outsourcing and then there is outsourcing. Unbelievable, but get used to it. Its here to stay.

The waist is WAAAAY too narrow for these pants to be the size they claim. Don't bother buying these, you'll just be joining the club of insane people who bought clothing over the internet.*If this review shows up multiple times it's because amazon claimed there was an issue and prompted me to resubmit it.

It's possible that the other ones just shrank more than these, but I've washed these in HOT water 2 or 3 times. They're not getting any smaller.Aside from that, they are lightweight, comfortable, button-fly, and fade into a greyish charcoal-y look that I really like. When I sit they kind of push into my stomach uncomfortably unless I pull them up before sitting, and that's kind of annoying, but I don't know if that has more to do with my body shape or the way they are cut.

I would much rather have paid a higher price and have them left things the way they were, but I guess they would not get the volume of sales to support such a concept.

I buy many different colors for my various activites. Currently I have over 10 pairs that have never been worn because there is no quality control at Levi Strauss. Living out in the country it is too difficult and costs too much to send the items back in to Amazon. The 501's I have were made in Egypt, Mexico, Haiti and other various places. The labels all match in size however some of the jeans are at least a full size smaller at the waist and some of the pairs have the correct waist but very narrow legs.

The original rivets are gone, their \\"denim\\" fabric is the worst quality; all seams fray, especially cuffs; belt loops fall apart; and the only appearance achieved is shabby tissue.

When I opened the additional online information today, \\"shrink to fit\\" appeared. The most important information appeared only after an additional click. These are two major management mistakes at your Levis store! And after the first cold washing with a special product for black clothes, the color started to disappear... The Jeans were a christmas present for somebody in Germany, so there are in Germany right now, otherwise I would have returned them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Shrink to fit","review":"They claim these are shrink to fit and they are not.I am not happy.

The front pockets sagged, the color was odd and my wife commented that she could get in there with me (not a bad thing). I have 3 other pair of 501's in the house that are the same size I ordered. These are pretty big. The other issue is they have redesigned the change pocket and made it lots bigger. So big it is nearly useless because it tucks under your belt if you wear a wide one.Now the comment about going to Penny's. The last pair I bought there (501's are the only thing I buy there) seemed to be heavier material. Washed 501's seem to have a lot of size variance, so trying them on is good. Second, the darker material blue ones fade more normally in the wash. These medium stone washed have the weird color that is popular on jeans worn by 20 somethings. Almost looks dirty.I've worn these things for 40 years. I'll keep on wearing them but I'm not happy.These went back though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Style...","review":"I'm very happy that I receieved my order within 4 days, the size is right but unfortunately I order Levi's Original fit but I received Levi's Straight fit same size and same color.

I have 5 pairs of these new 501's all less than two years old. Every one has split in the crotch area after about 6-8 months. I used to get 4-5 years out of a pair and usually they only wore through in the knees. As other reviewers have stated, they seem cut shorter in the waist so that I have to pull them up every time I stand up. Also, the denim seems of much lighter weight material to which I attribute the splitting in the crotch area. 501's used to be made in the USA with very heavy weight denim but these are sewn in Honduras and feel like cheap copies of real Levis. Used to love the fit and wear of 501's but guess I am going to have to try and find a new brand of jeans. Makes me sad as these used to be a great American-made product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Size Doesn't Match the Label","review":"The pants look nice but the fabric is super rough...think really heavy canvas material. And the size was totally wrong. The 32 x 32's I ordered had a 28\\" waist when buttoned up and a 35\\" inseam measuring from the crotch to the bottom of the leg. If this is the quality Levi's is now putting out I predict they will be gone in a year or two.

They were made in the U.S.A. They are made better, fit better and of higher quality. The one's that I have boughten that were made outside the U.S.A., are like stretch pant's. After I've had them on for a couple hours, the waist is an inch or more larger than when I put them on, as well as the rest of the levi's. I love my 501's, so am know wearing my old one's instead of my new one's because they fit so much better. The old one's are at least 15 years old, most are older than that. The other thing is they move their manufactoring out of the U.S.A., so they are less expensive to make, but the price has never gone down!!!

In this collected volume, DD tangles with Turk, Sewer King, the Kingpin, and the deranged assassin Bullseye; culminating in the classic battle between Bullseye and Elektra which left her dead. Miller's cinematic style artwork and superb storytelling perfectly control the pace of the story, something that is nearly impossible to do in comics. However, while this is an essential book and all, the dialogue can be a bit cheesy and grating at times, but if you can look past that, you'll find one of the greatest stories ever to be written in comic history. If you're new to Daredevil and like this, pick up Miller's Born Again which manages to be even better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Miller stories","review":"This book is good but a little overrated. This holds 15 issues from the early 80s, it also features the first appearance of Elektra. Many great stories are in this book, but unfortunatley there are just as many bad issues as there are good. With issues featuring Bullseye, Hand, and Kingpin you'd expect better. But the good issues are near the peak of Miller's writing and art abilities.I do recomend this to comic book fans but I prefer vol. 1."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I've read all the praise and reviews for this classic Frank Miller run on Daredevil. I tried hard to like it but in the end I was highly dissapointed. These stories have aged badly (unlike the first three Spider-Man essentials which DESERVE to be a '60s pop culture entity). I'm a fan of Miller's Batman: Year One and I'm a fan of Loeb's Daredevil: Yellow. Too bad this failed to strike the charisma that does two graphics conveyed. If you're new to the medium, grab those two but approach Daredevil Visionaries 2 with an unbiased caution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and dusty","review":"If you are a Frank Miller fan who came into his comics after Ronin and Dark Knight Returns don't expect this to be the same. What you see here is a pulp comic in true formula style. It hints at what Miller was to become but it never shows us. This is important. The comic itself is entertaining in the same way that any comic is. But the art is dull (slightly more black than the comics of the time), the color is poorly done and the scripts are banal. This is only slightly better than you're average comic. Nothing truly risky. No surpirse though considering that Frank was just a kid with no respect at the time. If you don't own Sin City or 300 or the new Dark Knight, then get those first. This is for hard core Frank Miller fans who want to see his roots, not for someone who expects the standard that he set with his later comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, But make sure you know what you are buying!","review":"There is a slight problem with the way the Daredevil Visionaries Series is described on Amazon.

My 2 1/2 and 4 year old love it. They play rescue adventures and I love the imaginative play that comes with this house. The only problem I have is that it's not very durable. It's wobbles on it's \\"stilts\\" that attach it to the base and the top floor (the part that folds out) falls off all the time. I probably have to put it on 5 times everytime they play with it. I really don't think they are being too rough - they just lean on the floor while they are playing with it and it pops off. I'm afraid it will eventually break - it's held on with only 2 tabs - and with the constant popping off I'm sure one or both of the tabs will eventually give.Overall, I think it's a fun toy with lots of replay value.

I will warn you to watch out for the helicopter as it does come zooming around rather fast and if you have your head in the way it does hurt!

It was played with for a bit - and then, boys being boys, they really played with it. And it kept falling apart. Pretty soon we were on a constant, \\"Fix this!\\" rotation. It got bad, we just put the cabin on the floor, instead of the stilts. This ruined the look, of course, so we put it back together - and even then, the playability factor just slowly went down hill.We were disappointed with the overall toy. The Diego piece, the animals and the vehicles were very much fun - and they lasted much longer than the Rescue Center. We should have just bought the accessory sets, instead. Because that's all we played with: vehicle and diego pieces.Might be a good toy for a gentle play-er, but we don't have any of those here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun","review":"My son, 2 3/4 years, loves this toy.

The only issue I've had with the quality of the toy is that the flap on the back that gives extra room in the treehouse comes off easily and cannot be put back by my son. Overall...this is a great toy. Take note that the backpack and zip line have changed since these pictures. The zip line is now a straight stiff line and the backpack snaps on to be easier than the loops."},{"rating":"2","title":"More happy kids down at this end...","review":"I'm with Jules.

You certainly have to be careful when carrying it around, but we've had no problems with it whatsoever; no part of the toy has fallen apart, and there have been no calls for help as of yet.

My only complaint is that the older model that I have did not have a headphone monitor. This has been remedied I hear in recent models.This unit is great for this price point.

I love historical novels and have found the journey form the Mayflower to the 1940s one I'm sad to see coming to an end. I have loved each book and have appreciated everything I have learned and all the research Gilbert Morris has put into his writing. It's really too bad this series is out of print now ... it contains so much formative American history it should be available for future readers to enjoy! There are forty books in the series and I guess my only complaint would be the repeat of a several scenes that pop up in quite a few books, and there are a few sayings that the author must have favored, because they show up in probably the first twenty books(and also in other series he's written!). Other than that, if you want a sweeping view of history and romance, then do not miss out on The House of Winslow.

However, they do a poor job of imitating the novelization that Goldratt engagingly offered in \\"The Goal\\".The authors have constructed a plot that provides an adequate expositional framework, but the main character's facile, unexplored results may not prove persuasive to the uninitiated. Coupled with abrupt story transitions, uneven pacing and sloppy editing (missing verbs, oddly-constructed quotes), the result demonstrates that authors can understand their subject without having the tools to explain it well.Get \\"The Cash Machine\\" for the useful information it contains, but don't expect \\"The Goal\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too analytical/scholarly and misses the point","review":"My main problem with this book is that Clark is too analytical. The book reads like a thesis. She often \\"intellectulizes\\" her way too a point that is either obvious or that she could have gotten to in a lot less time and with more straight forward language. Don't get me wrong - she does have some insights into Nietzsche but they are few and far between. I actually thought that her chapter on the Eternal Recurrence was the best in the whole book.

From the arcade scene, it moved to the PS1 and helped sell lots of systems. Then, Namco made a huge announcement: an enhanced version of Ridge Racer was released on the N64 in 1998. It had all of the tracks from the PS1 title, all the cars and stages plus 4 all-new tracks and up to 4 players can race each other at the same time.The graphics are sharp and colorful. The frame rate does not drop at all and the music is vintage Ridge Racer all the way. The controls are easy to get into. The game gets harder as you progress through the single player mode, unlocking cars and stages but it's fun at the same time.

Gooch is a fine player but he doesn't measure up to the original and his attempts at copying Lee on the guitar sound lame; plus his vocals are weak.

I have the albums the two songs here are from, and these are two of the weakest songs on each album. So, while I love hearing great new music, I'm wondering how good of a sampling I'm really getting from the other artists also.

Buy a good game with your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyable","review":"We had rented the original Mario party (it didn't really impress us that much) so when it came down to buy one we went with the \\"2\\" because it stated it had more mini-games. My daughter and I really enjoy playing this game. My whole family will play and have my 3 year old a computer guy. The game does take a long time to play (atleast an hour) but for family game night it is really fun. We can't wait to get Mario Party 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mario Party-Master of the Mini Games","review":"Mario Party 2, after Mario Party, is a really fun game. If you liked the first mario party, you'll like this. It took the best mini games out of the last mario party, and made them better. they even added a lot more. I really enjoy this game. It can have up to four players. it has all the good games, like bumper balls, crane game, bowl over, and much more. I think if you like board games and small mini games you will enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still great, but could be better.","review":"After playing the first one I was excited about this one. It's fun to play and has a more inhanced flavor than the original. The only thing I don't like about it, is that when you play the big game(versus the mini games)you can only choose to play for 20,30 or 35 turns. Every time I play it I set it at 20 turns, and trust me it takes forever. I can't even play the whole game. I think it would be better if you could set the turns for 10 or at least 15. After awhile you just want the game to end. Of course it would still be worth buying if you like Mario Party. Don't get me wrong, it's still fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!!!!!!","review":"This game is really fun... I think it is the best out of the whole series. This game is better when you have people to play with you. Its also good when you play alone but you don't get that same vibe that you would get when you actually have a challenge on your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd parts are not always better","review":"Is difficult not to think of the first game mostly cause in the second one there is very little or no challenge also the rewards are not as good as in the first game, although there's some new minigames and the chance of training before the real game. in general 1st one was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Good, but disappointing.","review":"This game was Disappointing because at the beginning of the game the intro showed \\"Mario Land\\" and then Wario came and crashed the party. Then they started arguing, and suddenly Bowser took over the land. Then the game said the first to defeat Bowser will have that character's name named after the land. For example, if Luigi won, or something, then the World would be called \\"Luigi Land\\"... or so I thought. I made Yoshi win ALL the worlds, and I also made Yoshi defeat Bowser 6 times in compleatly diffrent areas, yet it was still called \\"Mario Land\\". Personnaly, I think the game lied becuase the game said who ever beat Bowser would have his or her name in the land. But it all ways has to be for MARIO. No fame for YOSHI. Yoshi beat Bowser, yet he did not get the fame he deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game Stinks","review":"This game Is not a very good game to buy at all. The games price is high and the graphics STINK> the levels are hard, The single player is awful,and it takes a long time to play. I rented this game and the minute I started playing I wanted to take it back to the movie store. So, if I were you I would stay away from this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"No need to attend this party","review":"I bought this game because of all the hype. Yet,that's all it was. The first game I played was exciting and new. After that it's the same old thing. It is basically an electronic board game with no real excitement. There are four different settings horror, mystery, western and space. You can play 25, 30 or 50 turns. You can also select at any time human or computer players and you have to watch all of their moves. It is repetitive and boring after awhile. I have owned it 2 days and that's enough for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY better than the first one!","review":"I guess Hudson Soft realized how bad Mario Party 1 was, so they actually made Mario Party 2 a good game! The minigames are better, and even though there are a few bugs in the minigames(Shy Guy Says. I liked all the minigames execpt for the Wind-Up shy guy one, it was impossible! But the rest of the game was decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, Long, and Easy","review":"This game is a good party game, but take at least an hour to play. You play a board game, in which is crammed about 50 \\"mini-games\\". Most of these are simple, like pressing A and B at the same time to wind a mecha-something-or-other and tilting the control stick just enough so that your car doesn't spin out. The goal is to get the most stars. Unlike its prequel, there are no more games with spinning the control stick. This game is competitive, but requires too much time. After playing enough games, you'll unlock a one-player mode. Hard mode is too frustrating, especially on one level I can't beat, but normal mode is a good challenge. I recommend this game for people who enjoy competition or playing with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO GLAD I GOT THIS GAME!!!!","review":"I'm kind of a big gamer. But I love the classics. I have the original NES with the original Super Mario Bros which is arguably one of the greatest games of all time. Even today, it's a great game. Now, for this I went a little more modern but it's still a classic. I kept my N64 through all these years, and I used to have the Mario Party games until my mom sold them all. So, I decided I'd get them back and made my first Mario Party purchase for my favorite Mario Party game of the series, MP2. Great game.

There are no \\"norm-references\\" or \\"developmental milestones\\" charts/tables/etc. There is very little substantial information beyond what one might get in a basic abnormal psychology text or a general psych text.The upshot: if using for undergrads, use caution.

I can't stand when people say that she's the best female rapper ever (especially Lil Kim - eek!)...that is a statement which is TOO BOLD to make. None of the tracks on here are any good and the topics of money, sex with numerous men, and jewelry is already played out by No Limit's Master P.

In fact, if the book were madeinto a TV series, it might as well become the \\"Wonder Years\\"of this decade.The language is great, the plot is full of action andsuspense, and the pace is deadly (literally). Nick Twispis the most dangerous teenager in California today. Hisintriguing and brilliant mind produces the ideas and stuntswe all would have loved to do as teenagers.

So I kept on, hoping it would get better. But it never did. It actually got worse.I also found the dialog preposterous. Even though these are supposed to be very gifted and bright kids, the dialog just didn't ring true. And have you EVER, EVER heard a teenage boy refer to his girlfriend as \\"darling\\"? Maybe they do in prep schools, but not in any school I've ever attended.If you like your humor clever or witty (or even crass), stop here. This book is not for you.

Bored, prep school teen turns to \\"willfully disobedient\\" rebel in efforts to free himself from parental bondage and find haven in the small beach town of Ukiah.

I'd actually say he's smarter, funnier, hipper, sexier -- someone I'd like to drive across the states with, just for the hysterical laughs. So, it's worth reading this book for his voice alone so it's definitely recommended.One caveat. There's a lot of repetition here and the plot is not exactly tight.

He does pretty good with other characters, but the voice he uses for Nick really sucks. Also, I found a few word errors, the very first one I found was while Nick was changing in My Green Haven to go to the last dinner with Sheeni- the word Payne uses is \\"Transient\\" but Garcia uses \\"Transparent\\" I don't know if that bothers anyone else...I still listen to it, because its YIR.

Every new day was like a new episode in a cliffhanger soap opera. It clearly shows the capability of how much influence and manipulation teenagers really have over adults. What a 'fun-filled' piece of work. I started this book on July 4th, 2001 and made it last until I finished it in London at midnite on August 16, 2001. I strongly recommend this well-written book that reminds us that LIFE IS TRULY FULL OF SURPRISES."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, very interesting","review":"Well, I'd just like to say, the first few pages will really piss you off. I mean, there's no way a 14 year old could write like that. But after you read it for a while, you'll be hooked to it. I mean, at times I was staying up to 2-3 in the morning just reading it. For some reason, although i couldnt tell why, I just had to know what happened next. So besides that tiny complaint about the language, the only other thing i found wrong with the book is it's totaly unbelievable. I mean some of these events are so unlikely that its almost funny. The book itself is alos pretty funny, but i found taht wasn't its strong point. Also, there is LOTS of sex related activities in the book. For some thats a good thing, but its bad for others. So all in all, It wastruly a very good book to read. It just made you want to keep reading and reading. So if you want an entertaining book, then definately get this book. It's strange, but very good"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book you'll ever read","review":"This is by far the best book I have ever read. I myself am a 14 year old teen.

It's impossible to care about the pretentious characters, and horrific child abuse and rape are played for laughs. Which I guess would be worse if I cared about the characters.

I read nearly the whole book (the last 400 pages) in little under one day, as I was unexplicably drawn to the tension C.D. Payne had created. Not only was the book entertaining, but it conveyed the mind of a remarkably adept and gifted 14 year old boy, which is, for the most part, one of the more complex mysteries known to man. For the ability to return to that state of mind in such an array of intelligent humor, I give this novel a perfect 10"},{"rating":"1","title":"Redundant and tedious at nearly 500(!) pages","review":"This book is like the Jerry Springer show--it's kind of funny at first while also being a little sad (never has an author so thoroughly but inaccurately conveyed a lower middle class, \\"white trash\\" existence. yeah, I know it's parody, but stil...) and the joke gets old really quickly. As a 250 page book, I'd give it 4 stars. As it stands now at nearly 500 pages, it's way below average."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book is a fast, easy read. Nothing more. For this to receive five stars is ridiculous. It's a sometimes entertaining, readable book, yes. But, by no means, is it great. I mean, everyone praises the book's humor. \\"I laughed out loud,\\" everyone says. Well, I didn't. The book tries too hard to be funny, to be shocking, and, to me, the humor just seemed too easy, aimed for junior high kids. Sure, at points, Nick Twisp is amusing, but he's hardly some great literary character. Don't believe the praise. The book just isn't that good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wildly unusual, funny, irreverent, and great!","review":"If you have a wild sense of humor, were ever a teenager, and love well-crafted writing that takes you to places and into lives that you have never imagined this book will become one of your favorites.

I was really looking forward to seeing this film and the storyline about him seeking to find and get to know his biological father, who turned out to be wonderful. It was his mother that was the cause of keeping his father away all those years - an interesting twist. I liked Adrian's honesty throughout the film however in a few parts his directorship lacked integrity. The film pulled the viewers leg with a fake scene as a joke at a critical part in the film. It was totally inappropriate and in really poor taste. Those types of \\"joke\\" scenes have no place in the actual film but rather in the bleepers or outtakes section of the DVD. I like Adrian and I hope his films are refined in the future for mass success."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE","review":"I saw this film twice on HBO and I even wrote to HBO in hopes of Adrian Grenier reading my little note on how much I loved his film. This film is unique, emotional, funny, realistic and, most importantly, human. As young as Adrian was when he made this film, I think he was 23, he proves to be a gifted director already. I personally enjoy documentaries and this one is certainly a favorite. I highly recommend this film and am now looking forward to watching his latest venture Teenage Paparazzo. Please watch this film! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but NOT SAFE","review":"My two year old has been in love with this toy since day one (it's now 4 months later). However, she was holding it today when HER HAIR GOT CAUGHT IN THE GEAR ON HIS FOOT. To my surprise, the toy didn't even shut off as her hair was being wound around the wheels! The toy also wound around a friend's Halloween costume as she was holding it back in October. I thought (foolishly) that I would give it another chance since the costume was organza. Pablo's now in the garbage and my daughter lost about three inches of hair in one spot. VERY UNHAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"My one year old son loves the Backyardigans and we were excited to get this doll for him. I didn't realize when we bought it, but Pablo only sings/plays the main theme song from the Backyardigans, nothing else, which gets old very fast. With all the music in the shows, they could have added at least one other song.Also, Pablo cannot spin/roll on carpeting, and he requires a large-ish area to do his whole dance. The only rooms we have bare floors in are our kitchen and bathroom, and Pablo constantly bumped into things and stopped.We returned this Pablo and got the one with a firefly where he sings a lullaby, and my son loves that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it were also plush","review":"My 20 month old son loves this toy. Not only does he dance and sing with Pablo, but he loves to hug and squeeze him. Unfortunately, Pablo is all hardware inside with no cushioning, so there's not much to hug. But my son loves him all the same. We had to return the first one because it kept jamming instead of spinning and it would randomly cut off. The second one, after new batteries, has been great. As other reviews say, he sings only the theme song and needs a bare floor with lots of free space."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy breaks easily","review":"This is the second time I tried to post a review. Don't know if amazon is censoring reviews.Bought this toy through wizard. Got it on time. When I opened the box and tested the toy it worked great. But when I brought it home that night to show to my daughter (she's 8 months), the toy would spin and walk. It would sing fine, but when Pablo tried to move, his gears would make this grinding noise. I couldn't believe it! Other users have pointed out that cheap glue was used in the manufacturing. When that glue ran out, it wouldn't allow the gears to spin. I should've gotten an RMA, but we still like the songs.Don't buy this cheap product. Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not very durable","review":"My grandson received this toy for his first birthday. It worked fine for about an hour. It still sings and spins but makes an obnoxious gringding sound. There's no way to get to the inner workings to see if it's a gear that can be fixed. We will replace it because he adores Pablo but I'm guessing the replacement will have the same problem.Other than the horrible grinding sound the toy is quite appealing. My grandson carries it around with him all the time, he wants to sleep with it, and gives it lots of hugs and kisses. Too bad the mechanical engineering wasn't up to par on this toy. Also, as others have mentioned-it is not a soft toy. It is made of hard plastic with plush fabric over it sans padding. We'll look for a soft plush Pablo for sleeping with."},{"rating":"2","title":"cute and interactive","review":"Oh my, did my grandbabies and grand nieces and nephews enjoy Pablo.

Mr. Silbey is highly respected, but this book was a rush job. There are several editorial mistakes that also make the book annoying. I expected a detailed discussion about the annexation debate.
